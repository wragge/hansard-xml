                    <para class="block">Its object is to prevent the insertion of clauses that are irrelevant to the&#39; title which is on the draft Bill. Our proposed standing order is more restrictive than that one. There is no reason why we should restrict the opportunities which honorable senators may have so long as they keep the provisions of their Bills within the titles given by the orders of leave&#39;. We are introducing into our standing orders something which has&#39; no relation to the titles of Bills. Our present rule says that when a. Bill is introduced it shall contain no clause which is foreign to the title, which is specified in the order of leave, and if subsequently we insert provisions which are not within the title, power is given by a subsequent standing order to the Committee to alter the title accordingly, and to make a special report to the Senate. The only object of the proposed standing order is to prevent a clause being inserted in a draft Bill which is foreign to the title, and the use of the words &#34; or not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill &#34; very much enlarges the scope. As it is supposed to be founded on the South Australian Rule No. 275, We ought to adhere to that rule. </para>

                            <para>- The one which is before the Committee. All we require to provide at this stage, as is done in our present rule, is that no clause in a draft Bill shall be foreign to its title. The only restriction which ought to be placed on an honorable senator is that the provisions of a Bill which he presents pursuant to the order of leave shall be within the title therein contained. The subject-matter of the Bill we deal with tit a later stage. But it will be very unfair to an honorable senator when he brings up his Bill, or at the first reading of it, to have a ruling given that some particular clause is not relevant to the subject-matter, when the Senate in committee may decide that the particular clause is perfectly relevant. I wish to protect, honorable senators and to see that they are free from all restrictions in introducing Bills. If a clause of a Bill differs from the title that is a matter for immediate ruling, and can be dealt with ; but the question whether some clause is relevant to the subject-matter ought not to be subject to an immediate ruling. The President of the Senate Ought not to be placed in the position of ruling that a clause in a Bill is out of order because it is not relevant to the subject-matter. That is not his function at that stage. All we have to do is to give a senator leave to introduce a Bill and to specify the title, and then to see that no clause in the Bill differs from the title or extends beyond it. We can all decide that. But if we give power to the President to say whether any clause in, a Bill is relevant to the subject-matter we give a power which is less easily controlled by the Senate than is the case if the question simply is whether a particular clause differs from the title. Every member of the Senate can say at once whether a clause differs .from the title of the Bill, but it is a different thing to say whether a clause is relevant to the subject-matter. It would be a pity to make a change in our existing standing orders in this respect. The practice in South Australia has been limited to compelling <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> member who brings in a Bill to see that his clauses do not go beyond the title. An injustice may possibly be done to a senator in having a ruling given which there may be no possibility of checking. The title of a Bill is like the writing on the wall. Every one can understand it. The titles of Bills nowadays are made much more elastic than they used to be. The Minister for Trade and Customs, whose reputation as a draftsman is well known, during recent years in South Australia, introduced the practice of giving Bills such a title as - &#34; A Bill relating to such-and-such, and for other purposes.&#34; </para>

If the committee puts in the words &#34; not relevant to the subject-matter,&#34; it transfers a subject which has to be decided by the President from the title to the words of the Bill, and that may raise some difficulties.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is asking us to take a very retrograde step. He is asking us to go back to a practice which was found wanting a long time ago. The original practice of the House of Commons was that a Bill, as introduced, should, contain no clauses not within the title of the Bill. That was also the practice in most of our State Parliaments for a very considerable time. But it was found to be too restrictive. It was found that it prevented a great many clauses being introduced in a Bill which the mover and originator of the Bill thought ought to be introduced. Honorable senators will, no doubt, be aware that of late years the tendency has been to reduce the preamble of a Bill, and to diminish the title to a very short wording. In fact, the preamble has almost entirely disappeared, and the titles of Bills have become very short. In consequence of that tendency, the various Legislatures have found it necessary to alter their standing orders, and to give more scope to the introducers of Bills to put into them all they want. Instead of this standing order being, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has argued, a restriction, it is the reverse. The senator who introduces a Bill introduces what he likes, and what he introduces is the subject-matter of his Bill. He may include in that subject-matter almost anything he wishes relevant to the Bill. As a matter of fact, if this amendment is carried, honorable senators will be very much restricted indeed. It may be that the marginal note of the standing order is not quite clear, but that is of small&#39; importance. The amendment is inconsistent with the present practice of the British House of Commons, and of almost all legislative bodies. We want to give as free as possible scope to senators to introduce Bills, and to put into those Bills every clause that they think fit. Take an illustration. Suppose an honorable senator moves that he have leave to introduce, a Bill to do so and so. He can introduce into that Bill almost anything he likes that is in any way relevant or has any connexion with the title. But there may be clauses introduced into that Bill when it is first presented, which are foreign to the title. The standing orders say that if that happens the title must be altered before the measure passes ; and that is all. I hope we shall not adopt such a restrictive provision, and go back so many years in, I will not say the history, but the practice of legislation. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - I am quite confident that this question is not to be settled by describing an amendment intended to conform with our existing standing orders as restrictive. It is very much better if we can to avoid the use of any epithet of that description when we are dealing with what best gives effect, not only to parliamentary practice, but to the rights of honorable senators. No con.siderationseems to have been given to this subject, or to the South Australian standing order when our draft standing orders were framed. When I originally read the marginal note to this standing order, and saw the words &#34; clauses to come within the title,&#34; I passed it. Then I read it again, and found that instead of the standing order providing that clauses were to come within the title, it said that no clause was to be inserted that was not relative to the subject-matter, of the Bill. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> no doubt, . intended to give us was a standing order providing that the clauses of a Bill should come within the title, but what the Standing Orders Committee have done is to give us a provision that no clause shall be inserted that is not relevant to the subject-matter. That is a very different thing Who is to decide it ? What does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> ask the Senate to accept <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> That anything an honorable senator who intro.troduces a Bill puts into it is the subject-matter of the Bill. If that be admitted we do not want the standing order at all. We are prescribing the course to be adopted in the initiation of a Bill. What we require is that the title shall be specified in the order of leave. If the title is specified the clauses of the Bill must come within the title. That is the initiatory stage provided for in these standing orders - that no clause shall be in a Bill that is not relevant to the subject-matter. But who is to decide that? The question to consider is, what is the object of initiation? Is it to deal with the subject-matter or what is specified in Standing Order 1 77 <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If an honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator conforms</inline> to that, he has a right to bring in his Bill, and not to be questioned as to the subject-matter of his Bill when he gives his title. A <inline font-weight="bold">Senator introducing</inline> a Bill, says in effect: &#34;In the form of this leave I bring in my Bill, every clause of which conforms to the title.&#34; There is the landmark - the title - and by that is the right to introduce a Bill tested, and not by the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the occupant of the Chair for the time being, influenced, it may be, by his political views. It is the Senate, arid not the occupant of the Chair, who should judge the subject-matter of a Bill. Why should we depart from the existing standing order, which has been suggested for adoption also in another place <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I am sure that none of us has the slightest wish to interfere with the privileges of honorable senators, and they will be seriously interfered with by the proposed standing order. I should like to hear some precedent given for a standing order allowing a ruling to be given as to the subject-matter of a Bill at the time of its introduction. If such a precedent can be submitted, I shall be the first to bow to it. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable and learned senator should remember that these South Australian standing orders were adopted with very little consideration indeed. He will remember that he moved a motion by which a sub-committee was appointed to consider the standing orders of the various States and bring up a report within <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> hours, a task which I pronounced at the time to be quite impossible. In order to overcome the difficulty the sub-committee recommended as a temporary expedient, and without consideration of the standing orders of the other States, that we should adopt the standing orders of the House of Assembly of South Australia. That is no good reason why we should not now depart from them if we think it advisable to do so. I have not the advantage of being well acquainted with the practice of South Australia, but I know that in Queensland and in New South Wales the rule is that at all stages of a Bill the whole of the matter contained in it must conform to the order of leave. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> raises his objection particularly on the point that the standing order proposes action to be taken at the introduction of a Bill. But the question is whether all clauses, whether originally in the Bill or subsequently inserted, should conform to the subject-matter or the title of the Bill. In Queensland and New South Wales, the title of a Bill may be altered at any time. Under the practice there, any amendment which is relevant and conforms to the subject-matter of a Bill, may be agreed to, and if the title of the Bill does not fit the new matter introduced the title has to be altered. The very last thing done with a Bill may be to alter the title in order to make it fit the subject-matter. But the whole of the subject-matter of a Bill must be homogeneous. In my opinion, the standing order, as now proposed, is a better safeguard than that previously adopted, because the titles of Bills are now often very short. A Bill is introduced, for instance, to amend a certain law, and the words &#34;and for other purposes &#34; which are very often inserted have been held to have very little meaning, because, in carrying out the standing orders, the President or the Chairman of Committees will look past them to see whether an amendment proposed is relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill : otherwise a clause might be put in in the last stages of a Bill which would come within the title, but which would be foreign to the subject-matter of the Bill. </para>

An honorable senator moves that he have leave to introduce a Bill entitled so and so. That is all the Senate knows, or can know at the time, of the subject-matter of the Bill ; and if the order of leave is conformed to in that way, then the honorable senator&#39;s privilege is clear to carry his Bill through its first and second reading.

If we adopt the standing order now proposed we shall be doing violence to the practice of the House of Commons, which has existed for centuries, and we shall be giving a power to the Chair to prevent an honorable senator introducing a Bill and having its subject matter considered in Committee, not because it does not conform to the order of leave, the test of which is the title, but because in the estimation of the Chair it contains some provisions which are not relevant to the subject-matter. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia). - The argument just used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is untenable. The honorable and learned senator says that we propose to give an autocratic power to the occupant of the Chair to rule a Bill out of order, if any of its provisions are contrary to the subject-matter. But the honorable and learned senator is willing to give the Chair power to rule a Bill out of order, if any of its provisions are not in accordance with the order of leave. Where is the difference? There will be just as much difficulty in arriving at a conclusion, and just as much room for argument upon any conclusion arrived at by the Chair in the one case as there will be in the other. In all my experience I have never known a Bill ruled out of order for any reason when first introduced. We are really fighting a shadow, because I do not suppose for one moment that a Bill introduced by a senator would so far transgress the order of leave, or so far wander from the subject-matter as to be ruled out of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has referred to the practice of the House of Commons, and I shall now read from <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> 9th edition, page 566 - </para>

                            <para>- I am well aware of that. In the standing order now before us there is a confusion between the subject-matter and the title. In the original standing order there is the clear connexion between the title and the order of leave, and we have the fact that every clause must be cognate, and in harmony with the title. The standing order before us requires that the title shall agree with the order of leave; and that is all right. But then it proceeds - and no clause shall be inserted in any such draft not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is not ; and who is to say what the subject-matter is? No one, not even our present President, could say what the subject-matter is on the initiation of a Bill. All that he can know is the title. Under this standing order it would be competent for the occupant of the Chair for the time being to rule that some clause was not relevant to the title. But at that stage who is to decide on so vague a question as that of the subject-matter? We have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> that the proposed standing order is quite in conformity with other standing orders. No doubt it is in conformity with the other standing order which provides for amendments ; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker&#39;s</inline> arguments had been put before us in discussing Standing Order 195, they would have been applicable and of value. Standing Order 195 is as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">But an amendment is very different from an original clause, and the standing order I have read is most excellent at the stage to which it applies. Between an amendment&#39; at some subsequent stage of a Bill and a clause in the Bill as laid on the table, there is a vast difference. This standing order has been complicated without any benefit, and it would be far better to go back to the simple condition in which we found this and every other standing order, and so remove all doubt and difficulty. I would suggest that all the words in the standing order after the word &#34;such &#34; be struck out. The word&#34; draft&#34; is used. It ought to be &#34; Bill.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I wish to direct attention to a word which I think ought to be changed. The only Bills which we receive are those which come from the other House, and which are dealt with under another standing order. The word &#34;received &#34; may be applicable to such Bills, but it is not applicable to the Bills which are presented to the Senate under Standing Order 178. I suggest that we should use the word &#34; presented,&#34; which is to be found in our present standing order. It is only fair that we should hear the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who is a member of the Standing Orders Committee. </para>

                        <para>- This standing order deals with a matter of a very grave nature. It relates to Money Bills, which are dealt with in a separate chapter, beginning at Standing Order 225. It deals with Bills affected by the financial sections of the Constitution. Having regard to the great power which the Senate has in connexion with Money Bills, it should have some corresponding opportunity to that which is possessed by the other House of dealing with grievances. I suggest that we should delay the consideration of this, standing order until we come to deal with the whole question of Money Bills in another chapter. It is out of place in a chapter which has no relation to Money Bills in particular, but which deals generally with Bills which come before the Senate for consideration. I should like to have the standing order considered in connexion with the provisions dealing with Money Bills, so that we may have all the rules relating to such Bills set out in one part of our code. </para>

We are now dealing with first readings, and the first reading of a Bill which&#39; we may not amend comes under that heading. In the first place, we say generally that the first reading of a Bill shall not be debated, and then we say that the first readings of particular Bills may be debated. I admit that it is not a matter of very much importance ; but I submit that the standing order is in its right place. </para>

                        <para>- I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to consent to the elimination of this standing order. Our practice is that after leave is obtained by an honorable senator the Bill is presented and read a first time without debate, and the next motion is that the Bill be printed, and the second reading be made an order of the day for a certain day. This standing order will compel an honorable senator who, perhaps, may not desire to proceed with his Bill after it has been read a first time to get it printed before it is introduced. Why should he be put to the expense of printing his Bill when between the date of the first reading and the day set down for the second reading he might change his mind ? </para>

                        <para>- There are very strong arguments in favour of this standing order. We want to have Bills printed as soon as they are read a first time, as it is desirable that they shall be circulated before that stage. If the expense of printing has to be incurred, what harm is therein requiring senators to have their Bills printed before asking for the first reading ? The Senate wants to be seized of the contents of Bills as soon as possible. A small check like this is not unreasonable. We do not want to have senators coming along with piles of manuscript Bills which they never intend to have printed, flinging them down, and asking that they shall be read a first time. Government Bills have always been printed before the first reading. </para>

                        <para>- This standing order makes, in a very indirect way, a change which honorable senators ought to. be made aware of. At present we have three opportunities of reconsidering the clauses of Bills which have been dealt with in Committee. One is at the close of proceedings in Committee when the motion is made that the report be brought up. Any honorable senator may then move for the reconsideration of any clauses which may have been previously dealt with. That is a most convenient process. It is done before the Bill goes out of Committee, and when everything is fresh in the minds of those who have been dealing with it. It saves the Chairman leaving the Chair. I do not know how far that practice has been followed in connexion with parliamentary institutions elsewhere, but in South Australia it has been pursued ever since parliamentary Government has existed. It has also been adopted in the Senate with great advantage. The second way of getting clauses reconsidered, is when the motion is made for the adoption of the report in the Senate. Then any honorable senator can move for a recommittal. The one process is reconsideration ; the other is recommittal strictly so called. The third process is when the motion is made that the Bill be read a third time. Then any honorable senator may move to have any clause recommitted. But if we pass this standing order in its present shape, it provides that a Bill can only be reconsidered upon recommittal, and we shall be abolishing and depriving ourselves of the power we have at present of securing the reconsideration of clauses before a Bill gets out of Committee. I wish to preserve every possible power for dealing with Bills, and I think that this is an ill-considered amendment, in the sense that it has not been sufficiently thought out, and that it curtails the power and rights of senators. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>- No doubt this is altogether a matter of convenience, and the practice of reconsidering a Bill without taking it out of Committee is peculiarly a South Australian practice. When the Senate first met the majority of honorable senators were against this practice. They had never had any experience of it and did not like it. As will be seen from the memorandum accompanying the Standing Orders Committee&#39;s report, one of the objects of the Committee was to frame standing orders which they believed would be approved of by the majority of honorable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is slightly in error when he says that there will, under the proposed standing order, be only three opportunities of reconsidering clauses, because a Bill may be recommitted over and over again. Therefore, the amendment will not give the Senate any greater . opportunity of reconsidering clauses than we shall have under the standing order as proposed. The only difference will be in the mode in which the reconsideration takes place. There is one objection to the South Australian practice of reconsideration without taking a Bill out of Committee, and that is that we cannot get a fair copy of the Bill, and if a Bill is reconsidered in that way two or three times, it sometimes gets into such confusion that it is difficult to follow. Whether it is better to formally report a Bill to the Senate, have a fair copy supplied, and then reconsider it; or whether it is more convenient to reconsider it in Committee, is a question upon which I am not prepared to give a strong opinion either way. I think it does not matter much which course we follow, but there is undoubtedly an advantage in having a fair copy of a Bill when it is being reconsidered. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very great convenience to be able to reconsider a Bill in the same Committee without having it reported, because if that is not done, and the matter is postponed for consideration at a later date, and until a fair copy of the Bill has been printed, the subject-matter and details of the Bill pass out of honorable senator&#39;s minds, and it is possible that some honorable senators, who have taken a great deal of interest in the measure, may not be present when it comes on for reconsideration. I am sure it will be admitted that during last session we reconsidered Bills in Committee under the existing South Australian practice with great advantage to us all. I remind honorable senators that if a very great number of amendments have been made in a Bill, and a clean copy of it is desired, there is nothing to prevent us refusing to give leave for reconsideration in such circumstances. I am sure that the practice we have so far adopted tends to expedite business, and is of great convenience to honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- This is said, in the marginal note, to be the universal practice, and if that be so, it is a pity to lay the procedure down within the limits of a hard-and-fast standing order. So far, my objection to the standing order is the introduction of the -word &#34; strictly&#34; before the word &#34;relevant.&#34; An amendment is either relevant or not relevant ; there can be no question of degree. As worded, the standing order simply introduces another question which will have to be decided and another element of discussion. I move- </para>

                        <para>- The words &#34; strictly relevant&#34; are to be found in this connexion in the standing orders of every Parliament. They are in the standing orders of the House of Assembly of South Australia, and they have been interpreted over and over again in the House of Commons and in the Legislatures of all the Australian States. It would be inadvisable to alter the wording, especially in this standing order, because this deals with an amendment on an amendment of the House of Representatives. The question of relevancy is always difficult to decide, and each case must be settled on its merits. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down ; a question of strict relevancy is one which must be left to the presiding officer. In the standing orders of the House of Assembly of South Australia, which are much admired, and properly so, the words &#34; strictly relevant &#34; are to be found several times. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - I should like to see some of these instances pointed out. The fact is that the word &#34; strictly &#34; has been scattered much as is pepper from a pepper-box, and it is absurd to have these strong arguments in favour of the word &#34; strictly&#34; being retained when, in the very next line of the same standing order, we have the word &#34;relevant&#34; standing alone. </para>

There is a great difference between what is called &#34;universal practice&#34; and its formulation into a rigid standing order. This standing order is very difficult of construction. I appeal to any man to say what it means. I cannot make out what it is intended to prevent. It is far better to rely upon what is called &#34;universal practice &#34; than to confine ourselves within the iron-bound limits of a standing order. </para>

                        <para>- In the Queensland standing orders the general practice is shown in italic letters for the guidance of the members, and the rules defining such practice are interspersed with the standing orders. It allows honorable members to know what is the practice, without having a rigid standing order. That plan has not been adopted in the case of these standing orders. We have no option but either to have no standing order on the subject, and to rely on universal practice, or to make a standing order. It will be an advantage to have the universal practice stated in a standing order, in order that our actions may be uniform. </para>

                        <para>- It is the universal practice that there must be some finality about Bills. One House passes a Bill, and the other House amends the Bill and passes its third reading, so that it has been passed by both Houses except as to certain matters which are in dispute, and on which further proceedings take place. Amendments on the amendments are made, and so on, until at last a point is reached when there ought to be finality, and that point is met by the standing order. It gives a certain amount of latitude in making amendments on amendments, and in making amendments which are relevant to those qf the other House. I admit that when a Bill has passed three or four times between the Houses and amendments have been made, and these are followed by consequential amendments, it is very difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to what is open. But there must come a time when only certain matters are open, and when those matters must be agreed to by both Houses or the Bill must be lost. This standing order, which was drawn by the Clerk, formulates the practice of all the States and the House of Commons. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - I regard as of great value the practice which is adopted in Queensland. The volume which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has been kind enough to hand to me is practically an annotated volume of standing orders, comprising references to the practice of the House of Commons, and so on. I wish that something of the same kind could be done for the Senate. I am not prepared to say that this standing order does or does not accurately define the universal practice. I do not understand it. I do not know what it is driving at. I have the greatest possible jealousy of having too many standing orders. We have here over 400 standing orders, and it is quite enough to master those which are plain, without having new ones piled one on top of the other, expressive of what is described as the universal practice. I give the utmost credit to the Standing Orders Committee for making an effort to embody in a standing order what is described as the universal practice, but we are all subject to human frailties. I defy any man to embody adequately in six or seven lines the universal practice on a debatable question, which must be the subject of either a ruling by the Chair or a deliberate conclusion by the Senate on the occasion when it crops up. &#39; Why is it necessary that we should have another standing order upon this Subject ? AVe have just had a division on Standing Order 218, which defines the kind of amendments which can be made upon amendments of the House of Representatives. Is not that .enough? We cannot propose an amendment on an amendment of the House of Representatives that is not relevant, nor can an amendment be moved to a </para>
                    <para class="block">Bill unless that amendment be relevant to or consequent upon the acceptance or rejection of an amendment of the House of Representatives. What is this standing order wanted for ? It is a repetition in obscure and metaphysical language of another standing order. I ask that the Senate should not be hampered by an attempt - a laudable attempt - to embody something which is described as universal practice in a rigid, cast-iron standing order. Let us have some degree of latitude. If we are to be bound hand and foot in the discussion of matters, we may as well give up a portion of dur freedom. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal,</inline> as one who has had considerable experience, as to the difficulty of interpreting unnecessary standing orders. Why should we pile 233 upon 218, which is clear and expressive, for no earthly object except to attempt to reduce to a standing order what is universal practice? If it is universal practice we can deal with cases as they come up ; but in reducing it to language we may be doing more than universal practice warrants. </para>

                            <para>- There is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> knows, great difficulty in using precise language. The principle is a good one; the effort may be a good one. But it is a dangerous thing to adopt a standing order if you have a universal practice, because in framing your standing order you may, through the infirmity of human language, express something different from the universal practice. The whole object is to have all the . freedom we can have in debate in the Senate, and in proposing amendments. We have already passed 2 IS, which limits the kind of amendments which may be moved on amendments coming from another Chamber. The standing order under discussion practically does the same thing, but does it in a much less precise way. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia. - I do not think that this matter has been properly understood. The question is what we shall do with a Bill when it comes to us a first time, after amendment, from the House of Representatives, is one thing. The Bill may come back a second time, and may be dealt with. It may then come back a third time. We must meet those cases. Standing Order 233 is to meet final cases, when a Bill has come back a third time, and when it is proposed we have arrived at the stage of finality subject to a free conference.. It is no argument to say that by previous standing orders we provide for the amendments we may make on the amendments of the House of Representatives. That is all very well. But this is an additional standing order to provide what shall be done when the Bill finally comes back and we have arrived at the last stage. The argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that we must not bind ourselves will apply- to every one of these standing orders&#39;. If we are to have the freest possible discussion, and are not to be bound by standing orders, we do not need any at all. Every one of these standing orders bind us. All the rules that we have been considering about amendments bind us. There is no reason whatever that I can see why we should not have some kind of standing order relating to the final stage of amendments between the two Houses, such as we have with regard to the first, second, and third stages. The history of this 3 c standing order is this. Some time ago it was decided in South Australia - I think by the House of Assembly - to adopt new standing orders. The Clerks of the two Houses - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore</inline> and the Clerk of the House of Assembly - formulated this standing order, after careful consideration. The Standing Orders Committee do not take credit for it, because it was in the standing orders drafted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I think it would be safer to accept this standing order. It is one that would be seldom exercised, but it is just as well to have it. As I understand the position, a Bill comes from another place and is amended here. It is then sent back to the House of Representatives, and the amendments which we have made are either amended or agreed to. So the process goes on till the last stage ; and then it is provided that after another place has agreed to words to which we have already agreed, no further amendment on that amendment can be made. A finality standing order like this provides a safeguard against confusion when that last stage arrives. I hope it will be carried. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - I think that more confusion than even the standing order itself contains has been thrown around it in the course of the discussion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> solved the difficulty by eliminating about one-third of the standing order. That is one way of solving a question. I &#39;admire that method, and wish to carry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> process a little further by eliminating the whole of the standing order. The serious contention which has been put forward in favour of it is that the standing order contemplates the last stage of amendments. All I can say is that if so, the last stage will be very much worse than the first. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was rather carried away by the contention that the standing order is intended to meet the last stage, which is, however, absolutely met by Standing Order 218. That standing order also embodies the universal practice, and is fairly intelligible. Our desire is to provide that our powers in relation to amendments coming from the House of Representatives shall be, in some shape or other, properly under our control - that we shall not do more than deal with the amendments, and shall not re-open the whole Bill, which would be a monstrous thing to do. But how is that prevented? It is prevented by Standing Order 218 - </para>
                    <para>No amendment shall be proposed to an amendment of the House of Representatives that is not relevant thereto. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is a pretty high barrier to erect. It means that we cannot introduce anything which was forgotten when the Bill was in Committee in the Senate. Amendments made must be relevant to amendments of the House of Representatives, and must not seek to embody matters thought of afterwards. But that is not all. The standing order goes on - nor can an amendment be moved to the Bill. </para>
                    <para>That is, not to an amendment of the House of Representatives, but to the Bill or any&#39; part of it. unless the some be revelant to or consequent upon either the acceptance or rejection of a House of Representatives&#39; amendment. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is absolutely final. It exhausts the whole subject. </para>

                            <para>- I think the suggestion of the Chairman was an excellent one, emanating from a mind experienced in parliamentary affairs. That suggestion would make it clear that the general practice is applicable not only to Bills coming back to us from the House of Representatives, but to amendments to Bills coming from the House of Representatives and amended by us. If we like to substitute for 233 a repetition of 218 we shall be using less ambiguous language and doing precisely the same thing. The whole essence of it is the concurrence of the House of Representatives in what&#39; we have done. We cannot alter that. If the Chairman&#39;s suggestion is adopted, the matter will be put beyond doubt. Standing Order 218 is exhaustive and intelligible, and that this standing order is difficult of apprehension is shown by the fact that the powerful mind which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> possesses, though trained, by the way, on the Judiciary Committee of the Convention, has been unable to comprehend it. We should not hamper ourselves with standing orders which require the elimination of an essential part before they can be understood. </para>

                        <para>- The difference between Standing Orders 218 and 233 is, that under Standing Order 218 consequential amendments upon amendments made by the House of Representatives may be moved, and under Standing Order 233 consequential amendments may be moved in connexion with Senate amendments. That is what is intended by the standing order, and it is the universal practice. But as there is shown to be so much difference of opinion upon the matter, perhaps the safest plan to adopt will be that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> of leaving this standing order out, and then, when difficulties crop up, the President can rule as to what the universal practice is as questions arise. </para>

                        <para>- On looking into the matter I find that Standing Order 218 really applies to Bills which originated in the Senate, because it deals with amendments upon amendments made by the House of Representatives in Bills which have originated in the Senate. Standing Order 233 refers to Bills received from the House of Representatives. I am not prepared to say that Standing Order 218 applies to a Bill in all its stages, but at all events Standing Order 233, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has pointed out, is expressly placed under the heading of &#34; Amendments after disagreement.&#34; It appears to me, therefore, that it would be wise to leave this standing order in. With reference to the remark that this is the universal practice, it appears to me that it embodies a principle which we should be doing a gross wrong to violate in any way. When we are dealing with amendments made by another place, we are bound to adhere to the constitutional practice whether we provide for it in the standing order or not. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that Standing Order 233 does not exclusively relate to Bills received from the House of Representatives. It is under a heading of its own &#34; Amendments after disagreement,&#34; but it refers to all Bills. That being so, the honorable and learned senator&#39;s argument falls to the ground. Then Standing Order 233 does not refer to the condition of things to which my honorable and learned friend would limit it. It refers to identically the same set of Bills as are referred to by Standing Order 2 IS. In the meantime, I think we should strike this standing order out, and at the conclusion of the consideration of the standing orders we should reconsider either Standing Order 218 or Standing Order 225. If we decide to amend Standing Order 218, we can make it apply to Bills going both ways by an additional word or two. </para>

                            <para>- It does absolutely. My honorable and learned friend admits that it applies to the same Bills as Standing Order 218, and it introduces a lot of words which will receive an additional interpretation every time a Bill comes up to us from the House of Representatives. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia). - I desire to point out that the words of this standing order are, with the exception of the use of the word &#34;Senate&#34; for the word &#34;House,&#34; identical with the words of the House of Representatives&#39; Standing Order 249. 3 c 2 </para>
                    <para class="block">There is a marginal note to Standing Order 249 of the House of Representatives giving a reference to Standing Order 207. That is a reference to a standing order of some other House. So that we have in support of this standing order not only the recommendation of our own Standing Orders Committee, but that of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives, and a reference to a standing order of some other House. In these circumstances I think we ought to pass this standing order. It is all very well to speak of the universal practice, and to say that we shall get a ruling upon the universal practice, but how is the President to rule upon the universal practice ? We have no standing order to say that he shall do anything of the sort, or to give him power to do it, and it is a moot question whether or not we should adopt the usual course of providing that where we have not otherwise provided by our standing orders the practice laid down by the House of Commons is to prevail. Even if we agree to such a provision, we shall still have uncertainty instead of certainty, and I ask honorable senators to pay some attention to the recommendation of their own Standing Orders Committee. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia).- -Undoubtedly there has been temporarily adopted by the. House of Representatives&#39; a corresponding standing order. But we have no assurance that this standing order will be finally accepted <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the House of Representatives, and there is no authoritative standing order to this effect at present existing in any legislative assembly in the world. We are now engaged upon the task of adopting permanent standing orders for our guidance, and our object ought to be to endeavour, as far as possible, to have only such standing orders as can be thoroughly understood. When we come&#39; to deal with a standing order of this description it is not enough to say that it is at present in existence in a draft which has yet to come up for consideration in another place. We have to settle for ourselves whether this is a standing order which we ought to adopt. I agree that if we have no standing order applicable to a particular state of things, it is infinitely better that the Senate should have the practice of the House of Commons to go to, and to have a ruling sought, as a ruling must be sought upon all these questions, upon which each member of the Senate will be able to formulate his views of the universal practice relevant to the particular question that crops .up. What I object to is* the attempt to embody unnecessarily what may be described as the universal practice in a hard-and-fast standing order, when that universal practice is covered so far as it can be by the earlier Standing Order 218. Here we are at the beginning of the Federal Parliament endeavouring to lay down a hard-and-fast rule defining universal practice. It is from this point of view that, in the interests of the Senate, I think we should refuse to be bound by more fetters than are absolutely essential. For us to off-hand formulate in these standing orders a sort of political axiom of political practice is a task we ought not to undertake except under the most serious pressure. It is a task which we still less ought to attempt if there is already a standing order which, with the amendment as suggested by the Chairman, would exactly meet the case. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty was met last session in another way, when, although we knew that consequential amendments must be made, a Bill was passed, and the amendments left to be inserted on the suggestion of the Governor-General after the final stages had been passed in both Houses. It seems to me that that is the practice that should be followed. </para>

                            <para>- The practice of allowing the Governor-General to suggest consequential amendments is embodied in the standing order. It has been pointed out that, if the standing order bs passed as proposed,&#39; there might be a tendency to abuse it. It would rest with the President to practically determine whether an amendment was consequential, and should he determine that it was, the other House might take the view that, so far from being consequential, it embodied a principle. </para>

There is no necessity to introduce any words into the standing order, because the right of decision will always rest with the Senate. If we tie our hands we shall have long and tedious&#34; debates on the question whether an amendment does or does not interfere with the principle or substance of a Bill. The more we leave our hands free, the better it will be for ourselves. We can deal with each case on its merits. </para>

Otherwise a strong Government, with a strong backing, might force through the Houses an amendment which altered the principle or substance of a Bill, and which ought to be the subject of fresh legislation. The standing order is intended to cover formal amendments, and not amendments affecting the principle or substance of a Bill. If that view is expressed in the standing order it will avoid the necessity for the heated discussions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> deprecated, and possibly greater care will be exercised in sending down amendments. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>(South Australia). - It will be the height of discourtesy on our part, and, I think, contrary to the Constitution, if we frame a standing order to the effect that if the Governor-General sends down any amendments affecting the principle or substance of a Bill the Senate will not consider them. Any amendment which involved a principle of the Bill could not be put by the President to the Senate if we had such a standing order. The Constitution Act says that the Senate shall consider any amendments which are transmitted by His Excellency. An occasion may arise when it may be eminently desirable that a very important alteration should be made. As a general rule, the amendments recommended by a Governor are accepted without discussion, because they are. merely of a verbal nature. But it may happen that by some means or other a very important provision has, by the omission of a few words, been left out. Our clerks are especially careful, but a printer&#39;s error may be made. To tie our hands, and say that because we have made some mistake which affects the principle of a measure, we shall not be allowed to consider an amendment in order to put ourselves right, seems to me to be absurd. </para>
                    <para class="block">AVe should treat every amendment suggested by the Governor-General on its merits, whether it refers to a matter of principle or of detail.

I would point out to him that his argument is self-destructive. I will put a point which he can weigh between now and when we shall have this matter again under consideration- because I intend to have it dealt with again, for the reason that it involves an important constitutional question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> says that we should not tie our hands so as to prevent ourselves from dealing with any amendment recommended by the Governor-General on its merits. I decline to deal on its merits with any such amendment affecting the principle of any Bill passed by the Senate. This provision is simply for the purpose of enabling clerical and formal amendments to be made, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Playford himself lias illustrated. They may be errors of a typographical nature, or errors made by the Clerk at the table, or possibly there may be an omission in a clause dealing with the principle of a Bill, which may be amended by message from the Governor-General. It is not within the functions of the Governor-General to recommend an amendment which touches the principle of a Bill, and we should refuse to entertain any such amendment. </para>

                        <para>- We now come to those standing orders which regulate our practice in a way which will affect the House of Representatives, and I understand that there is a desire not to proceed, with the discussion of them just now. If that be so, I am quite willing that they shall be postponed. It is very desirable that they should receive the fullest possible consideration.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia). - I suggest that the numbering of these standing orders be entirely altered. Their wording is not so bad, but they are a complete jumble in their present order. For instance, 242 refers a Bill to the Committee. Then 245 should be 243; 244 should follow, and next should come 243. No. 243 deals with the position after a Bill has been returned from the House of Representatives. Standing Order 248 should be numbered 246, because it deals with the proceedings in Committee; 249 should be numbered 247 ; -246 should be numbered 248, and 247 should be numbered 249. By altering the numbers in that way we shall have some sequence, and &#39; the standing orders will follow in their natural order. In the present jumble there is not the slightest sign of order. </para>

                        <para>- The standing orders as here printed follow the same system as is followed in the ordinary standing orders. Instead of being a complete jumble, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will, on further examination,, see that the first part deals with proceedings in the Senate. Then follow the standing orders affecting the powers of the Committee and defining them; then those relating to proceedings in Committee are set out. There is no jumble at all. They follow in logical order. The mode in which they are arranged is first of all that they set out what the practice in the House shall be; then they set out what are the powers of the Committee, then the practice of the Committee. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will look at the standing orders we have just gone through, he will see that we have adopted the same sequence as to ordinary Bills. First of all, we have set out as to ordinary Bills what may be done in the way of practice in the Senate itself ; then the powers of the Committee ; then the practice of the Committee. The sequence is perfectly logical, and consistent with our ordinary standing orders. I am aware that another arrangement is possible. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> looks at the first report of the Committee, he will see that another  sequence was there adopted But, on consideration, it was thought that the -present arrangement was better. I think that it is more logical, at all events. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>(South Australia). - My own idea was that the arrangement of these standing orders was a little bit confusing. But, after hearing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> I think that perhaps there is a good deal to be advanced on the other side. What I rose particularly to say was that I am not going to be a party, unless compelled by action on the part of the House of Representatives, to the passing of standing orders affecting the two Houses without having exhausted every power we have to come to an amicable arrangement avoiding trouble in the future. I know what it will very likely mean if we pass these standing orders as <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> have them drafted. We shall have a conflict with the other House, and that pretty quickly. It is better for us not to have such a conflict if we can possibly avoid it. We have no printed precedents to guide us. In South Australia the two Houses have been working from day to day, and the practice has not been reduced to writing. They have a compact which can be broken by either House at any time, and which is no part of the Constitution. They have no standing orders dealing with the matter. Their position is different from ours. We ought to exhaust every means within our power to arrive at an agreement between the two Houses as to our standing orders upon this exceedingly important point. If we do not, the chances are that we shall be led into a dead-lock, which will be greatly to our injury, and much to be deplored. Therefore, I am not prepared under present circumstances to consider this part of the subject until, at all events, I can be sure that every effort has been made to arrive at a practical arrangement, or unless the other House shows a determination to adopt a course which I, as a senator, could not consistently agree to follow. I think that these particular standing orders ought to be postponed indefinitely. We can pass the others, and come back to this question again. I </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia). - I am quite as anxious as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is, and as every honorable senator must be, that there shall be an amicable arrangement between the two Houses. But it seems to me to be absolutely impossible that we can have any joint standing orders on this question. What are outstanding orders for ? To regulate our own practice. Our own practice is to make requests to the House of Representatives. Their practice is to grant or refuse those requests. So that our standing orders must be absolutely different. Let honorable senators look down these draft standing orders, and see if it is possible for the House of Representatives to adopt any one of them. It cannot be done. They only regulate our own procedure. Then look at the draft standing orders of the House of Representatives, which their own Standing Orders Committee have presented to them for adoption. I refer to their Standing Order 258, which has a number of sub-sections, but there is not one there that we can possibly adopt, because they cover their practice concerning a different state of affairs. We make the requests, and the}&#39; grant or refuse them. How can we have joint standing orders to regulate such matters <inline font-style="italic">1 ,</inline></para>

                            <para>- I do not know how we can arrive at that except through the Senate. A joint Standing Orders Committee certainly would have- no power to come to such an understanding. In the earlier part of last session, the Standing Orders Committees of the two Houses, I shall not say conferred together, but exchanged their drafts. I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> the draft of the standing orders the Senate&#39;s Committee then proposed in reference to Bills which the Senate may not amend, but I said to him - &#34;You cannot possibly adopt any of those ; they are not suited to your position.&#34; We obtained from them the draft standing orders they proposed, but we could not adopt an)&#39; of them. The only point upon which we can come to any understanding - and it must be done by the two Houses - is as to how many requests we may send to another place before a difference bf opinion is finally settled. The standing order dealing with that matter is the only one which is at all open for discussion between the two Houses. All the others refer to our own practice in the Senate and in Committee. I cannot myself see how it is possible, except by resolution of the Senate communicated by message to the House of Representatives, or <inline font-style="italic">viae versa.,</inline> that we can arrive at any arrangement in this matter. I do not know whether it is probable that we should arrive at any arrangement, nor do I know whether it is more probable that we should then arrive at an arrangement upon the abstract principle involved, than when the question arises in respect of a particular Bill as it did last session. In any case it is not a matter for settlement by the Standing Orders Committee, but by the Senate itself. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>(South Australia). - Perhaps I used an inaccurate phrase in referring to &#34; joint &#34; standing orders; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has hit the point to which I intended to refer. My object is that we should come to some agreement upon the particular matter involved in the proposal to send three messages. That is the matter upon which trouble may arise between the two Houses, and we should, I think, arrive at a decision in regard to it. We should, I think, embody the arrangement come to with the House of Representatives on that point in our standing orders, and they should embody it in their standing order. We may arrive at a decision to send so many messages down. After they have considered our suggestions we may then reconsider the message they send &#34;back, and we may send suggestions back to them again a second and a third time. We should have some mutual understanding as to what the practice upon that point is to be. The practice which the House of Representatives will desire to follow will unmistakably be that followed in South Australia, where only one message is ever sent from one House to the other upon such questions. No doubt the House of Representatives will light for the adoption of that practice as hard as they can, and we naturally will fight for the adoption of a practice which will give us what will practically amount to the power to make amendments. There will be differences of opinion between the two Houses upon this point, and we ought to agree to some compromise in connexion with it. I think that before any Money Bill is sent up to us upon which we may make, suggestions that point should be settled between the two Houses. The House of Representatives gave way on the Tariff Bill last year, but they did so under protest, and we, therefore, do not know how they will treat similar messages from the Senate on the next occasion. We may find that they will be the cause of trouble between the two Houses. I desire that we should avoid that if we can. We know what the&#39; results of a dead-lock between the two Houses may be. We had an experience of them in South Australia which was certainly a sad one. A dead-lock in that State caused an immense amount of trouble, and was settled eventually only by a compromise between the two Houses. Here, in Victoria, the State was placed in a worse position as the result of the dead-lock occurring between the two Houses of Parliament in connexion with the Darling grant. They had then the &#34;Berry Blight,&#34; &#34;the Stone Wall,&#34; &#34; the Iron Hand,&#34; and I do not know what not. </para>

Its evil effects would extend over the whole Commonwealth, and would not be confined to one State. If we once begin to discuss a Money Bill and carry what we consider to be important suggestions, and send&#39; them on to the House of Representatives, and if that House refuses to give them any consideration at all a dead-lock will ensue, and the chances of arriving at a compromise when our passions are heated and excited, will be very much less than if we were now quietly to sit around a table and discuss the matter calmly and amicably in order that we might arrive at a conclusion upon this very important point. I think that we should try to come to some understanding with the House of Representatives upon this proposal for three messages, with a conference at the close, before we deal with the other standing orders referring to these matters, and affecting only the conduct of affairs in the Senate. </para>

That is to Say that it simply means that after we have exhausted our efforts to agree, and have failed in agreeing - and, of course, there will be no disagreement unless upon a point which is vital and fundamental - the whole matter is then to be remitted, <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> means of a penal dissolution, not of one, but of both Houses of the Federal Parliament, to the arbitrament of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

I desire to point out, in dealing with the picture which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has presented of what has been called a dead-lock in the States, that if we assert our constitutional position as a Senate, although the assertion of that position may result in what is termed a dead-lock, under our Constitution that dead-lock is absolutely and constitutionally provided for, and its solution is equally provided for by provisions which form a part of the system of our constitutional machinery. Whilst I agree very largely with what has been said in &#39; relation to these proposed standing orders, I do not wish it to be supposed, for a moment, that I shall be averse to giving full effect to the constitutional powers of the Senate, and to bringing these constitutional powers, if they come into conflict with the powers of the other branch of &#39; the Federal Legislature, to the arbitrament prescribed by the Constitution, the votes qf the electors of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> misapprehends the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Playford. I have been dealing with a larger matter than that with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> lias dealt &#39;in order to appeal to our sympathy - the matter, if I may use the expression, of peace and order in parliamentary government, in relation to the assertion of our rights under the Constitution. I am not influenced by what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said, but I am influenced by the belief that everything ought to be done now to prevent a conflict, and everything ought to be done when a conflict does arrive, to avoid it if possible, and to minimize its effects if it is unavoidable. These standing orders are really divisible into two parts, and it is there that any difference lies between what has been said by Senators Playford and Baker. We have in these proposed standing orders some which are entirely our own affair. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has said, our object is to regulate our own procedure. There are some of these standing orders which affect ourselves, and ourselves only, but even those should not, I think, be couched in1 language which, when read by members of the other branch of the Legislature may irritate them a little. I dare say that members of the House of Representatives give some attention to our proceedings and to our language, and I think that if we can conserve and assert our rights by the use of diplomatic and careful language, which will not wound the susceptibilities of members in another place, we should do so. From that point of view I think that the particular set of standing orders which are our own, which we have a right to frame and alter as we please, might very well bear revision. But, as I have said, there are two sets of standing orders here - those which deal exclusively with our own affairs, and those, or one, at any rate, which directly challenges &#39;the other branch of the Legislature, and which would precipitate a conflict with the other Chamber at an early stage. That honorable senators may give the matter consideration before these proposed standing orders are again considered, I would point out that there is a very grave hiatus. In the first place, Standing Order 242 is unnecessary. Bills which the Senate cannot amend are precisely in the same position, until after the second reading, as any other Bills which come from the House of Representatives. Then we are taken right to the stage at which messages come from the House of Representatives dealing with our requests. What I suggest for consideration is that between the two events there is a considerable interval. A good deal has to be done, and I think we should prescribe, to begin with, at what stage the requests we make are to go to the House of Representatives. </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware of that. &#34; At any stage &#34; means at any stage of the Bill, and last session discussion was provoked as to whether one set of requests exhausted the powers of the Constitution. That was the rock on which there was a possibility of splitting, but more amicable considerations came into play, and brought about a result, so far .as procedure went, that at all events answered our purpose. But that has nothing to do with the point with which I am now dealing. In relation to procedure, we ought to have a standing order providing when our requests should go back - whether on the first clause of a Bill, or in the middle, or at the end. It would be rather absurd, I presume, to send messages at any particular stage in Committee, and, therefore, we want a standing order ; and I am throwing out this suggestion in no critical mood. </para>

                    <para class="block">We want the standing orders to be exhaustive, and I shall endeavour to frame amendments which will assist the Committee. My suggestion now is that we ought to have clearly prescribed what is to take place between the second reading and the time when the messages come back from the other branch of the Legislature, accepting, rejecting, modifying, or, to speak generally, dealing with our requests. The standing orders, as now submitted, are very crude to lay before the Senate, the members of which are not in the position of a Standing Orders Committee, and cannot sit round a table and discuss them. These standing orders are of vital consequence, and I know it is very difficult to frame them ; but I am allowing for all that in the remarks which I make. Standing Order 244 provides that if a message is returned completely complying with the requests of the Senate, the Bill, as altered, may be read a third time and passed. What is to intervene ? The Bill cannot be read in the interval j and the meaning is that the Bill must be read when the intervening process has been gone through. That should be prescribed by the standing orders : and all we have to do is in half-a-dozen lines to lay down the different steps to be taken, and make the matter as clear as midday. There are other standing orders to which similar consideration could be given with advantage, and instead of having, I will not say a jumble, but a crude set of standing orders, dealing with so vital a matter, we should have them in better form. The great difference, however, is in connexion with the second set of standing orders which directly affects the other House. Strong as I am in support of the widest constitutional powers of the Senate in relation to Money Bills, and adhering, as I do, to the position which I took up in the Convention, and out of it, as to the amplification of that power if possible, I shall never assent to such a standing order as that embodied in No. 246 without trying in some way or other to secure - though it may be impossible to secure - the adhesion of the House of Representatives. For instance, if such a standing order were embodied in our code, I think the members of the House of Representatives would be perfectly justified in scouting it and saying - &#34;If you, by your standing order, declare that a Bill must be sent down three times, and returned by the House of Representatives three times, and you can carry such a provision into effect, you are a much finer set of fellows than we took you to be.&#34; Such a standing order would be provocative in the highest degree. If. the House of Representatives did not return a Bill three times, what then ? There are conditions on which we are to do - what ? We are to demand, not politely request - though I think a little politeness might be engrafted on outstanding orders - a free conference. But what would happen if the House of Representatives did not send back the Bill three times? We, like Mahomet&#39;s coffin, would be hung up between heaven and earth, and I do not know where the Bill would be. </para>

I do not like approaching the House of Representatives on this subject, but this is a matter on which both Houses must agree somehow ; and if it is to be the occasion of a dead-lock, the sooner we bring it about the better. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and in the other instance it is a High Court constituted by the people. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> I feel that we ought to attempt to arrive at some agreement with the other House as to the number of times requests may be transmitted. In my opinion the House of Representatives are under the Constitution bound to receive requests, even seventy times seven, in matters of disagreement ; but the question is - shall we approach this matter from the point of view of trying to arrive at some definite agreement on the subject? If so, let us try, and if we cannot succeed we shall be just where we were. Prom all these points of view I think a postponement is exceedingly desirable. Do not let us be overpowered with timidity, because of the pictures of other dead-locks which have no relation to our parliamentary condition. At the same time let us take care that our own standing orders are absolutely complete and clear, so that he who runs may read, as to the different stages the Bill must pass through. As to the standing orders which impinge more or less on the fun ctions of the House of Representatives, or on what the House of Representatives, may consider to be their rights, or regard as their constituctionsl duty, let us do everything we can to come to some arrangement. If we cannot we must make our own standing orders and abide by them, and fight for them until the last jump. </para>

I believe that we shall do well to carefully consider the proposal which he has &#39;made. There is no particular reason for hurrying on the consideration of this part of the standing orders. I am still of the opinion that there is no necessity for passing these particular standing orders. Seeing that we dealt with some difficulties of this character last session, and in a manner which enabled us to get the legislation put through, it might be well for us to wait until another occasion arose, and then to deal with it according to the circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that; but the same necessity arises for standing orders, and these are evolved in the same way. There is, of course, a novelty, because the relation between the Houses does not correspond with the relations that exist between the Houses of any other Parliament of which we have any knowledge. But still, I think the same argument is good - that seeing that we cannot be perfectly sure of a correct interpretation of the Constitution, we should proceed slowly, and not, before the necessity arises, put into print standing orders which would force us afterwards into an attitude which we might not be disposed to take up. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether a joint committee could do it, but, certainly, it would pave the way to a better understanding if the Standing Orders Committees were to meet and confer, and, by discussion, we could no doubt arrive, to a certain extent, at an agreement as to what the practice should be. In any case, I think that most honorable senators will agree that there is room for improvement in all the standing orders which we have been discussing. Seeing that we have postponed some standing orders, including the first chapter, which probably will require the attention of the Standing Orders Committee, I propose to go on to-night with the consideration of the remaining standing orders, and then to adjourn the further consideration of the code, including all the postponed standing orders, for, say, a fortnight. That will give an opportunity to the Standing Orders Committee to meet and to carefully deliberate, and to bring up the postponed standing orders with such amendments as may appear advisable to them in the light of this discussion. Judging from the tone of the debate, and the excellent speeches from Senators Playford and Symon, I believe it will see the advisability of bringing up the postponed standing orders in such a form that they can be adopted without any long discussion. </para>

If we agree to these standing orders, we may commit ourselves to a course of which &#34;we cannot approve later on. We may be going in one direction ; the House of Representatives may be going in another direction; and thus we may be getting further asunder than if we had no standing orders on the subject. It is far better not to have any standing orders than to force ourselves to go in a direction which may be contrary to common sense at a particular time. I hope that the consideration of this chapter will be postponed ; in fact, I hope that it will not be brought forward again. Even if the Standing Orders Committees did meet, they would not be likely to agree on this subject. </para>

                        <para>- I think it will be a wise thing to postpone the consideration of this chapter, on the understanding that the Standing Orders Committee shall approach the corresponding committee of the other House and ascertain what it is prepared to do. I have my own opinion about what it will do, and about what the members of the other House will do, and it is derived from the proceedings on the Tariff Bill. A number of honorable members in another place think that we have the right to send down a Money Bill only once. I take the view that under the Constitution Act we can send down a Money Bill 100 times if necessary. If there is an idea abroad that the Senate could send down a Money Bill an unlimited number of times, it will not lead to the rapid transaction of business. There should be an understanding on the part of the two Houses as to when finality is likely to occur. If it is known that a Bill will pass between the Houses only three times, honorable members will make up their minds on any question before the last opportunity of arriving at an agreement is availed of. We have advanced a stage, and when the Standing Orders Committee report the result of their efforts, we can decide whether it will be wise to have any standing orders on the subject, or to rely upon the provisions in the Constitution Act. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia). - This discussion divides itself into two parts. First of all, as to the relationship between the two Houses, I quite agree that we should exhaust every effort to come to an amicable arrangement. I am not at all sanguine about an arrangement being arrived at ; but still, if we can do so, well and good, and perhaps it is a waste of time to discuss that question now. There is another aspect to be considered, and that is the standing orders which absolutely relate to our own procedure, and which will come on for discussion again. I wish to answer some of the rather hypercritical suggestions made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> He has said that we ought, in the language of these standing orders, to be as conciliatory as possible. I agree with that. He objects to the words &#34;demand a conference&#34; as being language which ought not to be adopted.

                    <para class="block">That was our practice last session. I will ask honorable senators to note the fundamental difference between the practice on Bills which we may amend and on those which we may not amend. In regard to an ordinary Bill, we go into committee, make amendments, and then pass the third reading ; after which we send a message to the House of Representatives stating that we have agreed to the Bill subject to certain amendments. Those amendments, and those only, are open for discussion. In the case of a Bill which we may not amend we must in the nature of the case adopt a very different procedure, and a different principle is brought into play. In the case of a Bill which we may not amend, we go into committee, but we do not read the Bill a third time, and do not pass it. The Committee reports to the Senate and the Senate sends a message to the House of Representatives requesting that certain amendments be made. Such a Bill has never been passed by us; the third reading has never been agreed to ; and the motion that the Bill do now pass has never been put. The Bill is open so far as the Senate is concerned, because we have never gone out of committee. The Bill is still in committee, subject to a message having been sent to the House of Representatives. Therefore the standing order which I have just read is quite right. In the case of a Bill which we may not amend, we have not read it a third time, whereas in the case of an ordinary Bill we do read it a third time before sending it to the House of Representatives. Supposing we receive a message from the House of Representatives virtually complying with our request, there is no necessity to refer the Bill in question back to the Committee, because everything in connexion with it is finished. The Houses are in accord, and all that we have to do is to read the Bill a third time and pass it. So that the difference in procedure and in the principles upon which we base our procedure is great. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER.What we did last session, and must do, is this : A Bill is referred to the Committee, and the Committee reports to the Senate. We do not read the Bill a third time, but we send a message to the House of Representatives informing them that we make certain requests. In the case of ordinary </para>
                    <para class="block">Bills we do read them a third time and pass them before sending any message to the House of Representatives. So that the position is entirely different. When the message comes back from the House of Representatives, if it does come back, agreeing to everything we suggest, and making amendments accordingly, we are in this position : There is no necessity to refer the Bill in question back to the Committee, because they cannot amend it. All our requests have been complied with, and all that we have1 to do is to read the Bill a third time and pass it, if we choose to do so. So that I contend that the words of the particular standing order which I have read are correct. I ask honorable senators to bear in mind the fundamental difference between the two positions. If they do that, I am quite sure that they will see that the procedure suggested, which was the procedure we adopted last session, and which has always been adopted in South Australia, is correct. I am not going to labour the argument, or to say anything more about it, because the subject will come up for consideration again. I make these observations so that when it does come up again, honorable senators may bear in mind the fundamental difference between the position of a Bill which we can amend, and which we read a third time and pass, and concerning which we send a message to the House of Representatives embodying our amendments ; and the position of a Bill which Ave cannot amend, which we do not read a third time, which we do not pass, and on which we wait till the House of Representatives makes the amendments we desire. When the House of Representatives makes those amendments, the whole matter is at an end so far as we and they are concerned. There is no question between the two Houses, and all that we have to do is either to read the Bill a third time and pass it or to reject it. There is no object in referring it back to the Committee of the whole Senate, because that Committee can do nothing. It is, as it were, <inline font-style="italic">functus officio.</inline> The Senate has adopted the Committee&#39;s report, and sent a message to the House of Representatives, which has agreed to make the amendments we require. The Bill comes back containing those amendments in the form in which we want them, and we read it a third time. </para>
                    <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia): - My criticism of the standing order referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> was not limited to the point that when a Bill is returned from the other place with a compliance with our requested amendments, it must then be read a third time without the necessity for its going back to the Committee of the whole. We all know that a Bill which we cannot amend, cannot be read a third time if we request amendments in it until those amendments have been dealt with in another place. What I complain of is that after the time when the Bill is read a second time - as unnecessarily stated in the first of these new standing orders - there is nothing to prescribe what the c&#39;ourse of procedure of the Senate or of the Committee of the whole Senate shall be. There is a jump from the second reading of the Bill to the return from the House of Representatives of the message with regard to the requests of the Senate. It is merely with the object of suggesting further consideration in the interval, and so that these rules may be recast, and we may arrive at something definite, that we are discussing them now. The first standing order in question is No. 242 - </para>
                    <para>Bills which the Senate may not amend shall (unless otherwise ordered), after the second reading has been passed, be referred to a Committee of the whole. </para>
                    <para class="block">We know what is done there. The next standing order is 243 - </para>
                    <para>All messages from the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> reference to such Bills which do not completely comply with the request of the Senate . . . shall . . . be referred to the Committee. </para>
                    <para class="block">There is a great gulf there. One standing order leaves off with the second reading of the Bill, and its reference to the Committee of the whole, and the next standing order starts with the return of our request from the House of Representatives either complied with or not complied with or modified. It is as though a Rip Van Winkle had made these standing orders and had gone to sleep between Nos. 242 and 243. What is the procedure <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> When a Bill which we cannot amend gets into Committee it will be dealt with in the ordinary way, except that we shall make requests instead of amendments in form. But there is nothing to prescribe that they shall take any particular form, or at what stage of the procedure in&#39; Committee we are to make our requests. If it is to be at any stage, let us-.say so. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is not provided in these standing orders how the report is to be made. Personally, I think the Bill should go back to the Committee of the whole, because it has never left the Committee as a Bill in the Committee stage. Suppose there is a standing order prescribing that we shall send it to the House of Representatives before the preamble is agreed to ? </para>

                            <para>- We adopted procedure for the moment on that occasion. I dare say we can do so again. But here, in this off-hand, loose, undefined way, at the end of Standing Order 244, it is provided that, if a message is returned from the House of Representatives complying with every request made by the Senate, the Bill may be read a third time, and passed forthwith. That is not the way to settle a matter of that kind. Suppose there were half-a-dozen requests made, and the House of Representatives complied with part of them, should not the Bill go back to the Committee for the reconsideration of the remainder ? I hold that the Bill is in the Committee stage up to the time of the return of the message from the House of Representatives. It is only a matter of procedure that in order to get the Bill to the House of Representatives with our requests for amendments, it goes back to the Senate, because the Committee is not a proper body, and the Chairman is not the proper functionary to send a message to the other House. The Bill is still in Committee, and that is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has entirely overlooked. </para>

                            <para>- It is as plain as possible that if a Bill leaves the Senate with suggestions for amendments, and those amendments are not agreed to, it is in the Committee stage and should go back to the Committee to have the suggestions reconsidered. When a final agreement is arrived at between the two Houses, the Committee reports to the Senate and the Bill is read a third time. There is no hypercriticism, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> supposes, in calling attention to a matter which affects the substance of our constitutional position; My criticism regarding the word &#34; demand &#34; is not got rid of by reference to <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> I say that Standing Order 246 is one that might be construed as holding a pistol at the head of the House of Representatives. The language used is of a most aggressive character throughout. What is more to the point, having regard to our constitutional position, is the fact that it ties our hands to three messages, and does it aggressively ; whereas if we had an opportunity of sending 30 messages, we might avoid all difficulty. It is a fact that we are laying down by that standing order a rule of conduct for the House of Representatives- that they shall receive our messages three times and return them three times. I think that carries out our constitutional position fairly. I refer to this because there are two parties to the bargain, and it is said I am hypercritical. I believe that my honorable friends opposite, and many others, are of that opinion, and if the Tariff Bill had come back again to us, and we had not been inspired by the spirit of compromise, we should have had to incur the odium of laying it aside. I hold the opposite view that we have the right, under such circumstances, to return the Bill to the House of Representatives, and throw upon them the odium of laying it aside. I rather agree with the standing order, but if we lay down this rule it must be remembered that we are laying down a rule which impinges upon what the House of Representatives may claim. Suppose they differ from it, it may turn out to be like a man receiving a letter which he does not like. He sends it back again, and it is again sent to him, and so the game of battledore and shuttlecock goes on until the address upon the letter is worn off. I recognise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> view that we should incur the odium, but I say &#34; no,&#34; the other House ought to do so. But if we, by a standing order, put our foot down, and say - &#34;This House is going to adopt this course,&#34; that will only be another instance in connexion with which we may get ourselves condemned before our time by the House of Representatives. If we are going to assert that right - and I do not deny that we may fairly do so by a standing order - I think it ought to be couched in some kind of language which will be, perhaps, less aggressive than that which is here adopted by which in effect we say - &#34;This is the law we lay down. We are going to act upon it. If you, the members of the House of Representatives, and we, the Senate, disagree, we will send the Bill back to you, and you may do what you like with it.&#34; It is fair that we should try to preserve that right to ourselves, but we should do it in as unaggressive a way as we possibly can. So that my criticisms are not hypercritical. They are observations of substance which, I am sorry to say, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> seems to have entirely misapprehended. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia). - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has entirely overlooked some of these standing orders. The honorable and learned senator says there is an hiatus between what it is proposed we shall do with a Bill after we have referred it to the Committee of the whole and the time when we send a message to the House of Representatives. I absolutely contradict that. If honorable senators will look at these standing orders they will see that first of all the Bill is referred to a Committee of the whole, then the standing orders set out what results can be arrived at by the Committee; they regulate the procedure and powers of the Committee, and they then go on to say that, whenever the Committee reports, a message shall be sent to the House of Representatives. Now, where is the hiatus ? There is a complete sequence. </para>

                    <para>SenatorSir RICHARD BAKER. - The whole thing is not a jumble. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to make assertions, but assertions are not proof. The whole thing is not a jumble, but it is absolutely in sequence, and is absolutely logical. There is no hiatus at all. The Senate, when it obtains a report from the Committee, if it is adopted, sends a message to the House of Representatives, and the standing orders as drafted go on to say that all messages received from the House of Representatives which do not completely comply with our request - that is to say, whenever there is not complete agreement - shall be referred to the Committee. Where is the hiatus and the want of sequence? </para>

                            <para>- They are numbered correctly. The standing orders first of all state what the powers of the Senate shall be. Then they state what the powers of the Committee shall be; and finally what the procedure of the Committee shall be. And if the numbering needs to be altered, surely it is a small matter, and not worth so much discussion and talk. If it is merely a matter of putting Standing Order 243 where Standing Order 242 now is, and so on, it is a matter of very small importance indeed. But if honorable senators will look at these standing orders as a whole they will see that they follow the same principle as our ordinary standing orders in reference to Bills. That principle is, first of all, to state what the Senate shall do, then to state what the powers of the Committee are, and. then to show how the Committee shall proceed. If these standing orders had been divided into three parts, and at the head of each there had appeared the words - &#34; Procedure in the Senate,&#34; &#34; Power of the Committee,&#34; &#34;Procedure in Committee,&#34; these remarks, which are really uncalled for, would probably never have been made. I strongly object to criticisms of this sort, which have no substance at all, and which ought not to be, made. </para>

                            <para>- I do not remember the circumstances ; I must have been suffering from a slight aberration at the time. This standing order is prompted by a consideration of the conditions of the British House of Commons, where there are some 678 members, and where there are at times scenes of great disorder ; and if we had a similar number of members I could quite understand a provision of this kind being necessary. I can imagine that a lot of trouble might be caused by even a moderate multiplication of the cantankerous element of this Senate ; but, in my opinion, such a standing order was never intended for a deliberative body such as this. It should be remembered that this Senate is composed of six representatives from each State, and though, according to the Constitution, the smaller States have an equal voice with the larger States, it is now proposed to curtail the powers of the former. When the Commonwealth grows, and new States are added, a small State might send six senators with a mandate to advocate certain legislation ; and under the standing order it would be possible for the representatives of the largely-populated States to combine to crush such legislation. That could easily be done by one of the more powerful senators jumping up as soon as opportunity offered and moving that a division be taken immediately, and no opportunity would&#34; be afforded of showing why a division should not be taken at that time. The calm and judicial way in which, generally speaking, we have conducted our deliberations, entitles senators from the smaller States to ask that such a motion should be carried by a reasonable majority. Let us provide for something more than a bare majority. I feel inclined to ask the Committee to provide for a majority of two-thirds of the senators then present. I believe that the standing order found its way into our code because it was feared by certain honorable senators that some senators from Queensland might endeavour to impress their extraordinary views on the Senate at inordinate length. It will be remembered that in the first code of standing orders distributed certain pages were pasted over with more drastic provisions. For what reason ? To meet the case of the senators from Queensland who had been given a bad reputation by those of our opponents who witnessed the Commonwealth celebrations and the opening of this Parliament, and who, of course, did not fail to describe us in what they considered to be our true colours. A feeling of consternation was created, and then certain honorable senators said - &#34; We will fix them by the standing orders.&#34; I hope the Committee will recognise that a provision of this kind is only intended for use in a large body such as the House of Commons, which, owing to the large number of its members, cannot in ordinary times, when there is no opposition, conduct its business with reasonable speed. In the Senate, as a rule, not more than 24 senators are present. We are being asked to prepare a standing order for a time of trouble which will never arise here. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who is liberal minded, and represents a numerically small State, not to pass this standing order without requiring the vote of a reasonable majority. With a view to testing the feeling of the Committee on the point, I move - </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> must be very hard up for arguments when he appeals to the representatives of the small States. I could understand an appeal being made to the members who represent small States in another place, because while one State is represented by only six members in that House, another State is represented by 23 or 24 members. In the Senate, however, the small State has equal representation with the large State. It is a poor foundation upon which my honorable friend has rested his superstructure. This rule has not been taken as he indicates from the standing orders of the House of Commons. The right to apply the closure is not vested in either a bare majority or a two-thirds majority, but in the Speaker of that House. The rule is taken from the South Australian code. I believe it was not enforced on one occasion last session. </para>

                            <para>- I never knew this form of the closure to be put in force in South Australia until the temper of the House had been raised to a high pitch by the great waste of time which had gone on. It has only been put in. force by the House in self-defence. There must be a rule of that sort in every deliberative Assembly, large or small, unless a minority is to be allowed to &#34; stone-wall &#34; to such an extent as to become a nuisance to every member who attends to his duties properly and fairly. The rule has never been abused in South Australia. I feel sure that it will never work harshly in the Senate, and that it will only be applied when it is richly deserved. It will be sufficient to provide for its application by the vote of an absolute majority. </para>

                        <para>- I support the amendment, because I think that the vote of more than a bare majority should be required when the closure is applied. Last session I suffered from the existence of this rule in our code. I submitted a motion to the effect that the editor of a newspaper in this city should be brought to the bar for printing a scurrilous article on royalty. Not being a person who parades his loyalty very often, I was surprised to find so many honorable senators who had received favours from His Majesty taking up the opposite position and applying the- closure. The exercise of this power should not be placed in the hands of a bare majority. In the case of my motion, only two honorable senators had spoken, and the matter had not been nearly sufficiently ventilated. But because it was not a palatable one to a number of honorable senators the gag was applied. Just as it operated against me on that occasion, it may operate against those honorable senators on another occasion, although not with my support. It may happen that only the representatives of one State are interested in the ventilation of a grievance, and, of course, the application of the gag in that case would be a much more grievous affair than it was in the case in which I was interested. I hope it will not be applied here again, except by the vote of a fair majority. </para>

                        <para>- I think we cannot&#39; do better than pass the standing order as it is framed. Of course, it is the &#34; closure,&#34; and that is an expression which, especially when it is converted into the word &#34;gag,&#34; immediately suggests some&#39; improper attempt to put a stop to free discussion. It has been&#39; the most successful, and it is the fairest method of putting an end to a debate which has lasted long enough, or to the discussion of a subject which has been -discussed enough, whether by one speech, or by two or three speeches. Its application does not depend on the President, the Chairman of Committees, or the leader of the Government, but on the sense of justice and fair play of the Chamber. During the whole of the time I had personal experience of this rule I never knew it to be abused. In a moment of excitement - perhaps in a fit of indignation - the application of the closure has been moved ; but an appeal by two or three members always availed . to have the motion withdrawn. It cannot be moved in the middle of a speech. If a member is ready to speak, and that fact is. indicated to the mover of the motion, it is always withdrawn. But the great safeguard is the sense of fair play and justice to the House itself. </para>

But still I think. that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> is quite right in suggesting that the vote of a substantial majority should be required. I have noticed in other Parliaments that when party feeling was running very high, and the majority was very narrow, they were prepared on every occasion to take advantage of the weakness of the minority, and to stifle further arguments. The result was that there was not a fair discussion. In cases of this kind a two-thirds majority is necessary. Probably the same amount of dissatisfaction would not be left on the minds of those who took part in such debates if a two-thirds majority had to operate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said that he does not mind- whether the majority is an absolute or a two-thirds majority. It would be better for us to adopt a two-thirds majority of those present than to provide that an absolute majority of the Senate shall settle the matter. </para>

To safeguard the honour of the Senate - because there are times of excitement when a very small majority might be tempted to do an injustice to a minority - we ought to adopt the suggestion which I am supporting. If a set of senators were making, themselves obnoxious, there would be no trouble in inducing a two-thirds majority to restrain them j but to say that half-a-dozen members shall be silenced by a majority of one against them is absolutely unfair. </para>

                        <para>- I may state at the outset that I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs&#39;</inline> amendment. It is all very nice for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to use sweet-sounding phrases, as he is in the habit of doing, in advocacy of the line of action that he recommends. He has been in the happy and fortunate position of living all his life in a calm political atmosphere. From my experience of political life, I am not prepared to leave my rights as a member of this Senate to the &#34; keen sense of justice &#34; of any majority of it. Our standing orders are a printed document, which enables honorable senators to know exactly what are, their rights and privileges. They stand there in black and white. Any senator has as much right under them as any other, whether sitting behind the Government or in opposition. It ought not to be left in the power of any majority at any time, whether they have a &#34; keen sense of justice &#34; or a desire to do injustice, to rob any senator of his rights and privileges. Surely the Postmaster-General has not yet allowed to die out of his memory what a &#34; keen sense of justice&#34; means in a heated political atmosphere. If this standing order is passed, in all probability I shall take advantage of it at some time to apply the closure to some particular member, though I shall not require it to be applied to me. If other people are going to use it, I shall be justified in using it upon others, though I certainly think we can do better without it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> was sitting in opposition in the Queensland Parliament, together with my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> and myself, we did not discover any &#34;keen sense of justice&#34; in the mere majority opposed to us. We found that every standing order that could be twisted and stretched in any way whatever to deprive us of our right of expressing our opinions on the floor of the House was used by the Chairman and carried out by the majority, because we were in a minority. It is not fair to ask us to depend on the good-will and charity of a majority of the Senate. By allowing the closure to operate in this way, a simple majority of one, even though the attendance might be only one above, a bare quorum, might be able to punish any group of senators who had not offended in any way whatever. Take a case that occurred only to-day. We had a discussion on these very standing orders consisting largely of a duel between members of the happy family from South Australia. It resulted in a drawn battle. I believe both the combatants drew blood. It might easily happen that some senators or a majority of those present might lose patience with such a duel and might use the closure. With what result <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> That every other honorable senator, although not offending in the slightest degree might be deprived of the right of expressing any opinion on the merits of the case at issue. Once the closure motion is carried the question is decided, and&#34; the mouths of the whole of the members of the Senate are closed. I object to being subjected to a drastic punishment when I am not an offender. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has given a case in justification of this proposal. He tells us that on one occasion, in the South Australian Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> set to work to adduce a number of reasons why he intended to oppose a particular measure. .He numbered those reasons, and after two hours he was still engaged in stating number one and had not approached number two. God only knows how long he would have been before he got to number five ! Therefore it was wise, argued <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> to have a rule of this kind to stop senators, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> from &#39; getting as far as reason number five. It might be wise on such an occasion to punish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> for wilfully wasting time and obstructing public business, but there is no reason whatever why unoffending senators should be punished for his offence. It is also to be remarked that the offending senator who calls down this drastic provision is not effectively punished at all, because it is impossible to move the closure until the offending senator has completed his offence. . Therefore the guilty escapes and the innocent are punished. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot conceive of any reason why any honorable senator should be afraid of the majority of the Senate. It appears to me that any one who puts himself in that position has a guilty conscience. Those who are afraid of a majority will, I suppose, object to being turned out at the next election, unless there is a two-thirds majority against them. That would be a splendid idea ! Next time they would want to increase the majority to nine-tenths, and after that I suppose they would wish to provide that they should represent the minority. There is no common sense about the idea. I cannot conceive that any honorable senator is on sound ground in objecting to a decision by the majority. I trust that the Senate will adopt the standing order. </para>

                        <para>- Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> I am astonished that our democratic and radical members in the labour corner refuse to bow to a majority in the Senate. Almost everything we do is done by a majority, even though it may be only a majority of one, and our honorable friends opposite are quite inconsistent in insisting that a two-thirds majority shall be necessary to carry the question, &#34; That the Committee do now divide.&#34; A question, &#34;That the Chairman report progress,&#34; or &#34; That the Chairman leave the chair,&#34; is carried by a majority of one, and yet it may have the effect of blocking the whole policy of a Government, and may make and unmake a Government. If honorable senators are sick of listening to matter which is not practical politics, we are told that a majority of one is not to be sufficient to stop the continued waste of time. The Senate should have absolute control over its own business. We hear many references to the &#34;gag,&#34; but my experience is that if the &#34;gag&#34; could be put upon each of us to some extent, it would be better for the conduct of parliamentary business. If ever the parliamentary machine collapses and does not do justice, it will probably be on account of the excessive amount of talking indulged in. If I had my way I should limit the speeches of honorable senators, and also of Ministers.1 I should be pleased to consent to a limitation myself, because I believe I should then deliver more condensed speeches, and speeches with more in them. I think we should retain absolute power by majority to say as a Senate that we have had enough discussion upon a particular question. And if honorable senators will bring forward extraneous subjects we should be able to say in the same way that we do not desire to discuss certain subjects. </para>

I have had a good deal of experience of a similar standing order, and I found it work exceedingly well, I was for ten years in a House with a membership of 24-, and even there debates were sometimes continued without any useful purpose in view. It is a proper thing for those elected to transact the business of the country to be placed in a position to stop obstruction of that character. I have known the motion, &#34; That the House do now divide,&#34; to be put and subsequently withdrawn when it has been found that one or two members have been especially anxious to speak. But where there is a deliberate purpose to prolong a debate unnecessarily we are perfectly justified in adopting the best means to prevent it. </para>

I am contending that the rights of a minority in the Senate should mot be at the tender mercy of the temper which the majority &#39;may be in at any particular time. Honorable senators speak of other honorable senators as having guilty consciences, and as being afraid to trust the justice and fair play of their fellow senators. I have already said that I have proved what the sense of justice of fellow members of Parliament is worth by a personal experience, which has been a lengthy, and, to some extent, a painful one. The veriest child in the community who sticks his hand into the fire -and gets it burned, learns by experience not to put his hand in the fire again. Possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has always been in the happy position- of being with the majority, and has never been called upon to suffer. The honorable senator represents absolutely the wrong class to have ever been subjected to the injustice this standing order provides for. I have been astonished that Senator Drake, who has been through precisely the same experience as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> and myself, has not raised his voice with those of the colleagues with whom he was associated in the Queensland Parliament. From my experience in the Queensland Parliament, I would as soon trust myself alone at midnight with a gang of burglars as trust to the sense of fair play and justice of certain members of that Parliament. We found that they were capable of torturing and twisting every standing order, not only to gag us, but to put us outside the House, and if our election had had to be determined by their interpretation of standing orders their keen sense of fair play and justice would have prevented even our nomination for election. When there is a keen difference between political parties the sense of fairness and justice in either party is never very keen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has said that it would be a good thing if honorable senators all round could be prevented from talking so much or sp loosely upon every subject that comes up for discussion. With that I absolutely agree. But this standing order is intended to apply only to the minority, and it never can apply to the majority. So long as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> continues to sit with the majority he will only have the pleasure of applying the gag, and will never have to undergo the discomfort of having it fitted on himself. As the Senate is constituted it might very well happen that a combination of honorable senators representing two of the States could absolutely close the mouths of the representatives of any one State on which they might have some design. That is a kind of thing for which we certainly should not specially provide, in our standing orders. We should stand as a minority in relation to our standing orders as any citizen of the Commonwealth stands in relation to the law governing the country. </para>

                            <para>- Then it must have been used more frequently than twice. On the first occasion I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> moved the motion immediately after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> had spoken. Then I have a very vivid recollection of another time when it was used against the Government, and certainly not because members supporting the Government had been doing too much talking. It was used not for the purpose of preventing them speaking, but for the purpose of taking a division in a thin House. Late at night there were twelve honorable senators present in the Chamber who wished to go to a division, and there were eleven on the Government side who were not prepared to go to a division. The motion that the Senate do now divide was then moved and carried on division by twelve against eleven. </para>

Having done that it seems rather surprising that they should express so much indignation at what is regarded as a base and brutal majority overriding the rights of the minority. Surely the minority of eleven on that occasion had some rights as against the majority of twelve; but those gentlemen, no doubt, considered that they were discharging a public duty in using this particular weapon. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DAWSON</inline>(Queensland). - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has said that this particular provision was applied last session against the Government, and has asserted that honorable senators who sit in the same corner as myself did not at that time manifest the indignation we are manifesting now. But we are now framing permanent standing orders,, and if we do not now object to what we deem objectionable we must for ever after hold our peace. We should then have no right to protest when the standing order was applied. Last session we adopted temporary standing orders, and it was not then considered wise to discuss the rules, but to accept them on trust. We have worked under those standing orders for one session, and have found this provision at any rate objectionable.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> in response to an interjection from me, said he considered the exercise of this standing order last session as grossly unfair ; and in doing that he admitted that the exercise of a standing order of the kind leads to unfairness, otherwise injustice.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> however, is now in favour of the standing order, not because he believes in its justice, but because it was. used against him last session ; and now ina spirit of retaliation he seeks to make it permanent. </para>

                            <para>- I then pointed out. that the standing order itself was objectionable, but said that if it were allowed to remain, we, in common with other senators,, would probably use it. It must be distinctly understood that we are not contending that the Senate should not have some power to curtail debate, but that that power should not be placed in the hands of one senator. There ought to be a provision similar to that. found in other Legislatures,- so that when the closure is applied it shall be with the consent of at least two-thirds of the senators present. Indeed, I would go further, and say that the two-thirds should not be less than one-third of the whole Senate. Surely it is not too much to ask those who are great sticklers for the standing order, to show some reason for it, and if they cannot, to let it go by the board. On our side, we have clearly shown very good reason why such a power should not be exercised by one senator. </para>

                            <para>- There will not be much alteration if many are of the same mind as the honorable senator. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said, that the small States have equal representation with the large States ; but that only applies to the present Senate. Under section 7 of the Constitution new States may be created, and the Senate has the power to increase or decrease the number of representatives, providing that the original States each retain six. Under that section a small State may be created with only three representatives ; and we may easily imagine what could happen then. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> says, the whole Senate gets thoroughly sick of a discussion, surely it would be possible, with, say, eighteen senators present, to get thirteen to agree to a motion under this standing order. The same honorable senator said that it does not much matter either way. </para>

                            <para>- The majority must rule, and we always take that view at election times. But the majority rule is then applied only after full and adequate discussion of the programmes of the candidates, and there is no application of the &#34;gag.&#34; This standing order, although it merely refers to a division in Committee, deserves all the opprobrious epithets that can be applied to it. When I was saying something about the reputation of the Queensland Legislature, it was suggested that I was romancing, and ought to be able to write a book ; but is it not a fact that honorable senators, since the standing orders were first produced, have received a page of the most drastic provisions ever submitted in a Legislature, dealing with infringements of . the order and privileges of the Senate ? On this point I refer honorable senators <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Standing Order 428 and those following it, which are provisions originally introduced in the House of Commons to meet such occasions as that on which Colonel Sanderson, M.P., and other honorable members indulged in a free fight, and generally upset the equilibrium of the Chamber.- These standing orders are introduced here because honorable senators have an idea that at some time I, or other senators of similar disposition to myself, may make things uncomfortable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake&#39;s</inline> reason, as representative of the Government, for supporting this standing order is that at one time we in this part of the Senate, after giving most unswerving support to the Government, found it desirable to once disagree with them and carry a motion under the rule. Because we did &#39; that, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is going to apply the &#34; gag &#34; to us for all time. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> forgets all about the experience of the Opposition in the Queensland Parliament - an experience never suffered in any Parliament of Australia - and only has an unhappy remembrance of what occurred here last session. The honorable senator, who has a many-sided character, objects to us in this corner, because we are not a lot of Nazarenes who turn the other cheek when struck. This standing order was exercised against us at a very early period, by either a strong supporter of the Government or a member of the Opposition, and when we found the weapon used, we thought we would give others a taste of the same treatment, in order that we might at some future time receive support in our endeavour to alter the provision. .We have all along said that we object to the closure, and while there is a hope that honorable senators will give way and take the same view as we do, we have a right to ask for fuller discussion. The majority in favour of the Pacific Island Labourers Bill has been described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as a majority of only one or two. </para>

Were an opinion a personal possession of no value except to the owner : if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply, a private injury, it. would make some difference whether the injury was inflicted on lv on a few persons, or on many. But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of all opinion is that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation ; those who dissent from the opinion still more than those who hold it. </para>

                            <para>- It may hurt me. I am reminded of what occurred when we were considering the Tariff Bill. My action was not approved by several honorable senators. On one occasion I was discussing at some length a proposition, and when I appealed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to stay and listen to some of the important arguments I had to offer, he said that he had had enough of the discussion, and he went away. He thought it was absurd on my part to proceed in that way, but I feel sure that honorable senators will now admit that if we had allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and his followers to take their own course with the schedule they would have attempted to alter the duty on almost every item. It was was only because a few honorable senators freely discussed the items that they said - &#34;We will not bother about a number of the items with which we originally intended to deal. We shall allow them, to go as they are,&#34; and instead of about 175 requests for amendments being sent to the other House, only about 100 were sent. I consider that I fulfilled a public duty in occupying the attention of the Committee as I did, even though some honorable senators deprecated what they considered to be a waste of time.. A time may come when similar legislation will be brought forward. </para>
