                        <para>- If the measure of value of the arguments against the Naval Agreement were to be determined by the length of the speeches in which they have been developed, I confess that I should rise with a considerable amount of misgiving, because I should feel that the combat was quite unequal, and that the conditions were so harsh that I could not subscribe to them. We have no reason to complain of any want of diversity of argument on the part of the opponents of the Bill. We have heard arguments, for instance, from two senators whose opinions on the question of loyalty to the home country, or on the broader question of Imperalism, are no doubt as wide asunder as I suppose the opinions of any two senators could be. We heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> declare, as we all knew he would, that his chief reason for offering opposition to the Bill was that, from his point of view,' the Commonwealth could render greater service to the home country, could be more useful in the sort of alliance which exists between us, if we developed our own naval power. With that argument I suppose that I, and many supporters of the Bill, are to a certain extent in sympathy. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> in that most frank and fearless way which characterizes most of his remarks, said outright that one of the objects he hoped to attain by resisting and defeating this proposal' was the severance of Australia from the mother country. I' instance those two senators because they are as wide apart in their real feelings on this matter as any two persons could be. We have also heard a somewhat long speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> who, I suppose, may properly be said to have taken a practical interest in all the details of this agreement, and who might, I think, have been expected to propose an alternative scheme. The opponents of the Bill seem to me to place themselves in a most unenviable position. They are full of criticism, from every quarter and in every way, but, though I listened with that amount of attention which may fairly be expected in so long a debate, I have not yet gathered from any opponent of the Bill that ho is prepared to suggest any improvement on this proposal. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely. W© have more than one choice before us. First of all, before we assent to the Bill, we may fairly institute a comparison ' between the benefits which would accrue to the Commonwealth under the provisions of this agreement and those which we have been enjoying under the existing agreement. It will not be gainsaid for a moment that the proposed agreement is a vast improvement on the old one. Therefore, to a certain extent, we start off with a predilec-tion in favour of the proposed agreement. I recognise that it is- a, distinct improvement, and to that extent it will meet with ray hearty support. I also recognise that the whole of the argument is not confined to a comparison between the agreements. The main argument has, of course, been directed to the principles involved, to the questions of whether we should enter into an agreement at all, or whether we should enter upon a sphere of naval activity and originate and develop our own Navy. When we are dealing with the question of an army, I suppose the first condition is men. When we are considering the question of .a navy, the first condition in these modern times is capital. I could understand such rounded phrases as " this Naval Agreement striking at the -foundation of our national life," and "it involves. the surrender of the right of the people to protect their shores" if we were dealing with matters affecting the army, if we were asked' to pay for men to come here and protect us.. But what we are. asked to subscribe to is <inline font-style="italic">uri</inline> agreement providing for annual payment which will dispense with the necessity of the Commonwealth indulging in a very large capital expenditure - that is the difference. I should sympathize at once with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> if we were dealing with the army. I should recognise then, and I am sure every one would recognise, that it would be desirable to institute a form of national defence ; in other words, that we should be prepared to find our own men, and should not hire men to fight for us, At the- same time, I should like- to criticise some of the phrases which have been used, and which have commanded a certain amount of attention ; for instance, the phrase - " the agreement will strike at. the foundation of our national life." While I confess that it is a well-rounded phrase, I am utterly unable to see its applicability to present circumstances. I cannot see where the agreement -strikes at the foundation of our -national life. I cannot see that we are in danger of losing our self-respect as a nation. Nor can I see any justification for- the sentence - ".By adopting the agreement we are adopting a course which involves the surrender of the right of the people to protect their shores." If I read the agreement with any degree of accuracy, the first thing </para>

                            <para>- One of the points about the agreement, which I admit at once pleases me very much, is that it gives us that right. Practically stress .is laid on the fact that we are at full liberty to do what we like in that regard. If I had the opportunity I should certainly be most willing to very largely reduce the expenditure on our land forces, and to apply a considerably larger sum to coast and' harbor defence. I think it would be a very sound thing for the Commonwealth to do. Roughly speaking, we are asked to vote £850,000 for- defence, which includes £200 000 for this naval subsidy. The balance of £650,000 is-, I understand, to be so expended that only £43,000 will be devoted to coast and harbor defence. I am not going to quarrel now with that decision, but I again affirm my great desire to increase the expenditure -on coast and harbor defence. Another phrase which arrested my attention, and which I thought singularly discordant and ill applied, was used by Senator Cameron when be said that by adopting this agreement we should make our own men alien in sympathy with us. He- urged that the men would be subject to the command of Imperial officers, and he regarded it apparently as an absolute corollary that they would, therefore, necessarily become alien in sympathy with the Commonwealth. The words seemed to me to be singularly inapt as coming ' from the honorable senator. We all admire him for the work that he did in South Africa. We all know that the Australian forces in South Africa practically served under Imperial officers, and I cannot find that because they went to that country to help. England in a war they returned to Australia with sympathies alienated ' from us, and from our ideals of national life. The thing seems to me a palpable absurdity. And if that did not happen in South Africa why should it happen here <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> I was totally unable to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> in his argument. Apparently no one in the Senate quarrels with the amount of the contribution. On all hands it is acknowledged that the £200,000 is an insignificant item - is indeed really inadequate as part payment for what we are getting. It is  is admitted that England's generosity is magnificent, and that for this £200,t.00 a year we shall get infinitely more than we could possibly get by an expenditure of a similar sum in any other way. </para>

                            <para>- It would almost appear - if one were to follow closely the arguments of some honorable senators - , that if we were asked to make a fair and proper contribution for what we were going to get - say, £500,000 a year - this agreement would not have so many opponents. I cannot share the view of those, who think that the Commonwealth is going to be humiliated because England has been generous. If Great Britain says to us : " We will give you this defence for £200,000," I do not think we should regard ourselves as being placed in a tributary and dependent position. But that is the argument which seems to lie in the mouth of more than one honorable senator. They think that the roots of our national life are being endangered because we are being made tributaries, and that we are being humiliated by having so much thrown upon us which we are not properly paying for. Al] these arguments appear to me to be absolutely fallacious. There is a further argument that has found its way into the debate, and that is that this contribution represents, to a certain extent, taxation without representation. </para>

                            <para>- We could not. If we reduce the argument to its extreme it will be seen that it reduces government to a. farce. Following upon that argument, we have heard the contention raised that this is a question which ought to be postponed ;. that seeing that this is the last session of an expiring Parliament the people ought- to be consulted with a view of eliciting what their opinion is. I entirely dissent. So long as I remain in Parliament I shall never allow myself to be a mere delegate. I shall reserve to myself the right of originating a line of thought ; I am not going to wait until the people have told me in detail exactly what I am to do after I come into Parliament. It would be absurd to come into Parliament with one's hands so tightly tied as that. For obvious reasons it would be improper to say that no question could arise for our solution that had not been previously debated by the people, and upon which the people had not made a definite pronouncement to bind their representatives. Such a contention is ridiculous. Those who say that no question should come before Parliament until the people have had an opportunity of expressing a decided opinion upon it, adduce an argument which, if carried to its fullest extent, would have the effect that practically speaking no question that had not been set out in the Government manifesto, or which had not been laid under similar conditions before the people, could be decided by Parliament without a referen-dum. Is any one of us prepared to subscribe to such a principle as that <inline font-style="italic">f</inline></para>

                            <para>- I entirely "dissent from that view. I think that a Government are abundantly justified in departing from their manifesto. When a Government issues its manifesto it naturally includes in it many things which are likely to attract the attention of the people, and upon which the Ministry would like to have an expression of popular opinion. But such a programme is by no means exhaustive or exclusive. Other questions may be made the subject of consideration in Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but I would never be a mere delegate as the honorable senator is. Seeing that so much time has been taken up. with regard to this agreement, and that, as I have said, I am not going to enter into an unequal Competition with other senators, I do not in tend to speak at greater length. But I should like briefly to analyze what are the advantages which the agreement confers upon us, and why it meets with my approval. First of all, one of the advantages of the agreement is that by the conjunction and co-operation of such a naval force as -we are going to have, with other branches of the navy in the China and India seas, we shall be put in a position of more complete defence than we. could put ourselves in for the next hundred years if we endeavoured to build a navy of our own. That is one of the chief reasons why I approve of the agreement. I approve of it also because it gives us splendid opportunities for having our own seamen trained. One of the distinctive features of the new agreement, as compared with the old one, is in the facilities it offers - and indeed the inducements, if we like to use that word - for the training of a body of Australian seamen. The third reason is that which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, that full power is reserved to us to do what we like in regard to coastal and harbor defence. When we have an agreement giving us these three facilities it would be absurdly foolish and quixotic for us to refuse to accept it. We should recognise in accepting it that we are doing nothing to sap our national life, but everything we can do to protect our country and to strengthen the Empire, while we are also conferring advantages upon ourselves by being enabled to train up a body of seamen of our own. For these reasons, quite apart from the financial considerations which I leave untouched, I intend to give this Bill my support. </para>

                            <para>- This is a verv important proposal, and it involves the expenditure of something like £2,000,000. I hope that there will be no attempt on the part of any honorable senator to curtail discussion in any way. The Government should not attempt to carry out what was their evident intention on Thursday last, to close the discussion by applying the cloture. The fullest debate should be permitted. I know that the members of the Government were running about, last week with copies of the standing orders in their possession, endeavouring to find some method of rushing the Bill through the Chamber. That conduct is not characteristic of a Government that is willing to submit its proposals to the freest possible criticism. I come now to the point touched upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> as to the authority of the Government to bring forward legislation of this kind. It is the well-known parliamentary practice that a Government should always have a mandate for the legislation which it puts before Parliament. I remember having read discussions which have taken place in the House of Commons, when the members of the Opposition have charged the leader of the House with having no authority from the people to introduce 'certain legislation at that juncture. </para>

There were very few candidates who stood for election in 1901 who, in speaking of defence, did &gt; not refer to the necessity for a small permanent staff and a citizen soldiery. There was no question of a naval subsidy at the time. I do not think that the question received much consideration .from candidates, except on the lines that we must have a naval defence based upon the principle that our own citizens should be the defenders.

Whilst declining to state what course would betaken in such circumstances, the Prime Minister pointed out that Parliament could not alter an agreement made between two parties, though it could make suggestions as to another agreement. He did not think, however, that any amendment would be made. The Prime Minister's optimism does not find an echo in the opinions of some of his most influential supporters. </para>

                        Barton allowed these paragraphs to appear in the newspapers without* any contradiction, and I say that they unduly influenced the minds of members of the Federal Parliament, and led them to think that if they agreed to pass the second reading of the Bill they would be permitted to make some suggestions for the alteration of the terms of the agreement. What happened
                        <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                        The second reading was carried, with the assistance of that great political seal, who is equally at home on political land or water,  that champion  political high diver,  and ground  and lofty tumbler, the Right Honorable G. H. Reid. When the second reading was carried with that right honorable gentleman's assistance, an attempt was made to vary the terms of . the agreement, but
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline>
                        Barton, having counted heads, said, " If any alteration is made in this agreement, the Government can take only one course." I remember being present in the House of Representatives when the right honorable gentleman said this, and I am able to congratulate the leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives upon having availed himself of an opportunity to offer a few observations on the stand taken by the Prime Minister. The latter, when he knew that heads had been counted, became very courageous, and he said - "I will resign if any alteration is made; I will resign if you reject this agreement." I ask whether that was not an attempt, at any rate, to bind the Commonwealth Parliament to the agreement? If it was not theoretically, had it not practically the effect of inducing a number of members of the House of Representatives, who were desirous that the present Government should retain office in order that certain legislation might be passed, to refrain from attempting to alter the terms of the agreement, because
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline>
                        Barton had stated that if they did so he would resign ? I ask honorable senators to contrast

                        Barton's conduct with that of

                        Laurier was about to go to the Imperial Conference. I suppose that the Members of Parliament in Canada had observed the effect of London hospitality on certain statesmen who had gone to England from Australia.

                        <para>It will be open to all the members of this Confer- 'ence to bring to its consideration any subject he may please. We all know that the First Minister of New Zealand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> proposes to bring to its attention the subject of Imperial defence ; and, if we are to credit the newspaper reports which have appeared recently, the Premier of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bunton,</inline> has rather taken the same course we* have, and deprecated the introduction of any such subject. At all events, we shall be there at the invitation of the Imperial Government to discuss all the subjects mentioned in the despatch I have a read, and we propose to discuss them in the spirit of the reply we have given. That is to say, while we are prepared to discuss this question of Imperial defence, neither my colleagues nor myself believe that any useful purpose can be served by such discussion. It is of no use whatever at this stage of the proceedings, on the floor of this Canadian Parliament, to try to deceive ourselves' as to what is intended by this subject of Imperial defence. If it be intended simply to discuss what part Canada is prepared to take in her defence, or what share of the burden must fall upon us as being responsible for the safety of the land in which we were born, to which we owe our allegiance, and in which all our hopes and fears are centred, certainly we shall always be prepared to discuss that subject Nor do I believe that we need any prompting on that subject, or . that our attention should be specially called to it. Even this session the Government has given its pledge to the House that it is prepared, and to the full extent, to carry out its duty upon that score, and to that declaration, the Government received the support of both sides. But there is a school abroad, a school in England and in Canada, a school which is perhaps represented on the' floor of this Parliament, which wants to briqg Canada into the vortex of militarism that is now the curse and blight of Europe. I am not prepared to indorse any such policy. . </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable and learned senator does not know it, everybody else seems to know it, and it is published in the press. The other afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> used language and terms such as "dastardly" and "cowardly," and I therefoi'e did not see anything unparliamentary in the use of the word "betrayed." However, I withdraw it. I wish to say that the memorandum of the Minister for Defence in Canada is quite different from the memorandum on defence prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, and presented to the Imperial authorities, in what I consider to be a most irregular way. I refer to the memorandum in which the right honorable gentleman said that the proper contribution of Australia to Imperial defence would be something like £5,000,000 a year. The memorandum presented by the Canadian Minister of Defence reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>The Ministers desire to point out that their objections arise not so much from the expense involved as from the belief that the acceptance of the proposals would entail an important departure from the principles of colonial self-government. Canada values highly the measure of local independence which has been granted it from time to time by the Imperial authorities, and which has been so productive of beneficial results, both as respects the material progress of the country and the strengthening of the ties that bind it to the Motherland. But while for these reasons the Canadian Ministers are obliged to withhold their assent to the propositions of the Admiralty and the War Office, they fully appreciate the duty of the Dominion as it advances in population and wealth to make more liberal outlay for those necessary preparations of self defence which every country  has to assume and bear. </para>

                    <para>Without referring tq anything done outside purely Canadian contingents, it is worthy of mention that the first contingent under Colonel Otter, composed of 1,000 men, drawn from every section of Canada, embraced within 4,000 miles of territory lying between the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans, was organized, fully equipped, and embarked within <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> pei ied of fourteen days ; and that a second  contingent of  1 ,200 men, composed of field artillery and mounted rifles, was fully organized, equipped and embarked within the space of three weeks........ In conclusion, the Ministers repeat that while the Canadian Government are obliged to dissent from the measures proposed, they fully appreciate the obligation of the Dominion to make expenditures for the purpose of defence in proportion to the increasing population and wealth of the country. They are willing that those expenditures should be so directed as to relieve the taxpayer of the  Mother country from some of the burdens which he now bears, and they have the strongest desire to carry out their defence schemes in cooperation with the Imperial authorities and under the advice of experienced Imperial officers, so far as this is consistent with the principle of local selF-government, which has proved so great a factor in the promotion of Imperial unity. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is the memorandum of defence put before the Conference by the Canadian Ministers, and it indicates the tone of the memorandum which should have come from the Minister for Defence of Australia. I am sure that honorable senators will not for a moment say that Canada is any less loyal than is Australia. Here I desire to ask honorable senators who have been charging those who oppose this proposal with being anti-Brisish, whether they describe the Canadians as anti-British because they have opposed this proposal ? I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who is one of those who have been guilty of making these charges against us, is himself a Canadian. The Canadians proved their loyalty during the Boer war by sending no less than 8,400 men to South Africa, at a cost of £620,000. In the face of that, surely they are not to be accused of disloyalty because they refuse to fall in with the terms of the naval agreement which has been proposed. </para>

The Colonies of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand sent between them no less than 30,863 men to the Boer war, at a. cost of £1,859,218. In passing, let me say that when honorable senators are so anxious to overload the naval and military estimates in this way, they should remember that Canada, with her population of 5,000,000, expends only 2s. per head on defence, although she is so near the theatre of a possible war. Some honorable senators may say that Canada is perfectly safe in having the United States next door, but the United States are not always on the best of terms with Canada. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> S..

                    <para class="block">If there is any reason or force in the contention of honorable senators that we should pay large sums of money to the Imperial Navy - and the proposed subsidy is a large sum for us to pay - I say those reasons must apply with equal force to the position of Canada, and yet we know that as a matter of fact they do not apply at all. Another objection I have to the agreement is that Ministers are making no provision whatever for the naval force which we already own and control in the Commonwealth. When they tell members of the Commonwealth Parliament that there is nothing in the agreement to prevent our establishing the nucleus of an Australian Navy they are but acting in a misleading and deceptive way, which is quite in keeping with- their whole course of conduct throughout these negotiations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> said there was nothing in the agreement to prevent the establishment of an Australian Navy, but I do not think the honorable and learned senator can have read the agreement. When he was discussing the question the other evening, I referred him to the preamble. The honorable and learned senator did what is usually done by the lawyers in the Senate. When asked a ticklish question they answer - " I shall come to that later on," and the later on is in the sweet by-and-by. The preamble to the agreement reads - </para>

I know the names of two shareholders and directors who occupy high positions in the land. When the Federal Parliament hesitated to send contingents away they were up in arms und said "Why send 2,000 men? Send 5,000 men." Undoubtedly their object was to try to send many men away for the purpose of getting rid of their surplus beef and i mutton . There is another aspect of this question, and it was suggested to me the other day by the report in a Melbourne newspaper of a discussion in a shire council on a fever which was infecting 'some of the animals - </para>

There is no comparison between our proposal for . forming the nucleus of an Australian Navy and the proposal that there shall be spent on the British Navy £35,000,000 for the current year. It was stated here quite recently by one of the emissaries sent out by the Colonial Office to persuade this country to go in for an increased naval subsidy, that one of the reasons why the United Kingdom was undertaking such a large naval expenditure was that other nations were competitors with them in building war vessels and in piling up their military and naval expenditure. Let us see how far that is true. The nations that the speaker had in mind were Russia, France and Germany. Let us find out the reason why the Germans have been increasing their navy lately.

Admiral Tirpitz, exhibited marvellous boldness, combined with tad, in dealing with the Reichstag, always unwilling to vote the necessary supplies. It is interesting to note that M.

The incident was utilized to the full by the German Government to bring home to the German nation the absolute necessity for a strong fleet ; and, in M.

                    <para class="block">We thus see how the military and naval alarmists in any country are able to gain their points. The inefficient War authorities in the old country commit what has been described as '" an amazing blunder " in seizing two German vessels on suspicion. The German alarmists adduce this incident as a reason for increasing German military and naval expenditure, and when the German Parliament votes the sum necessary for the increase, the alarmists in England point to the fact as a reason why Great Britain should increase her naval and military expenditure. England's greatest hour of trial was during the Boer War, when something like 250,000 men were underarms in South Africa, and every civilized nation was against her policy. That was the time when she was most exposed to attack on the part of foreign nations. If there was any nation on the face of the globe that would be so foolish as to adopt so suicidal a policy, that was the time, when England's hands were occupied in other parts of the globe, for them to make their attack. Even the United States, with which country we are told by one gentleman that a war would be an unpardonable crime, was against the policy of England. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that point. I want to show honorable senators that this is panic legislation, and that there is no ground for the alarming idea in the minds of some people that both England and Australia are liable to attack. The feeling towards England . has changed, if we may judge from the signs of the times. Quite recently we find the President of the French Republic visiting England and being received very cordially. We find 100 Frenchmen visiting London with the view of trying to arrange for some treaty of arbitration between the two countries. Since the Boer war Great Britain has entered into an alliance with Germany, though, of course, that alliance did not find much favour with the British people. But it shows that there is a better feeling on the part of those who govern England towards Germany. </para>

                    <para>SenatorHIGGS. - No; the honorable senator forgets that the Venezuelan affair  and the Anglo-German alliance was long after the period I have referred to. I have spoken of the feeling in the United States in 1900, just a year after the Boer war started. One of the emissaries sent out to this country to induce people to forget the land that gave them birth referred to the wars which ended in the year I815 as - </para>

                    <para class="block">The speaker tried to make out that it was due to the wars which ended in 1815 that England was able to secure Australia for us, and that we ought for this reason to contribute £200,000 a year to the navy. But the fact is that we owe the undisputed possession of Australia to-day to the work of England's free colonists. In 1770 Great Britain wanted to tax her American subjects. She had remitted all the duties except the tax on tea, which it was desired to retain in order to show the American colonists that England reserved the light to tax them. </para>

                            <para>- I do think so for this reason. It has been urged as a reason why we should contribute towards the navy that we have inherited a country over which we have undisputed possession in consequence of the success of the British Army and Navy in certain directions. We are told that the British national debt was accumulated in consequence of . certain wars from which we have benefited. I want to show that we were not considered at all in reference to those wars, and that the debt has not been accumulated in any way owing to the need for defending Australia. </para>

                        <para>The reports brought home by Captain Cook completely changed the beliefs current in those days in . regard to Australia. From the time of Dampier it had been supposed that the whole of this continent must be the same flat and miserable desert as the part he described. 'Cook's, account, on the other hand, represented the eastern coast . as a country full of beauty and promise. . Now it so happened that shortly after Cook returned, the English nation had to deaL with a great difficulty in regard to its criminal. population. In 1776 the United States declared their independence and the English -then found that they could no longer send their convicts over to Virginia, as . they had formerly done. In a. short time "the gaols of England were crowded with  felons; it (became necessary to select a new place . for transportation, and. just as this (difficulty arose Captain Cook's voyages called attention to a land in every way suited for such . a purpose, both by reason  of its fertility and of : its great distance. Viscount . Sydney therefore determined to -send out a party to Botany Bay in order tojoondtv convict settlement there ; and in May, . 1787, a fleet was ready to sail.

                            <para>- I propose to answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> interjection later on. I say that the people who built up South Australia and all the Australian States were the pioneers of this land, the explorers in the first place, and afterwards those who had the courage to follow them. It was only when the free colonists, forced to come Australia through the poverty and misery of the old country, settled here and made the country a field for the investment of money, that it' came to have some importance in the eyes of the people who are now endeavouring to make, us pay this subsidy. To show what Australia is doing for England at the present time, the vast amount of money that we have to contribute every year, and that we cannot afford to pay any more, I ask honorable senators to listen to this from <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan' 8</inline> statistics - </para>

                        <para>Australasia ranks amongst the debtor nations. At the close of 1901 its people owed to persons outside its boundaries, or, more correctly speaking, there was invested in it by non-residents, and owing by its various Governments, a sum approximating to £387,772,000, or £84 per inhabitant. Of this large sum £1 40,420.000 represents the private investments, and £241,352,000 the outstanding liabilities of. the States and local governing bodies. More important in some respects than the corpus of the debt are the annual payments made in respect thereof. These can be stated with some exactitude. The yearly interest paid on account of the State debts to other than Australasian creditors amounts to £7,991,000, and on account of local government debts to £642,000, while the income from private investments may be stated at £7,228,000, and the absentee incomes and return on shares held in London, £400,000. These various sums make up a total of £16,261,000, which is the tribute paid yearly by Australasia to London. </para>

                        <para>In considering the question of the annual payment made by Australasia to Great Britain, which is its sole creditor, it is important to have distinctly in view the fact that part of this income is payable irrespective of production, and part only arises where there has been antecedent production. In the first of these categories is the charge on State and municipal borrowing to the amount already stated (£8,633,000), and from two-fifths to a half of the income from private investments, or, in round figures, £2,890,000 - the two taken together making a sum of £11,523,000, or £2 10s. 4d. per inhabitant, which must be exported entirely irrespective of the condition of productive industry. It may here be remarked that there is another source of drainage from these States to be considered in estimating the tributary stream flowing from Australasia to England - that is the income of absentee colonists, which, in 1901. probably reached £400,000, a figure very greatly below that of previous years. The total payments to outside creditors or investors during 1901 may be summarized as follow : - Payments on account of interest in respect of State or municipal borrowing, £1.1 ,523,00&lt;" return dependent on antecedent production, £4,338,000 ; absentee incomes, £400,000- a total of £16,261,000. Of the sum just given, £.13,039,000 is paid by the States of the Commonwealth, and £3,220,000 by New Zealand. Under the condition of equilibrium between the introduction and withdrawal of capital, as already demonstrated, Australasia would show an excess of exports, representing the interest on State and other public loans and the tribute due to private investors. This export for .1901 was about £.16,261,000, and it is therefore plain that Australasia might increase its indebtedness to over £.15,000,000 in any one year, and at the same time show an equality between its exports and imports. With this explanation in mind, it will not be difficult to understand how, in spite of the fact that during the last thirty-one years the indebtedness of Australasia was increased by £314,816,000, the money or money's worth actually received, as represented b}' the excess of imports, was less than that sent away by £4,910,000. Such is the operation of interest as affecting a debtor country. In further explanation of this view of the matter, the following figures are given. It will be seen that out of loans aggregating £206,990,000, a sum of only £25,211,000 reached Australasia, the balance of £181,779,000 being retained in London to meet interest charges, as a set-off against a similar sum which otherwise it would have been necessary to remit from Australasia. </para>

                    <para>I think honorable senators can glean from that quotation an idea of the enormous amount of wealth that goes from these shores to people resident in England, and it should convince them that we already pay enough without burdening the taxpayers of the Commonwealth in another £200,000 per annum. We have been charged with meanness because we say that in any case Great Britain must keep up her navy. Honorable senators say that we are very mean to propose to avail ourselves of the protection 1 of that navy without paying for it. But I say ive are paying for it. When we send away £16,000,000 in the shape of interest every year, we are paying for the protection that is afforded by that navy. This view was held by Earl Grey, who said - </para>

                    <para class="block">The annual value of the trade of Great Britain with foreign countries is £665,895,000; the total trade of the United Kingdom being £877,000,000. As stated in the report of the Conference, the British trade in the North Atlantic, between the United Kingdom and North America , amounts to upwards of £200,000,000 per annum, of which five-sixths is with the United States. I want to know from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> and other honorable senators who support the proposal for an increased contribution, whether England has not a similar interest in that £665,000,000 worth of trade with foreign countries to that which she has in her trade with Australia. If of the £50,000,000 of trade with Australia £16,000,000 represents interest, how much of the£665,000,000 represents interest due from foreign countries on loans raised in England ? That is a fair argument which supports the contention that if the Commonwealth of Australia and the. Colonies were wiped out of existence tomorrow, the United Kingdom would probably have to maintain a navy. I do not say that there would have to be such an enormous navy as there is at present, because I am satisfied there is another method of settling matters, a method which would entail nothing like the expenditure caused by the maintenance of the navy. A better method could be arranged at once if Britain and Germany would fall into line with other countries, and adopt a system of international arbitration. I am glad to find that my view as to what we in Australia do for the old country is supported by Lord Hampden, who was at one time Governor of New South Wales.

                            <para>- The other day I was charged with being anti-British, because I reminded honorable senators of the historical fact that England had turned her guns on her own sons and daughters in America. But when I am discussing England I wish to differentiate between the rulers and the people of that country. I am  heart and soul with the people of England, but I am opposed to the rulers and their policy. </para>

                            <para>- Public feeling is generally represented by the press, but in Australia to-day the press of Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane does not voice public opinion. And in England, at the time to which I am referring, public opinion could not have been ascertained without a referendum. I am reminded of the fact that ten or fifteen years after the war of American independence the idea was that the people of England were about to follow the . example of the people of France, and that was one of the reasons why the Governments of England were so ready to go to war when the latter country proclaimed a republic. </para>

                            <para>- My desire ' is to differentiate between the people and the rulers of England when I criticise adversely the British Government, I hope I shall not be accused of any desire to be unfair or disloyal. I honour the people of England because my people came from the old country, but I must always be permitted to express any adverse opinion I may hold as to the Government of England. The people of England have no chance of giving full expression to their views, because millions of them are not allowed a voice in the selection of legislators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eraser</inline> suggested that it would be most dreadful if the commerce of Australia were stopped. I do not see that such an occurrence would be so dreadful. In 1901 we exported some 33,000,000- lbs. weight of butter to enable people in London to buy it at lOd. per lb., while people in Australia were charged ls. 4d., with the result that a good many people in the States of the Commonwealth had to give their children dripping and cheap jam. In the same year we exported 24,000,000 bushels of breadstuff's to enable the people of England to buy wheat and other grain at 3s. 9d. a bushel, while we in Australia were charged 5s. and 6s. a bushel. We exported 1,000,000 cwt. of beef and 2,000,000 cwt. of mutton in order that people in London and South Africa might buy meat at a price fifty per cent, below that which we were called upon to pay in Australia. We exported £17,000,000 worth of wool and £12,000,000 worth of gold. Under these circumstances would it be such a dire calamity, after all, if Australian commerce were stopped? I do not suppose for one moment that our commerce ever will be stopped, but those who support the Bill are drawing all kinds of dreadful pictures. </para>

It is not only money that is required to produce effective forces, but it is the personal service of our countrymen all over the world. It is blood rather than gold that is the basis of every true force ; and to awaken the true spirit, the Government of each colony, the people of each colony, should manage, as far as possible, their local forces during time of peace. Unless they do so, the barden of cost will be irksome, and the interest of the people in their maintenance - which is a first factor for success - will not be evoked. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is very true. If we have to pay this £200,000 per annum, and if we dispose of even the few vessels we have at the present time, we shall certainly take away a lot of the interest which Australians feel in the navy. Our contribution should be in men, and we should train our men so that they may be available if the necessity for their services arises. The contributions which the colonies made at the time of the South African war are an earnest of what may be expected in the future, in the case of a just was, though I do not think that it matters much to Australians whether the war be just or unjust, because, if called upon, I believe they will go. Canada sent 8,400 men to South Africa at a cost of £620,000 ; New South Wales sent 6,208 men at a cost of £391,620 ;' Victoria sent 3,897 men at a cost of £138,327 ; Queensland sent 2,903 men at a cost of £203,164; South Australia sent 1,494 men at a cost of £82,068 ; Western Australia sent 1,165 men at a cost of £51,646 ; Tasmania sent 796 men at a cost of £38,000 ; and New Zealand sent 6,000 men at a cost of £334,000- a total of 30,863 men at a cost of £1,859,218. From Australia we sent 30,863 men, or a number equal to half of those engaged on the Boer side. </para>

That .territory is not .so large as Australia, and Child occupies a narrow -strip along the western coast. Some six months ago I had a conversation with Lieutenant Sarbarido of the Argentine Navy, and he told me that the ;South American Republics must keep up a large defence expenditure, because there -are constant disputes over border questions. If we in Australia were as divided in race and sentiment as the people of the South American 'Republics, our military and naval 'expenditure would no doubt be large. 'One can conceive that it would -not tee very long before .a border trouble might arise between New South Wales and Victoria, or between .South Australia and Victoria, over some. such -question as- .that of the riparian rights in the River Murray. If there were the same racial and sentimental differences between the people of Queensland and New South Wales as there 'ave between the Chilians and the people of Argentine, war might very easily -arise over Queensland possibly taking the view that 'the Tweed -and the Richmond districts naturally belong to that State, -and were unfairly cut off when the boundary was fixed. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> draws our attention to the navy and military expenditure of South American republics, we can reply that if a similar state of affairs existed in Australia, we should not be able to pay the 4 per 'cent, interest on the £4-00,000,000 which the English capitalists have lent to States Governments and private citizens.

It is very fortunate for us that modern history furnishes instances to support the view of those of us who favour a system of local defence.

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators have asked us to pay attention to the teachings of history, but I do not remember that any one has drawn attention to this historical parallel ; nor do they allude to the modern instance when a naval De Wet was able to inflict the greatest damage upon the commerce of the country against which he was fighting. Now I come to the experts, as referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> He said that all the experts are agreed. Let us consider who the experts are. One of them is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Sydenham Clarke, a gentleman who is said to have been a member of the Colonial Defence Committee, which recommended that the States of the Commonwealth should buy a lot of obsolete arms. These weapons were afterwards given to our South African contingents, and had to be abandoned by them the moment they reached the Cape. The experts, of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Sydenham Clarke is evidently one, thought at the time of the .

In reply he was informed that a new foreyard would be sent out, but before it was despatched, the authorities would like to know who had carried away the foreyard, what he had done with it, and where he had put it. </para>
                    <para class="block">This same Admiralty has, as one of its traditions, the fact that it objected to the use of steam on the ground that the smoke from the engines would blacken the sails of the vessels. This is the same authority, says the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Coivrier,</inline> of the 9th January, 1903- which in more recent times has preferred paint and gilt to efficiency in gunnery. </para>

                        <para>In the year 1887 a new series of heavy gun designs were produced in France of avery remarkable character as regards their length. Up to that time the standard length of guns was some 30 cals. , but the new French designs showed' a length of 2 cals. to 45 cals. The practical effect of the improvement of guns is to give to the present day weapon as nearly as possible twice the energy of its 30 cal. predecessor. </para>

Speaking at the eigth annual general meeting of the Navy League, held on Wednesday, 13th May, 190'3, at the Royal United Service Institution, Whitehall, S.W., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnold</inline> White criticised the Admiralty methods in these words - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>There are four points of policy on which the Admiralty deserve criticism, and should 'have been criticised, and criticised severely, by the civilians on the Executive. Committee. I name those four points, not in order of their importance, but in the reverse order. The first point upon which the Admiralty deserves censure is its absence of economy. Any man who has made anything like an intellectual study of the idea that lies behind the word "efficiency" knows that not only are efficiency and economy interdependent, hut that you cannot have efficiency without economy. They are inseparable. I have no time, in the few minutes at my disposal, to five you any details as to the absence of economy, ut I noticed the other day that a circular issued to the dockyards seriously warning the workmen that if they idled, or were in the habit of idling, that they would be suspended for a fortnight. But only a few months before, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir K.</inline> Anclry, Accountant-General to the Navy, had the audacity to tell the Select Committee of the House of Commons that the checks in force in the dockyards were absolutely satisfactory. I have recently paid eleven visits to the different dockyards, and while I am prepared to say that the dockyards could not be in better hands than the respective Admiralty Superintendents, who are brilliant administrators, I say there is no system that would satisfy a business man for a moment, and that the dockyards are in fact, the sink of John Bull's gold. <inline font-style="italic">[Senate comiled.]</inline> So long as they are in that state of disorganization where there is no responsibility - for the Admiralty is not responsible, the-dockyurds are not responsible, and the service afloat is not responsible - sofar from the watch-dog wagging his tail or purring, as the "Executive Committee seem inclined to do, you ought to tell the Admiralty they have no right to waste the substance of the British taxpayer. I will only give you three instances of this. The first is the <inline font-style="italic">SjMrtiale,</inline> the Original estimate for which was £518,000 ; it cost £633,000 and was five years and a half building. My second case is that of the <inline font-style="italic">Heccate,</inline> upon which the Admiralty have recently spent £9,000, and then put her up for sale. My third case is that of the <inline font-style="italic">Hercules.</inline> A few 3'enrs ago £80,000 was spent on this ship's machinery. The £80,000 thrown away on the <inline font-style="italic">Hercules would</inline> have given the bluejackets in the navy their rations six months ago. My last case is the <inline font-style="italic">Warrior,</inline> which was turned into a depot for torpedoes and has "been a sink of money. I could occupy you for an hour on the waste of money in the dockyards, but those are the only instances I have time to give. My second point is on the administration of the dockyards. We talk a great deal in the Navy League, and have done for ten years past, on the importance of construction of new ships. It is surely unnecessary to remind you that in the event of a war the dockyards are as necessary for the success of the British arms at sea as the ships. What is the position of the dockyards ? Machinery and appliances to save labour have been gradually neglected, because the supply of new and necessary machinery creates no particular demand on any particular day, and the result is that if you went to war tomorrow notwithstanding the efforts which have now been made by the Admiralty, you would inevitably have a state of confusion, which is. very serious. I have received in the course of my visits a good deal of confidential information, but I am as certain of this as I am of standing here, that the want of efficiency in the dockyards reflects the greatest discredit upon the administration and upon successive Boards of Admiralty. When you reflect that one Government has been practically in office since the year 1886, I say that not criticism but punishment is wanted for that purpose. My third point on which the Admiralty require criticism is the question of food, and the treatment of the lower deck generally. </para>

Since then I have had the opportunity, owing to the kindness of the German Emperor, of Studying  the food iu the German Navy on board a German battleship, and I have ascertained from personal investigation that the food in the German Navy, and also in the French and United States Navies is better than our own. </para>

In ever saw a German officer with blood-vessels swollen in his neck to bursting point, swearing at the sailors ; and that kind of thing may sometimes be seen even on the Later-State boats connected with our merchant service. </para>

Each officer was apparently most particular in the instruction given, and each recruit was called upon to give his own explanation of every order, and his own idea and description of the gun which he was handling.

The whole argument in connexion with this Bill is founded upon the preparations being made by Germany, Russia, and France as the reason for the increase of naval expenditure in Great Britain. I submit that these interruptions are not calculated to facilitate the progress of the debate. I am pointing out that honorable senators cannot afford to disparage what is going on in the German Navy. 1 am referring to the system they adopt in the training of their men, and. I say that we in Australia ought to adopt the same system.

                        <para>Why, with all these enormous sums being spent on the navy, has the food of the blue-jacket, who is inarticulate and cannot complain, either through Parliament or through the press, been neglected ? We have probably all had a good luncheon before we came here, and anticipate a good dinner to-night ; but is it right that the blue-jackets, many of whom are required to know quadratic equations, should be compelled to sit down without a knife and fork and eat with a clasp knife V If only a few blue-jackets were articulate, or able to bring parliamentary or political or social pressure to bear, this would not happen. I will also remind 3'ou how the Admiralty acted in reference to the treatment of the blue - jackets when the <inline font-style="italic">Terrible</inline> was paid off. She was paid off the day before the King's procession went through: London, and the men were prevented from coming up to London. But a friend of mine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Pearson, proprietor of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Express,</inline> paid the whole ex [lenses, and 640 of these men, without their officers, with the temptations of drink, and the temptations of a great town, after a long campaign, and with plenty of money in their pockets, came up to London, but not one of the men was tipsy - not one of them disgraced himself. I say the testimony to the character of the British blue-jacket on the occasion of the <inline font-style="italic">Terrible's</inline> crew coming to London was such that the}' have deserved a consideration from Parliament and the public, which they have not hitherto received. My fourth point is gunnery. I admit that Lord Selborne has used the words "gunnery, gunnery, gunnery" to a credulous Senate. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnold</inline> Forster's replies are verbally all that can be desired, but are they accurate ? I will not answer in my own words, and in everything I say here I am not speaking my own thoughts ; I represent the views of many officers in the navy, including flag officers, and also of the. lower deck. I will read you only two statements. Here is a letter I had from Malta from a naval officer - " On April 29th, 1903, the eight battleships of this fleet - namely, the <inline font-style="italic">Vengeance, London, Bulwark,</inline><inline font-style="italic">Russell,</inline><inline font-style="italic">Venerable, Implacable, Formidable, Irresistible</inline> - left Naples for this place. In the afternoon we expended our quarter's allowance of practice ammunition, and a more disgraceful waste could never have been seen. We commenced at 2 o'clock. By 3.30 it had all gone, the total number of rounds being about 10,000. I do not know what the value of it is, but I should .think about £4,000. The way it was done was as follows : - Each ship towed a target and the other ships fired at it, altogether four different sorts of guns were firing at the same time, and the distance of the target was so great that you could not see where your shot went. It would have been far better to have thrown the ammunition overboard. Our gunnery lieutenant nearly cried. He has taken a lot of trouble in instructing the men. and this ammunition was to have been used for teaching the men to shoot. He had arranged with the captain to have two whole days for firing it. Instead of that it all had to go overboard in one and a half hours. The flagship, out of one 10,000, got rid of 80 rounds of 12-pr., 26 rounds of 3-pr., 1,310 rounds of ]-in., 1,000 rounds of "45; total 2,416 rounds in one and a half hours. It is very hard lines to have our practice ammunition thrown overboard like this. We have a class of acting-captains of guns, who are only waiting for their firing-test to get twopence a day extra pay. The gunnery lieutenant says he cannot give it to them on the last firing, as it was no test at all, the target being outside the distance at which .aiming practice should be carried out, and it was impossible to mark the shots. " </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The point of that letter is this : the British Navy miss the target twice out of three times, because they do not practice enough. There is no reason whatever why the British Navy should not hit the target at least once out of every two rounds, or even twice out of three, and until we can do that, we cannot say that we have good shooting. The only way to get good shooting is the way in which Lord Walter Kerr obtained good coaling, and that was obtained by publicity. If you have publicity, ammunition will not be blown overboard. Publicity produces emulation, and with emulation you will get from the British Navy all it can do. Now for the other fact about gunnery. I want to read a verv short statement recently made to me, not on oath, because I had no justice of the peace in the room, but with a witness - "I, , lately Chief Petty Officer, gunnery instructor, captain of a turret, with three good conduct budges, of H.M.S. , am now prepared to make oath and say that I have myself ditched thousands of rounds of practice ammunition. They sent me out to the Nore in an old gunboat - with more work to do in one day than one man can manage, and if I could not get through that work and go back, and have not done it (by work I mean firing more rounds than can be got through, or haze, weather or fog prevents the ammunition being fired <inline font-style="italic">off),</inline> returning to the gunnery school without having fired ofl the proper number of rounds of ammunition, nothing may be said the first time, but if it occurs several times you get removed as an unsatisfactory instructor.

This money is not to be regarded in the light of a contribution. When we place this £200,000 beside the £35,000,000 in the British Naval Estimates, we can see that this flea-bite of a contribution is .to be used for political purposes, just as the Australian Contingents were used by certain British statesmen during the Boer war. Politicians in the old country wish to use this subsidy us an argument to induce the British taxpayer to consent to enormous sums of money being raised for naval expenditure, which has risen from £25,000,000 some five years ago to £35,000,000 at the present time- </para>

                            <para>- Various estimates are given, but £35,000,000 is about the sum mentioned in the Conference papers. Some argument is deemed to be necessary by those politicians to satisfy the British taxpayer, and this subsidy will be used to that end. British politicians will say to the British taxpayer - "Look at what the colonists are doing for us ; not only in the £16,000,000 they pay in 4' per cent, interest, but in the extra subsidy, in order to maintain the British Navy and keep up the traditions of the British Empire." Honorable senators will recollect that the name of the Colonies was used with striking effect in an endeavour to silence the people of England during 1900-1 ; and so the name of the Colonies will be used in the present instance. If Australia and New Zealand had stood out with Canada, and refused to vote this money, politicians in the old country would, undoubtedly, have had very great difficulty in satisfying the British taxpayer that £35,000,000 is necessary for the navy. I oppose the subsidy, on the ground also that our refusal would no doubt make the British taxpayer think when he casts his vote at the next elections - would cause him to consider whether it is a wise policy to consent to the expenditure of this huge sum of money on the navy, and to realize that that expenditure is the more likely to bring about the very war he would like to see avoided. If we expend £35,000,000 on war ships, and man them with officers who have more combativeness than good sense, we may get into trouble at any time. I oppose this Bill, because I do not agree with the foreign policy of the British Government. Who believes in that foreign policy? </para>

                            <para>- It is one of those petty wars carried on by interested people, in order that the British taxpayer shall continue to pay uncomplainingly. . We see large head lines appearing iri the press about a reverse in Somaliland - how thirty British and about 1,000 black troops have been overcome by the " Mad Mullah " and his " fanatics," as they are called. It is very interesting to observe the habit of the Britisher. If the enemy .happen to be composed of aboriginal natives of Asia or Africa, and they show great courage, they are described as " mad fanatics." If, on the other hand, one of our own side shows great courage, he is decorated with the Victoria Cross. <inline font-style="italic">[Senate counted.]</inline> I ask honorable senators who are prepared to vote for this subsidy whether they see no danger in the policy which the British Government is pursuing with regard to China ? "Without a doubt, the scheme for the disposition of the Australian Squadron has been prepared with a view to what may happen in China. The foreign policy of the British Government - a policy which is participated in to some considerable extent by Russia, Germany, and others - is calculated to bring us into the direst trouble. Any one who has read any works about China must know that there is a considerable body of enlightened public opinion in that country, no matter what people may say as to the incapacity and general decadence of the Chinese. If we decide to pay a subsidy to the British Government, we shall only foe bringing the danger nearer to ourselves. By holding aloof, as the Canadians have done, "we might induce some British statesmen to pause and consider whether it is wise to take up the attitude which is adopted with regard to China. We all know what the powers who are manoeuvring in the China seas contemplate. We know that they are going to force their trade upon China, and if it attempt to resist sooner or later there will be -war. To my mind, the naval policy is framed primarily with the object of keeping up the British Navy to such a pitch that it will be able with other powers to step in and try to inflict disgrace and ruin upon the people in China. </para>

The risks I contend are dangerous. ' I am not like "the honorable senator who thinks that because he is a Britisher he is equal to four men of any other nationality. The conceit which finds a place in the minds of some Britishers and some Australians is insufferable. Anybody who reads about the educated and intelligent French nation, and learns -of the reforms which come to us through their Legislature, ought to recognise that they are equal to us in every respect. It is only national conceit that makes us assume that we are better than those people. </para>

Honorable senators are urging as one reason why we should pay this money that Russia, is making great war preparations. There is a. great deal to be said on behalf of that country, because until very recently her people could only send out commodities at the good will and through the territory . of some other nation. Russia has. been fighting for a port, and all her efforts have been mode in that direction- </para>

My belief is that they will find, a force which they never anticipated.. In assenting- to  the measure which has been put before as in such an underhand way by the Federal Government - and to which they agreed in such an. unconstitutional way - we shall be preparing the way for- what may be <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> awful war:. If we restrain, our hand we shall make these gentlemen turn to saner methods, which I may refer to later- on. According, to certain books I have read very great preparations are being made in China to resist foreign aggression. We have the authority of General Gordon that the Chinaman, will moke a very good soldier. The books, which have been written on the doings of the Allies in China give most extraordinary examples of bravery on the part of the men, youth, and children- of China, who, . actually armed with, spades- and similar primitive weapons, tried to block the- trains carrying the soldiers of. the Allies, and did not give way until many of them had been wounded and. struck down. There is the best material in China for resisting foreign aggression. We have no right to vote any money which may be used by, I should not say panic stricken  men, but. designing men, who are not satisfied with their own country, but who wish to conquer China, indeed the whole world. Like Napoleon, they de«ire to bring every nation into subjection if they can. On these grounds we ought not to support the Bill. If we refuse to accept the- Bill we shall take one step towards prompting Great Britain to withdraw her objection; to international arbitration... I was glad to see quite recently that England had agreed with Japan: to refer to a bit ration. a dispute as: to the rights of British residents to property in Japan. It; was very comforting to me to see that the United States had been successful in its demand that Germany and Great Britain should submit the differences- between, themselves and Venezuela to the Hague, Arbitration Tribunal </para>

Apparently it is only a small part of her- foreign policy. In. the case of Japan, she was agreeable to go to arbitration. Why ? Because she has a treaty of neutrality with Japan. It provides that if England is at war with any country, Japan, shall not interfere, and that, if they ace both attacked, they shall join forces. </para>

The honorable senator knows that negotiations were proceeding for some- time before the. two nations- agreed to allow the dispute to be- settled by arbitration. They only agreed because the United! States remained firm, and there was an unmistakable wish on. the part of. the people of that country that the matter- should be referred to arbitration. That is why arbitration was, agreed to by the two, powers concerned. </para>

                            <para>- Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> read, the newspapers 1 This measure is really a part of the foreign policy of the British Government. I say " of the British Government," because I differentiate, between the people and the Government. The policy of the people of Great Britain is the same as ours, though- many of them have- not votes with which to give expression to their wishes. In the case of Venezuela the United States put its foot down and would not allow Great Britain and Germany to act against the wishes of the American people, and to- interfere with the Monroe doctrine. The British; Government were 'wise in refraining from going to- war with a nation embracing 80,000,000 people and. commanding almost unlimited, wealth and resources-. I am sorry the policy ol the British. Government in regard to arbitration, is; such as. it is. Great Britain and Germany were the only two powers that refused to sign the proposals of the Hague Conference to refer international disputes to arbitration, although the United States, Italy, Russia and other powers were willing, to sign. For th» various reasons which I have given we ought to reject the Bill.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> disagrees with the policy of the measure, but says that rather than break his word, and because <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton assented to the agreement, lie will vote for it. It is to be deplored that the honorable senator should allow personal considerations to intervene when such large interests are involved. I regret the fact that any honorable senator should not look at the matter from a broader stand-point. It is not in the interests of any people, whether in Australia, China, or elsewhere, that there should be war. What has been the result of the war in South Africa <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Great Britain is saddled with £216,000,000 of debt, and there is a condition of seething discontent in South Africa. No fewer than 20,000 of the flower of the British nation are under the sod, and their relatives are left sorrowing for them. War may be in the interests of army contractors and people who make money out of it, but it is certainly not in the interests of the general community. The great national issue should be considered rather than the personal aspect of the case. The mere paltry fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton would be offended if we refused to ratify the agreement should have no weight. My own view is that backing up <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton and the British Government, by passing this agreement, may lead to disastrous results ; whereas the refusal to ratify it may conduce to the most beneficial consequences. Tam hoping for the time when there will be a general reduction of the military and naval estimates of the civilized nations, and when the great powers will agree to settle their disputes by the means suggested by the Hague Tribunal. The peace of the world will then be assured. We have no right to agree to proposals which will delay that benefit accruing by a single hour. I also affirm that in my opinion the proposals of the Government are not constitutional. Section 68 of the Constitution says that the commander-in-chief of the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the Governor-General. The Governor-General is the mouthpiece of the Executive Council of the Commonwealth. He is responsible to Parliament. But this Bill proposes, without repealing section 68, to hand over the control of the naval forces of Australia to some outside authority. On that ground this Bill should be rejected. If the Government want to alter the terms of the Constitution in that direction, it would be courageous to come forward in a manly way with a proposal to that effect'. But the Government know perfectly well that if they were to adopt a statesman-like attitude, and ask the people of the Commonwealth to agree to the alteration of the Constitution so as to take out of the hands of the Executive Council the control of the naval .forces, they could not expect that a thousand votes would be cast in favour of such a proposal. That is the reason why the Ministry are endeavouring to rush the measure through Parliament. Within six weeks or two months, if the Government do their duty, there will be a general election. Within four months the general election must take place. This question could be submitted to the electors. Where is the necessity for hurry % The old agreement remains in force. Why do <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton and his colleagues desire to place this Bill upon the* statute-book before the voters can express their views <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                            <para>- They know that the ' country would not tolerate the agreement for a moment. Let the Government go to Queensland and ask the people there whether they are in favour of this scheme of the Colonial Office. Every Queensland newspaper which I have read objects to the Naval Agreement. I could quote several columns against it from the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane. Courier</inline> and in favour of the creation of an Australian Navy. My opinion is that the majority of the people of the other States are also against it. While the Federal campaign was being conducted not a single speaker uttered a word in favour of the naval subsidy. Those who spoke about naval matters said that they were in favour of creating the nucleus of an Australian Navy. The Government are afraid to submit the matter to the electors. Otherwise they would not show such concern about the fate of the measure. At a later stage I trust that some one will move that the Bill be considered this day six months. Another reason why I am opposed to the measure is that Australia is in no danger of foreign aggression. It has been said that if Great Britain were at war Australia would be at war also. That does not necessarily follo w . As the late Chief Justice Higinbotham, of Victoria, said, when the old Naval Agreement was being considered in the local Legislative Assembly, any danger that is- likely to accrue to Australia will be owing to its connexion with England. I say there is absolutely no reason why Australia should not be at peace with the whole of the nations of the earth. We have been given an idea of what is likely to happen from Australasian interference at the time of the Boer war. The Boers did not object to Tommy Atkins fighting them so much as they did to the Australians. They said they could not understand why Australians should go to war with them, when they were colonists like themselves. I say that if we keep to our own territory ; if we avoid interfering with foreign nations ; if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir AVilfred</inline> Laurier has said, we refuse to be drawn into the vortex of militarism, we shall be perfectly safe in Australia. During <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> remarks, I made a reference to the distance we were away from the territories of other nations, and said that we had no borders to defend, and that we were a self-contained people. The honorable and learned senator in reply said that the very fact that we were surrounded by the sea showed that we were liable to aggression by foreign powers. </para>

                            <para>- It does not do anything of the kind. If Australia were not a self-contained continent the position would be quite different. But here we are some eight or ten days' sail from the nearest Russian coaling station ; and Russia is, in the panic-stricken minds of some honorable senators, deemed to be the nation likely to attack us first. Russian vessels would not find it to their advantage to come here at all. What could they get when they did come? Is any nation on the face of the earth so insane and suicidal in its policy that it is going to come to a continent like this for the purpose of loot - a country which has only riches when its population is working it; a country from which we only get riches through the hard work of producers? I say that our policy is not at all a policy of an offensive-defensive character. Our policy should be the policy which Canada is adopting. Canada is spending some £500,000 on her local defences. She is training her men ; and will very shortly, so her Prime Minister says, make an effort to establish the nucleus of a navy. That should be our policy ; we should let the whole world, including . the British Government, know that we . do not countenance any naval and military policy which has for its object interference with foreign people. We should say - " We are desirous of living at peace with the world, and if we have any surplus products which you would like to buy we should be only too glad to sell them to you ; but so far from interfering with you in any way, we are desirous of keeping aloof." For honorable senators to carry this Bill in the face of the arguments which those opposed to it have been able to bring before them, appears to me to be entirely contrary to their usual practice. Honorable senators who are favoring this proposal have certainly at times disclosed a gleam or two of lucidity, but on this occasion I must say that . their proposals are characterized by the greatest inanity.. We have had some arguments advanced by Australian statesmen, if I may. be permitted to call some of my fellow honorable senators statesmen - of course I know that a statesman does not appear to be a statesman until he is dead. He is but a politician up till that time. The statesmen in this Chamber have brought forward arguments in favour of an Australian Navy, and against this Bill ; and I am satisfied that if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton had not signed this agreement those arguments would have had full force and effect. I need refer only to the arguments used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, and adduced in the splendid speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson.</inline> I wish to reiterate my opinion that now is the time when the Imperial Government should propose a reduction and not an increase of the naval expenditure. I suppose there never was a time when a better international feeling existed, notwithstanding the differences which prevail in certain quarters; and instead of swelling the British Naval Estimates to £35,000,000, which is the war footing, they ought to be brought down to £25,000,000. </para>

Heavy increases of expenditure for warlike preparations are a strange sequel to the conclusion of pence. The policy on which we have entered is not the policy on which the great statesmen of the past - Lord Beaconsfield not less earnestly than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> - insisted. During the Russo-Turkish War-, navy estimates had been considerably increased. At the close of the war our expenditure was cut down to the greatly reduced figures which Lord Northbrook's Board inherited from their predecessors. Lord Beaconsfield's method of dealing with the navy seems wiser in its application to the present time than it appeared to those at the Admiralty u quarter of a century ago, when an increase of the navy was needed and the funds were scanty. Our present expenditure is increasing beyond all precedent. The severe and costly struggle in South Africa hns been brought at last to a successful issue. All the great powers of Europe are solicitous for peace, and are feeling the financial strain of costly armaments. Is our proposed expenditure necessary ? Can our present charges be borne without detriment to the national progress and prosperity ? </para>

                    <para class="block">The writer of that introduction goes on to express great doubt as to whether the people of England subscribe to the policy as outlined by the British Admiralty. After every war there is a period of peace. There was a peace of twenty-five years after the Crimean war, for which, by the way, the War Office was in no better state of preparation than it was for the Boer war. All the preparations had to made after the Crimean war had started, just as was found to be the fact in the case of the Boer war. My conclusion is that, if ever it unfortunately occurs that the United Kingdom is at war with some foreign nation, there will be sufficient resource within the nation, no matter how inadequate the preparations may be, to enable it to rise to the responsibilities of the occasion. It is not only proper that the British Naval Estimates should be reduced from ?35,000,000 to something like ?25,000,000, or even less, but it is an egregious blunder to propose to extract the former sum of money from the pockets of the English people. We must bear in mind that there has been no opportunity for the British elector to express an opinion about the present naval and military policy of the British Government: and common sense indicates that there ought to be a reduction. I have already said that if we pass this Bill it will, to some extent, assist the British Government in maintaining this excessive naval expenditure. One other point I have to deal with is that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> who contended that the old agreement of 1887 was carried out by the British Government. On referring to the report of the Colonial Conference proceedings of that year, I find the following : - </para>

There is just one sentence that I wish to say, not with reference to the agreement, but with reference to one point in the agreement, and that is, the normal strength ot the Imperial Squadron. I do not quite like that term. What I was going to suggest is this : That I hope that, as the old Imperial vessels are withdrawn from the station, we may reasonably look for their being replaced by vessels of a more modern type and more modern armament, because it is desirable to have a force of the most efficient type and description.

                        <para>Lord George Hamilton. - That, I think, is a very reasonable wish. Of course, as the vessels become obsolete, they will be replaced by more efficient vessels. It is quite admitted that there are one or two vessels on the Australasian station which are rather behind dates - </para>

                    <para class="block">What has happened during the fourteen years that the old agreement has been in force ? Have the Admiralty taken away the obsolete vessels aud replaced them with more up-to-date vessels? Is it not a fact that we are now told by naval and military experts in Australia that any idea we may have had as to the effectiveness of the Australian Squadron is a simple illusion - that the vessels are obsolete and have been obsolete for years ? Have we any reason to believe that there will be a change during the ten years of the new agreement ? Have we not the word of Lord Charles Beresford, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnold</inline> White, and other critics, that the British Navy at present contains a great number of obsolete vessels - that there is a great lack of administration, and such a waste of money that the navy is described i is a sink into which the money of the English taxpayers is thrown? We have no reason to anticipate any change of policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> endeavoured to deal . with the argument, which is based on the principle that there shall be no taxation without representation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> said that, because we represent the people in this Parliament, and vote the subsidy of £200,000, the people of Australia have representation. The fact is that we should have no control over the expenditure of the subsidy once it was paid. We should not be able, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnold</inline> White, to make eleven visits to the I 9 e 2 docks and see how the money was used. I think that it would be thrown away. When we speak of taxation without representation, we mean that if we subscribe a subsidy of £.200,000 a year we should be acquainted with the details of the expenditure. Of course, some one may say that the time will come when we shall have, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane</inline> or some other British statesman, a representative in the Councils of Great Britain. In view of what has happened over the Federation of these States, that time seems to me to be very remote. When we find very influential Australians saying that Federation is a mistake because the seat of government is so far removed from the people, is it likely that the Australian public will consent to or ask for representation on the Board of Admiralty or any other Department of the Imperial Government ? To sum up my views, I think that the whole business is a huge mistake, and that we shall regret the agreement for as many years as it may be in force. . I hope that if the second reading of the Bill is carried we shall in Committee be able to make an amendment terminating the agreement at the end of ten years. </para>

If a limit of ten years is prescribed, those who want the subsidy can fight the battle over again.

                        <para>- I feel satisfied that honorable senators are weary of the discussion, but I wish to express my opinions as shortly as possible, and to state some of the reasons why I shall vote against the Bill. It is almost a pity that the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest did not discuss the matter with the Parliament in some form before they went to England. It is quite evident now that there was then a very strong opinion that he should not in any way bind the Parliament to any agreement during the. discussions with the Colonial Secretary. Of course we are told that we are under no compulsion to accept the agreement which lie entered into, but it is quite evident from their remarks that honorable senators do feel themselves in honour bound to support the Prime Minister. They all seem to feel that if the agreement is rejected he will take the vote as an expression of want of confidence in himself. That obliges those who are extremely anxious to support the Government, and not to give a vote which would be taken as one of censure, to support the agreement, even against their convictions. 1 am afraid that it will have a great tendency to destroy the national feeling which we hoped would result from Federation. The question has been asked whether we can support a navy of our own. With a very little addition to this sum of £200,000 a year, I think- we could at least maintain a navy sufficient to enable us to train a great many of our seamen for naval warfare, should we, unfortunately, be called upon to fight. Since 1889 we have been subscribing £106,000 a year to the Imperial Government for the use of their ships in our waters, and spending about £67,000 a year on our local naval defences, making in all an annual expenditure of nearly £180,000. When we are anxious, as I think most Australians are, to inculcate a spit-it of independence and nationality, it is a pity that the Prime Minister should have entered into this agreement, even conditionally. We are anxious that our people should be taught the art of naval warfare. . Australia is an island continent, and I believe that the old sea-faring spirit which animated our fathers in the older land animates the Australians. If we had a navy of our own, poor as it might be in the first instance, we should be free from many of the traditions which surround the Admiralty. In South Australia, perhaps unconsciously, we followed the line of policy adopted by the United States in IS 12, when they were brought into naval conflict with the mother country. They discarded the old method of fighting ships, and went in for vessels with more powerful guns and the best armament they could secure. British naval officers found, to their great dismay, that the little boats built by the Americans under new conditions were even more powerful than their own and able to give them a great deal of trouble. When South Australia thought it advisable to procure a boat for the naval training of our seamen, fishermen and others, what was done? We brought out a boat which was fairly well armoured, and fitted with very powerful guns, and which could do a great deal more mischief than the <inline font-style="italic">Wallaroo,</inline> a type of the boats which were brought out .under the agreement of 1887. The <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> measured only 906 tons, and carried one 8-inch gun and five 6-inch guns, whereas the <inline font-style="italic">Wallaroo</inline> measured 2,500 tons, and carried eight 4-7-inch guns. It is quite evident that the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> could throw a great deal more weight by each discharge than the <inline font-style="italic">Wallaroo</inline> could. But how was that done? The <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> was intended mainly for coastal defence. A cruiser which has to sail all over the world has to sacrifice armour and armament to space for coal and stores. We should not be under the necessity of making that sacrifice. For our coastal defence we could start with two or three ships fairly well armoured and carrying very powerful guns, which would enable us to reach the most powerful cruiser that could come near our shore. </para>

                            <para>- I am relying on the opinion of the naval experts as expressed in the reports which have been presented to us. That statement is made very clearly by Captain Creswell in his report. It is very desirable, I think, that we should, as far as possible, cultivate the spirit of independence in this matter. I cannot understand why the Admiralty have pressed for a cash contribution as they have done. A subsidy of £200,000 is a small sum compared with the enormous amount which the British taxpayers have to provide for naval defence. It appears to me, and to various experts and newspaper writers in Great Britain, that it would be far better if the Admiralty encouraged us to go in for a navy, and so add materially to the British naval force. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but we should never despise the day of small things. England had not always the great and mighty navy that she has to-day. If we had only three ships we should add three vessels to the British Navy, but the £200,000 which we subscribe towards British naval defence will scarcely lessen the taxation of the British taxpayer one iota. Great Britain would be compelled to employ as many ships to protect her commerce as she does now. But if we started a navy of our own, with the expenditure of probably £300,000 a year, we should have ships, should train our men, and at any time when England was launched in warfare we should be able to place such vessels as we had, manned by our own sailors, at her disposal. It is not to be expected that in a new country such as ours, where wages are so high, we could keep a large number of men as non-producers. We should not be able to keep a full complement of men on the boats. But we desire to have a sufficient number of boats, so that they may pass from one port to the other, our men being taken on board and given a month's training per annum. We should then have all over the Commonwealth a number of men who would take their places on board the vessels when emergency required. </para>

That is the course adopted by our naval officers in South Australia. This very day the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> is out with her crew giving them a month's training, which qualifies them for the work they may be called upon to do. I should like to say with regard to the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> that when Australia was anxious to assist in naval warfare, in China, as she had assisted in military operations in South Africa, the one ship that was applied for by the Admiralty was the <inline font-style="italic">Protector,</inline> owned by South Australia. She left these shores at a few days'notice, fully equipped, and entered into the China seas admired by all the experts who were engaged in naval operations there. What is more, her engines and all her equipment were ready for going into battle when required. </para>

                            <para>- She is the terror of the seas. Whereas the <inline font-style="italic">Wallaroo</inline> could only discharge about 340 lbs. of metal against the enemy, the guns of the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> could discharge 580 lbs. of metal, or about 70 per cent. more. Instead of being fettered to the traditions of the Imperial authorities we should in building up a navy of our own probably follow the instincts which have led the United States to do what has been found to be so effective, by having armour and armaments very much stronger than usual. The exMinister for Defence based the opinions which he laid before the Colonial Conference upon a report by Rear- Admiral Beaumont. I do not think that Rear Admiral Beaumont fully understood the aspirations of the Australian people. When journals like the Spectator and the <inline font-style="italic">Speaker</inline> strongly urge Australia to qualify herself so that she may be able to offer men and not cash to the British authorities when required, we may reasonably conclude that that would be a wise policy to adopt. Seeing that the discussion has dragged itself along so wearily I shall refrain from saying any more, leaving my further views to be expressed in Committee. I shall vote against the Bill at this stage. </para>

                        <para>- I do not admit that the debate has dragged itself wearily along. From the beginning it has been of a very interesting character. A number of honorable senators are taking a lively interest in the passage of the measure, and the interest has been kept up in a very creditable manner. There is a feeling, not only in Victoria, but in the other States, that the Federal Parliament has to some extent been guilty of lavish expenditure. I have endeavoured to refute statements of that description, but when the proposed expenditure of £200,000 upon the naval subsidy is brought up, I cannot defend it under any circumstance. It will be very difficult for any honorable senator to attempt to justify a vote in favour of this Bill. I have told the electors on several occasions that we have been paying about £106,000 to the British Government for the last fourteen years. The only reply that I could elicit was - " More shame to the Governments that were guilty of such extravagance." I had to convince the people that it happened so long ago that the federal Government could not be accused of this extravagance. The argument used by those to whom I was talking was that in fourteen years we have spent over £1,500,000 ; and what have we to show for <inline font-style="italic">itl</inline> I certainly have had to aduiic that we have nothing of a valuable character to show for the expenditure. I have been told by those all over the Commonwealth who are anxious for economy that if the money had been saved we could by this time have had a better fleet than the present Auxiliary Squadron. I defy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> to deny such an evident fact. I am not going to be a party to an agreement that will involve the expenditure of £2,000,000 in ten years. That will make £3,500,000 that will have been spent since we first entered into an arrangement of the kind with the British Government. When we are going to do anything we ought always to have a good reason for doing it, but not a solitary advocate of this Bill has shown one good reason for the ratification of the agreement. In the first place, what have we to protect? We hear much extravagant sentiment about the hearths and homes of the people. </para>

                            <para>- That was what I was coming to. Almost everything we have is security for money which has been borrowed, either publicly or privately. A large amount of foreign capital is invested in Australia. There is great anxiety in the minds of some people that it is going to be removed. There is no fear that it will be removed by cruisers. The people who own this capital will take good care that it is protected. If the people who reap large profits from Australia wish their property to be protected, those people should pay for that protection. That is one reason why I do not consider that we should be justified in paying one cent or one dollar to anybody else for the protection of somebody else's capital. Again, supposing that we had anything in Australia to protect ; supposing that everything we have was not pawned to the extent it is, and that we really owned it ourselves and had a right to protect it, I should like to ask, what danger we should be in ?" A blackfellow will not put up a breakwind until the wind begins to blow, and I think he is very wise, . for the wind is of such a shifty character in Australia that he would have to be continually moving his breakwind. There is a certain amount of" analogy in that with respect to naval armament at the present time, because, within the last twenty years, it has been so continually changing that on every occasion when any nation has been compelled togo to war it has found that almost everything it had in the shape of ships and armament were out of date, and it had to set to work to produce new ships and armament. </para>

It will be time enough when I begin to advocate an Australian Navy to ask me what will become of it. Whenever I do begin to advocate it, I shall endeavour to instruct honorable senators in my views as to how we should treat it. If we take Australia as it really is and compare it with other parts of the world, we shall see where the necessity for protection comes in. Australia is, with the exception of New Zealand, almost at the ends of the earth, as the Scripture would say. We are furthest away from any source of danger, and as has already been, stated, vessels of war at the present time - those powerful cruisers which some honorable senators seem to be in such dread of - would have to come from somewhere.. Where would they come from ? I am saying this, only to show the absolute foolishness of the fears entertained by some honorable senators. </para>

I have heard a good many honorable senators talk of the danger to Australia if Great Britain was at war with Russia. Where would a Russian cruiser have to come from to get to Australia ?

                            <para>- I shall deal with Port Arthur by-and-by. If she came from the Black Sea, she would have to come through the Mediterranean, and out by the Straits of Gibraltar. What would the people in the forts of Gibraltar be thinking about, assuming that Great Britain was at war with Russia, if they allowed a Russian cruiser to get past Gibraltar ? And that is only assuming that the cruiser, or the Black Sea fleet, were fortunate enough to escape the British fleet in the Mediterranean. If she did not come in that direction from the Black Sea, she would have to come through the Suez Canal, through the Red Sea, and out into the Indian Ocean at Aden. The absurdity of the thing ought to be self-evident to almost anybody who considers the impossibility of any danger arising, so far as Russia is concerned, from ships coming from the Black Sea. If the Russian cruiser did not come from the Black Sea, it would have to come from the Baltic. I am sure that the Channel fleet would be hovering around that quarter, if it expected that any of the Russian fleet would emerge from the Baltic, and a Russian cruiser from the Baltic would have but a very poor chance of ever getting as far as Australia, even if there were any possibility of its getting provisions or coal on the way. If it did not come from the Baltic, it would have to come from the White Sea, and for over half the year it is impossible for a ship to get away from there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> has said that it would come from Port Arthur. But the Russians have not started to build ships of war at Port Arthur yet, and there are not so many of the Russian fleet in the North Pacific at the present time that the British Squadron on the China station would, not <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> able to look after them.

                    <para class="block">Russian cruiser did escape the squadron on the China station, she would have to come all the way from Port Arthur to Australia and in order to do so, would require a considerable amount of coal and provisions. If she ran short of coal on her way from Port Arthur to Australia, where would she replenish her bunkers? Do honorable senators suppose that Japan, which is the ally of Great Britain at the present time, is so fond of Russia as to be ready to give a Russian cruiser very much coal? Then she might come down to Hong Kong ; and do honorable senators suppose that she would get any coal there ? It must be remembered, also, that this Russian cruiser is coming down to take our paper money, the notes of the banks in Australia, because they might be trusted to take precious good care, if there were any danger of that kind to be feared, to shift all their gold to a safe distance into the country, where the Russian cruiser or any one else would have but a very poor chance of getting it. </para>

                            <para>- There are thousands of places which honorable senators might suggest to which the gold might be taken and kept in safe hiding from any Russian cruiser coming from any place. But I think I have shown the impossibility of any danger arising from a Russian cruiser coming to Australian waters. Then suppose we were at war with Germany, and there was the danger of a German cruiser coming here. Where would she come from ? The only coast line of any consequence that Germany is possessed of is in the Baltic, and I have little doubt that Great Britain would be able to find two or three ship's of the bulldog type to post at the mouth of the Baltic to prevent her coming out. There is, therefore, no possible chance, so far as either Russia or Germany is concerned, of any danger arising in Australia from a hostile visit of a cruiser owned by one of those powers. Then I come to deal with France, and to my mind she is the only power that can harass Great Britain, so far as her naval forces are concerned, with the exception of America, and I hope it will be agreed that there will be no possible chance of America ever attempting anything of the kind. I hope that such friendly relationship will spring up between Great Britain and </para>

But supposing these cruisers did get away, and were coming here to injure our commerce - what com7merce would they injure ? Honorable senators will notice that the whole thing is supposition from beginning to end. We have been supposing for the last fourteen years that we were going to be at war every other day, and we have been keeping the Auxiliary Squadron in " the beautiful harbor " for the greater portion of that time. Yet during those fourteen years there has not been the least danger of any attack upon Australia. There have been dozens of Russian scares, and scares of all sorts. I can remember very well when the people in South Australia were almost going mad, and were contemplating what portion of the hills they would go to; but it was all a newspaper war, and there was never anything in it. There never was the sound of a gun ; the battles, and supposed battles, were all made up in the newspaper offices for the purpose of alarming the people, and in the different States thousands of pounds were actually spent in consequence of these alarms. </para>

                            <para>- I was proud of the attitude of the Government of South. Australia on that occasion, and that is more than I can say of all the Governments in Australia. Some of the Australian Governments spent thousands of pounds, or, perhaps, hundreds of thousands of pounds, because of the war scares, ' which were created very probably, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> knows, for the purpose of causing an agitation in the money market of Great Britain, so that those animals called the " Bulls " and " Bears " could attack one another, and make their own fortunes while destroying the fortunes of others. But suppose that a war was in actual progress, and. the cruisers of the enemy did find their way out of the Baltic, the Mediterranean, or the Black Sea, whose commerce would be injured ? Would they injure the commerce of Australia ? Do not honorable senators know that the greater portion of the cargoes which go from Australia to the old country are for the purpose of paying interest on the money we owe to British creditors ? </para>

                            <para>- That is so; and the very vessels which carry the cargoes do not belong to Australia, so that an enemy's cruisers would not do- much damage to the commerce of this country.. As to all these matters I must only suppose, because I have no facts. I never saw the ensign of a hostile ship or the smoke of a hostile gun in Australian waters, and I have been here twenty-six or twenty seven years. I am sure that this is not 01* account of the strength of the Auxiliary' Squadron, or on account of the mighty fleets owned by the Australian States. It is simply because it is not in the interests of the powers of Europe to interfere in any way with the commerce of Australia. A very' subtle suggestion occurs to me, as I dare say it has occurred to other honorable senators, namely, that the great risk we run, is not for the protection of our own property or commerce, but for the protection of the property and commerce of somebody else. According to the arguments which have been used, the great risk can only arise because of our attachment to the British Empire. No one has ever suggested that any of the powers- of Europe or Asia, or, for that matter, America, are going to war with Australia ; I do not believe that any one has entertained such an idea. The cry is, " If the British Empire gets into trouble; if England goes to war, or any of the powers go to war with Great Britain, certain things may happen." </para>

                            <para>- I hope that there will be compulsory arbitration, even in connexion with national warfare. But I have no fear on account of our connexion with the British Empire. I am as loyal a subject as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> or anyone else could be, and I should do as much as they to maintain the honour and dignity of the British Empire. But I 'do not want to encourage the British Empire to get into trouble; I do not want to "sool' the British Empire on, as the shepherd would say to his dog. I do not intend, if I can help it, to indicate to the Empire that we are prepared to encourage war and desolation in the way in which it has been encouraged by some of the so-called " loyalists " and " patriots " of Australia. I am not that kind of patriot. I am one of those patriots who would have more regard for the prosperity of the people and less for the prestige of the Empire as a fighting machine -against the rest of the world ; and I should like very much if some of our " loyal " friends would entertain opinions in the same direction. But suppose - I do not know what other word to use - that an enemy's cruiser did get as far as Australia, what would she do when she got here ? It would not matter, for the purposes of the argument, whether that cruiser belonged to Russia, Germany, or Prance. </para>

                            <para>- It would take me too long to go round Australia and deal with each port, and I shall first take the case of Melbourne. I know that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> were at the head of the Government at such a time, his first suggestion would be to place a submarine mine  at the Heads, and then let the cruiser come in if it dared. Any wise man - and I merely mention <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> because I regard him as a sensible man - would suggest that the best way to protect Melbourne would be to place two or three torpedoes or a submarine mine at the Heads. But even supposing these precautions were neglected, it must not be forgotten that we have some very smart little cutters, -and that all they need do would be to go down the South Passage and cut away the buoys. The enemy's cruiser would find herself aground fifteen times in Port Phillip Bay before she could reach Melbourne. So far as regards the West Channel, it would be a very poor cruiser indeed which could navigate that. </para>

                            <para>- I am  calculating the distance by the West Channel, which is much greater than thirty-five miles. Anyhow, guns have not yet been invented which could successfully bombard Melbourne from a distance of thirty-five miles ; and as the enemy's vessel would Have to stand well off the Heads, that would add a few more miles to the range. Honorable senators must see the absurdity of talking about any great necessity for a fleet to defend the city of Melbourne. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> knows, Adelaide is almost in a better position than Melbourne, seeing that Kangaroo Island stands right in the way, with Investigator Straits on one side, and Backstairs Passage on the other. </para>

                            <para>- I am only suggesting what ought to be done, and what sensible people would do, if we had an enemy's cruisers hopping around. It would be quite easy to protect St.Vincent's Gulf with mines in either of the passages to which I have referred. Although Investigator Straits may be of considerable width, there is no navigable water in all the distance, and the portions to be protected are so limited that very little difficulty in this connexion would be experienced. Even if this mighty cruiser did get through, she would have to encounter large forts before she could do any practical damage to Adelaide. So where is the necessity to have a fleet cruising round, and what will the ships have to protect ? Then, going to Fremantle, I am sure that all the great works which the late Minister for Defence has carried out- </para>

                            <para>-I feel sure that honorable senators expect that if a hostile fleet or a number of cruisers were in our waters', and there was any likelihood of coal being got there the townspeople would have sense enough to set the coal on fire. Surely they are sufficiently familiar with the tory of Napoleon's famous campaign to know what to do in a case of that kind. Again, Perth is a considerable distance from Fremantle. I am sure chat the Commonwealth will be able to take steps for the protection of Fremantle , so that it would be impossible for a hostile cruiser, or even a hostile fleet, to do any damage to Perth. Honorable senators will see that I am gradually making a pretty good hedgehog" of Australia, so far as an enemy is concerned. Going along the eastern coast we come to "the beautiful harbor." It has often puzzled me to understand why there is such unanimity amongst the representatives of New South Wales concerning this Naval Agreement. There are not many of" them here - there never are. </para>

                            <para>- It is a wonder that there are three representatives of New South Wales present. We must recognise that one of them always sticks to his guns manfully, and that is the Vice-President of the Executive Council. It has puzzled me to discover why the' representatives of New South Wales are all so unanimous in this matter. One reason that suggests itself to my mind is that Sydney is nearer the sea coast than any of the other capitals, and is in more danger of being bombarded. If it were bombarded and rebuilt it would not hurt Australia, because Sydney would then get rid of the plague and many other inconveniences. I was wondering whether, in view of adult suffrage, some representatives of New South Wales have not been influenced by a desire to please the ladies, who, no doubt, will welcome the gallant officers of the proposed squadron. We all know that the greater portion of the Auxiliary Squadron spends most of its time in the waters of " the beautiful harbor." I believe that very often the ships get disabled for the purpose of being able to hitch up at Garden Island, and give the officers a chance to go ashore. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that Australian officers would look much more handsome, but they have not much chance yet. There are two or three things in connexion with the maintenance of a fleet in Australia which induce the representatives of New South Wales to be such ardent supporters of an agreement of this description. They are always prepared to spend money. It has been stated that the greater proportion of this subsidy would be spent in - they do not even say Australia - Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Where does, the patriotism of these honorable senators- come in <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Their regard for the crimson thread and the silken bonds disappear in the midst of the selfishness which surrounds them. Their patriotism is reduced to a consideration for the sale of ship biscuits and bully beef. It agitates me when I consider how the money is to be spent in Sydney. It is to be spent on ship's stores, and, I suppose, coal - all products of New South Wales. The cry of these Australian patriots is - "Give nobody else a chance ; let the citizens of the Commonwealth pay their  £200,000  gladly so that we in Sydney may get the whole lot and a little more spent among us." These men are prepared to do all they can to violate the Constitution for their own selfish ends. When the Commonwealth was inaugurated some members of the Senate said in Victoria that they expected to witness scenes of gaiety and splendour. Do' they support the expenditure of this sum of  £200,000  for the sake of the balls and festivities which may be given in honour of the officers - I was going to say and crews, but they will get very little pleasure. They are not supplied with even a knife and fork. They are worse off than the Chinamen, because they have to eat with their fingers. They are not supplied with napkins to wipe their fingers after they have eaten pork and treacle. Honorable senators come here and pretend that they are so stirred by patriot feeling that they are prepared to pay away the whole revenue of Australia for the purpose of getting a fleet, or entering into an agreement which will bring a number of warships hovering round Garden Island. There is another inducement for them to support the agreement. I do not know whether it has influenced the Customs revenue, but it appears that if they can keep the Auxiliary Squadron in "the beautiful harbor" there will be a chance of getting cheap cigars. It was 011I3' the other day that some officers of these vessels were fined for smuggling cigars and tobacco. Do the patriots of New South Wales wish to- have a British fleet in Sydney Harbor, so that they can go about the Domain, or any of the other fashionable places, and smoke shilling cigars, which they have got for a penny ? If that is the kind of patriotism for which the Commonwealth will have to- suffer in the future, I am very sorry indeed. I think I have said almost enough about Sydney and New South Wales.. The selfishness which has been exhibited by its representatives is scarcely worth the notice which they have got. But I think that when the people of Australia realize that six representatives of a .State are prepared to go baldheaded, or otherwise, for an agreement of this description, with the avowed expectation that the subsidy and  £100,000  more will be spent in Sydney, they will be more suspicious of the machinations of the politicians in New South Wales, who are endeavouring by all means to get every concession for that State, and particularly for Sydney, that is within the gift of the Commonwealth. I hope that the people of Australia will take warning from the past and be cautious as regards all dealings with New South Wales. Proceeding up the coast, between Sydney Heads and Moreton Bay there may be a few small ports and harbors. </para>

                            <para>- Newcastle can be easily protected, but as it is not a capital, as most of its hotels are falling to pieces, and as it has been in a dilapidated condition for ten or twelve years, I do not think that the hostile cruisers or hostile fleet that we hear so much about would trouble their heads to go near that port if it were not for the purpose of getting supplies of coal. In order to defeat that object, all we would need to do would be to cause a strike, unless, of course, honorable senators passed a Compulsory Arbitration Bill before that time. Going on to the capital of Queensland, I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will tell me that it would be almost impossible for a hostile cruiser to get up the Brisbane River. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; and I am sure that if they did not know their way very well about Moreton Bay they would get stranded a dozen times before they reached the mouth of the river. There is every possibility that they might be wrecked on Stradbrook Island and find themselves in the lazarette, when they would be quarantined and could- not go ashore! I do not know that honorable senators have any idea of the difficulties attending a successful attack upon the city of Brisbane. There are two- very effective little gun-boats there,, which I believe would be quite equal to the protection of the river. But let me point out what has happened in the past. I think it was in 1890 or 1891 that a flood came. There were not many labour members in the Queensland Parliament at that time, and the Government was not very careful. There was not a full crew on board the <inline font-style="italic">Paluma,</inline> and the morning after the flood that vessel was found in the middle of the Botanical Gardens. It took nearly three months to prepare ways to get her out. But one night the flood came again, and there being some people on board the <inline font-style="italic">Paluma</inline> who knew how to steer her in the right direction, she was floated into the river once more. That would be a nice position for a foreign cruiser to have to face. How would a ship from the Black Sea or the Baltic like to meet with such a fate? Proceeding along the coast, there is nothing to protect in Thursday Island except a few Japanese and boss pearl fishers. I have very little sympathy for Thursday Island. If an earthquake swallowed it up, there would be no damage done that we should have occasion to regret so long as the decent people got notice. </para>

                            <para>- I need not call the honorable senator's attention to the old story of Lot and his wife who got away because they were respectable people. If the respectable people in Thursday Island got an opportunity of removing themselves in time T should have very little regret for the loss of the rest, judging from what I have heard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> who has been there, and has had opportunities of verifying what he has heard, can tell us that in Thursday Island there is' nothing but a sickening sink of iniquity. I am sure that he would be quite satisfied with the results of an earthquake so long as one or two of his friends gob off safely. From Thursday Island we proceed to Port Darwin. There is nothing else on the road. It is a long distance, and I do not know where the hostile cruiser would get its coal and provisions on that coast. But suppose the cruiser got to Port Darwin. It would not stop very long there, because the cockles would eat holes through the bottom of the ship, and the mosquitoes would kill the crew. There are only 400 or 500 white people in the whole of the Northern Territory. The principal number of the inhabitants are Chinamen. The hostile cruiser might as well -go to China as to the Northern Territory. </para>

I am sure that a hostile cruiser would be disappointed with what it was able to get on the north-west coast.

                            <para>- I was leaving Hobart till the small-pox had been got rid of. I remember hearing a story which is applicable. It is a story of naval warfare, so that I hope it will not be ruled out of order. Once, when Lord Dundonald was- * on his little sloop of about 150 tons, he was overtaken by a great French cruiser of some 2,000 or 3,000 tons armed with 50 or 60 guns. He hardly knew what to do. But there was a man on board who could mimic a Dutchman very well. Lord Dundonald knew there was smallpox in Holland at that time. He therefore put up the Dutch colours, and when the Frenchman hailed his vessel, and said, " Where are you for ?" the man who could mimic a Dutchman replied, that the ship was from Amsterdam or Rotterdam - or whatever city had the smallpox worst. The Frenchman asked, "All well on board ?" The answer was, " No ; we are all down with the smallpox."' Orders were at once given for the Frenchman to bout ship, and away in the opposite direction ab the greatest speed possible. Similarly, I think there is no necessity bo refer bo Tasmania until she gets rid of the smallpox. I hope this debate will have finished before that time. </para>

                            <para>- If the squadron had been away from these coasts during the whole of the last twenty-five years nothing would have happened, except that we should have been about £2,000,000 better off. I do not think that the taxpayers would regard that as a disadvantage. Bub let me refer bo the remainder of the coast of' Australia, and ask the question : Where any foreign cruisers that were raiding these seas could do any damage? Upon the north.- coast of Queensland, the cruisers would be afraid to go within 100 miles of laud on account of the reefs. If they once got inside they would be afraid that they would never get out again. Off the New South Wales coast they could not get within miles for rocks and peaks. It would only be by taking great risks that they could get near the shore. Down in South Gippsland they could not get within five or six miles of the coast for mud. At French Island there is so much mud that I could walk across to the mainland without rolling up my trousers. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> can testify that round about Elan ville or Yankalilla it would be impossible to effect a landing. As to Kangaroo Island, we have had dozens of ships wrecked there - even ships full of whisky. Many sensible arguments have been used in the course of the debate, but a question of this kind has its ludicrous and its ridiculous sides. </para>

                            <para>- It was an excellent argument ; I have no fault to find with it. I am only sorry that my honorable friend had not collected more material for the purpose of continuing his speech. It appears to me that Australia resembles, in one respect, a tortoise or a turtle. Whenever an enemy comes to attack a turtle or a tortoise, it pulls its head and its limbs inside its shell, and remains safe. </para>

                            <para>- It is only turned over if it comes out of the water. Australia is a self-contained country. If .all the rest of the world went under in consequence of an earthquake not a soul in Australia would' suffer from hunger or thirst. Not a soul would need to go naked. There is not a soul who could not go into the bush with his rifle or shot-gun and shoot whatever game there was to be obtained. There is not a soul in Australia who could not obtain here all the amusements which he could get in any other part of the world. Australia is entirely independent, with the exception that it owes a lot of money. That is about the only trouble we have got. So that if all the rest of the world were destroyed, and we no longer owed that money to anybody we should be over £200,000,000 better off than we are. If we were entirely cut off from the rest of the world, instead of having to send abroad our wool, meat, butter, fruit, eggs, and produce of every description, to the value of £8,000,000 or £10,0(»0,000 every year, we should have all that stuff for ourselves. What a time the people of Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide would have, with all this produce remaining in Australia, instead of having to be sent away ! That illustration shows the disadvantage and not the advantage of our connexion with the rest of the world. I have said that we are like the tortoise. If danger comes we can draw in our head and our limbs, and we are perfectly safe. Would it not be ridiculous if a tortoise - and this is exactly the position of the Commonwealth of Australia - imagining that he was about to be attacked by a whale, a sea serpent, or a sea lion, got into a deep pool inside a coral reef, and then half-a-dozen sharks went swimming round while he was inside of his shell and there was nothing to fear? Cannot honorable senators see the similarity of the position, and how ridiculous it is that we, who are like the tortoise self-contained, self-reliant, and self-supporting, should have half-a-dozen sharks floating round to look after some other fellow who will likely enough never come near us ? Though, like the tortoise, we are self-contained, I have also indicated that we are very well armed, and, if we are not, it is quite possible to arm us effectively. It is proposed that we should spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in drilling a land force, and I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> admit that he would not object to the spending of £100,000 or so upon really up-to-date weapons of defence. We are to be in this position, and we are armed at all the vulnerable points. If we rolled ourselves up we should be like a hedgehog and nothing could touch us. And yet some honorable senators cry out about the dangers with which we are to be assailed, the men-of-war that are going to float round Australia, when we know that they could come within miles of us without the risk of being blown to pieces or wrecked upon our shores. Does not all this show that it is not any fear of danger that is affecting certain honorable senators who are so anxious to carry a Bill of this description ? No, it is the selfish instincts which induces them to endeavour to get something out of other parts of the Commonwealth which will benefit them, and which will do no good to anybody else. There is another aspect of the question to which I should like to call the attention of honorable senators. Is there anything more detestable in this world than a bully? Is there anything more detestable in this world than a man intoxicated who rolls about the streets insulting women and children? Is there anything more detestable than a man who is always on the aggressive, and who is always wanting to fight somebody ? Would it be right for the Commonwealth, for a State, or or for  any municipality in the Commonwealth to arm a mau of that description with a rifle, a revolver, a cutlass, or even a black thorn stick? Would it not be to their detriment and to their danger? Would not the man be the means of creating rows and ructions wherever he might go? Why is it that the flea is the most detested insect in the world ? It is because it is so persistent, so persevering, so pestilential, and because it is so painful in its endeavours to annoy everybody with whom it comes in contact. Do we desire to make the Commonwealth as contemptible as an insect of that description ? Why is it that the bee is more admired than the wasp? Simply because the bee does its work and interferes with nobody, unless it is itself provoked and interfered with. But how detestable an insect is the wasp. This goes to show that if you give some people, as some animals, the opportunity of becoming obnoxious, obnoxious they must become. Consequently, I say, it is better for the people of Australia, and it would be better for the people of many other parts of the world, if they paid more attention to the legitimate production of wealth than to providing the means for destroying the wealth of others, as well as protecting the wealth they have themselves. I should like honorable senators to consider these things, and to see that they give no opportunity to the sons of Australia to become more aggressive than they ought to be. We desire to be a peace-loving people here, and I am sure we shall never make a peace-loving people of Australians if we are always talking war to them, and always pretending that somebody is going to injure them, is going to rob them of what they have not got, and to do all sorts of damage to the country to which they belong. We ought never to do anything of the kind. It should always be our object to create a feeling of brotherly affection in the people of Australia for the white people of every other part of the world. </para>

                            <para>- Just so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> said that he would allow them to go to Heaven with him, but I would ask the honorable senator and other honorable senators who are so anxious to refer to the restrictions put upon the immigration of coloured people, who ever heard of a black, a yellow, or a red angel ? Is not everything in the realms of bliss pure and white? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> should remember that when he is trying to poke fun at an ignorant individual like myself. I hope that lessons will be drawn in many directions from this debate. I have no desire to overtax the indulgence of honorable senators. I would not do that for the world. But I wish to say a word or two with reference to the Bill we are discussing. I have noticed that though a great deal has been said during this debate, very little attention has been given to the Bill itself. When we come to consider the Bill we shall find that there is nothing in it but an agreement. Tt certainly has a preamble in which there are nearly as many " Whereases" as there would be in one of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs'</inline> questions. It would be meaningless, but for these " whereases." The first clause .of the Bill, the enacting clause, tells us what the Bill is going to be called. The second clause tells us what it is going to do. The next one appropriates money, but it does not say how much, and in it there is no solitary condition. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to pay some little attention to what I am going to say. I propose to endeavour to be serious in thu midst of what seems to me one of the greatest , absurdities over brought before the Senate. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> was speaking I endeavoured by interjection to draw from him a reply to the question whether the Admiralty had carried out the old agreement entered into in 1887. The honorable and learned senator ought t&lt;&gt; know that they did not. He knows that even at the time the agreement was made it was acknowledged by the Admiralty that two of the ships to be supplied were obsolete, and they never made any attempt to improve them or to replace them by others. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> to say whether there was any provision in the agreement made in 1887 in the way of imposing a penalty for nonfulfilment of the agreement. Senators Clemons and Downer are both pretty high in the legal profession, and I should like to know if they have ever drawn out an agreement between two parties in which there was not some condition imposing a penalty for the failure of either party to carry out the agreement. If one borrows money and enters into an agreement in connexion with it, something will happen if he does not pay up, and he may actually be put in gaol. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has said that a lot of members of Parliament do not pay their debts. I pay mine when I can, and when I cannot the other fellow has to wait. What I desire to call attention to, is that whenever an agreement is drawn out, even if it be in connexion with a contract for the building of a house, if the contractor does not build the house according to the plans and specifications referred to in the agreement, the other fellow will not pay him. If he agrees to build it in a certain time and fails to do so, what is the result? In such agreements there is generally a provision that he will be fined so much a day - £5 to £10 a day. If a contract is entered into to build a railway, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> I am sure, can tell us, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> if he were here could tell us, that there are certain conditions under which penalties are imposed. I should like to know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> from recollection, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> from knowledge, can tell me that anything of the kind existed in the previous agreement drawn up between the different States and the Admiralty. They cannot tell me any such thing because there was none. </para>

                    <para class="block">Admiralty doing anything for us ; all the other articles provide for our doing something for the Admiralty. That shows that when Australians go to the old country and come in contact with men of sagacity, with the experience of statesmen, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> and others associated with him, they have to keep both eyes and both ears open. There are twelve articles in the agreement, and yet there is not a single condition in the way of a penalty. The British Admiralty are to furnish us with a sort of fleet which is to be kept up-to-date, and certain conditions are to be observed in return for the payment of a certain sum of money. But if the Admiralty send out one first-class cruiser, one second-class cruiser, and four third-class cruisers, who is to decide whether or not they are treating us fairly? Who is to be the judge to certify that the conditions have been fulfilled? There is one part of the agreement I can see through plainly. If we do not pay the £200,000 the very guns provided under the agreement will be turned on us so as to compel us, whereas if the Admiralty fail to fulfil their portion of the agreement who is to force them to do so <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> No one is prepared to answer, and there is nothing in the agreement to show how the agreement is to be enforced. We must pay the £200,000, but there is nothing to compel the Admiralty to fulfil their part of the agreement. So it is from the beginning to the end of the agreement - so far as the Admiralty is concerned it is " heads I win and tails you lose." Poor Australia has to rely on the honour and on the integrity of the very party with whom sixteen years ago she entered into an agreement which has not been carried out as faithfully as it ought to have been. Honorable senators should look at the position from that aspect, and ask themselves whether it would not be better to save this £2,000,000. lt will not be safe for Australia to enter into an agreement like that unless there be some condition to compel the Admiralty to carry out the agreement to the letter. It has been asked how the agreement can be thus enforced ? If those who drafted the agreement had had the interests of Australia at heart as much as they had the interests of the Empire, they would have inserted some provision to the effect that until certain men, say Captain Creswell, now in the Australian service, and a French naval authority with an American naval authority, certified that the agreement had been kept, we should not have to pay this £200,000. It may be said that it is unreasonable to bring outside people into our affairs; but that is the spirit of arbitration - a spirit which I hope this Parliament will foster in the minds of the people of Australia. Something has been said already about Australia creating and maintaining a fleet of her own; and I do not wish to sit down before referring to that aspect of the question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> stated that the same objections would apply in connexion with an Australian-owned Squadron as applies to a hired squadron. At that time I. said that 1 had not proposed an Australian-owned squadron, but now I am going to do so as an. alternative. I should not have an Australian owned squadron immediately. </para>

                            <para>- I would start whenever we had the money in hand. Under present conditions, it is suggested that we shall still maintain our present naval ships - the <inline font-style="italic">Protector,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus,</inline> the torpedo boats, and the two gun-boats in Queensland. As we are still to keep these ships, I suggest that they should be improved. I know that to bring the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> up-to-date it would be necessary to give the vessel a 'certain amount of strengthening, but that work could be carried out in Port Adelaide at the expenditure of a few thousand pounds! I am sure that in Port Adelaide there are men both able and willing to make the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> as strong and capable as any vessel that could be built at the present day. When the vessel had been strengthened the power of her engines could be increased and her speed augmented from fourteen knots to eighteen or twenty knots. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> who knows something about the construction of vessels, will -agree that machinery above a certain power cannot be put into a vessel except she be of a certain strength. The strength of . the vessel must be in proportion to the power and weight of the machinery; and the same rule applies to armament. For the expenditure of about £10,000 the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> could be made an up-to-date vessel, with a speed of eighteen or twenty knots, - carrying one 8-inch gun and four 6-inch guns - a vessel which, properly manned, no other vessel except the <inline font-style="italic">Royal Arthur</inline> could get near. With 200 men, the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> could out-manoeuvre or destroy either the <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Wallaroo,</inline> although the latter had twice the number of men and arms they possess at present. I have been on board the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus,</inline> and, having seen iron before, I can assure honorable senators that that vessel is almost as sound as on the day she was built. All that the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline> wants is bringing up to date, and treating in the same way as I suggest the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> should be treated. </para>

                            <para>- So far as the two little gun-boats in Queensland are concerned, it does not matter what .people say about their strength, they are exactly the class of boats required for the position. They are able to protect Brisbane River and Moreton Bay from attacks of cruisers from any part of the world. They are of light draft, and can go where it would be impossible for heavy cruisers to go ; and they could be strengthened and improved. If Sydney has no vessels of the kind, one equal to the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> could be obtained for £100,000 or £150,000. What we want for Australian coast defence is not so much battle-ships as "watch-dogs." In Melbourne we want vessels which could go outside the Heads and reconnoitre. If any suspicious vessels were observed they could be attacked, . but if they were too strong, then the Australian ships ought to have speed enough to get inside the Heads behind the submarine mines or torpedoes, and under the shelter of the forts. That is the class of vessel we want for the protection of Australian commerce, which does not consist in our business with the outside world, but in the business between one Australian port and another. If the <inline font-style="italic">Protects;</inline> when lying outside Investigator Straits, saw any suspicious vessels cruising about she could give warning to any of the intercolonial boats which were about to leave. That would mean only a few days' delay to the intercolonial boats, and our commerce would be protected. But how are we to get such vessels? We already have some admirably adapted for the work, and at very little cost we could get others. During the last fifty years there has been no possibility of invasion ; and is it not quite reasonable to expect that for as long in the future there will be no trouble? We want swift vessels, well armed for their size, which can go out on observation duty, and in case of danger return under the forts and warn those in charge of the defences ashore. If they do that work, they are doing pretty well all that is really required. But how are we to get them ? We have not had a war for a long time, nor are we likely to have one. Let us decide not to enter into this agreement, and to save £94,000 a year for a period of ten years. If we adhere to the old agreement we shall still have the protection of the Auxiliary Squadron, and we can do something to force the Admiralty to bring their boats up to elate and to carry out the promises which they made in 1887. If that course were taken, at the end of ten years we should have saved nearly £1,000,000, when we could get as many vessels of an effective class as the present squadron comprises, and have what is so often spoken of - the nucleus of an Australian Navy. I hope that we all anticipate that within ten years prosperity will return to Australia, that with the increase of her population the revenue will, increase, and that at the end of that time we shall be in a better position to increase the annual amount which we are prepared to pay for naval defence. When we are in a position to do that we can increase our naval strength, and I am sure that the security of the people of Australia will be assured. I have no desire, I was going to say, to aggravate honorable senators by keeping them unduly late. I like to be reasonable. I have put the position from my point of view, which may seem a ridiculous one in the eyes of some persons. If my suggestions are worth anything, honorable senators can consider them ; otherwise they can throw them aside. If, in face of the great cry all over Australia for economy, they are prepared to throw away £94,000 a year, they will have to answer to the people. It will not be the fault of those who have endeavoured to warn the Senate against its foolishness. The supporters of the Bill must answer to the people, and I hope that when the time comes the people will consider all that has been said, and that their verdict will be in favour of economy. </para>

                        <para>. - The debate has lasted for five sitting days. The question has been discussed from every point of view - in fact, up to . the. very limits of order. Topics of every kind have been introduced, which could by any possibility throw any. light on the matter which we have to decide. I admit that it is one of the most important questions which the Senate has had to consider, and on which every honorary senator ought to feel, and I hope does feel, a sense of the responsibility of the vote which he is to give. I wish to dissociate myself from the one or two senators who have accused the opponents of this agreement of want of patriotism. I believe that every honorable senator is animated by the desire to do what is best in the interests of Australia. We take different views of our duty, but I believe that we are all aiming' at the same object. It appears to me that, as the matter has been discussed so fully, it is not in the interests of discussion or argument that I should prolong the debate. Many of those who have opposed the Bill have answered each other : many of them have answered themselves ; and those who have not been dealt with in that way have been answered by the many admirable speeches which have been made from this side of the Chamber. I hope that we shall now, however, go to a division, and I propose that afterwards we shall go into Committee <inline font-style="italic">pro forma.</inline></para>

                            <para>- It is a protest against the action of the anti Australian party. We have heard the arguments, so-called, advanced by the supporters of the Bill, and the arguments put forward by its opponents. I submit that the better plan would be for the Senate to agree to refer the Bill to a Select Committee, which could send for expert witnesses, and witnesses who are not particularly expert but who could give evidence that might induce some honorable senators to take a different view. It could inquire how far the Admiralty had carried out their promises with regard to the last agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> has said that their promises have been carried out to the full extent. We think it could be proved that it has not been done. If that could be proved,- no doubt it would have a striking effect on the character of the report to the Senate. The Committee could call experts like Captain Creswell aud others to show whether the views put forward by those who favour an Australian Navy are sound ; whether it would be possible for us even to establish the nucleus of an Australian Navy. Captain Creswell and other Australian officers could say how far, in their opinion, the vessels in the possession and" control of the Commonwealth would be suitable for the purpose of an Australian Navy. </para>

                            <para>- Captain Creswell and others could give us information. What I am anxious for the Select Committee to do is to find out the intention of the Government with regard to their naval employes. They seem to contemplate, with a good deal of lightheartedness, the discharge of 1,000 and more - naval employes. I want to ascertain to what degree they propose to take into consideration the interests of these men. It is said that it is not at present proposed to discharge them, but that the intention is to find out how many of them may be absorbed in the Australian Squadron. </para>

                            <para>- After the ruling which you have given I hope that the New South Wales itineraries will keep quiet. I want the Select Committee to take evidence in order to ascertain to what extent injury will be done by this Bill, and as to how many of the 1,000 men are to be dispensed with. I also want to inquire how far the Admiralty carried out their old agreement, and what prospect there is of their carrying out the new one ? The third point as to which I desire that inquiry shall be made is, whether the men already in the forces will be employed in the new squadron, and whether there will be any injury to them if they are not so employed ? I deprecate any hurry in a matter involving the expenditure of £2,000,000. A further point as to which inquiry might be made is whether there is any possibility of our being able to subsidize the McllwraithMcEacharn line of steamers, the Burns Philp line, and other lines that trade upon our coast, so that their vessels might be placed in such a condition as to be available in case invasion threatened our shores. The evidence that could be taken on these points would be most valuable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> urges that, as we have been discussing the motion for the second reading for five days, we ought now to go into Committee. But I protest against proceeding another stage to-night. I shall protest against the Bill at every stage. If there were forty stages I would protest against at each of them. </para>

                        <para>- I second the motion that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee. I particularly claim the votes of several honorable senators. I would draw attention to the fact that last session we appointed a Select Committee to deal with the question of the steamship service between Tasmania and the main land. It will be just to consider the report of the committee and the evidence which it took. The committee inquired into " the best means to adopt for improving the steam-ship communication " and "the estimated cost involved in the adoption of such means." In the fourth paragraph of its report the committee says- Evidence has been given to your Committee relative to the advisableness of the Government of the Commonwealth owning a line of steamers to connect Tasmania with the other States of the Commonwealth. Your Committee are of opinion that such a proposal should be considered in connexion with any movement for the'acquisition by the Federal Government of the railways of the several States, and in connexion with the question of defence, respecting which evidence has also been given to your Committee as to the possibility of constructing steamers for the Tasmanian Australian trade with a view to their utilization in time of war as a valuable adjunct to Commonwealth defence. </para>

                        (New South Wales - "Vice-President of the Executive Council). - Neither the mover of this motion, nor the seconder of it, has given the slightest shred of a reason for supporting it. This Bill has been thoroughly discussed from every point of view, and no mention was made in the debate of any advantage that might be derived from referring the measure to a Select Committee. Not a word was said on that point. No doubt it was recognised that there would be nothing gained from such a suggestion. The motion for the second reading has been carried by fifteen votes to nine - that is, by a majority of six in a Senate of twenty-four. The reasons now put forward are palpably illusory. It is quite evident that no advantage whatever can be derived by sending the Bill to a Select Committee, nor can there be any result except the wasting of a great' deal more time. I take it that the Senate will recognise that the majority must rule. As the majority has decided that the Bill shall be read a second time, there should be some very strong reasons given before the Senate decides not to go into Committee with it at once. We should only stultify ourselves if we allowed ourselves to be led into the ridiculous position of affirming the principle of a Bill, and then referring it to a Select Committee, for the purpose of discovering some reason why it should not be approved of. I do not want to help my honorable friends who are taking this action, by speaking any longer, but I hope that the Senate will, by even a larger majority than before, reject the motion.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has complained that no one has given a reason why this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. I think the honorable and learned senator could not have listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> because the honorable senator gave several reasons why this course should be adopted. I propose in a few minutes to fill any gaps which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> may have left, by giving some extremely good reasons why this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee.. Before I do so I wish to reply to the extraordinary argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> in reference to the majority which the Government obtained in the recent division. As the honorable and learned senator has pointed out, the majority was one of fifteen to nine in a Senate of twenty-four. As a matter of fact it is clear that the Government have not secured an absolute majority of the Senate in favor of this Bill. There are twelve members of the Senate who are absent and who have not voted, and it is impossible to say how their votes would have gone. </para>

                                is begging the whole question. What I said was that in the opinion of many persons this Bill could not be amended in Committee ; and I say that obviously it is a Bill which should be referred to a Select Committee in order that the position should be investigated, and that we may have a report submitted to the Senate as to the powers of a Committee of the Whole in dealing with it.
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                                has said that if the Select Committee recommended an alteration it would be impossible for the Committee of the Senate to adopt that alteration. That is only the opinion of the honorable and learned senator, and it is with a view of testing that opinion that I maintain that this Select Committee should be appointed. If we refer to the Standing Orders we shall find that, after a Bill has been referred to a Select Committee and reported upon, the Senate Can then go into Committee of the Whole. The question is put - " That the President do now leave the Chair and the Senate resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for the consideration of the Bill," which being resolved in the affirmative, the Senate resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole upon the Bill. I submit that if that is feasible, and I have every reason to believe that it is strictly in accordance with our Standing Orders, it is nonsense for
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                                to say that it would be impossible for the Committee of the Senate to adopt the recommendations of the Select Committee if they dealt with any amendment. It stands to - reason that the Select Committee would not suggest any alteration of the agreement unless the members of it had previously satisfied themselves that it was absolutely within the power of the Committee of the Senate to make amendments if they were thought necessary. Many of us, while admitting that we have been beaten on the second reading of the Bill, are still of opinion that there are a number of minor matters in it which ought to be altered in Committee. I propose to touch upon a few of them, in order that the Senate may realize how extremely important it is that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. In the first place, the question arises whether we ought, in principle, to accept any measure which comes up to us from another place in which an appropriation is embodied in a machinery Bill.

                            <para>- I do not think that is a question which the Select Committee could inquire into, unless there is some addition made to the motion before the Senate. I desire only that the Senate shall not be under any misunderstanding as to what is being done. If this Bill is referred to a Select Committee, that committee can. deal only with the matters referred to it. I do not think it can deal with a constitutional question such as that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> unless the Senate gives it power to do so. And I do not think the Senate would give it power to do so by a simple reference of the Bill to a Select Committee. Honorable senators know that neither a Committee of the Whole nor a Select Committee can inquire into any matter which the Senate does not order them to inquire into. They must get an order from the Senate to make the inquiry, either express or by necessary implication. </para>

I mention that incidentally only in order to convince honorable senators that it is not a frivolous amendment. It is one which was brought forward by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth ; but, to my mind, -it was unfortunately dismissed in another place with but scant debate. I have read all that was said upon the occasion, and every word I read impressed me more and more with the absolute importance of the addition to this Bill of some such clause as was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> view is right it would be absolutely impossible for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to move in this direction. </para>

                            <para>- I beg the honorable and learned senator's pardon. 1 remember that he did use the word "agreement,"but I understood him to refer to the whole Bill as the agreement. I quite appreciate the honorable and learned senator's objection now;, and it has rendered it necessary for me to explain that other legal members of the Senate have expressed the opinion that the Bill itself cannot be amended. </para>

The only question is whether the Bill shall be referred to a Select Committee, and afterwards to a Committee of the Whole, or whether it shall be referred to the Committee of the Whole at once. The Committee of the Whole can do everything a Select Committee can do except take evidence, and to take evidence is the only object of a Select Committee.

A Select Committee cannot bind either a Committee of the Whole, or the Senate. The Chairman of Committees will have to give a ruling in Committee of the Whole if any amendment be proposed. </para>

                            <para>- I submit that the Select Committee can take evidence as to whether or not this particular portion of the schedule is necessary to the agreement. I maintain that it is absolutely unnecessary, and many other honorable senators are of the same opinion. It is a matter on. which the Senate should ' not accept the simple affirmation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that it cannot be altered. There are other matters on which it is absolutely essential that evidence should be taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> stated that certain numbers of men will be employed on specific ships, and a Select Committee could take evidence as to whether there is any reason to suppose from the agreement that such will be the case. I see no evidence of that in the agreement, and I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that there is the least likelihood that the men will be thus employed, or that specific ships will be used for the purpose ; and on this point it is desirable to have the evidence of expert naval men. The most important part of the Bill is that relating to the reserves, and I am anxious to urge on the Government that Captain Creswell, Captain Hixson, or other experts employed by the Government, should be asked to throw some light on the operation of those clauses. Personally , I am satisfied that the clauses will be found to be absolutely inoperative. Another point on which the Senate should receive information through the medium of a Select Committee is the jurisdiction under which the Australian sailors of the Naval Reserve would be placed. I have given some small attention to the matter, and I am satisfied that no member of the Senate has the least idea of what the position of these men will be under the Imperial Discipline Act. Then, again, there is the question of the special rate of pay,, on which special information ought to be available. It is understood that this special rate of pay will be in the form of a retention, to be handed to the men at the close of their services. Under the Naval Discipline Act any penalties inflicted on sailors is invariably accompanied by loss of their reserve pay. So far as I can judge, sailors, who might be attracted to the British Navy by promise of these Australian rates, of pay would for the least misdemeanour find all their accumulated pay forfeited. Another point on which we have had no information whatever, and on which we ought to have expert advice, is referred to in article 7,. which shows the two classes into which the Naval Reserve is to be- divided. I have been unable to obtain personally any information, nobody in Melbourne apparently understanding the question. I alluded to this point in my address, and I certainly expected that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> would have taken some trouble to explain the point, but he apparently was in the same dark condition as myself. According to the clause, the Naval Reserve is to be divided into two classes, one class consisting of those who have served three years on board one of  His  Majesty's ships, and another- class consisting of those who have not so served. That is a question upon which we cannot express an opinion without expert advice, and the Government ought to have taken some small pains to post themselves as to the operation of the clause. </para>

                            <para>- The agreement has to run for a. period of ten years, and a most remarkable want of knowledge has been displayed as to the terms of the commissions of the ships. Each of the ships has to be commissioned for a certain number of years, which, we have been told, may be from three to five, though nobody seems to have any exact information. That is a point on which we are entitled to receive expert advice. I hope honorable senators will not think I have spoken at too great length. It must be remembered that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> distinctly said that nobody had given a single reason why this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee, and, under the circumstances, it was absolutely necessary that something further should be said on the subject. I hope I have satisfied honorable senators that there are good, valid, and most important reasons why a Select Committee should bo appointed. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                        said that no. reasons had been advanced why this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee, he was merely adopting the r61e of a barrister in a court of law in regard to evidence produced by the other side. His suggestion that our object in moving the motion is merely to tie up the Bill is not fair to us. Perish the thought that we should tie up the Bill in this fashion. We only desire a Select Committee to be appointed. The matter brought forward by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                        was overlooked by some of us. It is most important that the Select Committee should inquire whether it would be wise to construct a vessel to carry on certain services in connexion with Tasmania, and at the same time to be used for defence purposes. There are other matters for investigation, such as, for example, some proposals I have made.

I propose that the Select Committee should inquire whether there is any condition in the agreement which could prevent the carrying of an amendment that the soldiers and the sailors shall be prohibited from using the dum dum bullet on an enemy. That, I think, is a fair matter for consideration. The Select Committee would have a right to inquire whether we should use civilized methods of warfare, or resort to the methods of the savage and the tyrant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> said that the Select Committee could only bring up a report suggesting an alteration, and that we could not amend the Bill. </para>
