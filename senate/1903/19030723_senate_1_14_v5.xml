                    <para>- I regret in this second discussion of the question to find the leader of the Senate taking the attitude which he is taking. I regret that I do not find myself, as I so often am, in accord with him. Judging from the way in which he argued yesterday he does not seem to have that sincere conviction of the correctness of his view which he usually entertains when he addresses the Chamber. I had hoped at the outset to be able to say. that in dealing with the matter on this occasion I could dispense with the argument with reference to what has now been almost worn threadbare, the question of whether a charge or burden on the people is synonymous with a charge or burden on the consolidated revenue. Before dealing even with that I wish to say that I entirely deprecate the attitude which is taken in certain quarters of assuming and also of assuring the public that this discussion is unimportant. I also deprecate the attitude which is assumed by certain persons of attributing to honorable senators who insist upon the right of the Senate to amend this Bill a desire to show hostility towards another place. It is nothing of the kind. A position has been created necessitating our taking one of two courses - either of continuing to maintain that we have the right to amend or of retracing our steps and putting in place of our amendment a request. It is our duty to face that position and to apply ourselves to a solution of the problem which confronts us with a due regard to the principle involved, recognising, of course, that the importance of that principle is not to be measured as some would have us do, by the quality of the legislation in the Bill. I think it is the duty of all honorable senators to come to a decision on the question as to whether the Senate has the right to make an amendment or a request, after a due consideration of all the circumstances, but altogether untrammelled by considerations of what particular policy is embodied in the Bill. I certainly feel a considerable amount of diffidence in taking the course I am taking when I find that the leader of the Senate is supported, and supported so strongly, by the leader of the Opposition. But still I should like to point out that there is one aspect of the question of what is meant by a charge or burden on the people which has not yet, I think, been presented in this Chamber or in the other House. If the argument which has been adopted by those who say that the amendment imposes &#34;a charge or burden on the people&#34; be pursued to its logical conclusion, as it was by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> on a previous occasion, the position taken up is this : that by an increased draft on the revenue we lessen the amount returnable to the several States, and by reason of that fact some States may be obliged to have recourse to additional taxation in order to supply a deficiency. If that is the way in which honorable senators are construing the phrase, they are acting in direct defiance of paragraph (3) of section 53 of the Constitution, which says - </para>

                <para class="block">It does not say that the Senate may not amend a Bill &#34; so as to increase the charges or burdens on the people&#34; which are in existence. Does it mean so as to increase a charge or burden on the people - any charge, in any circumstances, imposed on the people? No; it refers to a charge or burden on the people thenproposed. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It must not be taken, therefore, to apply to an increase of burdens or charges on the people generally, whether present or prospective. It must be taken to apply to a case of a burden or charge that is being proposed at the particular time. In connexion with this we see that in the first instance taxation is the imposition of a charge or burden on the people, and I contend that in that sense this appropriation cannot be held to be a charge or burden on the people. The proceeds of taxation form revenue. If that revenue is in any way appropriated, if the requirements of the Crown necessitate drawing upon that revenue, can it be said that that involves an additional charge or burden on the people? When, for instance, a charge or burden on the people to the extent of &#163;100,000 has been imposed by taxation, when the amount has been collected we say that a burden or charge has been imposed on the people to the extent of &#163;100,000. If, subsequently, &#163;80,000 of that sum is appropriated, can it be said that that &#163;80,000 appropriation is also a charge or burden on the people ? If so, we should have a total charge or burden on the people to the extent of &#163;180,000, and only &#163;100,000 of money affected. It cannot be a charge or burden on the people when first collected and also when afterwards appropriated. If that were held to be a correct reading, when the whole of the &#163;100,000 was expended there would have been a charge or burden on the people of double the amount, according to those who contend that in this instance we should make a request and not an amendment. The people, although they would only have paid &#163;100,000, would, when that sum had been appropriated, have sustained a charge or burden of &#163;200,000. The section, therefore, can only apply to a charge or burden proposed at the particular time - <inline font-style="italic">in praesenti,</inline> as the phrase has it - and after it has been collected and has become the King&#39;s revenue, no subsequent disposition of that revenue can be said to be a charge or burden on the people within the meaning of this section. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> in dealing with this matter, argued that the ultimate effect of the amendment in this case would probably be that owing to the increased amount distributed, there would be lessened surpluses returned to the States, and that the States would have to resort to taxation to make up the deficiency. But I point out that if that is required to be done, that will be a charge or burden on the people <inline font-style="italic">in futuro.</inline> It will only be a probable charge or burden, and not a &#34; proposed charge or burden,&#34; which under this section of the Constitution it is provided we cannot increase, because the imposition of that problematical charge or burden <inline font-style="italic">in futuro</inline> might not occur for years afterwards. We are dealing here, not with a limitation of our powers to amend any proposed laws so as to increase burdens or charges on the people generally, but any proposed charge or burden at the particular time presented to the Senate for approval. Having dealt with that point, I desire to say that I take the view with regard to this section that it does not impose any limitation upon us in respect to the particular matter before us, apart altogether from the question whether this increased appropriation is or is not a charge or burden on the people. I think that during the course of the discussion on this question here and elsewhere, there has been altogether too much stress laid upon the practice of Houses of Parliament elsewhere, and in Great Britain and Canada particularly. The attention which has been devoted to this consideration has, in my opinion, to a very great extent helped to cloud the clear issue which is really before the Committee. If we are to discover what are the powers of the Senate in this respect, we must take into consideration the whole of the Constitution, and we must stand or fall by the Constitution, and the Constitution only. We commenced this Commonwealth with a new book, so to speak, untrammelled altogether by the practice of the Parliament of the United Kingdom with respect to the relations of the two Houses in financial matters, and unfettered by any practice of the Canadian Parliament with respect to the financial powers of the two Houses. When the framers of the Constitution drafted its various sections they had regard to the experience of Great Britain in parliamentary government during the centuries that have gone by, and they did not, as the Government are doing for instance in connexion with the Patents Bill - a matter which came under our notice last week- give us a definition which enables us to have the benefits of numbers of those decisions given during centuries. No ; the framers of the Constitution acted upon an entirely different principle. Knowing the results of the decisions with regard to these matters in connexion with the British Houses of Parliament, they endeavoured to crystallize the effects of those decisions in this Constitution, at the same time of course with a due regard to the different character of this Parliament from that of the United Kingdom, and with a special regard also to the peculiarities of the particular machine of government they were then designing. When they placed these limitations in section 53 on the financial powers of the Senate, they did so for reasons which were entirely different from those which first gave rise to the established difference in the powers of the two Houses of the United Kingdom. I shall deal with that aspect of the question at greater length later. What we have to consider now is what is the position of the Senate under the Constitution, and more particularly in relation to its powers under section 53. I have said that the framers of the Constitution, in framing this legislation which limits our powers, had not only the experience of the centuries of Great Britain in parliamentary government, but they bad their eyes fixed on the future working of this peculiar machine of government they were then designing. Now, where does the Senate get its powers? According to the opinions evidently entertained by some who have taken part in this discussion, the Senate would appear to get its powers under section 53 of the Constitution. Nothing of the kind. The powers of the Senate are given to it first of all by section 1 of the Constitution. I ask the attention of honorable senators to this - </para>

                <para class="block">Then we have several other sections dealing with incidental matters until we come to section 51 of the Constitution, the one which contains what are commonly known as &#34; the 39 articles.&#34; That defines, to some extent, the jurisdiction of the Parliament. Honorable senators will bear in mind that up to that section there is not - the slightest distinction drawn in the Constitution between the powers of the Senate and those of the House &#39;of Representatives. Later om we come to section 69, and we find under the heading &#34; Executive Government &#34; that certain departments of State are to be transferred, and inferentially Parliament is to have the power of legislation in connexion with them. So far we have not the slightest suggestion of any difference whatever in the powers of the two Houses. On the contrary, under section 49 each is to have the powers of the British Commons at the date of the establishment of the Commonwealth. The limitation comes in this particular section 53. Honorable, senators will bear in mind that, apart from this section 53, there is no limitation whatever in the powers of the Senate, and it is both coequal and co-ordinate in its legislative functions with the House of Representatives. Now we come to this principle that being a limitation of the powers of one Chamber which otherwise is co-equal with the other Chamber - according to all rules of construction of statutes, this section must be construed most strictly, and in favour of the particular body whose rights are being limited. Unless the limitation is clear, precise, and definite, it cannot apply. That is the ordinary rule of construction with regard to legislation limiting the rights of any body or any individual. So that if at any time there should appear to be any doubt--anc I am not saying that I am entertaining any doubt in. this instance - whether or not the operation of this section covers certain work of the Senate, it must be construed in favour of the Senate, because this is a section of limitation. I pointed out in dealing with this matter on a previous occasion th,e significance of the words &#34; so as to &#34; in this paragraph (3) of section 53. The paragraph says - </para>
                <quote>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">In considering these words strictly, I contend that the words &#34;so as to&#34; have to be given the fullest significance in favour of this Chamber. They are not to be construed as equal to the expressions &#34; likely to be,&#34; &#34; calculated to have the effect,&#34; or anything of that kind. They must be construed absolutely strictly, and it must be patent that the amendment proposed is an amendment of such a character that its direct, immediate, and inevitable effect will be to increase some then proposed charge or burden on the people. I do not admit that there is &#34;a proposed charge or burden in this case, but I am assuming, for the sake of argument, that there is. The effect of these words, &#34;so as to,&#34; upon a strict construction, necessitates that the amendment shall be of such a character .that in the words of lawyers, <inline font-style="italic">ipso</inline><inline font-style="italic">facto,</inline> it will increase the burden or charge. What have we here <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The object of this Bill is to give a bounty to certain persons who grow sugar with white labour. It is stated that the object of the amendment is to widen the incidence of that bounty, and it is suggested that by so doing a certain larger number of persons may come in to&#34; participate in that bounty. Have we any guarantee of that? We know that there are in Queensland many growers . whose views do not coincide with those who have adopted the white Australia policy, and who have moved for the abolition of kanakas from Queensland. We know there are many planters who say that they would prefer to grow sugar with black labour rather than to grow it with white labour to secure the bounty. What absolute guarantee have we for assuming that there will be an increased charge or burden on the revenue, because there will be an extra number of participants in the bounty? It is only a probability, a high probability I admit. But that is &#39;not the construction we are to place on this section of the Constitution. I say the amendment must be of such a character that not the probability but the inevitable effect- -apart altogether from any intervening circumstance - &#39; of its operation will be to increase the charge or burden. I do not think that in construing this particular section, according to all rules of statute construction, which necessitates the construction known as <inline font-style="italic">strictissimi</inline><inline font-style="italic">juris,</inline> we can deduce any other conclusion from these particular words - &#34; so as to.&#34; </para>

It appears to me that in the discussion of the matter, here and elsewhere, there has been a disposition to regard section 53 of the Constitution as granting the rights of the Senate. It does nothing of the kind. We have heard honorable senators arguing, for instance, as to whether a request and an amendment may be moved in connexion with the same Bill, and referring to this particular section 53 as if the financial powers of the Senate were derived from this section. My argument is that the financial powers of the Senate are derived from the Constitution generally and from sections 1, 49, 51, and 69, in particular, and they are only limited by section 53. We have to look to the whole Constitution to see what is the extent of our power, but there has been a disposition, I say, in certain quarters to look to section 53 alone as being the grant of the powers of the Senate instead of the limitation of them. </para>

                        <para>- That has been the tendency displayed, and the honorable senator, on reference to the debates in the Senate and in the other Chamber, will see that arguments have been based on the powers of the Senate as defined by section 53, ignoring the fact that that section is not the grant, but the limitation of those powers. That is a fallacy which has led some honorable senators into considering what is provided under the Constitution, from an entirely wrong point of view. They have viewed section 53 in an entirely different way from that in which they should have viewed it, and they have omitted to consider the rest of the Constitution. It is the section which confers legislative power upon the Senate and the other House, the section which defines the powers of the Houses, the particular section which defines the limits of jurisdiction of the Parliament, and the other section which refers to transferred departments in connexion with which inferentially we have the power to legislate - as is these particular sections which confer the powers of the Senate, and section 53 is simply introduced as a section to limit those powers in certain circumstances to a certain extent. Why were . the Senate&#39;s powers limited in regard to money matters ? Was it because the Senate is unrepresentative of the people as is the House of Lords? Was it because we do not properly represent the people as in the case of the nominee Canadian Senate, or in a lesser degree certain Legislative Councils in some of the self-governing British possessions? We know that although originally the financial preponderance of the House of Commons arose out of the insistent demands of the people that their representatives, and their representatives only, should hold the purse-strings, during the course of the last century it has been found that the financial preponderance of one House makes for the stability and permanence of the cabinet system of government ; because it has been considered that if the two Houses had co-equal powers, it would then be a matter almost of impossibility, in many instances, that the Cabinet should maintain simultaneous majorities in both Houses. Although the original reason for the establishment of the difference in the powers of the two British Houses was the unrepresentative character of one as compared with the other, still a great reason why it has been maintained in Constitutions where two Chambers are representatives of the people is because it has now come to be considered a necessary adjunct of responsible government. This leads us to consider how far effect has been given to that principle in section 53. The Cabinet system of government could not be carried on if the Cabinet had a majority in one House, and if the other House refused to vote the ordinary supplies they required for the year, or if their policy of taxation was approved in one Chamber and thrown out by the other. But going beyond those two classes of cases equal powers, especially in the case of two Chambers which are representative, will not be inimical to the maintenance of responsible government. Consequently we find in section 53 that this Senate has no power to originate or amend the ordinary annual Appropriation Bill or Bills imposing taxation. These are practically the two matters upon which it is absolutely essentia&#93; a Cabinet Government shall have a majority behind them if they are to remain in office. But what -of this Bill now before us <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is it a Bill imposing taxation <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Certainly not. Is it a Bill the loss of which would place the Government in such a position - I am speaking purely with regard to the financial portions of the measure - that it would be difficult for them to carry on administration of the country&#39;s affairs. I say it is not such a Bill. The whole of the limitations contained in section 53 were intended to secure the proper working of the Cabinet system of government - to secure that the Cabinet should be able to carry on the government with a working majority in the other place, even if there were a majority against them in this Chamber. The majority in this Chamber on questions of general policy might reverse the decision of another place, and that reversal would not affect the Government ; but if this Chamber had equal powers in regard to the appropriation of moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government, or equal powers with regard to taxation, then there might be complete disorganization of the governmental machine, and legislation and administration would come to a stand-still. But. could the amendment of this Bill bring government to a stand-still ? No ; and that is the test we can apply when we consider the history of the framing of the Constitution, and the object and meaning of section 53. </para>

                        <para>- There is no appropriation of a definite sum. If there had been, and wen had proposed to appropriate a larger sum, we should certainly then be amending a law so as to increase the appropriation, or increase the charge or burden on the people or on the revenue, according as we might &#39;view it. In the absence of any definite sum proposed, and construing this section strictly, we must not have regard to the &#34; may be &#34; or &#34; might be,&#34; or any of the possibilities, but to what we know to be the immediate effects as shown by the amendment itself. The amendment must be of such a character and quality that its immediate and direct effect, apart from any intervening circumstances, will be to increase the proposed charge or burden! on the people. I therefore intend to adhere to the attitude I held when this matter was previously before us - first, because I do not consider this amendment to involve a charge or burden on the people within the meaning of section 53. Again, even if this were allowed to be a charge or burden on the people, I contend that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> amendment does not, <inline font-style="italic">ipsofacto,</inline> increase that burden. Further, there is no definite appropriation of any particular sum in the aggregate for carrying out this policy, and there has not been and cannot bc any definite increase of any sum. Further, I say that section 53 is a limitation of the powers of the Senate, which are otherwise equal with those of the House of Representatives, and, being such a limitation, it must be construed strictly. The section must be construed in the light of the fact that its limitations are designed for the maintenance of the system of responsible government, and that the competence of this Senate to pass an amendment of the character now before us is not calculated to prejudice the existence of that system. </para>

If I wanted to follow his illustrious example, I think I should commence my few remarks this afternoon by submitting, without any personal reference to any member of the Chamber, a very old-fashioned conundrum. That conundrum is - &#34; Why is a lawyer like a restless sleeper,&#34; to which the answer is - &#34; Because he lies on one side, and then turns and lies on the other.&#34; That, in a Pickwickian sense, is unfortunately the attitude which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has taken up on this question, as I shall prove from words which fell from the honorable and learned gentleman&#39;s own lips, and which are recorded in that most inconvenient publication known as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> occupied about three hours yesterday afternoon in demolishing an hypothesis which he most emphatically insisted upon three weeks ago. I can understand a lawyer doing that sort of thing in connexion with the practice of his profession ; we know that lawyers are briefed, and have duties to discharge, and when they are brought, as they sometimes are, into juxtaposition with awkward circumstances in their professional work, they are necessarily allowed some liberty. </para>

                    <para>We have, I submit, a right to amend this Bill according to the Constitution. Section 53 of the Constitution provides that we may not amend laws imposing taxation or appropriating revenue for the ordinary annual services of the Government. We are here appropriating revenue for a specific purpose by statute. It seems to me, therefore, that these proposals should not be put as requests, but as amendments. </para>

                <para class="block">With an emphatic declaration so nicely and concisely phrased, a number pf us agreed, and we were rather taken aback at the laboured eloquence with which the honorable and learned gentleman yesterday sought to destroy his previous argument. I suppose the honorable and learned senator had forgotten, and, like the restless sleeper, he turned over and not only demolished his own argument, but, with a zeal worthy of a better cause, sought to depreciate the position of this Senate in the Constitution of the Commonwealth. I remember very well that at the time of the Federal elections, there were none more eloquent or more consistent than the Prime Minister and the Vice-President of the Executive Council in claiming that New South Wales, at any rate, should return only men who would maintain the Constitution. They said in effect - Perish everything but the maintenance of the Constitution <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> But we find here, at an early stage of our career, just as we found in the very first Bill sent up from another place, a deliberate effort made to belittle the position of this Chamber. That effort was repeated in the speech put into the mouth of the Governor-General at the close of the last session of Parliament, denying in effect that this Chamber has any function in the granting of supply. That was ah assault upon the position of this Chamber under the Constitution, which the Postmaster-General, when I sought to have an address presented to the Governor-General on the subject, promised, in the event of our letting him off, should not again occur. Following up the idea that this is to be merely a Chamber of revision, requiring the presence of only one paid Minister out of seven - following those continued assaults to which I have referred, we find now an urgent appeal made to us to do - what ? To go back on a deliberate vote arrived at by a very large majority - a majority whose excess was actually larger than the minority who voted - and to place ourselves in the extraordinary position of turning the other cheek to receive another buffet. I must own to a feeling of regret .at the action of certain honorable senators on this question. We can take no exception to those who constituted the minority on the previous occasion maintaining the same attitude now, but I do feel surprised, and in some degree pained, that honorable senators who were manly enough and clear enough in their mental perception of the position to vote for the amendment last time, should now, having been told point blank by &#39;some other authority somewhere - an authority with no more power to interpret the Constitution than we have - that they were wrong, be willing to turn the other cheek with Christian resignation ready to receive the other buffet which will follow. As sure as we are discussing this question, a strong, if not successful effort will be made elsewhere to meet with an equal rebuff any attempt made by this Chamber to obtain what it desires by request. I shall vote against the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> and I shall certainly vote against seeking a repetition of the rebuff by voting for any request. Though my  speech will be brief, I wish to elaborate some of the remarks which were made with very great clearness and ability by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> The only reason 1 repeat those remarks at all, is because I made notes of similar points last night, with the intention of speaking on them to-day. I should like to make one or two brief quotations, though I do not think it necessary to repeat any of those which were used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer.</inline> I desire to emphasize the fact that in my opinion there is the greatest possible difference between the meanings of some of the terms which certain honorable senators have mixed up together in their speeches. We are told by one speaker at one stage of his discourse that a duty is a burden on the people ; and to that we all assent. But the same speaker at another stage eloquently alleges that the appropriation of the proceeds of that duty is another burden on the people. How can we have two burdens on the people in the matter of a &#163;6 per ton duty on sugar? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> used pretty much the same argument, and dealt in a general way with hundreds of thousands of pounds; I shall take the simple duty of  &#163;6 per ton on sugar. Are we to be told that when the people have paid the &#34;burden,&#34; and the money is paid into the King&#39;s hands, that the distribution of the revenue from the duty of &#163;6, is another burden on the people 1 Are two burdens to be manufactured out of one payment? It is impossible to follow the argument that every appropriation of money is a burden on the people. I want to draw the distinction that lies between a burden on the people and a charge on the revenue. The enacting of a. duty is placing a burden on the people, as we all admit ; but the appropriation of the revenue derived from it is not a new burden on the people, but is simply a charge on the revenue. The quotations which I shall make will strike at the initiation of the whole matter.

                    <para>In this reign (Charles LT. ) we first meet with the imposition of permanent taxes. . . . . Above all in it was established the great principle of appropriating supplies. ...

                <para class="block">We have come away from that state of affairs to some extent in dealing with appropriations at the hands of Parliament, but the theory still holds good that the money granted by Parliament in the form of a tax is the property, for the time being, of the monarch, and is disbursed in his service. In England, for instance, the money is raised by Parliament, and is devoted to the maintenance of the King&#39;s navy, the King&#39;s army, and the King&#39;s officers of State in many directions. Here we have not got away from that in theory, although we have got away from it in phraseology to some slight extent. In this Chamber, honorable senators now present assented, without debate, without protest, to the passing of the Excise Tariff Bill which, in section 5 - -leaving out the words relating to the dates when the duties are to be paid - says :- </para>

                <para>It is a duty of Parliament to appropriate these moneys; and they are not less the moneys of the King, because His Majesty cannot personally hold and disburse them. They are held and disbursed under the supervision of the officers of State, and under the direction of votes of Parliament, Parliament doing the work which the monarch would otherwise have to do personally. We have followed the theoretic principle laid down so far back as the time of Charles II., when permanent duties were first enacted under the British Constitution,, and in this matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> amendment we are not dealing with a burden on the people, but a charge on the King&#39;s revenue. I do not see how it is possible to waive away the plain simple statement in the &#39; two Acts I have quoted - that it is the King&#39;s money and not the people&#39;s money voted for the purposes of. the government of the country under the Constitution of which  His  Majesty is made&#39; part. </para>

                        <para>- In one respect perhaps it is not part of the document, but it is part of the Constitution. I cannot conceive how any honorable senators will deliberately set about to deceive themselves on the point as to whether the moneys which are involved in this amendment are the moneys of the King or the moneys of the people. If. they are the moneys of the people we cannot be creating a fresh burden on the people by merely distributing them. I wish to refer to the question of whether the distribution of the money involves an increase of the burden on the people from another stand-point, and that is what the people may be called upon to pay. Under the Customs Tariff Act, the duty on cane sugar is &#163;6 per ton, , and on beet sugar &#163;10 per ton. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> aims at so promoting the production of sugar that the Commonwealth will be independent of imported sugar. If that be the case, what will be the result? Instead of paying, as a large proportion of the people have to do today, duty at the rate of -.6 a ton on cane sugar, and &#163;10 a ton on beet sugar, they will pay at the rate of &#163;1 a ton. Locally-grown sugar- is subject to an excise duty of &#163;3 a ton, and &#163;2 of that sum has to be returned in a bonus, so that what the people will be called upon to pay on the sugar, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> achieves his object, is a duty of &#163;1 a ton. How can it be alleged that the amendment increases, the. burden on the people if they are to get their sugar at a duty of &#163;1 a ton, instead of duties of &#163;6 and &#163;10 a ton? The proposition is so transparent that I fail to understand how honorable senators could befog themselves by trying to prove the very opposite of what is the simplest sum in arithmetic. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as the leader of this side of the House. So far as we have seen on this question, with the exception of one senator, he leads himself and no one else. </para>

                        <para>- It has been made abundantly clear in the course of the debate. I am not belittling <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in stating a plain fact. There is no concerted action, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> remarks implied, for no party issue is involved. If these benches are in any way to be regarded as occupied chiefly or wholly by freetrade members, the leader in chief of the free-trade party, who occupies that position outside the Chamber, is at variance with us. There can be no evidence of any party action. I absolutely repudiate the idea that there is or has been any party action. So far as I know, on both sides of the Chamber, every honorable senator - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is a living example of what I am saying - has occupied a position of absolute independence in his action. It would be most unfortunate if ever a question involving the rights and the dignity of the Senate were permitted to be dragged into the slough of party politics. Let us, at least as far as we can, avoid the introduction of any party question in connexion with our insistence on the rights which a large number of us believe are granted to us, not as a privilege, but under the Constitution. I have no desire to elaborate my arguments at greater length. I believe the Senate will be making the greatest mistake it has ever made if, after deciding that its duty was to amend, it should simply, because it has received a rebuff elsewhere, admit that it was absolutely wrong, and did not understand its constitutional obligations and rights by reversing its decision and saying - &#34;Oh, well, we made a mistake. &#34;We will try something else,&#34; without any additional arguments having been adduced to show us that we were wrong. The statement of the leader in another place was at absolute variance with his words when he was leader of the Convention. When we find that a distinguished gentleman occupies an absolutely contradictory attitude in two positions - one as leader of a Convention and one as leader of another place - and that he is backed up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who, in the short space of less than a month, has absolutely contradicted himself here, I wish to know with what confidence any honorable senator can approach the other House and ask that a request  may be granted instead of an amendment being concurred in <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If we have the power to insist on our amendment, surely it is more dignified to insist than to throw away the right of insistence, and say - &#34; May we with bated breath and trembling knees ask to be generously allowed to make a request, which we are very sorry we ventured to submit as an amendment.&#34; I regret that so much time has been occupied in this discussion. I do not think that I am open to blame because in the previous lengthy debate I took no part, and if I have spoken for a. few minutes to-day I have been justified in speaking. I do not always feel bound to take notice of the remarks of newspapers upon political matters. But when we find a great newspaper with a degree of accuracy quite unusual on the part of a newspaper writer chronicling the different stages, in a controversy, and finally saying that a House deserves well of the people throughout the Commonwealth for seeking to maintain unimpaired and intact the dignities, powers,, and rights granted to it by the Constitution, I think one may feel some little satisfaction in having not an element of support, because honorable senators ought not to rest on any newspaper for support, but an indication of a clearly expressed opinion in agreement with our own. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator used the term &#34; unmanly attitude &#34; in reference to the action about to be taken by some senators, who, he anticipated will reverse their previous votes. I shall not attempt to follow the intricacies and subtleties of the legal arguments which have been used in this Chamber. T could not do so if T tried, and I am satisfied that the only result of attempting to do so would be to make the confusion worse, and, perhaps, there would be the additional result of a headache for myself. I shall be guided as to the vote I intend to give upon this question only by the plain English meaning of the Constitution as I read it. A good deal has been said about what was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. It does not matter what they intended. I have only to guide me in this admittedly important issue the exact words that were finally agreed upon by the gentleman who framed the Constitution. These words appear to me now as they have done throughout the discussion to mean that, in this particular instance, we have not the power granted to us within the four corners of the Constitution to amend this Bill, but that we have the power to request amendments. I was, unfortunately, unable to be present on the last occasion when a vote was taken upon the question ; but when I was here I expressed myself in hearty accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> amendment, and I supported the suggestion that it should be put in the shape of a request. I have not changed that opinion, and I propose to record my vote now in the same direction. The striking feature of the debate to me is that it proves very clearly that the ten wise men who were sent by each&#34; of the colonies to frame .a Constitution for the Australian Commonwealth failed in their duty, They failed at least to this extent that they have left the particular sections, in which this matter is dealt with so ambiguously worded, that we find the leader of one branch of the Legislature taking one side, and the leader of the other branch taking another, though both of these gentlemen were leading members of the Conventions. I am reminded when I think of this of a sentence used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> during the debates at the Convention of 1891, held at Adelaide. It appears to me that it will be admitted that the Convention succeeded admirably in following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> advice. That honorable and learned senator at the Convention said - </para>

                <para class="block">The discussion in which we are at present engaged, irrespective of former discussions of a similar kind, clearly shows that the framers of the Constitution failed to scientifically draw the line showing the exact rights and privileges of the two houses, and in my opinion they failed also to make a workable arrangement, because leading members of the Convention are debating this subject from diametrically opposite points of view. It is therefore left to a layman to take up the Constitution as he finds it, as it was left by the legal minds who framed it, and read it in the light of plain commonsense, if he can. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; I admit the difficulty of placing a commonsense English interpretation on section 53, but it seems to me that in this case we have the power to request an amendment, though not the power to make an amendment. It has been said, I think by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that if we do not adhere to our amendment, but decide to send it to the other House in the shape of a request, we may find that it will be decided that there is not even the power to request left to us. It may be my obtuseness, but I really cannot conceive of any situation arising in which the Senate will not have the power either to amend or request an amendment. Although this is admittedly an important question, I may, perhaps, be permitted to say that too much importance is being attached to it. The weight of constitutional argument which has been introduced into the debate to settle this question, reminds me somewhat of the use of a steam hammer to crack an egg. Holding the view that I do, I am compelled to support the motion which has been submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. If it is carried, I shall be prepared to support a further motion that the proposed amendment be submitted to the other House in the form of a request. I should like to say that, as a representative of one of the smaller States in the Commonwealth, and knowing that this is the States House, and peculiarly guards the rights and privileges of the smaller States, I have, perhaps, more than have representatives of the larger States an interest in seeing this question properly thrashed out, and in seeing that our rights under the Constitution shall be jealously guarded. I am quite as anxious as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to see that the stamp of inferiority shall not be placed upon the Senate by the action of any of its members. I think that expression, used by the honorable and learned senator, was a little out of place. I should like to Know who among the representatives of either the. smaller or larger States is prepared to have the stamp of inferiority placed upon the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- It is not, but I think it supports my contention that too much importance has been attached to this question. In this particular instance, there is really very little difference between a request and an amendment, and as I read the Constitution we have not the power here to make an amendment, though we have the right to make a request. For the reasons given, I shall support the motion submitted by the &#34;Vice-President of the ExecutiveCouncil. </para>

                        <para>- I had the honour of being a member of the Federal Convention; and I have a very distinct recollection that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> has already reminded us, we were most anxious to make the Senate a strong House. Although I was a representative of one of the larger States, my sympathies in that matter were with the smaller States. I saw that the Senate would be most useful in protecting them, if there were any disposition on the part of the larger States to coerce them. When this amendment was first under consideration, I was tempted, during some remarks made by the Postmaster-General, to suggest that the Bill might be described as neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring. </para>

                        <para>- I am at present speaking with regard to this particular amendment. I think that it is the intention of the Bill to give all the States a fair measure of justice ; but if the amendment is thrown out, they will not be likely to secure that measure of justice which I think ought to be given to them. I received considerable light upon this subject from the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> The honorable and learned senator, in my opinion, brought forward an excellent point. I listened to him with attention, and if I had previously any doubts, the honorable and learned senator&#39;s speech solved them. I venture to remark that under certain circumstances, we may, as a Commonwealth, have a source of income which will not mean a charge or burden on the people. We have, for instance, a considerable income from the post and telegraphic services. Judging by the experience of the old country, we may in the future derive a magnificent income from those services, and honorable senators will not contend that that will be a charge or burden on the people. A learned King&#39;s Counsellor has remarked elsewhere, and I am glad to find that some leading barristers adopt the view, that an expenditure of the moneys of the Crown is not imposing a charge on the people. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable senators, and amongst them <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> as well as a learned King&#39;s Counsellor in another place, tell us that there is at times very little difference between an amendment and a request. We have been told that the difference is something like that between tweedledum and tweedledee, but it now turns out that there may be a very considerable difference. It appears that if we send a request for an amendment to another place, and it is there rejected, the responsibility for throwing out the -Bill will rest upon us ; but if we send an amendment and the other House refuses to accept our amendment, the responsibility for throwing out the Bill will be upon them. If, in this instance, we send down a request, and the other House refuses to accede to it - and, judging by the debate which took place elsewhere, some honorable members believe that we have not the right even to make a request - we shall be placed in a more undignified position than if we insist upon making an amendment, and that amendment is subsequently rejected. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that every member of the Senate is actuated by a desire to uphold the dignity of this Chamber. I think that the tone of the debate which took place in the other House was excellent, and I should like the tone of our debate to be of an equally high character. I was particularly enlightened by the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker.</inline> The honorable and learned senator was a member of the Convention which met at Sydney in 1891, and he showed us by voluminous papers which he had beside him that, under the Commonwealth Bill as submitted to that Convention, the powers of the Senate would not have been nearly so great as the Convention in 1897 and 1898 subsequently agreed to make them. I have no wish to find any fault with the drafting committee of the Convention. I know they did their best, but I am not at all clear that the Constitution as now drafted is as acceptable as it might have been made. Whole sheets of drafting amendments were submitted simply by resolution, and I am not sure . that in some of the sections of the Constitution the drafting committee did not slightly alter -what was the original intention of the Convention. We know that a consolidation of statutes is sometimes found not to be on ail-fours with the whole of the provisions of the Bills which have been consolidated. We have been told of a remarkable instance in point in connexion with a consolidation of statutes, the work, I believe, of the late Chief Justice Higinbotham, in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Mackinnon. I am not at all sure that the fault which was found with this consolidation might not, in some respects, be found with the work of the drafting committee of the Convention. I hope that if we eventually agree to send a request to the other House, and that House declines the request, the Government will bring in another Bill in which they will embody practically the amendment we have already carried here. I state my conclusions with all due deference to my honorable and learned friend and colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> whom I recognise as the leader of honorable senators on these benches. </para>

There was at one time an intention to call it the &#34; States House,&#34; but in spite of the opposition of my learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> I succeeded in the Convention im having the more dignified name adopted. The Postmaster-General and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> do not seem to be quite in agreement on this question, but I hope that that will not prove the case with the members of the Ministry in the other House, but that the latter will do their best to have the Bill carried in such a form as will be satisfactory to the Senate. Whatever takes place, we all desire that the sugar planters shall have fair play, which I do not see they can get if our views are not carried out by the House of Representatives, whether those views be presented by amendment or by request. I hope I have shown sufficient reason for opposing the motion now before the Committee. </para>

                    <para>- I shall support the proposal of the Government, which indicates the proper course to be followed by the Senate. It is singular that, whilst honorable members of another place are united in their views on this question, senators are about &#34;six of the one and half-a-dozen of the other.&#34; That is a very unfortunate position, which should be considered by those who wish to precipitate a conflict between the Houses. I cannot help observing that the two honorable senators, who are perhaps the warmest on this subject, are our military friends, Senators Gould and Neild. I suppose those honorable senators are so accustomed to the idea, if not the practice, of fighting, that they feel called upon to infuse a little military ardour even into their arguments. It has always appeared to me that the Constitution conferred upon the Senate rather greater powers than the Convention intended. The Convention decided that there should be some distinction made between the two Houses in regard to the way in which Money Bills were to be dealt with, and then the Convention proceeded to so arrange matters that the distinction was practically lost. It was as though we were expected to send down to the other House a statement of our wishes in a blue envelope instead of in a white envelope - that we were to send our proposals down and call them &#34; requests &#34; instead of calling them &#34; amendments.&#34; I do not see that the rose smells less sweet if called by any other name. To my mind the power remains with us, and we are in no danger of losing it. If we have not the straight out power of amendment in certain Bills, we have always the power of making requests, and surely that power rightly and properly used is sufficient, and is in no danger of being lost. I feel strongly that the dignity and position of this Chamber is best conserved by recognising the spirit of the Convention and of the Constitution. In my view, the Constitution calls on us to make our wishes known in a form which accords with the popular view as recognised in the Convention, and represented by the House of Representatives. If at any time a difference of opinion arises between the two Houses, and there is any uncertainty, I shall feel it my duty to unhesitatingly give the benefit of the doubt to the House of Representatives. In following that course, I shall feel that I am adopting the course which best promotes the dignity of this Chamber, and which will increase our strength for the time, if ever it comes, when we have to fight over some question of substantial importance. When the rights or privileges of the Senate are at stake, no one will be found fighting for them more strongly than myself. </para>

                    <para>- I feel that I am to some extent responsible for the present position, seeing that I was the means of introducing the amendment which forms the basis of the difference between the two Houses. It seems that the other House &#34;takes exception not to the amendment, but to the way in which it was presented by the Senate ; and it behoves us to give every possible consideration to the matter. We have to consider whether we were right in our first contention, and if so, whether it should be adhered to, or, on the other hand, whether the balance of opinion and the weight of evidence are not so much against us that it is our duty to change our attitude. I confess I share with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> though only to some extent, the perplexity of mind in which one is placed as to whether the proposed alteration in the Bill should have been submitted by amendment or as a request. My own inclination is to adhere strictly to the position which the Senate originally assumed ; but after listening most carefully to all the arguments which have been advanced during this and the previous debates, and after reading everything said by those who are capable of giving a sound and well-informed opinion - particularly those who helped to frame the Constitution - I am forced to the conclusion that this proposed alteration should have been presented as a request and not as an amendment. I am not one to close my mind against evidence, particularly evidence so weighty as that which has been given by those opposed to the view that in such a measure the Senate cannot make an amendment ; and I am bound in justice to my own conscience, and in justice to the claims as to the relative positions of the two Houses, to come to the conclusion which I have indicated. This debate is, I suppose, the most lengthy that has taken place in the Federal Parliament on a constitutional question, and the point at issue is one which we should carefully, calmly, and deliberately consider before coming to a decision. It may be said that inasmuch as I submitted the amendment in the first instance, and, further, as this is a question which very materially affects the well-being of a considerable portion of the people in my own State, I am naturally prejudiced, and that rather than run any risk of losing the measure, I may be inclined to take up a position contrary to that which the justice of the case or the Constitution warrants. But that is not so. I yield to no member of the Chamber in a desire to maintain the dignity, power, rights, and if I may use the term, privileges, of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> are both gentlemen of very great ability, whom I hold in very high esteem, but notwithstanding their strong attitude, and also the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> - a gentleman who stands exceedingly high at the Bar, and is held in great esteem as a constitutional lawyer - I maintain that unquestionably the balance of argument and of opinion in this and the other Chamber is against the position first taken up by the Senate. Regarding the matter from that point of view, I am bound to reverse mv position and to vote in favour of the proposed alteration being submitted as a request and not as an amendment. I have arrived at the conclusion in no hasty or premature manner. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that this is a most important question, and that our  decision may have far-reaching consequences, and be quoted as a precedent for all time. That consideration has weighed with me in arriving at the decision which I have announced. The debate has been an exceedingly able one on both sides, and, under the circumstances I, at any rate, do not regret the time it has occupied. I find&#39; that the Prime Minister argued strongly in the other House that the Senate had no right to make an amendment of this character, and discussed the question from every possible point of view. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, dealing with the position which he and others took up in the Federal Convention, referred to a passage from one of his own speeches quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> and while admitting that the extract was quite right up to a point, and under certain conditions, showed that it was really explanatory of quite another set of circumstances. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> the leader of the Opposition, supported the view of the Prime Minister, and was most pronounced in his opinion that the &#39; Constitution is so clear as to leave no room for doubt. </para>

                        <para>- That is the inference to be drawn from the honorable senator&#39;s interjection. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> and every other member of the House of Representatives, was bound to come to an honest conclusion upon this matter. Although he is in opposition to-day he may be a member -of a Government to-morrow. From the responsibilities of his position in the other House, and in accordance with every law known to parliamentary government in any British country, the leader of the Opposition, equally with the head of the Government is bound to maintain, not only the rights and privileges of the House to which he belongs; but of both Houses. Then, also, the Prime Minister himself was very strong in his attitude against the position which the Senate took up. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> were amongst the framers of the Constitution, and they are of opinion that we have no right to amend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said to-day that the Vice-President of the Executive Council did not feel very strongly upon this matter, judging from the manner in which he presented his case yesterday. I believe, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> feels extremely strongly. He stated that there are no misgivings or doubts in his mind. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs,</inline> one of the framers of the Constitution, is equally strong. By way of interjection, in reference to the question of the appropriation of &#34;moneys, that honorable and learned gentleman suggested a point to which I have not yet seen a single answer given. He suggested that if the Senate has the right to appropriate a small sum of money - and, of course, the appropriation under my amendment in this Bill would be comparatively small - then we have the right to appropriate the whole of the consolidated revenue for a year. I confess that that query presents itself to me as a stumbling-block. I observe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> intends to address the Committee when I have finished. I shall be glad if he will give his opinion as to whether, if the Senate has the right to appropriate a sum of money for any purpose, we have equally the right to appropriate the whole of the revenue for a year. </para>

I attach very great importance to any statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> upon a constitutional issue. I remember hearing that gentleman speak in one of the Convention debates in Melbourne, and was very much interested. He is exceedingly industrious, and invariably presents his case in the clearest possible manner. He appears to entertain no doubt with regard to the powers of the Senate in this instance, although he is a man who fully recognises the constitutional importance of the relative positions of the two Houses. I have read his speech most carefully, and I find that he strongly supports the attitude of the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- If I were convinced that our first stand was the right one, I should insist upon maintaining the position of the Senate even if it resulted in a dissolution of both Houses. In addition to the opinions of the gentlemen whom I have mentioned, we find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> B. Edwards, the member for South Sydney, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> E. Groom, speaking on the same side. There are fourteen lawyers who maintain that the Senate has no right to make the amendment in question. Whom have we on the other side ? In the first place, there is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker.</inline> There is no man whose writings and opinions on constitutional matters I have read with greater interest, for many years past, than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker.</inline> I possess his excellent manual amongst my papers, and I very often turn to it for guidance with regard to constitutional matters. I have listened to everything which he has said on each occasion when he has spoken, and have weighed his arguments carefully. But, as I have said, the balance of argument is undoubtedly against his view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> takes up the same position as does the President. He is an undoubted authority upon constitutional matters and a strong stickler for the rights of the Senate, particularly as they affect the interests of the smaller States. I share with him a desire for the maintenance of the rights and privileges which have been conferred upon us by the Constitution ; but I am afraid that on the present occasion my honorable and learned friend and I must part company. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> takes the same side. He has given a great deal of consideration to these matters, and is strongly against the Senate making a request, and equally strongly in favour of our power of amendment. There is also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> a gentleman of very great ability, and who, young as he is, has devoted much time and thought to constitutional affairs. I listened to him with the greatest interest and care. But, as I stated before, I am bound to have regard to the weight of evidence. That being the case, I fear we shall have to reverse our decision. In his statement yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> urged that the Senate must not come into conflict with the other branch of the Legislature without being sure of its ground. That is an important point of view. If the stand taken up by some honorable senators were correct, and we were to push it to its ultimate conclusion so that the Governor-General was bound to dissolve both Chambers, should we be able to maintain our position before the country? If I thought that the position of the Senate was unassailable, there would be no hesitation about my attitude, but I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that unless we are absolutely sure of our ground, we should not provoke a conflict. There ought to be an overwhelming majority of the Senate in favour of any stand which we may decide to take up. Indeed, we ought to be pretty well unanimous. </para>

                        <para>- If our position is not a tenable one we are bound to retreat. For the reasons which I have advanced, and in consequence of the enormous weight of evidence on the other side, I am convinced that the Senate cannot maintain the position taken up in the first instance. Let me submit an illustration. Suppose that the legal gentlemen whose opinions I have quoted constituted a judicial tribunal, and that the question of the attitude assumed by the Senate was submitted to them for decision, what would be the result ? Undoubtedly their decision would be against the Senate. There would be fourteen legal minds on the one side and five on the other. That seems to me to be a convincing illustration. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate I have shown that there are fourteen legal gentlemen who think we have no power to amend this Bill, and only five on the other side who think we have a constitutional right to amend. Having listened to everything that has been said upon the subject in the Senate, and read everything that was said in the House of Representatives, I can come to no other conclusion than that the Senate was wrong in the first instance ; and -I must give my vote in favour of a reversal of that decision, and for submitting the proposal which I made as a. request, and not as an amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I do not rise to offer any further argument in reference to the question in dispute, but I think I may be permitted to state that yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> - no doubt unwittingly - misrepresented the attitude which I have assumed, and what. I have done. He stated to the Committee, and it has been reported in the public newspapers, that I, being President of the Senate in Committee, dissented from a ruling by the Chairman. Now, I never did anything of the sort. What happened was this : The Postmaster-General, in the absence of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, moved that the Bill be recommitted. It was recommitted. He then moved that the resolution proposed to be sent down to the House of Representatives in the form of a request be rescinded. I spoke on that motion, and voted with the Postmaster-General. Therefore there was no dissent whatever from any ruling of the Chairman of Committees. I think that that would have been a most improper thing for me to do, and, as a matter of fact, I never did any such thing. There is another matter which I should like to mention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> - judging from an interjection which he mad - seems to think that I have not. accorded to him such courtesy as I ought to have done. I am very sorry that he should think so. I can assure him that no discourtesy towards him was intended. The observation I made was in answer to an interjection in the heat of debate. If the honorable senator thinks that I was discourteous to him I am exceedingly sorry, and I apologize to him for what I have said. </para>

                    <para>- I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> and the Chairman treated each, other with great courtesy in the matter. Certainly the position for a person supposed to be arbitrary to take would have been to wait patiently until the Chairman had given his ruling, and then, upon an objection being taken, resume the President&#39;s chair and pronounce his ruling <inline font-style="italic">ex cathedra.</inline> But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> waived that position, and spoke on the floor of the Chamber in the same way as the Chairman was speaking. I think it was exceedingly courteous on his part, very fair to us, and so far from there being any disrespect to the Chairman, I feel sure that it was done as the result of a perfect understanding, and with a view to preserve the best possible feeling be between them. So much for that matter, which I very much regret has been referred to. I do not wish to make another speech, but to formulate certain propositions, because we are making history, and this precedent will be cited as a reason for doing the same thing in the future. Apart from the question I have already argued, that this amendment does not increase the charge or burden on the peop&#39;e, I submit that, according to my reading of the Constitution Act, the Senate cannot amend (1) an Appropriation Bill for the ordinary services of the year, (2) Bills imposing taxation, or (3) any Bill so as to increase the charge or burden on the people - not on the revenue. I ask honorable senators to note the words, &#34; on the people.&#34; When the charge or burden is on the people it is taxation, but when it is on the revenue it is appropriation. The Sugar Bonus Bill does not in effect impose any charge or burden on the people. It leaves the charge the same, but alters the appropriation. The King receives the same sum as before, and so the charge or burden is not altered. The effect is that this is a special Appropriation Bill. Can the Senate, not amend so as to increase the amount of appropriations in Bills of this character <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Clearly it can unless the provision that Bills appropriating revenue must not &#39;originate in the Senate makes increase an origination. Such a construction is not merely an extension of the language, but it is in effect a contradiction of both language and understanding. </para>

                    <para>. - -While we were discussing the third clause in Committee, it came to my knowledge that there was a difference of opinion with regard to the way in which the amendment should be put, and I suggested that, as we had already made some amendments, the matter .should be allowed to pass, and that clause 2 should be recommitted, in order that the point might be discussed. In fulfilment of that arrangement, the clause was recommitted, and this discussion has taken place. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> was very wise in agreeing to give up the amendment, and to proceed by way of request. I cannot say that I have changed the opinion which I expressed before. The difficulty, on a strict reading of the Con.stution, appears to me to be still unanswered. It is a case in which a strict reading of the Constitution is at variance with the apparent intention of the framers. I must make that admission, because I see the weakness of construing section 53 as I did ; but I do not see how it can be construed unless we allow the apparent intention of the framers to overreach the express words of the section. At the present time there is a very strong opinion against the strict reading of the section, and that being so, we come back to the opinion which was expressed here last session, that the power of request commences where tHe power of amendment fails. It is only recently that it has been suggested here that that interpretation may not be correct. If it is correct, clearly it is open to us to make a request whenever we have not the power to make an  amendment.  As the other  House has declined to consider the proposition as an amendment, I think it is wise on  the part  of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> desiring as he does, not only to save the Bill, but to save it with his amendment, to exhaust all methods. Clearly the next method is to approach the other House by a request. I am not with the honorable senator in his desire to secure this amendment, but I am entirely with him in his desire to save the Bill. The proper way to achieve that object is, to my mind, to send back the Bill with a request, and, if that is acceded to, then the Bill is saved with the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is on very unsafe ground in voting for the amendment on the supposition that, whether we make an amendment or a request, <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> are bound to. get what we desire, because the Government will bring in another Bill. We are endeavouring to do all we can to pass this Bill. If we cannot get the Bill passed through the two Houses, what reason have we to suppose that if another Bill is brought in embodying the amendment it will be passed ? </para>

                    <para>- The Postmaster-General has adopted1 a very unfair tone in urging honorable senators to support the view of the Government. For what purpose was the Bill -introduced ? It was brought in merely to give the Minister for Trade and Customs a better method of distributing the rebate, and, of course, to legalize an illegal regulation. The Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> had made certain promises to the. planters, and in order to give effect to them it was necessary to introduce this Bill. If it is lost, the planters who. produce sugar by white labour will still receive their &#163;2 a ton. No doubt, the Government are not anxious to extend the operation of the Bill, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> desires to do ; so that he has no guarantee that, even if he should vote now as he proposes to do, his amendment will be accepted. </para>

                    <para>. - I have very few words to- say in reply, and I speak chiefly because I promised to answer two questions. The first question was as to the meaning of section 56 of the Constitution. I have been looking into that matter since I spoke. A detailed explanation of the reason why that section remains in the Constitution is to be found in Quick and Garran&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Annotated Constitution.</inline> The explanation - which any honorable senator can find for himself by referring to the Convention debates - is that a similar clause in the  Constitution  Bill of .1891 was confined to a message to the House of Representatives. At that time the clause, which is now section 53, did not contain the proviso which is to be found in it at the present time. Instead of that, these words were used, &#34; Proposed laws mainly appropriating revenue.&#34; Some discussion took place as to the wording of section 53, and it was then altered to the form in which it now stands. It was thus made quite clear that certain Bills which used to be called Money Bills under the old practice, could be introduced in the Senate, and that that would not be origination. Then there were members of the &#39; Convention who were anxious that these appropriations should not be introduced without a message, and therefore this proviso was left. On almost the last occasion when the Commonwealth Bill was amended, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> pointed out that it was not necessary to use the words as applicable to the two Houses, because it was only in the case of one that there would be any necessity for a message, the proviso of section 53 making it unnecessary to consider provisions of the kind described there as constituting a Money Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston, Mr. (now Sir John)</inline> Cockburn, and I think some others, thought it would be better to have these words in, and therefore the proviso was retained. So that really the reason, so far as the Senate is concerned, why that proviso was- retained was that it was thought possible that it might be necessary to have a message in regard to Bills appropriating revenue or moneys, and containing provisions for the imposition and appropriation of fines and other pecuniary penalties. It was in order to make it certain that Bills of this kind could be introduced, that this proviso was retained. I think myself that it is not necessary, and that section 56 has clearly only a bearing upon messages introduced in the other House. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Walker</inline>is quite right ; it is only a machinery Act. Honorable senators must remember that it is impossible that we can draw any money from the consolidated revenue except by an appropriation, and there is no single word of appropriation in that Act. Not a single item can be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund towards the services under that Act without a separate appropriation, and for every one of those services there must be a vote upon the Estimates. I have referred to the two arguments which it appeared to me to be necessary to answer, but as regards the main contentions put forward on both sides, the discussion has been ample, and I do not wish to add anything to what has already been said. I, however, repeat the opinion I expressed before that the matter seems to me to be absolutely clear. A good deal has been said about upholding the rights of the Senate, and speeches have been made such as that delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> and other honorable senators, who have put forward reasons, which, in their opinion, substantiate that view. But we have had other speeches by some honorable senators not giving any substantial reasons, but adopting the language of bluster and exaggeration with regard to the rights of the Senate. I say that if the dignity of the Senate is to be preserved, it will not be by windy generalities of that kind. It is not by adopting a braggadocio attitude, but by reasonably and fairly taking up the position which the Constitution gives us, that we shall maintain our rights and privileges. The strength of the Senate can best be shown by taking up a position that is perfectly clear, and then standing by it, and not by making assertions of rights which are untenable, and trying to assert and maintain them by big expressions and by loud talk. This Senate can only be strong if it takes to itself only the powers given to it under the Constitution plainly and clearly. So long as it assumes those powers, let it stand up for them under all circumstances, but unless the powers for which it contends are so clearly without doubt the Senate will only be weakening itself by making assertions of authority which it really does not possess. I think I need not say any more, and I hope the Committee will now go to a division and get to business. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GLASSEY</inline>(Queensland).- Since the last meeting of the Senate I have given a good deal of consideration to the desirability of altering the terms of my original proposal with a view to making it more acceptable to the other House. I think I am now able to submit it in a modified form, in which it will be found acceptable. As this Bill first came from the other Chamber, it prevented growers of sugar who had planted their cane by means of black labour prior to the 28th February, 1903, taking advantage of the bounty. I have gone carefully into the matter, and have read the debates which took place upon the Bill in another place, and T find that there was a majority of twelve in that House in favour of the Bill as it originally reached us, though there were honorable members favorable to an alteration under which no time limit would be specified. I think it would be a pity to pass the measure in the form in which it reached us, inasmuch as I find that we have about 90,000 acres of land under cane in Queensland, and only 36,000 acres of that area have been registered by those desiring to take advantage of the bounty. I submitted an amendment which has caused a considerable amount of trouble from the constitutional stand-point. I have since given a great deal of consideration to the matter, and have consulted a number of honorable members of the other House. I have also consulted the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has this matter in hand, and I find the right honorable gentleman is favorable to a modification of the proposal I originally submitted. I therefore move - </para>
                <para>That the House of Representatives be requested to amend clause 2 by inserting, after the word &#34;three,&#34; line 7, the following words - &#34;and to every grower of sugar-cane or beet within the Commonwealth, not being sugar-cane or beet planted by other than white labour, after the twenty-eighth clay of February, one thousand nine hundred and three, in the production of which sugar-cane or beet white labour only has been employed for a period of twelve months immediately preceding the delivery thereof for manufacture.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">Under this modification of my original proposal, the only persons who will be precluded from taking full advantage of the bounty system will be those who have planted cane by black labour since the 28th February of this year. Under my amendment only a small number will be precluded from taking full advantage of the bounty, and we shall be given extended opportunity for carrying out the principle of a white Australia. The Minister for Trade and Customs is quite willing to accept the amendment, and, from my personal knowledge of a number of honorable members of the other Chamber, I feel sure that the amendment will be accepted, and that we may then regard the question as settled. I regret very much that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has not seen his way to accept my proposal in full. </para>

                    <para>- When this matter was before the Committee on the last occasion, the Postmaster-General, who was in charge, was unable to accede to the view which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> put forward. But the matter has been discussed a good deal since, and with a view to carrying this Bill into law, and effecting an equality of distribution which cannot otherwise be brought about - with a view to giving rights promised by the regulation - the Government think it fair and reasonable to agree to the proposed request. It will be noticed that there is one difference between the matter of the amendment which was previously made and the request now submitted. The difference is that this proviso is not to apply to cane planted by other than white labour after the 28th February, 1903; in regard to every other portion of the cane the twelve months period will apply. The benefit of the Act will be extended to any person who uses white labour only in the production of his cane for twelve months before he takes it to the factory, provided only that the cane has not been planted by black labour after 28th February, 1903. Under the circumstances I hope the Committee will accede to the reasonable request which has been submitted, and which, I have no doubt, will be adopted by the other House. </para>

                        <para>- What we are dealing with is a message, not from the Minister for Trade and Customs, but from the House of Representatives. The particular amendment which we have had before us did not come from the other place with any expression of opinion disagreeing with it on its merits. There is nothing to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> amendment in its entirety, when it was considered on its merits in another place, would not be accepted; and I think the honorable senator is rather refraining from insisting on a position to which he is entitled. The only ground on which the House of Representatives declined to accede to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> amendment was that it was in the form of an amendment and not in the form of a request. The result of the vote which has just been taken is that we are prepared to yield to the contention of the House of Representatives, so far as this particular Bill is concerned, and make this amendment in the form of a request. It seems to me that the proper procedure would be to send back <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> original amendment in the form of a request. I voted for that amendment, and I do not know that I should vote for the amendment now before us, without, at any rate, a &#34; run for my money.&#34; If the House of Representatives were to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> original amendment when sent in the form of a request, honorable senators would, no doubt, get what they had supported, or, on the other hand, the House of Representatives could make modifications. It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> ought not to be put in the position of taking less than the Senate backed him up in asking for. </para>

                    <para>- Yes. In my opinion it is quite competent for the Committee to send to the House of Representatives any request they decide upon at this stage. The principle laid down in section 53 is that a request may be sent to the other House at any stage. There is nothing binding the Senate to formulate its request in the form that the amendment, which we have agreed not to insist on, originally took. In my opinion, I think the request is in order. </para>

The other House, when the amendment was sent down, rejected it on constitutional grounds, but it must be remembered that it had previously been discussed there on its merits and rejected. Now that it is put forward in the form of a request, the Government see that in order to bring about agreement between the Houses, it would be wise and reasonable to consent to the amendment in a modified form. I am merely stating the views of the Government under the altered condition of things. I am not asking the Senate to fall in with any arrangement made. If the request is put forward in this form, the Government here and in the other House will support it ; but, if it be in the original form, the Government will feel compelled to oppose it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, if we think fit. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> introduced the amendment in the original form, I should certainly move some modification. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> knows my views, and when he consulted me I told him what were the views of the Government. Instead of moving the amendment as . it originally stood, and waiting for the Government to propose their modification of it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has moved it as a request, and in a form in which the Government will be willing to accept it. Why should not that course be pursued ? It is the course- which seems to me to achieve the result which the Committee desire should be arrived at, and meets, the views of the Government, lt will be supported by the Government in the other House. Nothing is to be gained by making the request in the form of words originally adopted in the amendment. There is no particular virtue in the Senate sending back a request in exactly the same form as the previous amendment. When the Bill comes back to us it will be open to us to send to the House of Representatives any message we think proper. If our desire is to bring this legislation to a conclusion as soon as possible, we secure that end in a business-like way by agreeing to a course which is likely to commend itself to the other House. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>(South Australia). - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> motion has the effect of decreasing the burden on the people, and, therefore, I am inclined to vote for it. It certainly decreases the amount which has to be paid to the growers of sugar, because it excludes those who plant cane after a certain time. It appears that the honorable senator has the best chance of carrying his proposal by having it sent down to the other House in the form now suggested. If we have an. understanding that the other House is likely to agree to the motion as now framed, it will certainly save time to carry it in that way. </para>

                    <para>-- After the debate which has taken place on the position and dignity of the Senate, we are now confronted with a proposal that means climbing down with a vengeance. I do not intend to speak against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> original amendment, or even against his proposed modification of it, but I seriously protest against modifying it under present circumstances. The House of Representatives has not considered this question on, its merits since we last sent down the Bill to them. But because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> naively informs us, there has been some private discussion between himself and other persons, and we are told that the House of Representatives, without having an opportunity of discussing this question on its merits, is likely to assent to a request in a certain form, we, therefore, should climb down and accept the modification proposed. I shall oppose doing anything of the sort. It should be beneath our dignity to do this sort of thing in this way. Further, I would point out that if the proposal is to be modified it is open to the House of Representatives to make the modification. I am not speaking in hostility to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> wishes, but I think that the modification he requires should come to us from the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives may alter its opinion. Sorely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is not so anxious to climb down, or so convinced that he was previously wrong, that he wants to alter his proposal before there is any need to do so. He tells us that he would still prefer his original amendment. I will support him in sending down a request in the form of his original amendment. Let him give the other House a chance. When the question was previously discussed there was a majority of twelve in the House of Representatives against what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> desires. But if the House of Representatives were to change its mind, it would not be for the first time in the history of our legislation. I urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> to stand by his request as he originally framed it, and not to climb down without showing any fight at all. If we hear from the other House that they will not accept the proposal in its original form, we can agree to a modification of it, but&#39; that is the only reason why we should consent to an alteration. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GLASSEY</inline>(Queensland).- We ought to exercise a little patience about this matter. There is no necessity to enter upon heated arguments, and to charge persons with climbing down. We ought to be practical. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who very courteously and generously supported my previous amendment, says that the House of Representatives has not discussed this question on its merits. </para>

                        <para>- The question certainly was debated on its merits elsewhere. I merely took up an amendment that had been submitted in the other Chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomson,</inline> the member for North Sydney. His amendment was lost by a majority of twelve. Having ascertained that the Government would accept the proposal if it were modified, and being desirous to see the measure passed in such a way as to confer the greatest amount of relief on the greatest number of planters in Queensland, I am bound, in the interests of those whom I have the honour to represent, to endeavour to get for them as much as I possibly can if I cannot get all I want. I cannot secure the passing of my amendment as it left the Senate previously. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not think that the Senate should pay any attention to matters of private conversation. Whatever may have taken place in the other House, or in connexion with a Minister of the Crown there - and I believe that certain things have taken place - it is extremely undesirable for the Senate to alter the proposition with the view of bringing itself in accord with the result of certain negotiations, even if we know that the other House will agree to the alteration. So far as we know, it has no objection to the original proposition, except that it was made in a wrong form. If the Ministry are prepared to accept a modification - and we understand that they are - when it comes before us it can be considered, and probably we shall then have the assistance of a number of honorable senators who were not prepared to go the whole length with us, but who might go to the limit which is now suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey.</inline> I do not wish to labour the point, but I think that if we alter our proposition we shall be taking up an undignified position, and one which we are not asked to take up by the message from the other House. </para>

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is very wise in asking for what he has reason to think he will get. He is quite right in looking all round him, reading the debates in both Houses, and acquainting himself with the feeling in the other House in order to gauge what concession he is likely to obtain. No one has yet carefully considered in what respect this request differs from the amendment. If it is carefully looked into, it will be found that it really gives all that was asked for by the supporters of the amendment. It leaves the door open until the end of the period for any one to come in on giving twelve months&#39; notice. The only difference it makes is that it bars cane which has been planted by black labour after the 28th February, 1903. It carries out everything except that it discourages the planters to continue planting with black labour. The amendment meant that on giving twelve months&#39; notice the planters could come in at any moment, and up to that time could continuously plant with black labour. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> ought to be very well satisfied, and I believe that the planters will be very well satisfied if this request is acceded to. I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> is again running the risk of losing everything&#34; by moving his amendment, because a similar amendment was proposed in the other House, opposed by the Government, and defeated by a majority of the members of that House. It is like spoiling for a fight to send down a proposal which has been fully discussed, opposed by the Government, and defeated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is very anxious to get the Bill through with the concession to the planters, who, up to the present time, have not been able to see their way to get rid of coloured labour. There is a danger that, while we are fighting this grand battle over constitutional points, the unfortunate Bill may suffer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> does not wish to see the request and the Bill sacrificed in a fight between the Houses. What is the use of saying that we must send dow&#39;n the request in exactly the same form as the amendment, or else we shall suffer in our dignity ? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> considers it is all that he is likely to get, and it is proposed as a request, our best course is to support him in his view, and see whether the other House will amend the Bill as he desires. </para>

He has voted twice on opposite sides, and now he is asking honorable senators to vote another time. What can that be called but wobbling?

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR</inline>(South Australia). - I am very sorry that we have got into this muddle. I regret that such a parliamentary veteran as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> should put his proposition in such an unsafe position. What has he done &#39;( He has been negotiating with some person or persons unknown. When a Bill comes to the Senate we have no right to consider anything which has occurred in another place. What is happening, and what ought to have happened, are two different things. If the honorable senator had submitted his proposition as a request, and the Government had any objection to its form, it would have been their duty to move an amendment, which would have been discussed, and, if carried, it would have been all right. But suppose that a number of honorable senators were prepared to support the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> in its original form, but not in its altered form, the amendment of the Government would have been defeated, and his request would have been sent down to another place. By altering the language, he runs the risk of losing his proposition. He has put the whole principle of his proposition in jeopardy. If the amendment is defeated the proposition will be put in the new form, and a number of honorable senators have signified their intention of voting against it, while, if the amendment is carried, the Government have signified their intention of voting against the request. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> who declares that he never wobbles, is between &#34; the devil and the deep sea.&#34; I am prepared to vote for his proposition in the original form, and to- back down if the other House desires an amendment, which the Government are prepared to accept. If there is a possibility of getting the original amendment carried, seeing that it carries out the principle we are advocating to a greater extent, then I shall adhere to it. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> will see the error of his ways, and will adhere to his original amendment. The honorable senator should leave it to the Government to move an amendment upon it, which&#34; will bring it more into conformity with the views held in another place. If that is done, everything will go smoothly, and something will be accomplished, whereas now there is nothing but confusion before us. </para>

I have felt that in submitting lily proposal in a modified form, in which it is likely to be accepted in another place, I am running no risk of losing anything and I think I shall gain much. I do not desire to earn the reputation which some people would like to give me of being a &#34; wobbler,&#39;&#39; but I am exceedingly anxious to submit this proposal in such a way as to insure its finding a place on the statute-book in the best possible form. I thought, and I still think, it was my duty to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> and other members of the Government, whether they would accept my proposal as previously submitted. I have had conversations with some of the members of the Government, and with honorable members of the other House, and I have found that a slight modification of my original proposal would be acceptable. Was it not my clear duty under the circumstances to submit the proposal in a modified form, that I might run no risk of having it rejected, when it is possible that, if I insisted upon mv previous proposal, a great number of sugar-growers would be unable to take advantage of the bounty proposed ? </para>

                        <para>- Then I cannot help it. There is no question of &#34;wobbling&#34; in the matter at all, as I have merely desired to submit my proposal in a form in which it will be acceptable to another place. I feel that I was justified in trying to find out whether my proposal would be likely to be accepted by the Government, or by a majority in the other House. Let us see what the modification I propose amounts to. The original proposal of the Government was that all cane planted by black labour prior to 28th February last should be excluded from the bounty. There were 90,000 acres under cane, and only those cultivating 36,000 acres would be able to secure the bounty under the original proposal. I felt that many of those who desire to do away with black labour in the cultivation of sugar-cane would be unable to secure the bounty, and that the fulfilment of the policy of a white Australia would thus be retarded. I moved an amendment upon the original proposal of the Government, which was subsequently carried in the Senate, to enable a number of planters who had already been working their plantations for twelve months with white labour, to secure the bounty. I now find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> and other members of the Government are of opinion that the planters have had sufficient warning since the Excise Tariff Act came into operation, and they positively decline to recognise planters who have planted cane with black labour since the 28th February, this year. What would be the area of cane planted this year by black labour? It would probably be not more than from 500 to 1,000 acres at the outside. If honorable senators are prepared to promote the welfare of the State of Queensland, and to give fair play to the sugar-growers in that State, they will be ready to support the modified proposition I now make. I regret that any heat should have been introduced into the matter, and I certainly think there was no justification for it. I deny that I have placed myself in a false position in connexion with this proposal. I was anxious that it should be submitted in a form in which it would be acceptable, not only to the Senate, but to the other </para>

                        <para>-On the other hand, if the amendment is modified in the way now suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> the Government will accept it here and will throw their support into the scale in its favour, and if it is passed here they will support it in the other House. That is the position we take up. On the other side, honorable senators admit that they know what will happen, but they insist that certain stages must be gone through before what must happen shall take place. They contend- that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> should bring forward his proposal in the original form ; that the Government should then propose a modification of it j and that, if the modification is carried, it should be sent on&#39; as a request to the other House. Again, it is said that no modification of the proposal ought to be made here at all, that the Bill should go down with the original amendment as a request that a modification of it should be suggested there, and when it is returned to the Senate we can accept the modification. The whole tiling is a farce. Every honorable senator is prepared to admit now the extent to which he is willing to go in this matter, and every honorable senator admits that if the proposal comes back to the Senate from another place in the modified form now suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> he will be willing to accept it. </para>

                        <para>- Surely it is trifling with our duties to demand that we should go through all this form for the purpose of arriving at the same conclusion, after spending a great deal of unnecessary time over it, because of some vague suggestion that the dignity of the Senate is involved in these formal steps being gone through. I thought that the Senate was a body which was willing to adhere to the substance of its powers, its rights, and dignity, but was not willing that these small punctilios of politeness, or whatever they may be called, should stand in the way of carrying out substantially the wishes of both&#39; Houses of&#39; Parliament. I say it is the duty of both Houses to try to arrive at a conclusion which will bring desired legislation about as early as possible. Why should we not arrive at that by the shortest cut possible <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> What possible sacrifice to our dignity will there be in adopting that course ? With regard to what I may call the almost furious attack, certainly the violent attack, made upon me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> I may say that it is true, as the honorable senator has said, that I promised I would vote for this proposal if submitted in the form of a request. But when I did so, I tell the honorable senator frankly that it did not occur to me that this modification would make any substantial difference in the course that was to be taken. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> spoke to me about the request, what I had in my mind, and what the honorable senator had in his mind, was whether I should treat this proposal as a request which might rightly be made by the Senate. It certainly did not occur to me, when dealing with the question from the constitutional aspect, that there was any question or difference as to a modification of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- But I ask the honorable senator, who, I think, is willing to see an extension of the advantages of the rebate to those who have not been using black labour since February, 1903, to take a reasonable view, and say what chance there is of the proposal being carried into law if we persist in taking steps which are supposed to be necessary in order to, in some indefinite way, assert the dignity of the Senate.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WALKER</inline>(New South Wales). - I am glad that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has confirmed what we on this side of the Chamber understood from him, that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> original proposal were sent to the House of Representatives as a request, he and his colleagues in the Government would support it. The honorable and learned senator has, however, explained that he only meant that they would support the request in a modified form. It is only right that I should mention, that to my knowledge at least, two, and I believe three honorable senators supported the proposal that a request should be made instead of an amendment, on the understanding that the request would be in the form of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> original amendment. So far from the Government being placed in an awkward position in relation to the other House, I think that they will be placed in a more dignified position if the proposal goes forward as a request in the form originally drafted, because, as now proposed to be amended, the request will be in the form of the very amendment which the Government in the House of Representatives, I understand, declined to support. </para>

                        <para>- If I cannot get anything more than that, I will do so ; but I am going to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> present motion for the reasons which I have already given. My honorable and learned friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, put it that we must not be too devoted to what he described as &#34; the punctilios of politeness &#34; between the two Houses. We should all be desirous of extending to the other House the same politeness that we expect to receive. It is not a matter that depends upon &#34; the punctilios of politeness,&#34; or upon politeness at all ; but if we have rules of procedure, when we desire to adhere to them, our course of action scarcely deserves to be characterized as a farce. Rules of procedure are passed to be adhered to and followed. A great deal of danger and mischief is very often occasioned in legislative and other bodies by taking what are called short cuts, and disregarding the procedure laid down, and which, in some instances, has been pursued for ages. That procedure very often facilitates instead of hampering the course of public business. </para>

                        <para>- That is&#39; the view which wisdom would prompt my honorable friend to take, and it is a course of action which will shorten the discussion very much. I was not familiar with the facts stated by my honorable and learned friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that there was a majority in the House of Representatives against a proposal similar to that embodied in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> original amendment. That would have been an excellent reason to put forward when we were debating <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> amendment. We might have dealt with it from that stand-point. We. have no message from the House of Representatives, except that our amendment was not in proper form - that is to say, that it was an amendment and not a request. We have no means of knowing what view the House of Representatives takes, except as conveyed in the message with which we are dealing. I do not complain that we have been informed of what the attitude of the Government would be towards the request, if we sent it down. From some points of view it is desirable that we should know what is likely to take place. But it is not the Ministry to whom we have to send our message, but the House of Representatives. That House has not sent us a message dealing with the amendment on its merits. When our request goes down, they may adopt it, and give us all we want. If they do not, they may do one of two things. They may suggest the modification, which the Government are willing to concede, or they may disagree with the amendment. It is not for us to back down right away. If they are willing to agree to our request with a modification, when the Bill comes back to us I shall be prepared to support the acceptance of the concession they make. They are not likely to disagree with our suggestion <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> because, to do so, would be an affront to the Senate after the impartial way in which we have discussed the constitutional question. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has given us an assurance that the request if modified will be accepted by the Government. But the message with which we have to deal is from the House of Representatives, not from the Government. I attach every confidence to the assurance that has been made on behalf of the Government, and think it is a proper tiling that it should have been made. I do not agree with those who have adversely criticised the Government for making that intimation. It is the proper thing for Ministers to indicate the length to which they are prepared to go with regard to concessions. But we are dealing with messages between the two Houses, and should give the House of Representatives an opportunity of discussing the suggestion on its merits. </para>

                    <para>- I am&#39; extremely anxious that the sugar growers in Queensland should get that protection to which I think they are entitled. If there is any miscarriage in that respect, to a very large extent it will have been the fault of the senators from Queensland. It appears to me that there has been divided counsel. A section of the representatives of that State desire one thing, while another section of them ask for something else. As I am anxious to do the thing which I think is fair,. and also in accord with their desire, I should like to see a common ground of agreement arrived at before we go to a vote. </para>

                        <para>- I have been waiting for an hour and a half to hear, but no one knows exactly what is to be done. It is quite true that the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> was made in another place, debated, and defeated by a substantial majority. According to statements whic&#39;h have been made here, it was opposed by the Government. It is said that if the same proposition is made by the Senate, the Government in the other House will take up an adverse position, and we all know that when the influence of the Government is cast against any proposition .there is very little likelihood of it being, carried. Surely, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> knows whether his proposition will carry out what he desires. He has assured us that it will, and we have the assurance of the representatives of the Government that if it is sent down to the other House their colleagues will urge its acceptance. It seems to me that the position is perfectly clear. If I had any doubt on the question I should vote with the Government, but I entertain no doubt. I feel that the right course to adopt is to accept the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> with the modification which the Government desire, and if a division is called for I shall vote in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- It is a great pity that those who have the interest of the Queensland planters especially in charge here, cannot arrive at some sort of an arrangement by which what they all desire could be carried out in the most expeditious way possible. Although I am certain that every honorable senator is willing that good legislation should be passed, I think it is quite obvious that there are some honorable senators who would like that to be done with a good deal of complication. I see no reason to justify the suggestion that the course which we all agree in the end must be arrived at should be arrived at with so much circumlocution. It is five weeks since the proposition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is now asked to propose to the Committee was opposed by the Government, and defeated in the other House by a majority of twelve. The Government are now willing that it should be carried with a modification. The sole question is whether we shall send down the request in a form in which we know it will be accepted by another place, or in the form originally suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> leaving the modification to be made in another place. Why should we delay <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If honorable senators from Queensland would agree about the matter there is no question that a majority of the Committee can carry the request in the modified form now suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey.</inline> Those honorable senators differ as to the way in&#39; which what is proposed should be done. Some of them think that the request should be sent down in the modified form. </para>

                <para>Senater O&#39;CONNOR.- Of course they cannot give us any guarantee, but we are able to say that the Government will support the request in that form, and when it is remembered that the Government had a majority of twelve on this question in the House of Representatives, honorable senators can judge for themselves what are the possibilities. After all there is nothing new in putting these considerations before the Senate. This is what we do in every case in which we wish to come to an agreement with the other House. We do not propose an amendment or make a request here which will suit our own views only. We do that in the first instance, but when we see what are the views of the other House, we propose our request or amendment in a form which we think will be acceptable to the other House. That is the course which is being suggested here. If my honorable friends, the senators representing Queensland, are willing to adopt this course in the interest of the Queensland planters, they will have this advantage, that the modified proposal will be taken up and supported by the Government, and although I cannot, any more than any one else, guarantee that it will be carried, I have very little doubt that it will, and that the Bill will become law at once and all uncertainty will be removed from the minds of those persons who have been kept in suspense in connexion with this measure for so long. If the other course suggested is adopted, the Government will refuse to support the request in the original form. It may be that a majority of honorable members in another place will be willing to suggest some modification. I do not know that they will, but there is just the same risk involved as to what may happen to the Bill in the course which honorable senators opposite suggest. If there is any difference between honorable senators from Queensland as to the form in which what is desired should be done, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> generous suggestion might be adopted. I understand that the honorable senator is willing to withdraw his motion for a request. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS</inline>(Queensland). - As to my desiring to claim any credit for this proposition, I may say that my sole desire is that the gentleman who has been chiefly responsible in another place for the negotiations which have been mentioned should get his fair share of the credit. I refer to Mr. Fisher, the honorable member for Wide Bay. I desire that honorable senators should have &#39;an opportunity to vote upon the two proposals. My fear was that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> after moving his original proposition, should accept an amendment moved by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, there would not be an opportunity given to honorable senators to vote upon the two proposals, and honorable senators who desire to vote for the original proposition might be found voting against the whole clause. </para>

                        <para>- I must take the dictum of the leader of the Opposition on that point, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has distinctly stated that until the other House has had an opportunity of dealing with the original proposal on its merits he will vote against the amendment. I have, therefore, as a Queensland senator to decide whether I shall support the Government or the Opposition in this matter. I have no objection to state at once that I intend to support the Government, because I believe they will have the best opportunity of satisfying the desires of the people whom I am endeavouring to represent. We have had assurances from honorable senators on both sides that the members of the Ministry in the other House, and prominent members of the Opposition in that House, are prepared to support a request in the form suggested by the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> and that they are not prepared to support a request in the form of the original proposition. We are, therefore, in this position : that we have to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> proposal, or get nothing at all. Of these alternatives I prefer to accept the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor.</inline> It is to be regretted that so much time has been wasted in this discussion and that so many side issues have been debated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was very prominent at one portion of the debate in insisting that we should climb down to the other Chamber. </para>

That is to say, they object to what they call now a &#34; climb down,&#34; but are willing, if we insist on the original proposition, and the Bill be sent back, to then &#34;climb down.&#34; There is no doubt that that would be a most emphatic and decided &#34;climb down.&#34; If the amendment as proposed is good, why should we wait until the Bill is sent back from the other House ? If the amendment is worth adopting, why not adopt it now ? Where, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> asks, is the necessity for all this circumlocution? Why cannot we take the most direct means of achieving what, so far as I understand the expressions of opinion from both sides of the Chamber, we are all agreed on? What we have agreed on is that which is most likely to be carried, and most expeditiously put into force. And that is certainly not the original proposition, but the amendment as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> which, for the reasons given, I am prepared to support. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MCGREGOR</inline>(South Australia). - I am very sorry that an)&#39; difficulty should have arisen, but Queensland representatives must recognise that it has arisen in consequence of their over-anxiety. Whenever the question of a request or an amendment is before the Senate, the Queensland representatives take up a wrong attitude, and put themselves into such a position that they have to retrace their steps. We have been told that in another place there was a majority of twelve against what I consider to be bare justice to the planters in Queensland ; but we ought to remember that, proportionately, the majority I have spoken of is not so great as. the reversal of opinion in the Senate. Queensland representatives ought to remember that the Government, in another place, were originally against the amendment. But it is not altogether the Government ; we may find that the members of the House of Representatives will alter their opinion, and carry the proposal if it be earnestly advocated. And any amendment made there might be more liberal, so far as the planters are concerned, than that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Senator Glassey</inline> and other honorable senators do not seem to understand the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> in his usual conciliatory mood, accepted the amendment of the Government without ascertaining whether he had a majority to carry it. If the original proposal had gone to the other place without any amendment and had been defeated, in what position would the Queensland planters have been? But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> had introduced his original proposal and an amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> were carried, the probability is that the majority who carried it would be able to carry the proposal as amended. If, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> amendment were defeated, we would still have the original proposal to send to another place. Honorable senators will see that the original request makes it -absolutely certain that we shall get something, whereas this compromise, as it were, puts us in a position where we get nothing. I think * it was rather foolish on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> part not to move his original proposal. </para>

                        <para>- There would be no obligation on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> &#39; part not to vote for an amendment on his proposal, if he thought the amendment the better ; but he was under an obligation to certain other members of the Chamber not to accept the amendment, and thereby deprive them of the opportunity of voting on both the amendment and the original proposal. I hope honorable senators will discuss this question fairly. It does not matter which proposal goes to the other place. I am certain that the House of Representatives will not set aside the measure, because the honorable members of that Chamber and the Government are just as&#39; anxious n.s we are that this Bill should be carried expeditiously. The amendment means that planters in Queensland, who may be under obligations to kanakas they have engaged, cannot come under the Bill if those kanakas are used in planting after the 28th February this year ; so that really the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> makes the Bill very little better than it was when it first came to us. Is it not better for honorable senators to fight for as much as they can get ? If the original proposal goes down, the Government, being anxious to carry the Bill, may amend it in the way indicated ; on the other hand, there may be a majority in the other House to carry the proposal in its original form when the question is properly argued. I hope the vote will be given with the full understanding that by the original proposal we lose nothing, but that by the amendment we make the measure less liberal than it is at present. The question is whether it is better to send down the original proposal, or send it down in an amended form - which has the best chance of passing? We can lose absolutely nothing, no matter which course we take, because the Government will not throw the Bill aside, and the other House may do I better for us than we expect. </para>
