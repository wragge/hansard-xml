                    <para>. - A recommendation was made by the Imperial Government in regard to the strength of the garrison at King George's Sound ; but there is' no agreement on the subject. The Government have endeavoured to retrench the military expenditure generally, though the reduction in numbers here is very small - practically only three men, because there is one more corporal this year than last year. I presume, however, that the military authorities consider that the garrison is relatively as strong as other branches of the Defence Force in other parts of Australia. With regard' to the slight increase in the estimate, I would point out that Parliament is asked this year to vote £900 for rations, whereas the vote last year was only £600, and the whole of that amount was not expended. Several small items, such as the vote for the signallers, and the vote for fuel and light, have been slightly increased, and £100 has been provided for passage money. </para>

                <para class="block">It is therefore absurd to say that the reduction was recommended by the General . Officer. Commanding, because he protested against it as strongly as possible. The minimum for safety at Thursday Island is 101 men, and the garrison has been reduced to fifty-three. At Albany the minimum for safety is forty men, and the garrison has been reduced to thirty, whilst at Sydney the forces have been reduced from 278 to 217. These fortifications are most important, and should be manned by trained men. If vessels belonging to an enemy were to obtain access to any of the harbors referred to they could inflict irreparable damage. It is, therefore, foolish to reduce the number of gunners and other trained men below the minimum of safety. The expenditure involved in maintaining an effective force would not be very large, and I think we should satisfy our selves that our most important strategic bases are properly manned. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to obtain some information with regard to the fortifications and garrison at Thursday Island ; but I understand that the item bearing upon that military station has been passed during my temporary absence from the Chamber. I should like to know how many guns they have at Thursday Island, whether the guns are ancient or modern, the extent of their range, whether there is an ample supply of ammunition, and whether there are sufficient general stores. We are spending over £10,000 per annum upon that station, and I question whether there is any use in having a small garrison in such a place. The Estimates are being dealt with so hurriedly that it is not safe for a senator to leave the Chamber for even a few minutes. I think that it is desirable that we should know whether we are really getting any value for the £10,000 per annum we are spending upon the garrison at Thursday Island. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt it is desirable from a military point of view that that we should keep up garrisons at King George's Sound and Thursday Island, and other places at such a strength as to afford full security. Honorable senators understand, however, that in defence matters retrenchment is the order of the day, and that we cannot keep up any branch of the Defence Forces at a strength sufficient to afford absolute security. It is not intended to reduce the garrison at King George's Sound. Although last year provision was made for thirty men, the number fell as low as eighteen or twenty, and therefore we are really now proposing to strengthen the garrison by bringing it up to an establishment of twenty-six men. That will be an increase upon the number maintained last year. </para>

                    <para>- It is very unsatisfactory to hear the admission of the Minister that our garrisons ( are not sufficient to afford absolute security. ' A force of twenty-six or thirty men at a place j like Albany is absurdly inadequate. I realize the difficulties by which the Government 1 are beset. If Parliament will insist upon: cutting down the Estimates by large sums, it will be impossible for us to maintain an adequate Defence Force. I think a very strong effort should be made by Ministers to impress this fact upon honorable members so that they may realize the necessity of voting more money. I have no sympathy with those who desire to spend money unnecessarily upon our military forces ; but at the same time we should not reduce the whole of our military arrangements to a. farce. At our naval bases we should have a sufficient number of men to constitute a. reasonable force upon a peace establishment. It is a notorious fact that the number of the rank and file of the permanent forces throughout the States is utterly inadequate. We have not sufficient men to properly care for the guns and fortifications in the different States of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether that is so. It is notorious that we have not sufficient paid gunners to properly supervise the guns and fortifications which have been placed under their control, and for' which they are responsible. If honorable senators entertain the belief that we possess a force capable of defending our shores in case of attack they may as well realize at once that they are living in a fool's paradise. Probably it will be urged that there is sufficient manhood in Australia to repel any attempt at invasion. That might be true if we had a sufficient number of trained men to form the nucleus of an organized force, and if we possessed the requisite guns, rifles, and munitions of war. But it is a farce for honorable senators to argue that at the present time we have a sufficient number of men, even upon an ordinary peace establishment. I trust that Ministers will urge not only in this House, but in the other Chamber, that adequate provision shall be made in this respect, and that they will not be content with the absurdly insufficient number of men that is proposed for this particular naval base. </para>

                        <para>.- But the Attorney-General must recollect that these are only partially-paid men - men out of whom all the heart has been taken by the new regulations. When the present General assumed command of the Forces the total number of permanent artillery in the six States comprised 50 officers and 1,170 men. Even prior to that period the States had out down the number to a very dangerous degree. But what do we find now <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> First a reduction was made to 43 officers and 902 of other ranks ; then a further reduction to 38 officers and 820 men was recommended, but only as a temporary measure. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to connect my remarks with the establishment which it is proposed to provide at King George's Sound. The Government propose to station twenty-six or thirty men there. My contention is that, in consequence of the total of the forces having been so largely reduced, it is impossible to station an adequate number of men at that base. Although the permanent artillery of the States originally numbered 1,200, their strength has since been reduced to 750. It is therefore very necessary that the Government should urge upon Parliament the importance of adequately manning the forts at King George's Sound and other bases. I have no desire to make a second reading speech, because I have no right to do so in connexion with the division which is under discussion. I presume that we cannot add to the number of men for whom provision has been made in these Estimates. Such a proposal must come from the Government in the first instance. Whilst honorable senators are anxious to retrench as far as possible, I believe that their good sense will prompt them to vote whatever sum may be necessary for the efficient defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- I regret very much that I had not an opportunity to discuss the vote for the defence of Thursday Island. I merely desire to ask the Minister in charge of these Estimates if he will be good enough to give honorable senators some information as to the type of weapons which are in use at King George's Sound. Are they up-to-date and fit to repel any attack ? I think that we should know whether they are muzzle-loaders or breech loaders, and also when they were mounted there. It is of no use maintaining gunners if they are not provided with good weapons for use in case of emergency. In this respect there is considerable room for improvement at Thursday Island. </para>

                        <para>- It is a bad principle to allow when dealing with fixed salaries. Surely the Committee should know whose salaries are to be increased, and, if the officers concerned are under the Public Service Commissioner, whether the increases have been recommended by the Public Service Commissioner. Such information would be useful to the Committee. It is evidently proposed to raise the salaries of certain officers on the head-quarters staffs to the extent of £848. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to say a word or two as to the principle which the honorable senator, who states that he is endeavouring to protect the Committee, desires to establish. The principle enunciated, by him is that the Committee should not vote this year a sum in excess of last year's expenditure. That would be a very unfair position to take up, because the expenditure of any Department for any given year is invariably less than the amount actually appropriated for its service. It must necessarily be less. A Department cannot expend more than the amount voted for its use ; but it may expend less. It would be impossible to ask the Committee to vote the exact amount to be expended, because various changes must take place even in connexion with the working of a staff" of clerks. A clerk receiving a certain salary may be replaced by another clerk in receipt of a lower remuneration, and thus each item of expenditure cannot be given. They would overlap to a great extent, and if an attempt were made to put such information before the Committee, honorable senators would have a right to say - " The Government are attempting to deceive us." We might, for example, have the sum of,£400 in one line, when as a matter of fact only a portion of that amount would relate to the corresponding figures in the second column. It is impossible to show why out of a total of £4,109 appropriated last year for the district head-quarters' staff of New South Wales, only £3,828 was expended. The men whose offices are described were employed, and received their customary salaries ; but from various causes the amount required was less than the sum actually appropriated. The sum which we are now asking Parliament to vote is- less than the amount appropriated last year, but it is necessarily iri excess of the actual expenditure for 1902-3. We must always make provision for contingencies, and it is unreasonable for the honorable senator to ask the Committee to request that the vote shall not be in excess of the sum expended last year. I can say from my knowledge of the working of the Department that it would be exceedingly unwise for the Parliament to adopt such a policy. It ' would tend to discourage all savings on the Estimates. At present a Department endeavours to work as economically as possible, in order to be able to show a good result ; but the honorable senator would introduce a principle which would penalise a Department which evinced a desire to effect savings. The more it saved, the less would be the sum voted for its maintenance in the following year. That would certainly be most undesirable. So far as I can gather there were no increases last year. The savings effected were due simply to changes that took place owing to various circumstances. The amount actually voted was not required. The same thing must invariably happen in relation to a given vote. </para>

                        <para>- No. If the honorable and learned senator will refer to the Estimates, he will find that a sum of £73,585 is set apart for the permanent forces in New South Wales, £51,544 for the militia or partially paid forces, and £7, 309 for the volunteer forces. Then we have an item of £12,669 for ammunition. I wish to know how that ammunition is to be distributed. There is a further item relating to general contingencies, and I also desire to obtain some detailed information in regard to that vote. </para>

When we reach the several Departments, honorable senators are generally allowed at least some latitude in discussing the first division ; but once that division has been passed, honorable senators must confine themselves strictly to the division immediately before the Committee. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I must again return to the charge. It is highly desirable that honorable senators should be able to find out at a glance exactly how much our Permanent Forces are costing. Of course, by wading laboriously through the Estimates, I can find that out for myself; but surely the clerks of the Defence Department ought to relieve honorable senators of this superfluous labour, and frame their accounts in such a way as to show at once how the money has been expended. That is my complaint, and I think it is a legitimate one.

                        <para>- " Absolute safety " means a great many things. In the four militia regiments alone there has been a reduction of no fewer than 500 men, and of £5,000 in pay. I turn to another page of the Estimates, and I find that in connexion with the volunteers there has been a much larger reduction. The volunteers in New South Wales have been reduced by over 1,000 - from 3,544 to 2,482. In the unpaid forces, for mere clothing and management, there is a reduction from £11,300 to £7,300- a decrease of no less than £4,000. Can Ministers give the Senate an assurance that it is possible to maintain in adequate order the forces when such reductions are made in the expenditure not for pay - not one penny piece is for pay - but merely for clothing and contingencies <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It will be within the recollection of the Senate that a return, laid upon the table upon my motion a. little while ago, showed that the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth had been reduced by 25 per cent, in the two years during which the Commonwealth Government have had charge of them; the reduction being 7,000 out of 28,000. There has been no recruiting for a length of time. I do not know how long that regulation has been in force ; but, in addition, an extra number of men have left the force, and a great number have been discharged, while companies and corps have been broken up and disbanded. If inquiries were made, I think it would be found that at the present time the effective strength of the Defence Force is not much more than half of what it was when taken over by the Commonwealth. If one-quarter of the men had gone by 31st March, and there has been no recruiting, while companies and corps have been disbanded all over the States, the remaining three-quarters must have been materially reduced. When we come to consider the Estimates next year, we may find that, with those wholesale reductions, the amount required will be materially less than that for this year, for the simple reason that men are not available. It is mere affectation to close one's eyes to the figures given in these documents placed before us. There has been a tremendous reduction in the number of the citizen forces and in the amount expended on their equipment and maintenance. I have already shown a reduction of practically £1,000 for each of four volunteer regiments, the difference in the total expenditure being as between £11,300 and £7,300. i The number of troops, as I pointed out, has been cut down by about 1,100 men. </para>

                        <para>- There are now eight companies instead of six in each regiment, but the strength of the company has been cut down from 100 men to sixty men. I am now referring to the reorganization scheme which was recently laid on the table of the Senate, and has been published in the press throughout the Commonwealth. The number of each regiment in both the militia and the volunteers has been reduced by 125 men ; and, in addition, several companies of volunteers have been disbanded. While four regiments of the partially-paid or militia forces have been reduced by 125 men each, the volunteer division lias been reduced not by 500 men, but by 1,100 men. When we are voting these amounts for both the partially-paid and volunteer forces, is, I think, the proper time to express an opinion as to whether it is desirable to continue the two branches - whether or not the force should be all partially-paid or all volunteers. The present state of affairs is, I believe, admitted on all hands to be unsatisfactory. I believe it was desired on the part of the Government, and possibly on the part of their military advisers, when the Commonwealth was first established, to change the volunteer force into a partially-paid force. I believe that was in contemplation ; but whether it was ever more than contemplated I do not know. Judging by the Estimates, it seems extraordinary that the volunteer force, the members of which receive no pay, are the most " slaughtered " in the' way of reductions. The retrenchment falls most heavily on the unpaid men, and most lightly on the professional soldier. I shall not discuss the professional branch of the forces, because the Estimates in regard to these have already been passed. We have before us, however, the question of the partially-paid and volunteer forces, and in regard to the former the expenditure has been very materially reduced. The volunteers, however, suffer in that their clothing allowance has been reduced to 30s. per annum per man. It is an interesting problem whether it is possible for a uniform to be provided for that amount, when we consider the wear and tear in camp, and on parade. All kinds of weather have to be faced, and uniforms have to be slept in, on the ground, when in camp, and as straw is very seldom permitted, a single blanket does not afford much protection from the dirt of an earthen floor. Under the circumstances, I am inclined to think that as in the past, it will not be found possible to provide a uniform for the amount mentioned, though of course if it were, it would be all the better for the pockets of the Commonwealth taxpayers. The Government appear to take considerable credit for not expending the total amount of the Parliamentary vote. I take exception to such an attitude, because in my opinion Parliament, having voted the money, desires that it shall be expended, and not that the defence forces shall be starved. In view of not only the large reductions made in the Estimates by the other branch of the Legislature, but also of the large savings effected by the administration of the Government, it seems to me that by voting the enormously reduced sum on the Estimates, we run a risk which is not in accordance with public interest. To reduce expenditure too far, especially in the case of the wholly unpaid men, would be to expose us to the danger that the Commonwealth may not get the efficient working force which the people would desire. It is true that we are voting, in round figures, about £500,000. How much of this will be treated as savings, I do not know ; but it is wholly undesirable to vote such a sum unless an adequate force is the. outcome. I am very much afraid, however, that we shall not get the adequate force for which Ministers hope. I know the difficulties caused by the reductions of expenditure which have taken place from time to time,, and my object is to urge on Ministers the unwisdom of paring down, in administration, the paltry amounts we are now asked to vote. Had I thought of the matter, I should have given notice of a question, with a view to ascertain how many men are available for the defence of the Commonwealth at the present time. I fear that the numbers have been very seriously reduced, and that they will be still more reduced, unless the citizen forces are encouraged by a little more of that generosity which they have a right to expect at the hands of those to whom they give gratuitous services, or services paid for by a remuneration so paltry as to be hardly worth discussing. </para>

                        <para>- No one can regret more than I do the necessity for having to retrench in the Defence Force generally, and in this branch of it particularly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> of course recognises the peculiar circumstances of the present position. The necessity for economy has been strongly impressed upon the Government, and we have asked the General Officer Commanding to prepare a scheme of re-organization which will fit the economical desires of Parliament. Having to re-organize on the basis of the amount voted by Parliament, he has proposed a certain strength with regard to each of the divisions of the Defence Force. Some honorable senators have been deprecating any reduction in the permanent force ; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> objects to a reduction in the partially-paid and volunteer branches of the Defence Forces ; and, no doubt, other honorable senators will separately object to reductions in other directions. But when we have considered all these matters we get back to the position in which the General Officer Commanding is placed, and remember that we have required him to re-organize the Defence Force on a certain financial basis. I very much regret the necessity for reducing the number of partially-paid forces1., but the reduction is carried out in accordance with a scheme of re-organization which, I think, should have a fair trial, and which we all hope will be successful. After the scheme is accepted and in working order, it will be for Parliament to say to what extent it will go in voting supplies for this Department. Whatever the Parliament may be willing to vote the Defence Department will be glad to expend in the most profitable manner. </para>

                    <para>- ! sympathize very much with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in the strictures he has just passed upon the cutting down that has been going on in the volunteer forces. It is necessary, to begin with, that we shall have a clear idea as to the kind of Defence Force which the people of the Commonwealth desire to have. So far as I have been able to gather, it is the desire of the people that the Defence Force should be composed of a small nucleus of permanent men, together with a citizen force of volunteers. Apparently the Commandant and the Government cling to the idea of maintaining a partially- paid force in a comparatively strong position. I do not think that is in accordance with the wishes of the people. As far as I have been able to interpret their desire, it is that the partially-paid force should be subjected to a reduction - should gradually disappear, and should be replaced by a volunteer force. In comparing the cost of the permanent men with that of the partially-paid men and volunteers, I find that the permanent men cost nearly £200 ; the partially-paid men nearly £15 ; and the volunteers between £4 and £5 per head per annum. I put it to honorable senators, whether it would not be better to spend any sum between £5 and £7 per head per annum upon our volunteers, and have a much larger number of them, than to spend so large a, sum on our partially-paid forces, and have so very few men to show for our expenditure. For an expenditure in. pay of £51,544 we have only 4,966 partially-paid men, whilst, for an expenditure of £7,309, we have 2,482 volunteers. During the past year, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has pointed out, the numbers of the volunteer force have been reduced by 1,100. Honorable senators may fairly ask why the volunteer arm of the service is being reduced to such an extent. Have the people of the Commonwealth not stated their desire to be that our army should be composed as largely as possible of volunteer forces? That being generally accepted as the desire of the people, it was the duty of the Government and of the Commandant to reduce the expenditure on the partially-paid forces, and to offer every encouragement to our young men to join the volunteer forces. We must have a. definite policy of some kind in connexion with our Defence Force. As the Attorney-General has pointed out, honorable senators complain that this or that branch of the Defence Force is not sufficiently, considered, but we are always bound by the condition that the money which we are able to spend on a Defence Force is limited. That being the case, it becomes the paramount duty of the Government to get as much as they possibly can for the money they spend. What is the best way to do that? I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> favours an increase in the partially-paid forges, but my opinion is that we cannot afford to add very largely to the numbers of that branch of the service. I think our policy should rather be the reverse of that, and that we ought to increase our volunteer forces. I have heard it stated that young men will not join the volunteers, and do not : take any interest in military service, unless 1 they are paid. I do not know whether that is the case, but I know that when I was a young man, thousands of young men in Great Britain took part in the volunteer movement without ever getting a single shilling out of it. I am sure that we have in Australia large numbers of young men who would be glad to join our volunteer forces if sufficient inducement were offered to them - if only in the way of free ammunition. </para>

                        <para>- We ought to very largely add to that method of establishing a Defence force. Let us contrast the numbers. Including everything, the volunteers cost between <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> and £5 per head, while the militia cost about £15 per head. In New South Wales, for instance, we have 4,966 militia, costing £15 per head, and 2,842 volunteers costing between £4 and <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> per head. Would it not be much better to have 12,000 or 13,000 volunteers in that State for exactly the same sum as is now spent on 4,966 militia and 2,482 volunteers? By adopting the system I advocate, we should double the number of men available for service when required, and train a very large number of our people to shoot well. The Government should take seriously into consideration the question of whether it ought not to encourage the rifle clubs and volunteer arm of the service in the way suggested. I know that the General Officer Commanding is opposed to a citizen army, and is in favour of a permanent force. </para>

                        <para>- I know that he is not getting a large force, and that we are not able to give him it ; but, as I said before, we have to cut our coat according to our cloth, and I think we could get the best service by encouraging volunteers. In my opinion the Government ought to put down its foot, and tell the General Officer Commanding that that branch of the service must be encouraged. The excuse has been given that men will not take an interest in the defence of their country unless they are paid, that the only way to bring them into the service is to enrol them as militia. I do not know whether that is the case or not. But it is very desirable that the other method should be given a fair trial. I feel almost certain that we should get a very large number of young men to join the volunteer force if they were given the encouragement which I think ought to be given. Why not offer prizes for the best shots, why not have shooting tournaments all over the.

I believe that if that were done a considerable number of young men would gladly join the volunteer force. I have nothing to say against the partially-paid force. I know that it includes a very large number of worthy men; but I also know that so far as a certain section of the force is concerned, membership is looked upon more as a pot-boiling expedient than anything else. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> said that in his opinion the Committee ought to express its opinion as to whether the partially-paid or the volunteer force should be encouraged, and in order to afford an opportunity for the expression of its opinion I move - </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> in endeavouring to show that we ought to depress one branch of the Defence Force in favour of another. The position is that we want all these branches. We recognise that one man may be able to render better service to the country by becoming a member of the partially-paid force ; that a second man, who cannot spare so much time, may be able to do better by joining the volunteer force; and that a third man, who, perhaps, cannot join either of those branches, may be an excellent member of a rifle club. We are not discouraging any of these branches. We are giving more consideration to the rifle clubs than was previously given. We are giving just as much consideration to the volunteer forces as was previously given. And with regard to the partially-paid force, we are reducing the number in consequence of the desire for economy. But what is happening, in many cases, is that we are converting volunteers into partially-paid forces. It is contrary to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> ideas, but I think it is a perfectly wise course to take. We recognise that these volunteers are performing certain service now ; we believe that they are in a position to qualify as militia ; and we say that if they do they shall be paid. That is the reason why the Estimates provide for a smaller reduction in the partially-paid than in the volunteer forces. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> spoke about the policy which has been adopted with regard to the partially-paid and volunteer forces. I am not talking about what may happen in a particular locality, because in some cases there may be more volunteers, and in other cases more partially-paid men. What has happened throughout the Commonwealth under the re-organization scheme is that in many cases we have converted volunteers into partially-paid forces, and, consequently, men who were not paid before for their services will get payment in future. I think that the principle of partially-paid service is sounder and more wholesome than that of volunteer service. </para>

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - I should be at once ruled out of order if I were to proceed to discuss any question not relevant to the division of the Estimates before the Committee. While I am not going to contest the Attorney-General's sweeping statement with regard to the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth I shall discuss the position in New South Wales. My honorable and learned friend was entirely wrong, except in regard to one small matter. One company of sixty volunteers was transferred to the partially-paid branch, but that is the sum total of the transfers in
                </para>
                <para class="block">New South Wales connected with the items which we are now discussing. The Attorney-General has stated that the same inducements are being offered, and the same consideration shown to the volunteer forces at the present time as were given in the past ; but, as to that, he is entirely mistaken. To begin with, for many years in New South Wales an allowance of £3 per man was given for clothing and sundries. The allowance now given is £1 10s. for clothing and £1 for sundries, and under the heading of sundries are included a large number of expenses which formerly were not charged against the £3 allowance. As a matter of fact, the men are worse off to the amount of £1 per head per annum now than they were formerly, and a difference such as that is likely to go a long way in accounting for the difference between efficiency and inefficiency. IF <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will again look at the figures, he. will see that he rather overstated the cost of the volunteer forces. The total sum provided for 2482 men is £7,300, or less than £3 per head. With some little knowledge of what lam speaking about, I venture to say that that amount is materially less than was voted for the volunteer service some time ago. Referring to the re-organization scheme, I would point out that these volunteers - these particularly cheap soldiers - have allotted to them in the defence scheme which has been published everywhere the defence of the ports of Australia, apart from artillery defence. They will act as garrison troops, while the other branch of the service will act as a field force, and will roam about the Commonwealth, meeting the enemy if he goes sufficiently far inland. It is the volunteers who will have to bear the entire brunt of his attack. Therefore the policy of the Government should be, not to make this service less attractive, but to make it more attractive, and to induce the best men to enter it. I do not agree with the Attorney-General that the responsibility for this policy is to be thrown upon the General Officer Commanding. I do not throw the responsibility upon him at all ; I throw it upon the Ministers. It is their policy that I am discussing. The General Officer Commanding no doubt does the best he can with the limited sum placed at his disposal ; but I am discussing the public policy of the Ministry, not the military details for which the General Officer Commanding is, no doubt, responsible. I have made these remarks, not because I believe that we have now an opportunity to alter affairs, for I know that that is not so, but because if nothing is said, if our opinions are never expressed, the Ministry will have nothing to guide it as to the views of Parliament. I cannot support the request for a reduction. I do not wish to set up the volunteer forces as against the partially-paid forces. In my opinion neither the one nor the other branch of the service is receiving adequate attention. I am afraid that experience will prove that the small sum which the partially-paid troops are to receive in the future will be insufficient to induce the attendance that is expected. I feel sure, too, that the volunteer force will be so pinched in ways and means that service in it will lose its attraction for suitable men. What will be the use of spending money upon training the members of rifle clubs and cadets if the partially-paid and volunteer services are so inadequately provided for that trained men will have no inducement to join them ? The Government should look the position straight in the face. If they desire to have a useful Defence Force they must find the necessary money, and must not accept a negative vote in Parliament without daring the consequences of a division. I have made these remarks because I think it a duty I owe to the Commonwealth to say what, in my opinion, is desirable in the public interest in connexion with defence expenditure. I should like to have a vote which will give some indication of the wishes of the Committee, but as I do not wish to see the partially-paid forces reduced or discouraged in any way, I cannot vote for the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> I would rather see him move a request for an increase of £1 in the vote than a request for a reduction. If he did so, I would vote with him with the greatest pleasure, in order to obtain an indication of the views of the Committee on this subject. </para>

                    and myself look at this matter from different points of view. He thinks that we are spending too little upon both the volunteer and the partially-paid forces, whereas my opinion is that we are spending quite enough on defence, and cannot afford to spend more. I desire that we shall get the very best value for the money that we consider we are able to afford.

                        <para>- That is the only inference to be drawn from the honorable senator's remarks. In my opinion the resources of the Commonwealth will not permit us to increase our defence expenditure, and therefore I say that we should get the best value for the money we vote. That, I think, can be done by allotting more to the volunteers and less to the militia. It is for that reason that I have moved the motion. It is extremely desirable that we should express an opinion upon the subject. Any uncertainty or hesitancy as to the adoption of a particular course is likely to be fatal to the formation of an efficient Defence Force. We ought to make up our minds on the subject, and express our opinions clearly for the benefit of the Government and of the Commonwealth. I ask honorable senators, whatever their views may be, to give the Government an expression of opinion which will be a guide to them in this matter. If we desire that more money shall be spent upon defence, let us say so. I think we cannot afford to spend more ; but a better allocation of the money voted is necessary. </para>

                (Queensland). - Under the head of general contingencies in connexion with the vote for the New South Wales military forces I find that provision is made for railway fares and railway freights, £3,000 ; steamer fares and freights, £150 ; other travelling expenses, £2,000; incidentals, £1,000; bank exchange, £100; fuel and light, £550 and so on. I think that some explanation should be given regarding these items, because the total is a very large one, amounting to £7,925. Then again, I notice that £500 is provided for postage and telegrams. I should like to have some explanation regarding that item.

The letters and telegrams sent by regiments and corps have to be paid for out of the vote previously dealt with, which is a very paltry allowance. This item must have reference to the expense incurred upon postage and telegrams by the staff officials.

                        <para>- I wish to enter a strong protest against the discrepancy between the pay of the Tasmanian Forces, and that provided for in the other States. We have been told that this distinction was made in the interests of economy at the request of the Tasmanian Government. The Minister was unable to tell me who made this request. It appears, however, that it formed part of the general request made two or three years ago, that the expenditure in every department should be kept down to the lowest possible limit. I cannot be charged with having any great love for militarism, but I feel that if we are to have a Defence Force in Tasmania, the officers and men should be placed on exactly the same footing as those occupying similar positions in other States. So far as defence matters are concerned, , Tasmania has derived no benefit from entering the Federation. I cannot understand why Ministers should have allowed themselves to be so far led away from their obvious duty as to listen to a request such as that referred to. They should not have consented to perpetrate an unfederal act and to inflict a manifest injustice upon the members of the Tasmanian Defence Forces. It has been admitted by the Treasurer that injustice has been done, and we have no distinct assurance that the present grievance will be redressed. I am sure that this question is likely to occupy a prominent place in Tasmania during the forthcoming electoral campaign. </para>

                        <para>- Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> specifically called attention to that matter, he also spoke of the discrepancy between the rates of pay in Tasmania and in other States at ordinary times. He went so far as to say that the grievance was such an old one that the members of the Defence Forces were disgusted, and strongly inclined to resign. In regard to the increase of the expenditure upon the head-quarters staff in Tasmania, I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who called attention to the matter, that the six staff officers, who constitute the District Head-quarters Staff in Tasmania, draw salaries amounting to £1,460, representing an average of only £243 each, whereas in Western Australia - a State with which I think I may fairly institute a comparison - there are five staff officers drawing salaries amounting to £1.510 per annum, or an average of £302 each. I wish to ascertain why the Tasmanian officers - for whom I do not hold any particular brief - should perform the same work for an average of £243 per annum that the Western Australian officers perform for an average of £302 ? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> if he can justify that anomaly ? Why should the six officers in Tasmania discharge duties for £243 annually, for the performance of which the five officers of the district headquarters' staff in Western Australia receive £302? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. They are engaged exclusively in the discharge of military duties. The relative size of the States has nothing whatever to do with the question. If the officers are fully employed they night as well be travelling over a large State as over a small State. Again, the Tasmanian Defence Forces, including the cadet corps, number 2,555, and the total expenditure upon them is £21,233, whereas in Western Australia the Defence Forces number only 2,181, and the total expenditure upon them is £28,348. Thus the Tasmanian forces number approximately 400 more than do those of Western Australia, and yet the expenditure upon them is £7,000 less. I put this illustration to show the discrepancies which exist. I trust that we shall have some further assurance from Ministers that these anomalies will be removed, and that the Tasmanian forces will be placed upon an equal footing with those of the other States. It is all very well to say that provision will be made to remedy them in the Estimates which will be submitted twelve months hence. That is not the right way to look at the matter. It is quite possible for Ministers to remedy these evils immediately, even if we pass the Estimates in their present form. I do not intend to move any request, although the serious injustice under which the Tasmanian forces have laboured for some time past would justify the adoption of that course. </para>

Since this question was previously debated upon a motion for adjournment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> I have devoted some time to investigating the state of affairs which he described. I trust therefore that Ministers will give me their attention, because what I have to say is, at least, accurate. The Attorney-General has stated, by way of interjection, that on the occasion in question he promised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> that the grievances which he brought forward would be remedied. He is quite correct in that statement, and I have no doubt that he will carry out his promise. The unfortunate feature of the matter is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> asked for very much less than he ought to have done. </para>

                        <para>- I am not blaming the Attorney-General for what he did. I simply desire to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> to put it mildly, made a blunder. The history of the condition of the Defence Forces in Tasmania is briefly this : Many years ago Tasmania annually spent upon those forces more than the amount which appears upon these Estimates. At that time they were a fairly effective body. But, later on, bad times were experienced, and, as a result, the Defence Forces had to be retrenched. They were retrenched to such an extent that their members grew disaffected - a condition of affairs which was dissipated only by the South African war. That war gave a fillip to the volunteer movement in Tasmania, and while it lasted things were all right. When it terminated, however, a reaction occurred, and the men again grew discontented. At that time Federation was on the eve of accomplishment, and accordingly they were told that when the Commonwealth assumed control of the Defence Department their grievances would be redressed. But the year 1901 passed without any alteration being effected. The same remark is applicable to the year 1902. Towards the end of that year Major-General Hutton visited Tasmania, and informed the officers and men that upon the Estimates for 1903 provision would be made to redress the disabilities under which they laboured. He therefore urged them to possess their souls in patience for a little longer, promising that justice would be done to them. Evidently something has intervened between the promise made by him and its performance, because nothing has since been done, and the men have now been asked to wait a year longer. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is complicated by the financial necessities of Tasmania. I admit the financial difficulty, and that it would be useless for me to talk upon this question if I were not prepared to make a practical suggestion with a view to remedy the existing state of affairs. I am, however, ready to offer such a suggestion, and I trust that Ministers will give effect to it, because I know that it will meet with practically the unanimous approval of the Defence Forces of Tasmania. Major-General Hutton has divided the forces of that State - apart from the permanent men - into the field force and the garrison force. As Ministers are aware, the members of the Tasmanian field force are not paid upon the same scale as are those of the rest of the the field forces of the Commonwealth. In contradistinction to the garrison forces which remain in each particular State, those forces may be called upon to serve anywhere within the Commonwealth. Tasmania's grievance has reference to her field force. The position is briefly this : 500 men belonging to that force may be drafted from Tasmania to Queensland, there to serve side by side with others forming part of the same division who would be receiving a higher rate of pay. That state of things is not conducive to discipline. I know that the Attorney-General recognises that fact as fully as I do. The difficulty is to decide how an alteration can be effected. The field force of Tasmania aggregates about 882 men. Her total number of volunteers - using the term in its generic sense - is roughly speaking about 2,000. An attempt is now being made to spread a certain vote which appears upon these Estimates over the whole of these forces. Under that plan the Tasmanian field force does not receive the same rate of pay as do the field forces in any of the other States. Whilst I do not think I should be justified in asking for any additional expenditure, I claim that the sum which it is proposed to vote should be spent more economically, and that the 882 men comprising the Tasmanian field force I should be paid exactly the same rate as ^ are the rest of the field forces throughout I the Commonwealth.' To permit of that being done we must effect economies in the | other brandies of the Tasmanian Defence Force. If we do that we shall be studying the true interests of economy, because honorable senators will recognise that that term does not necessarily imply limiting our, expenditure so much as insisting that we receive good value for it. I admit that there are a few other men in the Defence Force of that State who do not quite come within the category of a " field " force and to whom it is desirable to offer more pay. These number about a hundred, and include a few members of the artillery and some of the engineers. The reason why it is desirable to grant the members of the Tasmanian field force extra pay is to insure that they shall engage in daylight training. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron's</inline> claim a little while ago for the expenditure of an additional £692 was based upon a demand for camp pay to the men during a fortnight in each year. But if we desire them to become efficient, that is not all that is required. What is wanted is daylight parade or training ; and we cannot obtain that unless we pay men to engage in it. It is quite unfair to expect members of the Tasmanian field force to undertake daylight training if they are not paid equally with those in the other States. In order that we may offer the S82 men who comprise that force the same rate of pay for daylight work that is enjoyed by the rest of the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth, I urge the Ministry to adopt the suggestion which I have made. Let us save the money upon the remainder of the Tasmanian forces - let them remain volunteers - and I can assure the Ministry that both officers and men will be perfectly satisfied. If we can arrange to place some 900 men in Tasmania upon the same footing as their comrades upon the mainland, the rest of the force will remain perfectly loyal as volunteers. </para>

                <para class="block">Government to distribute the money in a different way. I suggest that they should give full pay to say 900 men, in order that they may become equally efficient with the field forces in the rest of the Commonwealth ; and in order to provide the funds necessary for this purpose they should effect savings in respect of the remaining Tasmanian Forces, comprising over 1,000 men. The Defence Forces in that State would be. abundantly satisfied with such an arrangement. I trust that the Ministry will accept my assurance, because I have taken pains to ascertain the opinion of the forces in Tasmania, and I am sure that this would be a reasonable solution of the difficulty. The better system to adopt would be, of course, to treat all the Commonwealth Forces alike ; but the men in the Tasmanian Defence Forces are just as willing as we are to recognise that there is a difficulty in relation to that State, and they would be well pleased if the field forces there were adequately paid, and raised to the state of efficiency which prevails in other parts of the Commonwealth. I do not wish to embroil the State of Tasmania with the Commonwealth Government, but it is obvious that this is an instance, which will probably recur during the history of Federation, of a State endeavouring to retrench, not in connexion with some Department which it wholly controls, but in connexion with one controlled by the Federal Government. Tasmania is engaged in a financial struggle, and the Government there find it difficult to retrench. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will readily understand that in present circumstances the State Government is strongly tempted to refrain from practising any further economies in Departments which it wholly controls, and, during the bookkeeping period, to effect indirect retrenchment in a Department controlled by the Commonwealth. I have no desire to deal bitterly with the subject ; but that is what the Tasmanian Government is doing, and it is for that reason that the Commonwealth Government have been induced by the Ministry of the State to cut down the pay of the Defence Forces in Tasmania. To put the position in a nutshell, the Tasmanian Government has used the Federal Government for its own purposes of retrenchment. Politically, the Federal Government has been of service to the Tasmanian Government. The State Government has avoided the odium which it would possibly have incurred if, instead of effecting retrenchment in relation to a Commonwealth Department, it had retrenched nearer home. I frankly admit that I cannot move any motion on this Bill which would further the object that I have in view ; but I feel certain that Ministers, in this Chamber at all events, will give the matter some consideration. I firmly believe that they will find ray proposition not only practicable, but one that will meet with the hearty approbation of the Defence Forces in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the honorable and learned senator has grasped this question in all its details. I have a very clear recollection of what took place upon the occasion of the recent debate on this subject, and I shall endeavour, as briefly as possible, to give honorable senators an idea of how the matter stands. The General Officer Commanding was requested to draw up a re-organization scheme for the whole of the Commonwealth, and he provided that the Defence Forces in each State should bear a reasonable proportion to the population of that State. The scheme allots a certain proportion of the forces to Tasmania, and, in order to give effect to it, we should require about £4,000 more than we are now asking Parliament to vote for the Defence Forces in that State. </para>

                        <para>- If we have a Defence scheme for the whole of the Commonwealth, we cannot keep cutting and hacking it about in order to meet the exigencies of this or that State. The honorable and learned senator really complains of our failure to carry out the re-organization scheme in Tasmania, and that failure is due to our desire to meet the financial exigencies of the State. In order to carry out the scheme of the General Officer Commanding in its entirety, we should require about £4,000 more than we are asking for the Defence Forces in Tasmania. As I pointed out on the occasion of the debate to which I have referred, no specific request for retrenchment was made to us by the Tasmanian Government ; but there has been a general desire that we should endeavour to so make our arrangements as to suit more particularly the financial exigencies of Tasmania and Queensland. That was the reason why it was considered desirable, if possible, that we should lessen Tasmania's burden in connexion with the Defence Forces. As I pointed out before, there was another peculiarity, inasmuch as the Defence Forces in Tasmania, although technically militia, had almost ceased to be paid. They received only a small amount in respect of camp pay. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator will remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> remarked on that occasion that I was confusing the issue in relation to the two sums of £4,000 and £15,000, and that all that would be required was a sum of about £620. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> said that he would resume his seat. </para>

If we thought that Tasmania should be asked to bear this additional expenditure, it would be necessary for us to provide a further sum of £4,000. I should certainly object to the honorable and learned senator's proposal, although I do not know whether it would involve an increased or reduced expenditure. If Tasmania could afford to bear the increased expenditure, the scheme prepared by the General Officer Commanding should be carried out there as in the other States. </para>

There may have been some misunderstanding in connexion with the recent discussion of this question ; but it was certainly not on my part. The request then made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> and supported, I believe, by other honorable senators from Tasmania, was that for this year we should give the whole of these men full rates of pay during the time that they are in camp. It was estimated that that would entail an expenditure of £600, but the outlay would be much more. Whatever it is, we propose to provide for it out of the Treasurer's advance, and subsequently to ask Parliament to vote the money. I think that the other matter might be allowed to stand over until next year. I thoroughly recognise the force of the case made out on behalf of the forces of Tasmania, and naturally the Defence Department very much regret that the reorganization scheme has not been carried out in its integrity in all the States. I think that honorable senators may rest assured that every effort will be made in the next Estimates to provide for that scheme. </para>

                        <para>- In all instances where the services of an officer are permanently required, he ought to be given a permanent position. Neither male nor female officers have been treated fairly in this respect. I have had communications from officers who have been classed as temporary, although they are practically permanently employed. Under the Public Service Act, they can only be retained in temporary positions for a certain time, and then they have to be discharged. But what takes place <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Some other persons with less experience are put in their places, and the work is not done so efficiently. That system is going on at the present time. I will take the instrument fitters by way of illustration. In a mechanical business of this description, men who have been engaged for a considerable time, and know the routine of the work, should hold permanent positions. But, instead of that, there are twenty or thirty of these officers who, although there is enough work to keep them permanently employed, are not placed upon the permanent staff, their services being dispensed with at the end of six months. I believe that three months' grace has been given ; and, when that has expired, these men must go and make room for others, who will be permanently appointed. If they were really temporary hands, when their term of employment expired it would not be necessary to put others in their places. The very fact that it is necessary to replace them in order to carry on the work, is, as the lawyers would say <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence that they ought to be on the permanent staff. I want to know why they are not appointed, or whether the business of the Commonwealth is to be carried on as it has been in some of the States, where men have been discharged simply for the purpose of enabling others to be put in their places. Of course, if the officers in question were incompetent, they should be sent away forthwith, and competent officers should replace them. But, under our legislation, it appears that competent men have to be replaced by persons of less experience. While that is the case our affairs are not being managed as they should be. </para>

                        <para>- Others have been appointed, or are about to be appointed. Another point to which I wish to direct attention is that when we entered into Federation certain conditions were imposed on the Federal Government in regard to taking over men and women who were in the employment of the States. Has that been done in all cases ? Has every man and woman who was employed in the transferred departments before Federation been taken over? That question arises in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department. Before Federation there were a number of persons employed in the cleaning of the central offices. In the majority of instances the charing and cleaning are done by widows. Some time ago I asked a series of questions as to the number of persons employed in the cleaning of the post-offices in the capitals of the States. The replies showed that these cleaners were not taken over, although they were doing work for the Commonwealth. In most of the States, with the exception of South Australia, a system of sweating has been carried on concerning the payment of the cleaners. That system ought to be considered a disgrace to the Commonwealth. I do not wish to enter into the particulars, but honorable senators have only to turn to the answers given to my questions, and they will find that unfortunate women, some of whom are widows, who have families to bring up in a respectable manner, have had to work for not more than 1 5s. a week. </para>

                        <para>- Either in New South Wales or in Western Australia; the honorable and learned senator can ascertain by turning to the answers given to my questions. South Australia is the only State in which a respectable amount has been paid for the services rendered. Why were not those unfortunate widows taken over and made permanent employes just as were the other officers ? There must have been some reason for declining to take them over, and I should like to know what those reasons are. | There have also been several instances where young women have been employed by the States in the Post and Telegraph Depart- : ment for a number of years, and because ( they were not permanent officers they were ; discharged when the Department was transferred, ether officers being put in their places. When anomalies of that description creep into our administration it is time that 1 some inquiry was made, and something done | to render justice to those who have served | the States in the past and who are prepared to serve the Commonwealth in the future. I hope that when the Attorney-General or the Vice-President of the Executive Council replies, some explanation will be given of the anomalies which I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that if such anomalies exist in the Post and Telegraph Department they exist in other Departments : and what the honorable senator has discussed is the action of the Public Service Commissioner in relation to the Post and Telegraph Department. The Public Service Act provides that the rights and privileges of all permanent officers shall be the same as they were under the States Acts, and that in certain cases temporary officers shall be made permanent, with all attendant rights and privileges. In other cases the Act deliberately provides that a person temporarily employed shall not be employed for more than six months, or, at most, nine months, and shall not be re-employed until after an interval of six months. That provision was deliberately adopted by Parliament in order to carry out the principle of rotation, and in order that permanent work shall not be monopolized by one set of persons - that temporary employes should not by continual employment become practically the holders of permanent positions without complying with the requirements of the Public Service Act. Section 33 of the Act provides that where a person was in the employment of any State at the time of the establishment of the Commonwealth, he may, on the certificate of the Public Service Commissioner, be appointed to a permanent position without complying with the requirements as to age or as to examination. These were the provisions on which the Public Service Commissioner had to act, and he was supplied by the heads of Departments with a list of the officers employed temporarily, and also with a report as to any necessity there might be for making certain positions permanent. Upon the information supplied, the Public Service Commissioner recommended that in certain cases offices previously filled by temporary employes should in future be considered permanent and filled by permanent officers. In such cases the temporary officers employed were for the future employed permanently. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> complaint is that the power given to the Commissioner was not exercised in a sufficiently full and free manner. </para>

How are we possibly to discuss this matter unless we have specific instances <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It rests with the Commissioner to say whether or not works shall be carried out by permanent officers or by temporary employes ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is of opinion that the Public Service Commissioner should have made more appointments of a permanent character. It is possible, however, that honorable senators may be of the contrary opinion, namely, that too many officers have been given permanent positions.

                        <para>- The Commissioner ; but, as a matter of fact, it is not the Commissioner who decides. The case I have in my mind is that of a Victorian telegraph line repairer, named Tucker, who had been in the service for two years. This man was in the service as a temporary employ when the Department was transferred, and along with all the telegraph line repairers in the various States was by proclamation exempt from the section of the Public Service Act which limit their employment to a period of six months. The object of the exemption was to enable the Public Service Commissioner to determine which of the men should be appointed as permanent telegraph line repairers. During the whole time of his employment, no fault whatever was found with this man Tucker, or with the way in which he performed his work ; but when the list was issued by the Commissioner showing- the men who were to be permanently employed, this man alone was excluded ; and therefore his services had to be dispensed with. Tucker did not know why he should not be made a permanent employe, and his ganger, on being appealed to, said he knew of no reason why Tucker's services should be dispensed with. Eventually Tucker appealed to the Commissioner, and then learned that the reason he had not been recommended for permanent employment was that he had been reported as physically unfit. But Tucker had been employed by the Department for two or three : years, and he never, during that time, had been found physically unfit to perform his duties. It must be remembered that permanent employment would carry no more wages, though, of course, it means certain rights and privileges. So confident was Tucker that he was not physically unfit, that he offered to undergo a special medical examination ; but the Department refused to allow that test to be applied. Here we have the sort of case referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> The services of a line repairer, who had been employed for two or three years was dispensed with, although during the last three months or so the Government have been assiduously advertising in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> for a permanent line repairer to fill the position. Under the circumstances, it is idle to say that there was no vacancy for Tucker. If the man is physically unfit, how is it that he was employed b)' the Government for the period I have named <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the Government are sure that the man is physically unfit, why is it that objection was raised to his undergoing a medical examination? </para>

                        <para>- We are told that we must depend on the Commissioner ; but on whom does the Commissioner depend? In the case I have mentioned the Commissioner depends absolutely on the report of the ganger, who may get rid of a man for whom he has a dislike. Instead of these branches of the Public Service being managed by the Commissioner they are managed by the gangers ; and in the place of political influence we have the influence of personal dislike and personal spleen. The ganger shields himself behind a charge of physical disability, which may mean something or may mean nothing. It is a commentary on the ganger that it took him two or three years to find out that Tucker was physically unfit ; and, as a matter of fact, Tucker is in as good health now as ever he was. </para>

                        <para>- We were invited to believe that the Commissioner would be all eyes. The case to which I have referred is typical of dozens of cases that might be quoted. I am constantly receiving similar complaints from men in my own State. Temporary employes are dispensed with, and they find that within the year appointments are made in the Departments from which they have been discharged. After these men are dispensed with they are debarred from obtaining employment in the service for twelve months, and they can only assume that appointments are made of men who are altogether outside the service. </para>

                            (New South Wales). - I rise to make no animadversions upon the Public Service Commissioner or upon any one in the service; but as this matter has been broached, I should like . to say that we have had sufficient experience of the Act to enable us to suggest that the amendment of the section referred to is worthy of Ministerial consideration. I shall cite a case for honorable senators. Some little time ago there were sixteen persons doing temporary work in one of the Departments. The officer in charge of the Department urged the Minister to put the whole of these men on the permanent staff as he considered their services necessary. For some reason or another the Minister put six of the men on the permanent staff, and the other ten have been employed temporarily, from time to time. They have been discharged on the day before every public holiday, and taken on again the day after the holiday in order to save the pittance to which they would be entitled for the holiday under the Act. That discloses a beggarly state of things, and it is a scandalous proceeding for any Minister to consent to. After a great deal of trouble I managed to secure official recognition of the fact that these temporary employes were entitled to be paid for public holidays under the Act; but, as soon as ever I succeeded in getting their legal rights in this respect acknowledged, the practice was adopted of dismissing them before each holiday and taking them on again the day after the holidays, for the sake of the day's pay of about half a sovereign each. Now all these men are to go, and Johnny Raws are to be taken on to do the work which these men have been doing for nine months. I submit that it is not in the public interest that such changes should take place. These men could go to work without oversight, whilst new men will require to be trained, and the business of the country will be thrown into arrears. I am urging that Ministers should take notice of the discussion, and consider whether it is not in the public interest that the section of the Act referred to should be amended in such a way as to provide that appointments made for the performance of duties which are permanent should also be permanent. Ministers are welcome to the particulars of the case I have cited, and I am prepared to supply names.

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has practically said by implication what I wish to say. We passed a Public Service Bill because we thought the political arena was not a good place in which to discuss the conduct of the Civil Service. We desired to remove the service from any political environment, but having done that, honorable senators proceeded at once to try to bring the question of administration back into the political arena from which we industrially sought to set it apart. Personally, I agree entirely with the policy of removing these questions from the political arena. If any attack is to be made, it should be directed to the Public Service Department, and we should not have irregular discussions upon particular instances. Whether names are mentioned or not, is a matter of no consequence : but these references to particular instances, while they interfere with the efficiency and independence of the Public Service Department, insidiously avoid the direct attack which is implied, but is not made. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I desire to elicit some information from the Government on several matters relating to the Post and Telegraph Department. For nearly eighteen months the Public Service Commissioner has been in office, and during this period he has been engaged with the inspectors in drawing up a reclassification scheme. I desire to know whether it is nearly completed. I am aware that some months ago a large amount of information had reached the Commissioner from the inspectors, and I should have thought that by this time the Government would have been placed in possession of the scheme. In Western Australia there are officers in the Post and Telegraph Department who consider that they are entitled to increments of salary, but whenever the question is raised they are told to wait until the classification scheme is completed. More than 11,000 men and women are concerned in this work, and we, as their representatives, are entitled to urge upon the Government that it should be done within a reasonable period. Another question in which the officers of this Department, particularly in Western Australia, are interested is the scheme of allowances which is being drawn up by the inspectors and the Commissioner. I understand that it is the intention of the Government to practically give equal wages and conditions in the capitals of the States, and on that foundation to build a scheme of allowances. In other words, the proposal is to give those officers who live in distant parts of a State or in the tropics an allowance which is based on the minimum in the capital. That is not a fair basis to adopt. The Government in this respect ought not to be in a different position from private employers. In Perth and Melbourne, for instance, private employers do not commence on the same basis. Taking any trade
                </para>
                <para>Or occupation, it will be found that the employes receive a higher wage in Perth than in Melbourne owing to the difference in the cost of living. And yet the Commonwealth is trying to run its Public Service on quite a different line. It is proposed that £110 a year shall be the minimum wage in all the capitals, quite overlooking the fact that the cost of living is 20 per cent, higher in Perth than in Melbourne. I hope that that fact will be considered in devising the scale of allowances. I desire to know on what rule increases of salaries are being given this year ? A statement has been made to me that certain increases in Western Australia were recommended by the Deputy Postmaster-General, and that his recommendations were referred back to him. I desire to elicit from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> either a confirmation or a contradiction of the report. It seems to lue that if the Government have taken this course they are doing either too  much or too little. When we bring other grievances before the attention of the Government, they tell us that they must abide by what the Commissioner has recommended. They apply the rule of Government responsibility to one case, but not to the other. I desire to know whether certain increases have been recommended to a far greater extent than is disclosed by the Estimates? I wish to refer also to the system of promotion in the Post and Telegraph Department. In framing the Public Service Act we attempted to make it possible for a man to start in the general division at the lowest grade, and gradually to work his way to the top grade by displaying sufficient merit. We thought that, under its provisions, a man would be able to pass from the general to the clerical division, and subsequently from the clerical division to the professional division ; but we find that the law is not being administered in that way. If, for instance, a man is classed as a letter carrier, his salary is increased until it reaches £140, and there he seems to stop. Suppose that the position of letter sorter, carrying a. salary of £120 is vacant, and the letter carrier, who is ' receiving a salary of £140, wishes to become a letter sorter, he is called upon to sacrifice £20 a year in order to get into a different grade of the service. It may be argued by the Government that they cannot afford to increase the salary of the office in that case, but I wish to polO t out that no increase of expenditure is involved. When a letter-carrier becomes a letter-sorter, it does not necessarily follow that his successor will get the same salary as he received. I know a case where a letter-carrier who was receiving a salary of £140, desired to obtain a vacant position of letter-sorter. If he had obtained the position he would have had to sacrifice £20 a year, but the Government would not have been called upon to pay any more money to have the amount of work done, because he would have been succeeded by a man at a salary of £70 or £80, or if he had been three years in the service, £110. The letter-carrier would have obtained real promotion, and had his merits recognised, and the Government would have effected a saving. It seems to me that it was the will of the Senate that letter-carriers should have an opportunity of becoming letter-sorters, and finally passing from the general to the clerical division without being called upon to make a pecuniary sacrifice. That object, I submit, could be achieved without entailing the expenditure of an additional £1. The question of transfers from the general to the clerical division is another matter that demands attention. Suppose that an officer in the general division is getting a salary of £140, and that an office in the clerical division becomes vacant. No matter what salary may be attached to the vacant office that officer is required to start as a probationer, so that the provision in the Act relating to transfers is a delusion. Of course it is said that a man should not be appointed over the heads of others ; but the Act contains a provision which enables the Commissioner in certain contingencies to promote over the heads of others any officer who has shown superior merit. Our object in making that provision for transfer from the general to the clerical division was to give an officer in the general division, who had shown ability and merit, an equal chance with an officer in the clerical division, but the Commissioner is not interpreting the Act in that spirit ; and, practically, by his administration, he is shutting off all transfers from the general to the clerical division unless an officer is prepared to make a pecuniary sacrifice and commence again as a probationer. I shall deal with some other questions when we come to the divisions of the Estimates relating to this Department in Western Australia. I hope that in his reply <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will be able to furnish satisfactory information on the points which I have raised. </para>

                    <para>- The officers in the Post and Telegraph Department in Tasmania are not being paid for Sunday work, although a regulation under the Public Service Act says that all Sunday work shall be paid for at overtime rates as from the 1st January last. I understand that all officers in the Post and Telegraph Department of other States are being paid for Sunday work, if not at overtime rates. Some little time ago a representative of Tasmania complained of this act of injustice, and the permanent head in Melbourne said that he did not see why the officers should not be paid for Sunday work, and that the matter would be attended to. The Deputy Postmaster-General for Tasmania has since been approached by some of these officers, but he has informed them that he has never had, and has not now, authority to pay overtime fur Sunday work. This seems an anomalous state of affairs. I do not know if the reason for it is that the Ministry have been asked because of the financial state of Tasmania - of which we have heard too much - to keep down expenses in the Post and Telegraph Department as well as in the Defence Department ; but, if so, it is not fair to save money at the cost of fair play to the officers concerned. I am satisfied that I have only to bring the matter before the Vice-President of the Executive Council to be assured that he will give it his fullest consideration. I hope that he will look into the matter. If he does, he will find that what I say is correct - that the Tasmanian officers of the Post and Telegraph Department, and perhaps those of the Customs Department, too, are not being treated in regard to payment for Sunday work in the same manner as the officers of those Departments employed in the other States have been treated. I am sure that it is not the desire of any member of Parliament that there shall be differential treatment. The Department, being a Federal one, should be administered in a Federal spirit. , </para>

                    <para>- I am informed that the employes in the Post and Telegraph Department in Tasmania are treated in precisely the same manner as other employes of the Department elsewhere. If they are not, they certainly should be so treated, because it is the wish of the Government to deal with all its officers alike. I am informed that the officers of the Department concerned have to work a certain number of hours during the week to entitle them to . overtime on Sunday ; but that the Tasmanian officers are treated in exactly the same way as the officers employed in the other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has complained that an officer of the general division who is transferred to the clerical division has to commence at the lowest rung of the ladder in that division, but I am told that that is not so. Such an officer is required to pass an examination to show that he is qualified for the position to which he aspires, and if he does that, and is appointed to the position, he is given the salary appertaining to it. </para>

                        <para>- I have not inquired as to the effect. The matter is left entirely to the Commissioner ; the Government do not interfere. All we wish is that every man shall be treated fairly, and we believe that the Commissioner is doing his best to provide for fair treatment. The honorable senator also referred to the fact that the Deputy Postmaster-General for Western Australia has recommended the payment of certain increases to the officers in the Post and Telegraph Department of that State, and the Government have been blamed for not granting those increases. The position is this : The officer referred to recommended an all-round increase for his subordinate officers. That is a common trick of men high in the service who want to curry favour with their subordinates, because they know that nothing will make them more popular. I have on many occasions, when Treasurer of South Australia, had to deal with cases of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- I am "not sure. The Commissioner looked into the matter, and decided that certain increases which he considered fair and just, and on the same basis as increases granted to other branches of the service, should be paid, and they have been paid ; but the recommendations of the Deputy Postmaster-General for Western Australia were not accepted. With regard to the statement made about the scheme of allowances in addition to salary, I am informed that these allowances have not been absolutely decided upon yet ; but they will short!}7 come before the Cabinet, and, when they do, due consideration will be given to the claims of officers who are forced to reside in places where living expenses are much higher than they are in the Commonwealth generally. That is the rule adopted in South Australia in regard to public servants who have to reside in the Northern Territory, where the cost of living is higher than it is in Adelaide, and the climate is not the most pleasant in the world. It is only fair and just that such officers should receive higher salaries, and obtain longer leave of absence from duty, than officers elsewhere. I have been asked if the classification of officers is yet complete. I am sorry to say that it is not ; and that we anticipate that it will not be complete until next year. The inspectors have been hard at work in the different States obtaining the necessary information, and, when that work is finished, they will be called together in Melbourne, where a conference will be held between them and the Commissioner, and the scheme finally recommended will be submitted to the Government for consideration and adoption. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know whether a certain case which has been brought under my notice has been accurately stated ; but, as it involves a very grave charge against the Commissioner, I think I should bring it before the Minister, so that the officer concerned may have an opportunity to clear himself. I know that it would not be fair to condemn him upon hearsay evidence, because I dare say many things are done in the service of which he knows nothing, although his understrappers may say that the matter was referred to him, and his reply was so-and-so. The case which I am about to mention may be one of that kind. A letter carrier in Western Australia applied to be examined, so that he might be transferred from the general to the clerical division. He therefore filled in an entry form and forwarded it, with the prescribed fee, to the proper authority. But, instead of being afforded an opportunity to rise in the service - an opportunity for which we thought we were providing when we went through the Public Service Bill in this Chamber - both the application and the fee were returned to him, with the information that he could not be permitted to go up for examination. </para>

                        <para>- No reason was assigned. The man was prepared to submit himself for examination, but an opportunity was refused him. If this statement of the case is accurate, a grave injustice has been done to the officer concerned, though I can scarcely think that any one occupying a position such as that of the Commissioner would be guilty of such injustice towards a subordinate, no matter how humble. I mention the case in order to give him an opportunity to contradict what I have said, if he can do so. Other cases, which are nearly as bad, have been brought under my notice j and I have heard of many instances in which favouritism has been shown - men who should be given promotion being put on one side to allow of the advancement of the favourites of heads of Departments. If attention is not drawn to cases of that kind upon occasions like this, they are passed over, and grave injustice is done. I hope that the Government will inquire into these matters, and that a full explanation will be given of the case to which I have referred, when I hope it will be shown that there is no foundation for a charge of injustice. </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria. I have a list here of twenty-nine or thirty names, of which the first two are those of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Myers</inline> and a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brownrigg.</inline> I will not weary the Committee by reading all the names. They are men who have had a long term of service in the Department, and it was not the intention of Parliament that nien who were engaged upon practically permanent work should be discharged under the operation of the Public Service Act. These men should be classed as permanent employes if their' work is of a permanent character. I wish to point out to the Government, and to the Public Service Commissioner, that the Act should be interpreted and administered in accordance with the rules of common-sense. When I stated that a number of poor unfortunate employes, who have very little influence in the Commonwealth, were engaged in the post-offices of some of the capital cities at a weekly wage of 15s., the Attorney-General asked where they were to be found. I said they were in either New South Wales or Western Australia. I can now tell the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the position of affairs in New South Wales is bad enough, but that the State in which these women are engaged at the small wage of 1 5s. per week is Western Australia. That is the State in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> represents the cost of living to be so high, and which produces £8^000,000 worth of gold per annum. These unfortunate women, many of whom have families to maintain, are receiving only <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> per month. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council has any desire to investigate this matter any further, he might refer to the question asked by me on the 2nd September, 1903. Of course I had no idea when I mentioned this matter that I should be called upon to supply the names of the individuals affected, and the exact amounts received by them, because my statement had reference to the question which I had already asked. I should like the Minister to explain why instrument fitters, possessing special skill and knowledge, are being dispensed with, whilst other men, without their special skill or lengthened experience in the service, are being taken on in their places ; and also why the unfortunate cleaners in the post-offices are not treated in the same manner as other servants in the Department. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps this will be an opportune time to again refer to a question which I have raised on more than one occasion in this Chamber, namely, the overtime paid to letter-carriers and officers employed in the mail branch of the postal service in Queensland. For many years it has been the practice in Brisbane to make certain payments in the form of overtime allowances. For the last thirty years it has also been the practice to make special allowances to letter-carriers and others engaged in the mail branch for services rendered in connexion with the sorting of the English and American mails. Furthermore, fees have been paid according to a fixed scale for Sunday work. These fees were paid up to the 30th June last. Just prior to that date, an intimation was made that new regulations would be framed to provide for similar payments, but under a new system. When the question of entering the Commonwealth was being discussed in Queensland, special attention was directed to the fact that the Constitution contained a provision that officers transferred from the State to the Commonwealth service would have preserved to them their existing and accruing rights and privileges. A serious inroad has, however, now been made upon these rights. The salary and allowances of the officers referred to, when taken together, do not amount to very much ; in fact, I consider that the remuneration is insufficient. Yet under the new regulations, which have been in operation since 30th June, a considerable reduction has been made. The men strongly object to the change, and intend to hold fast to all those rights and privileges which they believe to be safeguarded by the Constitution. It is perfectly clear that those who framed the regulations now in force either were woefully ignorant of the conditions prevailing in Queensland, or wilfully omitted to embody in them the provisions necessary to preserve to the Post-office employes concerned the rights and privileges to which they were entitled as transferred officers. I was at first inclined to believe that owing to the illness of the Public Service Inspector for Queensland, the regulations had been framed by some one without knowledge of the conditions existing in that State, but I ascertained from the Public Service Commissioner that that was not the case. I do not wish to say anything harsh regarding the Inspector, because, unfortunately, he is still on the sick list ; but if the new regulations afford any indication of that gentleman's capacity, I am afraid that there is much room for improvement, if not for the appointment of an officer more competent to discharge the duties attached to his position. A resolution has already been passed in this Chamber condemning the system of paying for Sunday labour as if Sunday were an ordinary working day, and there were 365 working days in the year. Under this system, those who have Sunday work to perform, receive far less for it than for their services on an ordinary working day. I am sure that that is not in accord with public sentiment. I cannot say whether the continuance of this system is due to any fault of the Commissioner. If the fault lies with the Treasurer or the Ministry, the sooner matters are rectified, the better. Sunday labour should be paid for at a higher rate, and not at a lower rate than that applied to work performed upon ordinary days. The employes in the Queensland Post-office, to whom I have referred, have not drawn the allowances to which they are entitled under the new regulation, lest they might compromise themselves. They do not intend to permit their rights and privileges to be taken away from them without contesting every inch of the ground. </para>

                        <para>- Up to the time I left Brisbane on Saturday no intimation to that effect had been conveyed to the men, and the other matters to which I have referred were still unsettled. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has mentioned that the Public Service Commissioner and the inspectors are hard at work classifying the officers and framing regulations which will meet the requirements of the conditions which prevail in the different States. I desire to direct attention to the regulations intended to apply to officers who are stationed in outlying districts. It is provided that officers in remote parts of the Commonwealth shall receive a special allowance equivalent to 5 per cent. of their salary. For instance, an officer in receipt of a salary of £100 per annum would if transferred to some remote part, be entitled to £105 per annum. An increase of salary to even £150 per annum would not afford such an officer more than sufficient compensation if he were sent to some parts of north-western Queensland, because the conditions of life bear no comparison, so far as health, comfort, or the cost of living are concerned, with those which prevail in the more settled parts of the Continent. I am sorry that the Public Service Commissioner did not adopt the course which I suggested some time ago, of enlisting the assistance of officers from the different States, who would bring practical knowledge and experience to bear upon the framing of the regulations. He would have found such assistance of extreme value, because it would have enabled him to avoid many difficulties. I mention these facts in order that the Vice-President of the Executive Council may have an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Postmaster-General with whom I have already freely debated it. I have no doubt whatever that if the Department adopt some method of the kind I have suggested, it will prove beneficial to all concerned. For the Public Service Commissioner a.nd his staff to devise any uniform system which will operate satisfactorily or justly all round is absolutely impossible. </para>

There is one question, however, to which I desire to direct the special attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. It is the attempt which is being made to create what is termed " uniformity " in the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. The idea seems to have got abroad that a uniform system should be adopted throughout Australia. Now, although uniformity may be very good in its way, it is an extremely dangerous thing if we make ourselves slaves to it. For instance, according to that doctrine, a man coming to Melbourne from Northern Queensland would still clothe himself in the way that he did up there, and mee <inline font-style="italic">versa,</inline> lt must be apparent to everybody that, whilst the administration should revolve round one central idea, latitude and longitude, climate and other conditions, ought to be taken into consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Probably they are, but not to a sufficient extent. Some little time ago I had an interview with the Public Service Commissioner, and the whole burden of his contention was that the Government desired him to bring about a uniform system of administration in the Post and Telegraph Department. Uniformity was the keynote of his remarks. I pointed out that the conditions which obtained in Sydney were different from those which prevailed in Melbourne or Brisbane, and that in Tasmania still other conditions were operative. How, in the name of common-sense, is it .possible to effect uniformity without inflicting serious injustice upon the employes of the Department, or without hampering the Department itself in carrying on its business ? I do not think that we ought to become the slaves of any idea of that kind in the administration of this great Department. We ought to conduct it upon common-sense lines. I am very sorry to note that, in the administration of most of our public Departments, the ordinary garden variety of common-sense is conspicuous by its absence. What private individuals are able to do without any difficulty appears to be impossible in these Departments. This is a condition of affairs which is not creditable to us, and we ought to attempt, in some way or other, to effect an alteration. I trust that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will impress upon the Commissioner the absolute necessity of dealing not only with each State but with each portion of the Commonwealth, according to the climatic conditions which prevail there, and that he will throw entirely to the winds the idea of grinding the service down to one uniform likeness. Other honorable senators have spoken on the subject of Sunday labour ; but, in my opinion, it is a matter which cannot be mentioned too often. It was thoroughly thrashed out in this Chamber, and we arrived at the conclusion that Sunday labour should be paid for at the rate of time and a half. Nevertheless I have not heard that the Public Service Commissioner has done anything in the direction of giving effect to the wishes of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I am not discussing what is polite or impolite, but what is just and unjust. Is it fair to ask the employes of the Commonwealth to work at a lower rate on Sunday than that which they receive upon other days of the week ? A private employer would not dream of making such a proposal. Most private employers pay their workmen either double rates or time and a half for Sunday labour. Everybody pays more for Sunday work except the Commonwealth. I do not know who is to blame for this state of affairs - whether it is the Public Service Commissioner or the officials of the Post Office, or the Postmaster-General, or the Government, but surely somebody must be blameable. I know, however, that Parliament is responsible. One House of the legislature has already expressed its opinions upon this matter, and I hold that some effect should be given to its views. I wish also to say a word or two upon the question of " mail " money to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has referred. For thirty years certain officers engaged in the Post and Telegraph Department at Brisbane have been in receipt of a specific allowance for what is known as " mail " money. That allowance was discontinued on 30th June last, and as a result, a large number of men find their incomes reduced to the extent of £18 or £20 a year. That is a very serious item to men who receive comparatively small salaries - salaries which range from £120 to £150 a year. Repeated representations have been made to the Department and the Public Service Commissioner upon the matter, but up to date, no relief has been afforded. Instead of being paid a lump sum for Sunday work - as was previously the case - these men are now paid actually less than they received for labour performed upon other days of the week. I do not know whether this " mail " money can be regarded as one of their rights and privileges. </para>

                        <para>- Long custom has induced these employes to regard this money as a part of their regular income, but whether they are entitled to it under the Constitution is a matter which must be decided by the Courts or by some higher authority than I profess to be. I have also received a complaint from the western portion of Queensland in connexion with this question of Sunday work. Out there it appears that some officers act both as telegraph operators and post-office assistants. A telegraph operator works only six hours upon a Sunday, whereas a post-office assistant is required to work seven and a half hours upon that day. </para>

                        <para>- If a complaint has been made, it has not been attended with success. In such circumstances to where should Commonwealth employes go for redress of their grievances but to Parliament? All that these officers claim is that where they act as operators and post-office assistants, the}' ought to be placed upon a level with operators, and that their Sunday's labour should consist of six hours only. I should like the Vice-President of the Executive Council to tell me how many officers there are in the service over sixty years of age. I am informed that in this Department promotion is blocked, and unnecessary expense incurred by the retention of a very considerable number of men who are over sixty years of age, and who are really not as capable as they were formerly. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that the honorable senator could ; but he is much more active than are a great number of men who have reached his age. He should also remember that we have some better work for him to do than carry letters. Some honorable senators have referred to the scanty encouragement which is given to men to endeavour to rise in the service. I presume that most honorable senators have heard of Napoleon's famous saying that he created his generals out of mud - in other words, that he promoted them from the ranks; but it appears to be almost impossible for a young man entering the Post and Telegraph Department, more especially if he enters by the gate of the general division, to ever rise to anything superior to the position of a letter-carrier or a sorter. The intention of honorable senators when the Public Service Bill was before us was that every facility should be given to the humblest letter-carrier or sorter to rise, if he had the ability, to the highest position in the service. My information is that instead of encouragement being given to those men in the general division who are ambitious to rise, every impediment is thrown in their way ; every obstacle that can be raised against them is raised. Why should that be the case? The Government say that they are not responsible. These evils have their rise mostly, I believe, within the service. There is a feeling of jealousy between the members of the clerical division and the general division, and probably between the professional division and all the other divisions. What the people want is efficiency, and I think it must be apparent to every one that a young lad who enters the Department as a messenger, who becomes in time a letter- - carrier or a sorter, and rises step by step in the service, is likely to be a much more efficient post-office employe than is a man who hai been confined during the whole of his career merely to one branch of it. The Government ought to make a representation not only to the Public Service Commissioner, but to the heads of Departments, that every inducement should be given to young men to endeavour to rise in the service. There is one other matter to which I desire to refer, and that is the fact that employes in the Post and Telegraph Department are not permitted to take an active part in politics. My opinion is that that is very wrong, and the framing of a regulation of this character is discreditable, to say the least of it, not only to the Government and to the parties who framed it, but to the Parliament which permits it to go unchallenged.. Why should we seek to deprive an employe of the Commonwealth of any portion of his political rights ? </para>

                        <para>- I believe that another question on which we may probably require the opinion of the High Court is whether it is in the power of the Parliament, or of the Public Service Commissioner, or any other person to take even the least particle of his political power from any citizen of the Commonwealth. What is the good of giving men votes with one hand and taking their political power away from them with the other ? 1 am familiar, of course, with the arguments which are raised in support of regulations of this kind ; but they are altogether unworthy of a free people. What should we think of any private company which deprived its shareholders, if they happened to be employed by it, of the right to have a voice at a meeting of its shareholder ? Such a thing could not be done according to law. If a man is a shareholder in a company and attends a meeting of shareholders in that company, he has rights equal to those of every other shareholder, whether he is an employe of it or not. When he is engaged in the work of the company he is under the orders of his superior officer ; he is acting then not as a shareholder but as an employe. When he attends a meeting of shareholders, however, he does so not in his capacity as an employe, but as a shareholder, and I contend that he is entitled to have a voice and vote in the management of the affairs of that company, just as much as is a shareholder who is not an employe. If that is the position with regard to a private company, should it not apply also to the Commonwealth ? Are not public servants citizens of the Commonwealth as well as employes of it ? Have they not the same interest in the welfare of the Commonwealth as have men who are not in the employ of the State <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Why, then, should they, under a regulation such as that to which I have referred, be deprived of any portion of their rights as citizens which have been conferred upon them by the Constitution? I hope that the Government, at an early date, will take this matter into their very serious consideration, and will see that a reactionary regulation such as this is swept away. I have very little hope of much improvement being effected for some considerable time. We are told that the work of classifying the service will extend over another year, and after it has been completed there will still be endless trouble and confusion. I was one of those who strongly supported the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner. I am not very sure that I was right in doing so ; but as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has said, we must not condemn the principle until it has had a fair trial. While I have cast some strictures upon the Commissioner, I must confess that his task has been an exceedingly difficult one. He has had to fuse, so to speak, six different systems. He has had to bring about, in his own words, a certain uniformity, and his task has undoubtedly been one of extreme difficulty. For that reason we must not condemn the system too hastily. I trust that before all is over it will be found to be an advantageous one - beneficial, not only to the Commonwealth as a whole, but to those who serve the Commonwealth. I am hopeful also that as time goes on, and as the Commissioner gains more and more experience, he will be able to deal in a more liberal and truly national spirit with the various Departments than he appears yet to have done. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat has told us that he strongly supported the provision for the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner. All that I have to say in reply is that I think I did wrong when I voted against it. It appears to me that the Commissioner is an exceedingly useful buffer between the Government and Parliament. He saves the Government from a good deal of hostile criticism, and certainly from a considerable amount of hostile criticism on the part of the honorable senator. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> opened his speech by dressing down the Commissioner in a very severe manner, but concluded with a few remarks to the effect that after all the Commissioner had had an exceedingly difficult task to perform, and perhaps had not done badly after all. The honorable senator has given us a re-hash of the speech made by him on the Public Service Regulations. One of the matters to which he has referred is the question of uniformity in relation to the rates of pay in the service. I do not believe in that uniformity. If he had listened to what I had to say shortly before the adjournment for dinner, he would have found that neither I nor my colleagues believe in it. We believe that the cost of living and various other circumstances which increase the expenditure of civil servants in certain parts of the Commonwealth should be taken into consideration, and that their salaries should be raised to meet additional expenses which public servants in more favoured positions do not have to incur. It seems to me that it would be a very cruel thing to turn men out of the service simply because they have reached the age of sixty years. We have at the head of the Post and Telegraph Department in South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd, who is seventy seven years of age, and yet to-day is as able as ever I knew him to be. He is better able to manage the affairs of the Department there than is any man of whom I know, and in view of the fact that he is in full possession of all his faculties, that he has been brought up in the Department, and is a skilled and intelligent gentleman, it would be a most unwarrantable procedure to retire him from the service simply because he is over sixty years of age. To turn out of the service a letter sorter, or any other officer, who had reached the age of sixty years, but who was still able to perform the duties of his office, would be simply shameful. Many of these men, because of family affliction and other causes, have not been able to save much money. In more than one State they are not entitled to pensions, and it would be cruel to turn them out on the world simply to make room for younger men, who would not be more efficient, and certainly not as discreet as they are. The honorable senator has also repeated remarks previously made by him as to the political rights of public servants. The Honorable senator has drawn a parallel between the position of a shareholder of a company, who happens to be an employe of that company, and that of an officer in the Commonwealth service. All that we say is practically that a public servant shall not take an active part in politics ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> holds that because an employe of a company, who happened to hold shares in it, would be allowed to take an active part in its meetings, a civil servant ought also to be allowed to take an active part in political warfare. Would the honorable senator say that an employe of a company who was also a shareholder in it should have a right to take a prominent part in a meeting of its shareholders; and possibly to abuse his own directors ? </para>

                        <para>- If he did, he would soon get the sack. I should certainly sack him if I were a director of the company, and he failed to behave himself. What should we say if the head of any Department stood on a public platform and abused the Ministry ? We may go down to the lowest man in the service, and it will be seen that it is inadvisable that public servants should take part in political matters. Especially is this the case with regard to the employes of the Post-office, who have means of influencing the electors in country districts to a considerable extent. We do not deprive public servants of their votes, and we do not intend to do so. They have every right and privilege which is enjoyed by ordinary citizens. We do not propose to treat them as the railway servants of Victoria are treated, and to put them in a special class. If we did that we might have to allow them to talk politics to their hearts' content, although it would still be a most undesirable thing that they should stand up and oppose the Government of the day' One or two questions have been put to me, and I will reply to them before sitting down. With regard to Sunday labour we have made an alteration so as to make the payment equivalent to what is paid for ordinary overtime. That is to say, instead of reckoning 365 days for the year, we reckon the usual number of working days, excluding Sundays. Therefore, that grievance is remedied. With regard to payment for overtime, all the officers in the Post-office have been paid up to the end of June under the old scale. A new regulation has been introduced which reduces the amount of payment for overtime. In Queensland the officers say they will not accept it, and the whole question is being considered by the Commissioner with a "view to meet the case as fairly as he can. With respect to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has said regarding the instrument fitters, and what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie has said as to the refusal to give permission to certain officers to be examined for the higher grades, I promise the honorable senators that I will have their speeches cut out of <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> and forwarded to the Public Service Commissioner for his explanation, and when I receive it I will show it to them. The matter will thus be gone into fairly. I can say no more, because I do not know anything about the cases. Possibly, however, we shall find, when the matter is investigated, that there is some reason for the action which has been taken. </para>

                        <para>- I am ~verv sorry that at this early period of the career of the new -Government they have done something which I think is very much in the nature of a trick or a subterfuge. I am very anxious to give the new Government a fair trial. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> have a very great respect for the Prime Minister. He is an ornament to the Legislature. I quite believe that he has had to take over something in the nature of a legacy of wrong doing. But the Prime Minister and his Government should meet the case boldly, and refuse to carry on any negotiations or to incur any expenditure which meets with strong objection in the Senate and in the other Chamber. Every one knows that the present Parliament is about to close its work, and that many members of it are about to go before their constituents. Bills are brought forward dealing with the expenditure of millions of money, and one can well imagine that it would be possible to pass through the Senate proposals for the expenditure of several thousands of pounds with very little opposition, because honorable senators are in such a hurry to get away that they may not notice the items in the schedule. What can we think of a Government, which, having consented to a Conference with the protesting partners in the Pacific Cable, proposes in this Bill expenditure to the extent of over £22,000, which, if agreed to, will render absolutely nugatory any proceedings which may take place at the Conference? If honorable senators will look at page 9 of the Bill they will see that the expenditure to which I object is as follows : - For New South "Wales, " Telegraphic line from Sydney to South Australian border, owing to the use of line having been granted to the Eastern Extension Company in connexion with international traffic, £11,100 ;" Victoria, " Telegraph line from Melbourne to South Australian border, owing to the use of a line having been granted to the Eastern Extension Company in connexion with international traffic, £5,043 ;" South Australia, " Additional wires from Adelaide to New South Wales and Victorian borders, owing to the use of lines having been granted t» the Eastern Extension Company in connexion with international traffic, £6,000." These sums make up a total of £22,143. What use will it be for the protesting partners to the Pacific Cable to make any protest at the proposed Conference if we sanction the expenditure of £22,143 for the construction of wires to carry out the proposed agreement with the Eastern Extension Company? </para>

                            <para>- What is this that we hear from the honorable and learned senator ? Are we to understand that the Pacific Cable Board does not regard this as a concession to the Eastern Extension Company ? Have not the partners -Canada, New Zealand and Great Britain - been protesting all along against the proposed agreement because it extends the concession granted to the Eastern Extension Company in New South Wales, to Queensland, and Victoria? The late Prime Minister and also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Drake know  the Eastern Extension Company well enough, as I shall show the Senate at a later stage ; and both know that no one has up to the present been able to "gain a point " over that corporation. So astute and clever, and so  insinuating and insidious,  are the company in their methods that they are able to gain an advantage over any Government with whom they do business. Their history shows that their social and other influences are so great that they have been able to manipulate in their own interests the Governments of half-a-dozen nationalities. To allow this company to enter Victoria and Queensland would be to disadvantage the whole of the Commonwealth, and the partners in the Pacific Cable. Once this Parliament passes a Bill authorizing the expenditure of £22,143 in order to give this company special wires to Adelaide, so  that they  may send messages along their wires by the Cape or by Port Darwin, from  that moment we give the company  a legal status, and any effort to expel them from their position at a later stage may mean heavy damages awarded against the Commonwealth by the High Court. By passing this Bill we should give the company a footing, and they would be able to plead that they had been led into a considerable, expenditure of money, because the Commonwealth had to all intents and purposes ratified the agreement entered into with them by the Prime Minister. It appears to be a very wrong proceeding - to call it by no harsher term - on the part of the Government, to sneak in a provision of this kind in order that the Eastern Extension Company may claim that the agreement has been ratified. </para>

The proposed agreement was brought before Parliament in such a way that the members of the House of Representatives had not the time, or did not care to take the trouble, to study the details, and the measure was pushed through. It is claimed that there is a majority in Parliament in favour of the Eastern Extension Company's agreement. </para>

                    <para>I messages received and despatched depend entirely I upon the officers of the Eastern Extension Tele- I graph Compaq1 - a gigantic corporation making i hundreds of thousands per annum, and storing up millions in a reserve fund. This enormously wealthy company has received considerably over £3,000,000 from the different Governments of Australasia in the way of subsidies, and has conducted itself generally in the most approved monopolistic fashion by grabbing all it could get, demanding the highest rates procurable and paying the largest dividends possible. The interest on its capital has been guaranteed by some of our governments, and it has run practically no risk, while it has built up a monopoly which has become a crushing load upon the community, and threatens to dominate the governments of some of the southern colonies. The extortionate cable rates charged by this octopus combination have crippled free telegraphic intercourse between Australia and Europe, and been the primary cause of the meagreness of the daily newspaper information received from London. No country in the world of our commercial and political importance is so badly served with news as Australia, and the trouble is wholly due to the fact that all our cables must pass along the lines of a private company, which charges and does what it likes - and reaps a golden harvest in the process. </para>
                    <para>The selfishness and extortion of this mammoth monopoly at last became so apparent and intolerable that the statesmen of the continent were forced to look round for some means of escape from its clutches, and when the Pacific Cable project was mooted they welcomed the scheme as a possible liberation from the monopoly's growing power and influence. At last, after many conferences and much deliberation, it was decided that an All British cable should be laid, the cost to be borne in fair proportions by Great Britain, Canada, and Australasia. The main object of the proposed scheme was to have a cable touching only British territory, and owned solely by the State. The existing privately-owned cable is inadequate for present-day requirements, and, provision having to be made for the future, it was deemed advisable to seize the opportunity of breaking a monopoly which was yearly becoming troublesome, and would eventually become quite intolerable. But the proposed innovation no sooner began to take practical shape than the Eastern Extension Compaq- brought pressure to bear upon the Imperial authorities, on the ground that the new cable was not at present necessary and that when the requirements of trade demanded it, they were prepared to lay another to the Cape. But by this time Canada and Australia had entered into the idea of a State-owned All-British cable with enthusiasm, and had obtained the report of an independent Commission in favour of its practicability, economy, and necessity. And the British Government, wisely putting the appeals of the colonies before the interested claims of a private syndicate, consented to bear a share of the cost. Finding that no help in bolstering their gold-producing monopoly could he obtained from the Home Government, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company set to work to undermine the opposing project by offering to reduce the rates and construct another cable. The proposal, as given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> E. Squier,  acting manager for the company in Australia, was: "The company will entirely waive the renewal of subsidy and guarantee  against  competition, and in addition to providing a cable from the Cape all the way to Glenelg <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Perth will at once reduce Tariff to 4s. for the whole of Australasia and make further reductions on a sliding scale as traffic increases until the reduction reaches 2s. 6d. per word in 1903. In return for the above the Company would only require the same .privilege in Perth, Adelaide, and Melbourne as the}' have hitherto enjoyed in Great Britain of directly distributing their international telegrams to and from the public." The proposal of the company looks harmless, but when it is inquired into it is found to deal a death blow to the Pacific scheme. If the monopoly is permitted to collect and deliver messages throughout Australia it will doubtless force the large cabling firms to enter into long contracts, and when the State cable comes along it will find the best part of the profitable business absorbed by the syndicate. In this connexion we must remember that we are dealing with an immensely powerful and wealthy combination, which has millions to spare in fighting the opposition. If the company can secure specially favorable conditions now it will go on its way rejoicing, and the fortunate shareholders will continue to grow .fat on the dividends provided by deluded Australians. It is clearly our duty to resist all concessions to the company and push ahead with the Pacific scheme, which would have its Australian terminal station in Queensland, which would grow into a valuable national asset and a rich source of revenue. </para>
                    <para>The question that now confronts the people of Australasia is whether the}' are going to remain at the mercy of this private company or construct and maintain an All-British cable to be owned and controlled by the people themselves. Apart from the fact that the Pacific line would only touch on British territory, and thus remove the risk of our being cut off from all European intercourse in time of war, the proposed line would be a strong binding link between Great Britain, Canada, and Australasia, inasmuch as it would form a valuable part of our joint national property and be wholly under the control of the people who could regulate the transmission rates and all other matters connected with the new department. The only argument that we have heard against the proposal - the argument of the company's special pleaders - is that it would ruin the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company - a private monopoly which is only now, after years of extortion, beginning to suggest reasonable rates and give a thought to public petitions. We submit that a new cable is necessary in the interest of Australasia, in order that we may be adequately supplied with old world news, in order that communication between this continent and Europe may not depend upon the caprice or business exigencies of a private company, in order that reasonable rates of transmission may be assured, and in order that the power of an unscrupulous and grasping monopoly may be broken. In this matter the interests of the people are paramount. In Great Britain and Australia postal and telegraphic affairs are controlled by the Governments, and private enterprise is not permitted to interfere with the State monopolies, and it is anomalous to permit all telegraphic intercourse between the Southern hemisphere and the heart of the world to be monopolized by a private, profit-mongering concern, the alpha and omega of whose existence is dividends, no matter who pa3's them. We contend that no offer of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company can possibly be so satisfactory to the public as the results sure to follow the inauguration of the Pacific Cable under State control. The chairman of directors of the monopoly told his shareholders, at the last meeting in London, that if the Pacific Cable were laid it would mean a loss of £250,000 per annum to his company. Presumably, he was then reckoning on still retaining a. share of the Australian trade, so it is clear that this country has been a fine healthy milch cow to a number of fortunate European speculators. Is it not time the people took this profitable source of revenue into their own hands ? </para>

                    <para class="block">It is a good one, and the honorable and learned senator need not be ashamed of it ; nor need the writer. The article is written by a man who knows the ways of the Eastern Extension Company, and who understands the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> knows the insidious influence of the company, and that if it is allowed to get a footing the Pacific Cable will be a failure. He knows that if we permit the expenditure of this money, which is to give the Eastern Extension Company special facilities for sending cablegrams by their line, the loss on the Pacific Cable will continue for another period of at least ten or twelve years. It is the duty of every one who talks about the Pacific Cable being a binding link between us and the sister Federation of Canada, to do all he can to keep the Eastern Extension Company out of Victoria and Queensland. That can be done under section 80 of the Post and Telegraph Act, which provides that the Postmaster- General shall have the exclusive privilege of collecting telegrams, and performing all the incidental services connected therewith. If the Department is careful to guard its privileges, no person other than the Postmaster-General can collect, receive, or deliver telegrams in Victoria or Queensland. We have a right to keep the Eastern Extension Company out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> denies having written the article which I have read, but he will not deny the speech which he made in the Senate when the Post and Telegraph Bill was under consideration. The honorable senator will not deny that he said then that the Pacific Cable, owned and controlled by the State, could not possibly compete with an outside private company. He will not deny having said that State ownership is a handicap, because the State must do its business in an open way. He will not deny that he said the opposing company would give rebates to cable users, and he will not deny that the Eastern Extension Company, if permitted to come into Victoria and Queensland, will make secret agreements with cable users to the detriment of the Pacific Cable, and the loss of all the partners connected with it. What are the figures published in connexion with this <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> From statements received from the British Treasury by the Postmaster-General, and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> newspaper of 1st July, it appears that, in connexion with the Pacific Cable for the year ending 31st March, 1903, the disbursements are set out thus - </para>

                    <para>The cable was only opened for traffic in December last. Consequently three months' revenue was all that could be set off against this heavy annual charge. No exact statement of the receipts for this period has been supplied by the British Treasury, but in one despatch it was estimated that the revenue would average about £1,150 per week for one class of business, and £13,600 per annum for another class. These calculations indicate that the receipts for the quarter mentioned probably aggregated £18,910, so that the accounts for last financial year possibly read - </para>

                    <para>The total loss for the two years will therefore not fall far short of £193,790, of which Victoria's share will be £21,394. The interest charge, £77,500, will remain stationary for 50 years, but at the expiration of that period the money borrowed to construct the cable will have been repaid, and this annual charge will thereupon cease. </para>

Was it fair treatment to Canada to allow the Eastern Extension Company to find their way into Victoria? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> will tell us this evening or to-morrow that it will probably turn out to be a very good thing to allow the Eastern Extension Company these privileges, as we shall be able to get rid of them in twelve years time. When he was advocating that privileges should be given to the Eastern Extension Company he said that we could terminate the contract in twelve years if we pleased, or we could make another contract with the company.

                            <para>- The honorable and learned senator has changed his mind. I am sure that any one who will take the trouble to go into this matter must confess that it is our duty to ourselves, as well as to our partners in the Pacific Cable, not to permit this expenditure on behalf of the Eastern Extension Company. This company is a most gigantic monopoly. Honorable senators will get some idea of the extent of the monopoly when they read a little book which is issued by the Eastern Extension Company, and which gives a list of the various companies which, with the Eastern Extension Company, are amalgamated in a company called " The Globe Telegraph and Trust Company." One of the most prominent individuals connected with the Eastern Extension Company, a son of the first <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Pender, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Denison Pender, is a director of the Eastern Telegraph Company Limited, the Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company Limited, the Western Telegraph Company Limited, the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company Limited, the West African Telegraph Company Limited, the West Coast of America Telegraph Company Limited, the Europe and Azores Telegraph Company Limited, the Direct Spanish Telegraph Company Limited, the Black Sea Telegraph Company Limited, and the Globe Telegraph and Trust Company Limited. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator puts it nicely ; they have spun a web round the world. The reason this company is fighting so hard in Australia to-day is because they see that their gigantic monopoly is threatened. They see that if this Pacific Cable, which is a State-owned scheme, is a success, other nations will be following the example of Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom. They see that that is inevitable. It took nearly two months' hard fighting on the part of the friends of the Pacific Cable iu the Senate to secure a Conference for the protesting partners. I believe that the Government would have done almost anything to thwart our efforts in that regard, and it is fortunate that they did not succeed. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have a fighting fund of £800,000 or more to look after their special interests in all parts of the world. It will pay them to expend that sum in reducing the rates to- cable users in Australia, so as to attract I most of the business which is going to the | Pacific Cable. That result is inevitable, i The late Government, through the Attorney-General, led us to believe that the agreement which they were entering into was one to prevent the cutting of rates, j The paragraphs to that effect in the Melbourne press were not denied. They were lulling us into a sense of false security. There is nothing in the proposed agreement to prevent the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company from reducing their rates. On the contrary, every privilege is given to them when there is any competition from the Pacific, or any other cable, to reduce their rates to whatever sum they like, and it will pay them to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> knows that if the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company were to reduce their word from 3s. to 2s. 6d., and the Pacific Cable Board were to charge 3s., the whole of the business would go to the former. Because business people would not be so foolish as to pay 3s. a word when they could pay 2s. 6d. If the Pacific Cable Board found that they could reduce their rate to 2s. 6d. per word, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company would come down to 2s. a word ; and if the Pacific Cable Board reduced their charge to 2s. a word, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company would come down to ls. 6d., thence to ls. per word - in fact, to any sum, I believe, to make the Pacific Cable such a huge burden on the general taxpayer in the Commonwealth, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, that the State proprietors and the taxpayers would say, "The Government stroke is not a business stroke. The Government cannot run this concern successfully. Let us sell the cable to the Eastern Extension Company as old wire." The representatives of the Government in the Senate are not so unintelligent that they cannot see through this thing. They see through it well enough, but for some reason - I cannot give the reason, and I am sure that they cannot give a satisfactory reason to the public - they are prepared to allow the company to come in here and do this thing. </para>

                    <para class="block">I together with Canada, New Zealand, and | the United Kingdom, to an expenditure of, i at the very least, £77,500, for a period of fifty years - that is, to pay interest and to provide a sinking fund - in connexion with the establishment of the Pacific Cable. If j the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company are allowed to come in here in this way, undoubtedly they will make the Pacific Cable a financial failure ; no other result can follow, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> knows. I explained to him the other day how a telegram company in this "city were giving rebates to their customers, and registering indicators free of charge, and I expressed the opinion that they are under an agreement to influence business over the lines of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, and that the inevitable result will be that, once the latter company get a legal footing in Victoria and Queensland, down will come their rates, and the loss on the Pacific Cable will be greater. It may appeal to some honorable senators who use the cable to a great extent that that company will reduce their rate from 3s. to 2s. 6d., from 2s. 6d. to ls. 6d., and from ls. 6d. to ls.; but they should remember that the States which have entered into this partnership have already saved Australian cable users £750,000 ; that if there is to be a big loss on the Pacific Cable, those of us who desire to protect the general taxpayer against this burden will try to get a stamp duty imposed on all cables sent through the Post Office, and that, for the sake of securing a merely temporary gain - cheap cables at the expense of the Pacific Cable Board - they might have to pay a greater sum later on. As soon as the Pacific Cable Board had been made a mockery, and their lines taken up or parted with to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, the rate would be put back, if not to 9s. 4d. a word, to at least one-half of that sum, and a monopoly re-established. Twenty members of the Senate signed a document to the effect that they would not ratify any agreement until the desired Conference had been held. Other honorable senators declined to sign the requisition, but they said that they were in favour of a Conference being held. Dismissing for the present all the arguments against allowing the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company any footing in Victoria and Queensland, and appealing to honorable senators on the single ground of the rights of the protesting partners, I hope that they will reject this proposed expenditure. I do not ask them to reject the Bill, because it provides for the construction of justifiable works, but to omit the items to which I have called attention. We have a perfect right to make that amendment, because it is in the direction of reducing a burden or charge on the people. I submit that in order to carry out the spirit of the promise made by the Government we must reject the items. It would be of no use to pass the items and then to hold a Conference ; "it would be tying the hands of the other partners. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I hope that the honorable senator has been convinced by my remarks that the proposal of the Government to expend £22,153 on special lines for the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, if enacted in this Bill, would be used as an argument by their friends, as has been done already, that the negotiations had gone too far for the Commonwealth to recede from the agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> made the suggestion in his telegram the other day, but the members of the Senate know that it is not the case. We know, and the Government know on the best authority - the signatures of honorable senators - that twenty senators desire a Conference to be held before the agreement is ratified. If we pass these items, undoubtedly we shall assist the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company to get a hold, which they would not otherwise have. But if we refuse to vote this money the protesting partners will get fair play, the agreement will be discussed on its merits, the absence of certain necessary clauses will be pointed out, and satisfaction will be given. There is no doubt in my mind that a Conference, if held, would have a beneficial result. I am very hopeful that after a Conference has been held the Government will not ask us to vote an expenditure of this kind. But the point before the Senate at the present time is that we have no right to spend £22,153 in the interests of that company, in giving them special privileges to carry out the proposed agreement, until a Conference has been held. </para>

                            <para>- Yes-; we shall require them in any case. The amounts set down for the construction of lines from Sydney to the South Australian border, and from Adelaide to the New South Wales and Victorian borders is required for expenditure in accordance with the agreements entered into, prior to Federation, between the Governments of New South Wales and South Australia and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company - agreements which have been superseded by the Commonwealth agreement now awaiting ratification. Furthermore, a point which has been overlooked is that the wire is required to carry the existing business. The number of telegrams sent is constantly increasing, and we, therefore, require additional wires. These telegrams will be sent over the wires whether the lines are used by the officials of the Department or by the staff of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. The honorable senator spoke as though we were asking for money to erect lines especially for the benefit of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. </para>

                            <para>- An agreement has been made with the company, under which a wire must be reserved to them, and if we reserve a wire to them we must erect another for ourselves. We should require this additional wire if the business now transmitted by the staff of the Eastern Extension Company were sent by our own officials. We have not reserved for the company a wire for the transmission of business which would not, under ordinary circumstances, be sent. The company have asked for a special wire, because they believe it to be of advantage to them to have one. Instead of their messages being transmitted by our operators over our own wires, at the expense of the persons sending the cablegrams, the company have asked to be allowed to transmit the messages over our wires by their own operators, paying us the ordinary rate of 5d. per word. The Pacific Cable Board pay us 5d. per word for transmitting their messages over our wires by our own operators, and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company pay us exactly the same rate for transmitting their messages over our wires by their operators, we reserving a particular line for their use. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that that is the reason. We have intimated to the directors of the Pacific Cable Board that they can have the same advantage as is given to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, but they have said - "No, we prefer that our messages shall be sent over your wires by your operators." Therefore, it cannot be rightly suggested that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company is given a special advantage in this matter. We shall require these wires in any case, whether the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company continues to transmit the messages by their own operators, or the messages are transmitted by the postal officials. We must proceed with the erection of the wires, and we do not prejudice our position in regard to the company by erecting them. The immediate necessity for these wires arose in consequence of the agreement of the New South Wales Government with the company to provide it with a special wire. Of course, when a wire is set apart for a particular service it is sometimes necessary to have more wires for the remaining business, because a wire set apart may not be fully used. Still, it is a great advantage to the Department to have a number of wires, in order to prevent delay in the transmission of business. </para>

                            <para>- A wire must be provided between Adelaide and the New South Wales bolder, under the agreement between the State Government and the company. The Department would erect a great many more wires if it could obtain the necessary money. It will be of advantage to have additional wires from Melbourne to Sydney, from Melbourne to Adelaide, and in other directions, and, so far as I can see, it is of no disadvantage to the Department to, reserve one line for the transmission of the messages of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company by their own operators. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I find that there have been delays between Melbourne and Adelaide, owing to the increase of business arising from the lower rates : so that we really require the line, whether the agreement stands or otherwise. I do not know whether I should reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> with regard to the newspaper article which he so confidently attributed to me, because he has since cheerfully withdrawn his statement. I think it is hardly fair, however, for the honorable senator to make rash and bold statements on the chance that they may be correct. The honorable senator should have known that at the time the article appeared I had ceased to be the editor of the newspaper to which he has referred. At any rate he might have found that out if he had made inquiries. It was difficult to say off-hand, after such a lapse of time, whether I had written such an article; but, owing to some peculiarities of style on the part of the writer, I came to the conclusion that the contribution quoted was not my handiwork. At the same time part of the article is correct. I have always advocated the Pacific Cable, because I considered that it would have the effect of reducing the cable rates. That result has been brought about, and the portions of the article referring to that point are absolutely correct. We were paying higher rates than we should have paid, and there is no doubt that the construction of the Pacific Cable resulted in a reduction. The proposed new lines have nothing to do with the agreement with the Eastern Extension Company. They must be constructed, and it is just as well that the money should be voted. </para>

                        <para>- The items of expenditure mentioned as being necessitated by the agreement entered into with the Eastern Extension Company are so mixed up with the ordinary votes that it is very difficult to distinguish one from the other. As the Attorney-General has stated, the construction of the telegraph line from Sydney to the South Australian border was authorized by a State Act of New South Wales, and the construction of the line from Adelaide to the Victorian border was authorized by a State Act of South Australia. Therefore we have to carry out the engagements into which those States have entered. There is, however, an amount of £5,043 set down for the construction of a line from the South Australian border to Melbourne. That work has not been authorized by either State or Commonwealth. A special line is now placed at the disposal of the Eastern Extension Company against the express wish of the Victorian Government. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was Premier of Victoria he absolutely refused to give to the Eastern Extension Company the facilities now proposed, and the Commonwealth Government have not only agreed to incur certain expenditure j in order to enable the company to divert busi ness from the Pacific Cable, but have allowed the company to open offices in Melbourne against the. wish of the State Government, and without authority from the Commonwealth Parliament. Their action has been quite unwarrantable. On the pure supposition that the proposed agreement with the Eastern Extension Company would be ratified, they have placed at the disposal of the company a special line from Melbourne to the South Australian border, and have thus placed the Pacific Cable Company at a disadvantage. It was very amusing to hear the reasons urged by the Attorney-General for the construction of the proposed new line. He stated that it would be necessary whether the agreement with the Eastern Extension Company were ratified or otherwise. He thereby admitted that for ordinary Inter-State traffic another line beyond those now available was required, and yet in the same breath he stated that one of the existing lines was placed exclusively at the disposal of the Eastern Extension Company. The Attorney-General declares that in any case we require this additional line for the purposes of our Inter-State traffic. Yet the exclusive use of one of the existing lines has been handed over to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. If that agreement is not ratified we shall probably close this line to the Eastern Extension Company altogether by charging differentia] rates, so that the traffic may be diverted to the Pacific Cable. The statement made by the Attorney-General is one of the most extraordinary which I have ever heard fall from a Minister. I would remind honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larke,</inline> the representative of Canada, recently pointed out what are the desires of the Eastern Extension Company. Their object is to make the Pacific Cable absolutely unprofitable. We all know that in Great Britain the people have not adopted State socialism to anything like the extent that we have in Australia. Consequently we are apt to form an altogether erroneous idea of their views regarding the Pacific Cable. They look upon it as a rash experiment, the success of which is very doubtful. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larke</inline> points out that if this line does not pay within the next few years it is exceedingly probable that the people of Great Britain will say - " We must sell it to a private company." That will afford the very opportunity which the Eastern Extension Company desires. If they can purchase it, they will practically control all means of communication with Australia, and will be able to treat us just as they choose. If they get rid of their present competitor by making the Pacific Cable a non-paying concern they will be in a position to exploit Australia to their heart's content. I trust that this item of £5,043 will be eliminated. Some time ago I declared my belief that the Eastern Extension Company granted rebates. I have since received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Warren,</inline> in which he denies the accuracy of my statement. I am bound to accept his word, and therefore I have pleasure in mentioning the matter to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- The expenditure upon the works which are contained in the schedule to this Bill amounts to £422,283.

I also understand that the £5,043 which is required for the construction of a telegraph line from Melbourne to the South Australian border, and the £6,000 which is set down, for additional wires from Adelaide to the New South Wales and Victorian borders, are necessary altogether apart from any business passing beyond the limits of Commonwealth territory. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council assures me that this money is required to construct these lines for the purpose of carrying Commonwealth traffic, I shall agree to the clause without any opposition, but when the schedule is under discussion I shall ask him to agree to strike out the words " owing to the use of a line having been granted to the Eastern </para>

The Attorney-General has said that in any case we require a new line for our own Inter-State traffic ; but what is the position ? According to the honorable and learned senator the Department at the present time is working with two lines short of the number which it actually requires - namely, the one proposed to be erected, and one the use of which has been granted to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. If that be so a very great injustice is being done to the people of Western Australia and South Australia, who require the use of the line handed over to the Eastern Extension Company. I should like to see the item of £5,043 provided for this line struck out. </para>

This line will be used for exactly the same purpose, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council cannot deny my assertion. We are, therefore, making a distinction without a difference.

                            <para>- I understand it as well as does the honorable' senator, who seems to imagine that the handing over of a line to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has not relieved the business done by the Department. There will be work for this line, whether the agreement be ratified or not. Our internal business, and more especially the telegraphic business between Melbourne and Western Australia, is increasing so rapidly that I believe the wire will be required, and that is why I. should like this sum to stand. I do not think we have a right to suggest that we are passing this item because of any agreement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. We are granting it because we believe that our business warrants the construction of another line. </para>

I do not believe that he would do such a thing. He has informed us that he requires this money for the construction of a telegraph line, and that we shall want it whether any proposed arrangement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company be ratified or not. We shall agree to the. item on that understanding.

That being the case, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company will not send any cables from Melbourne to Adelaide, and therefore that traffic will be suspended.

                            <para>- But by means of the differential terminal rates we shall be able to stop them from sending any messages to Adelaide. The public will send their messages by the Pacific Cable. It is thus proposed to build a line which, in these circumstances, must be absolutely useless, unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is prepared to admit that the Department is at present working with two lines short of the actual number required between Melbourne and Adelaide. If that be so, it is a scandal that a line should be placed at the exclusive order of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. Any one who is at all familiar with the transmission of cables to Europe knows that, owing to the difference in time, scarcely any messages are despatched in the morning. If a message were sent from here in the morning it would be of no service; but, if it were despatched at midday, the person to whom it was addressed would receive it in London when he went to his office at 9 a.m. If the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has the exclusive use of a line, that line must remain absolutely idle every morning. </para>

                <para>This Bill is for the purpose of legalizing grants made in excess of votes for the years 1901-2 and 1902-3. The money has all been spent, and if honorable senators strike out any items, I do not know that they will be any better off. The other House passed the measure without a word of objection. The object of it is to give parliamentary authority to expenditure incurred by the Treasurer out of a sum which he receives by way of an advance. Parliament votes the Treasurer about £200,000, from which advances may be made, and this Bill gives legal authority for the payments he has made out of it. </para>
