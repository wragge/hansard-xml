                    <para>- I rise <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a matter of personal explanation on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal,</inline> who is not present. It is in connexion with a division which took place last night: on the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to introduce a provision for pensions in the Judiciary Bill. Before the Postmaster-General left the Chamber yesterday, he had arranged a general pair for that day and to-day with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal,</inline> of course, leaving the disposal of his vote in the hands of his colleague the leader of the Senate. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> left, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> understood that the former was going to support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker.</inline> When the vote was taken, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> was voting against the insertion of the provision, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> had he been present, would also have voted in the negative. Consequently, if the pair were to have any operation at all, it would have meant that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> would have been paired as voting against the insertion of the provision, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Zeal would have been paired as voting for its insertion, which was manifestly what he did not intend. In the circumstances, as the pair was of a general character <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the Judiciary Bill, and it was understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> would bo voting in the same direction as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> there was no necessity, of course,' for the pair to be recorded in the report, ' because if it hod to be recorded at all it would have meant the inversion of the original intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal.</inline> I feel - perfectly 'certain that had he understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> would have voted' against the proposal for pensions, he would have taken the opportunity of pairing with an honorable senator whom he knew would be in favour of the provision, or would have stayed to exercise his vote. The honorable senator has written to- me a letter in which he expresses some surprise that, after the arrangement which he had made, there is no reference in the newspapers to the pair which was entered into. Hence this explanation, which is due to him. </para>

            <para>The DEPUTY PRESIDENT. - The Senate has directed that these shall be orders of the day for particular days, and the view I am submitting is that it is not competent for the Senate at the present time, and by summary motion in the way proposed - without a suspension of the standing orders - to pass a motion in respect of particular orders of the day. The practice in this matter is laid down in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> on pages 247 and 2.48 ; but there is a direct ruling summarized in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Black</inline> more's <inline font-style="italic">Speakers' Decisions</inline> on page 88 in these terms - </para>

            <para class="block">It goes on to cite the case in which that decision was given by a Speaker of the House' of Commons. Of course, as regards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs'</inline> notice of motion, the orders of the day will be called on at half-past twelve o'clock, and he will accomplish the object which he has in view by moving that his order of the day be adjourned to a particular day. But as regards the notices of motion in the names of Senators Pearce and Stewart, when their orders of the day are called on, in due course, it will then be their duty to ask that they be postponed. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me, sir, from standing order 227 that the orders of the day are specially excepted. The motion of which I have given notice will not anticipate, but will postpone the consideration of the order of the day. Therefore, I cannot see that your ruling applies to my notice of motion. It must be borne in mind, too, that a certain motion was agreed to by the Senate the other day on the understanding that it would be possible to take this course, and thus safeguard the order of business ; but if your ruling is correct these orders of the day may be put off until the end of the session, because other notices of motion may be given, and take precedence of those which have been on the paper for nearly the whole session. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to ask whether there is not some way by which all the business which honorable senators wish to have transferred to the new day for private business could not be transferred at once? It was undoubtedly understood that all these orders of the day should take their place on the business paper for the new day in their respective order. I think that we . ought to be in a position, if necessary, . to take such a course as would enable that understanding to be carried out. If we have to wait until each day arrives, it will be impossible to give to honorable senators the full benefit of the new day for private business. I suggest, sir, that you should consider whether the standing orders might not be suspended, or whether by consent the notices of motion might not be moved. </para>

The Government are about to introduce a Bill to grant a preference to all the goods manufactured in New Guinea to the extent of something like 33 £ per cent. When the Customs Tariff was before the Senate the fullest information was afforded to us. We had volumes of comparative statements showing the duties in operation in Canada, New Zealand, and elsewhere. What object can there be in offering opposition to furnishing a clear statement as to the preference the Government desire to give to goods manufactured in New Guinea <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not wish to enter into the merits of the proposal, but if the Government refuse information such as would be contained in the tabulated statement which I have asked for, I am driven to the conclusion that not only do they wish to get in the thin edge of the wedge for a Customs Tariff preference for the manufactures of British India, but that they want to push that policy through in a manner which does not permit of the fullest discussion. When we consider that the exports from New Guinea at the present time may be put under five or six different heads, comprising shells, gold, and a few other products, we -must see that there is some motive behind the proposal of the Government. The objection of the Government to grant a tabulated statement indicates, to my mind, that they want to pass their measure in such a way that honorable senators may not be fully aware of the great seriousness of the step it is proposed to take. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> to withdraw any opposition to my proposal. It is quite true that I or any other honorable senator may, by taking the Customs Tariff schedule,, make deductions and obtain the information for ourselves. Some honorable senators,, however, may not care to go to that trouble,, and I ask the Government to grant my simple request, so that one of the officers of the Customs Department may be permitted to do the work, and the Government Printer may be authorized to supply us with the necessary printed copies. </para>

                    <para>. - The motion asks that there shall be laid on the table a schedule under the Customs Act of all articles and rates of duty, showing opposite to them the difference or preference proposed to be given in the case of New Guinea. Such a document would certainly take some time to prepare, though perhaps not a' great deal of time, and it would cost some money to print. If the information desired could be obtained in no other way than that now proposed, I should have consented to treat the motion as formal. Under the circumstances, however, I do not think that any Government would be justified, without obtaining an order from the Senate, in consenting to the expenditure involved. The New Guinea Bill, in regard to these- duties, provides that, notwithstanding anything in the Customs Tariff, there shall be paid on the goods and produce manufactured in Papua, and then imported to the Commonwealth, duties of Customs at rates one-third less than those charged on like goods imported from other countries. In order to get the information desired, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> or any other person merely requires to pick .out such articles as the proposed preference would apply to, and deduct one-third from the duties now imposed. </para>

                        <para>- What I said was that it would take up a certain amount of the time of a clerk, and would cost money to print. The whole schedule of the Tariff would have to be gone through in order to provide the tabulated statement which the honorable senator desires. Any honorable senator who wishes, may make the necessary calculation on the edge of a copy of the Tariff - no trouble would be involved, except some little calculation. But is it necessary that such information should be supplied in the way proposed <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> This is not a matter of very much moment ; but I feel justified in not consenting to treat the motion as formal. When action is taken by the Government for very obvious reasons - they may be right or wrong - it is a pity that honorable senators should take occasion to suggest that there is some motive behind. What motive can there be ? The. only motive is that in our present position we are bound to see that no unnecessary expenditure takes place. I do not intend to oppose the motion if the Senate desire to carry it ; and I do not suppose that the expense would be very much. But whatever the expense, it is for the Senate to say whether it is worth while to incur it. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot see that any exception can be taken to the motion. The objection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is that the printing will involve some cost; and no doubt that is a valid objection. But a proposal to print the return is not incorporated in the motion, which simply provides that the document shall be laid on the table. When the document is produced, it will be competent for the Senate to decide whether it shall be printed, and we can then have an estimate of the cost. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has pointed out, it will not entail much time or trouble to prepare the return, and I can see no reason why the motion should not be accepted. </para>

I suppose that this supplementary report has been produced to appease some one ; and it would appear that persons outside Parliament can get all the printing they require done at the expense of the Commonwealth. But when I ask for a return, which, I believe, will show protectionist members in the Federal Parliament what they are about to do, I am opposed by the Government. I want protectionist members, and those who believe in a white Australia, to see that, under the Government proposal, they will allow people to slip over the narrow strip of sea between' us and New Guinea, and there utilize the labour of some 350,000 Papuans, in competition with white Australians. </para>

The Government is not prepared to come down and boldly say - " Gentlemen, let us have a preference Tariff which will allow the goods produced by Hindoos to come into Australia at duties one-third less than are imposed on other goods." The Government will not do that, but they bring in a Bill to allow a preference in favour of goods manufactured by the Papuans of New Guinea; and they know that once such legislation is passed, the Senate is committed. </para>

                        <para>- And I should have said - " Good luck to them ; let them do the best they can with the country." In my opinion, the fertile brain, which prompted a Minister to introduce a Bill of the kind, had in view that once we were committed to a proposal to allow the produce of black labour in New Guinea to be introduced, in the Commonwealth at preferential rates, we would have no ground for refusing to allow the products of millions of His Majesty's Indian subjects to be imported on similar conditions. There are only about half-a-dozen products, and those entirely of the primary industries, which are exported from New Guinea to the Commonwealth' at present. I therefore can see nothing in this but a deep design, and the objection of the Government to have this printing done seems to me to prove my case. If the Government were really anxious to have the fullest discussion they would send us, as they did during the Tariff" debates, piles of statistics of all kinds, but all that I ask is a simple column to be added to the schedule showing the difference proposed in respect of imports from New Guinea. I desire that the workers in the various industries of the Commonwealth, and the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives who represent them, should know what is being done when we are asked by a simple paragraph in the Papua Bill to give a one-third preference to. the products of manufactures and industries, in New Guinea. </para>

                <para class="block">I have already addressed the Senate twice on the subject of this motion during the discussion on two successive Supply Bills, and it is therefore unnecessary for me to go over all the arguments again. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton has pointed out repeatedly that the armament and equipment of our forces are in a shockingly deficient condition. The Minister for Defence is, to judge by his public utterances, of a different opinion. My contention is that it is for Parliament to say who is right, and it is necessary for that purpose that we should have a detailed statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton as to what the deficiencies consist of. Until we have this detailed statement it is impossible for Parliament to deal with the question, or with the Estimates when they come up for consideration, in an intelligent way. When the Estimates are brought up we shall be asked to vote certain moneys, and it will be impossible for us to say whether those moneys are being applied in the best manner possible. It would have been very much easier for me to explain what I desire if General Hutton's report were available. But in spite of everything that has happened in this connexion, honorable senators will no doubt be surprised to hear that that report is not yet available. It is impossible to explain why we should have special difficulty in getting this particular report. I speak subject to correction, but I think it was laid on the table in another place some three weeks ago, and a week later it was laid on the table of the Senate. ' Just now I asked the messenger to get me a copy, and I was told that copies are not available. I ask honorable senators to decide whether it does not appear that the intention is- that we shall not be allowed to see that report, so long as it can possibly be kept from us. That, to my mind, is only in keeping with the methods which prevail in the Defence Department in respect of every report which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton sends in. I shall not speak further on the subject of the motion, but I intend to take it to a division, if necessary. </para>

I only know what the facts are, and I say we do not all know it. On the contrary, the organization is being carried on so far as Parliament will permit it to be carried on in the way in which Major-General Hutton has suggested. Of course, in connexion with this question of reorganization, it is one thing to lay down a perfect plan and another to provide the money to carry it out. As Parliament has decided on many occasions that no more than a certain sum can be expended in the defence of Australia, whatever scheme of re-organization is adopted must be kept within that. </para>

                        <para>- The best use possible has to be made of the money voted. Can any possible good purpose be served by carrying this motion, when all the information that is necessary for Parliament can be obtained from Major-General Hutton's report? What good purpose can be served by picking out particular parts of Australia and drawing attention to deficiencies when they are now being remedied as far as possible by the scheme of re-organization which is being carried out. As regards supplies of ammunition and warlike stores generally, they must be regulated by the amount which Parliament is prepared to vote. In addition to this it certainly would be a violation of all well-known principles adopted in dealing with military affairs to publish to the world, any more than is necessary for the purpose of carrying on parliamentary government, any defects which there may be in our military system. When we publish such defects to the world we publish them to our enemies. It is perfectly right that we should give such information upon these subjects as may be necessary for Parliament and for the Government, but we ought not to go beyond that. I do not know to what defects <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> especially alludes, but I say that we should not depart from the sound, wise, and generally established principle, that defects in our military system should not be made known to the world. It is not necessary for the purpose of supplying members of the Parliament with information in dealing with defence questions, or for any other purpose, that this particular information should be given in any more detailed way than it is to be found in Major-General Hutton's report. I oppose the motion, because I believe that the publication of such information would do more harm than good.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline> SMITH (Western Australia). - I should like to know from the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether Major-General Hutton's report has not been ordered to be printed by the House of Representatives or by the Senate ? </para>

                        <para>- That clears the matter up, and we shall no doubt be able to see the report. I intend to support the motion, because we have a most important question to consider. It rests not with the General Officer Commanding, or the Minister for Defence, but with the Parliament, to decide what money shall be voted for the requirements of the defence of Australia. It is essential that we should know to what extent our armament and equipment are deficient. A report, such as that which is required by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> from the General Officer Commanding, would give full particulars. When that information was supplied we should be in a position to vote the money necessary to make our armament and equipment as efficient as we think they should be. At the present time we have no definite information on the subject. We wish to elicit the opinion of an expert of high qualifications, the one who is best fitted to tell us what our requirements are. It has been stated that he and the Minister are not in accord on this subject. We can have the advantage of hearing the views of the Minister expressed in the other House, and we desire to learn the views of the General Officer Commanding. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has said that it is inadvisable to publish to the world the fact that out armament and equipment are deficient. </para>

                        <para>- It is not very long since the General Officer Commanding, in a public speech delivered at Adelaide and reported in all the newspapers, stated that we were so deficient in the necessary means of defence that if we had a transcontinental railway built we should be sending men without arms to defend certain portions of the Commonwealth. There could not be a more dam- aging statement than that made, if we desire that other nations shall not know our defenceless condition. I believe that our- requirements with regard to rifles, ammunition, and munitions of war will be very large, and that the Senate will willingly vote any sum which it considers necessary to put our forces in a satisfactory condition. But when the civil and military heads of the Defence Department do not seem to be in accord as to what our requirements are, and we are not to be supplied with any information from the expert authority, we are not in a position to vote money to supply the deficiencies. It is only reasonable that such a report should be furnished to the Senate, and I cannot understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> should oppose its production. </para>

                        <para>- No ; because! think we have a right to know specifically in what respect the armament and equipment of our forces are deficient. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has interjected that the labour party cut down the military expenditure. What we objected to was an army without arms. We objected to voting £700,000 a year for an army which the General Officer Commanding told us had bo arms to fight with. If the Government come to us and say that a sum of £100,000, or more, is necessary in order to arm the existing forces the labour party will vote solidly in that; direction. But we shall not vote money for an army which would be practically useless in time of war. We have never refused to vote for necessary armament. I understand that the return which has been laid on the table does not give the information which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> by his motion desires to supply us with. What harm can be done by Parliament and the general public knowing what are the requirements of the forces? The position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is that we know that we are in an unsafe position, but like the ostrich, when pursued, we wish to put our heads in the bush. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to support the motion as proposed to be amended. It must be evident to all of us that there is something radically wrong about our Defence system, when the General Officer Commanding and the Minister for Defence are not working as harmoniously as they ought. On the one hand, the Minister has made particular statements ; on the other hand, his statements have been contradicted by the General Officer Commanding, and I think that Parliament is entitled to the information which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> asks for. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> puts in the plea that it is not desirable to make the facts public. I suppose his meaning is that we ought not to expose our weakness ; that we should not demonstrate to possible invading powers how unprepared we are to meet them. My opinion is that any foreign power which desires to invade Australia knows a great deal more about our condition of preparedness or unpreparedness than we do. These powers take precious good care to get all the information which it is possible to obtain. They have every means of obtaining the information, but we cannot get it. Why cannot the Parliament of the Commonwealth be trusted in a matter of this kind ? Why cannot the. public be taken into the confidence of. the Government ? My belief is that the one incompetent member of the Government is the Minister for Defence. I do not think he has any of the qualifications desirable in a gentleman holding that position, and he ought to be put out of it at the earliest opportunity. We get nothing but bluster, blow, and bounce from him. We want something else from a man at the head of the military administration. We are spending a million per annum on defence, and yet the General Officer Commanding comes forward and tells us that we have no arms, and no equipment. We are spending money on the men, but of what earthly use is a man on the field of battle unless he is armed ? We might as well put up a prop. I hope the Senate will insist upon being supplied with this information. What harm can be done? None, so far as I can see. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> says that possible opponents may know our condition. It is known to them already. The members of this Parliament are responsible to the community for the condition of our defences. If I tell my constituents that I cannot get any information with regard to preparations for defence they will say - "What earthly use is there in our sending a man like you to Parliament? We elected you to get information on these matters, to see that our interests are attended to, to look after the affairs of the country." Yet when we come here desiring to get information the Government places every possible obstacle in our way. It lies entirely with the Senate to say whether the Government is to carry on this policy of concealment, which is after all only a refuge for incompetence. I' trust that honorable Senators will vote for the motion as proposed to be amended. It can do no harm, and it may bring about a great deal of good. </para>

I think it will be generally acknowledged that it might have saved the British Empire £1,000,000 or so had the British people known what a bungling concern they had in the shape of army administration. It is not when we are attacked that we ought to find out whether our men have gone into the field sufficiently armed. It is only right for honorable senators to make these inquiries. It is only right that the public should know what ought to be done. We know very well that the public desire that economy should be practised in almost every direction.

                        <para>.- The question is rather more complicated than that. What I gather concerning the. intentions of the mover, is first of all that he wants the Senate to know what is required to put the Commonwealth in a position of security as regards defence. That is a very large question, and involves many intricate points. Secondly, I take it that he wants to know what should be obtained at present, and what is absolutely necessary to be done. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in the opinion of the expert who has been brought from England to advise' us. Thirdly, having secured that information, the honorable senator wants to .know to what extent is the Commonwealth capable of beginning to put the Defence Force, having regard to what is immediately necessary, into a practical condition of utility. Will those three points be covered by the motion? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> is satisfied that they will I have no objection to urge. I am not saying anything hostile to him, but I want to see whether, by amending his motion, he can get the information, which I do nob think he will obtain as it stands. It is too general. He should amend it so as to indicate the particular information that we ought to have. We have it from a quarter from which I was very glad ito hear the statement emanate - namely, the labour party - that so far as equipment and armament are concerned they are prepared to support any expenditure to put them in a satisfactory condition. If the honorable senator is satisfied that his motion will secure the information that is required, I am prepared bo support him. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron's</inline>
                    point, I am satisfied that the motion will secure the information which we all require. The General Officer Commanding has already laid it down that £480,000 must be spent upon equipment to put our forces into what I may called a mobile .condition, in which they can move freely and be thoroughly well armed and equipped for service. The Senate has not yet got the data as to how that sum is made up. As to what
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                    has said with reference to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline>
                    Hutton's annual report, I may point out that that report does not go sufficiently fully into the question bo enable us to judge of what we are doing when we vote on the Estimates. The information which I expect to obtain as a result of my motion will put us in a position to vote intelligently when we reach that stage. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said that Parliament refused to allow more than a certain amount of money to be spent. That is literally true. But Parliament, as every honorable senator must remember, had to vote in the dark. The Minister for Defence had gone away, and the office of Minister was in commission. "

                    Lyne, who was temporarily at the head of the Department, did not know anything about it, and was unable to give any information concerning details. He simply accepted a lump-sum reduction without any protest, whilst practically admitting that he knew nothing about the position. Another point raised by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                    was that in publishing to the public, we publish to the enemy. I submit that it is very much better that the public and even the enemy should know what are our weak points while we are in a position to remedy them, than that they should be discovered when we are absolutely at war, and nothing can be done in the way of remedy. That is my answer to the suggestion that it is dangerous to the public weal to publish this information.

                    <para>- Honorable senators will recollect that when we adjourned last evening some discussion had been raised as to clauses 66 and 67. The point involved was this : These clauses provide for obtaining the fruits of a judgment from the Commonwealth or a State, in cases where the Commonwealth or a State is a party. Following the well-known rule, in all the States except New South Wales and Queensland, and also the rule followed in Great Britain and many * other countries, it was proposed to provide that there should be no execution or attachment or process of that nature issued against the Commonwealth or a State, but that there should be another way in which the money due under a judgment should be paid. I proposed, when the matter first came up for discussion, to strike out all the words after " suit," because it appeared to me that in the form in which the clause stood those words really meant nothing, and that it would be very much better to confine the clause to the first part of it, which prohibited execution or attachment or process against the Commonwealth or a State.. Senators Harney and Matheson and others seemed to take the view that there was no reason, why the State or Commonwealth should not be put in exactly the same position as an individual - that, no matter what the amount might be, there was no reason why, if it were not paid within a certain number of days, execution should not be issued with all the usual consequences. </para>

                        <para>- I did not ; and I think any one who has for one moment thought of the difference there is between the State - that is, the people of a State or Commonwealth - and a private individual would say that it was a matter for serious consideration. However, I see that there is a real reason why we should give some kind of remedy which is enforceable ; and since the adjournment last night I have prepared amendments, which, I think, will carry out the wishes of honorable senators opposite so far as can be reasonably expected, and yet will prevent the consequences which must follow from adopting ' the ordinary remedy, as against an individual. I first propose to ask leave to withdraw the amendment nov before the Committee, and then to move an amendment, that after the word. " against " in the second line, the words- " the property or revenues of " be inserted. Then in clause 67, I intend to move that all the words after " Commonwealth " be omitted, with a view to inserting the following :- or a State, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth or of the State, as the case may be, shall satisfy the judgment out of moneys legally available. These amendments will place a litigant, who has succeeded in obtaining a judgment against the Commonwealth, in the position that immediately the certificate is issued, he may ask the Treasurer to carry out the judgment by paying the money. It will then become the statutory duty of" the Treasurer to pay the money out of moneys legally available. Of course, a Treasurer cannot pay except out of moneys legally available, which means moneys appropriated by Parliament for the specific purpose, or moneys which are in his hands in such a way that they may be legally used for the purpose of satisfying a judgment. If the Treasurer refuses to carry out his statutory duty, the High Court has power under a. clause, which we have already passed, to issue an order compelling him to do so. That will enable all the circumstances to be taken into account, which would be impossible in the case of an execution issued in the ordinary way. The High Court will, for instance, consider whether or not there is money legally available. The mere statement that money is not available will not be sufficient; the Treasurer will have to satisfy the Court that money is not legally available. If it is legally available he W1 have to pay, or take the consequences which fall on a person who fails to carry out an order of the Courts or to discharge a statutory duty. If money is not available, no Court. will make an order, and then Parliament will have to take the matter up and vote what is necessary. </para>

                    <para>- As the senator who raised the difficulty, I think that the compromise now proposed meets the objections which were expressed last night. The Bill, as it stands, would render a judgment against the Commonwealth so much waste paper. I had no idea of asking for more than that judgment should be satisfied when money was legally available ; and in the class of cases I had in my mind, money always will be available. I was not referring to cases of millions, but to cases in which £500 or £600 may be claimed in connexion with public works, and so forth. </para>

Under the amendment as now proposed, the first thing necessary is that the money shall be available ; and if it is not available, then the creditor must wait for action by Parliament. If the Treasurer refuses to pay, then under the Constitution it will be possible to get a mandamus against him, and he may be attached and put into prison like any other person. The amendment makes it pretty certain that where a Treasurer has money available he will pay at once. </para>

                    <para>- A difficulty is raised by this clause. The time in which the party is to apply is within fourteen days, and before the jury is sworn. Very often a person is committed two or three days, or even the very daj', before he is to be tried, and the jury is sworn. He would, according to this, have to apply either to a Justice in Chambers or to a Supreme Court. That might be very inconvenient, because, in Western Australia, at all events, the Supreme Court rarely sits, and for this purpose a sitting might be required within twenty-four hours. I suggest that the words " a Judge of " should be inserted after the word " to," line 5. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I have another suggestion to make in this clause, to carry out the same purpose. The idea I had in submitting the amendments to which the Committee have just agreed was to render it possible for persons who require counsel to defend them to make an application speedily. There is another provision in the clause which places a difficulty in their way. Honorable senators will see that, if it is considered desirable in the interests of justice that such an appointment should be made, " the Justice or Judge shall certify this to the Attorney-General." There might be some difficulty in certifying the matter to the Attorney-Gen ral. Why should we not add after the word "Attorney-General " the words which are to be found in the first sub-clause, " or such other person as the Governor-General appoints in that behalf."

                        <para>- I do not think that is necessary ; we cannot provide for every possible detail. What power would the person commissioned have to make arrangements'! The clause provides that under certain conditions the Attorney-General may, if he thinks fit, " cause arrangements to be made for the defence of the accused person." That means that somebody must be. retained to defend him, and that an obligation must be incurred to pay for the defence. . The person commissioned to prosecute cannot be supposed to pay for the defence out of his own pocket ; the payment must come from the public funds, and he must communicate with the Attorney-General before he can make those arrangements. After all, is it not better, to deal with the responsible person, who is the Attorney-General ? As soon as the Judge makes the order the person prosecuting, if he is not the Attorney-General himself, will communicate at once with the Attorney-General to get authority to make the necessary arrangements. There might be a general authority given in prosecuting to make these arrangements. </para>

But, if he has a representative in these cases, the departmental instructions could be given to the representative to make these arrangements. However, if the Vice-President of the Executive Council thinks it a matter of' moment to resist the amendment, I will not press it.

                        <para>- I know that that is inferred, but the clause does not say so, and counsel for the Crown, when such a case is brought before the Supreme Court of a State, may say - " I object to your jurisdiction." When the clause is looked at, it will be found that the jurisdiction is given to the Supreme Court of the State,- and counsel may then say - " I know that, but it was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Commonwealth Act to give that jurisdiction." The Court would say - "So it was," and the appeal would not be heard at all. The meaning is governed by the words " the laws of the Commonwealth," but we are in this clause directing a Commonwealth Court to reserve a point of law for a foreign jurisdiction, and we have no power to do that. There is another point to be considered. Even, assuming that the Supreme Court of the State would accept this new jurisdiction which was cast upon it by a foreign body, then a suitor before that Court would have a different status from what he would have if it were described as a " Supreme Court exercising Federal jurisdiction," because where it is so described there are certain limitations and privileges set out in clause 35. All these would be excluded. </para>

The jurisdiction of the High Court, except that taken out by the " exclusive" clause, is vested in the Supreme Courts of the States by virtue of clause 40 and other clauses. This clause only provides machinery by which a point of law goes from the Supreme Court of a State to the Court exercising Federal jurisdiction : it does not give any independent jurisdiction. </para>

This is one of those, cases in which Federal jurisdiction can be conferred. By clause 40 it has been conferred on the Supreme Courts of the States, and it must be exercised by virtue of that power. This clause does not confer the jurisdiction, but simply provides a method by which any point of law will go to the Supreme Court, which has been invested with Federal jurisdiction. Unless we are to use the words " Supreme Court invested with Federal jurisdiction," wherever the term " Supreme Court " is now used, we 3hall create a difficulty. If those words " were used in this clause, and not in others, they would give rise to all sorts of ingenious arguments to prove that something was meant quite different from that which was intended. </para>

It will be remembered that that clause gives the right of appeal from the small courts. It might be found desirable to regulate the amount in respect to which appeals should be made, or it might be necessary to restrict or regulate the appeals. </para>

                <para class="block">These words impose an unnecessary limitation on the right of the Parliament to object to a regulation. No good object is served by limiting its right in that respect, because a later part of the clause provides that if an objection is raised, it shall be absolutely without prejudice to any action which has been taken previously. Nobody can be in the least degree hurt if, at any time, the Parliament should request the Governor-General to annul a regulation. We are all well aware of the way in which regulations are laid on the table. Nobody is paying any particular attention, and the Minister in charge of the Department mutters a few words, which are very often inaudible, and hands the regulations to the Clerk. I do not refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> but to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> who very often mutters a few words which T do not catch. The regulations pass into the limbo of forgotten documents, and, until some case arises, they are unknown. </para>

The Journals of the Senate are not supplied tome, bub are sent somewhere else, and consequently I do not see the record of the proceedings. In any case, regulations get laid on the table, and no one knows anything about them until a case arises. It was only by the accidental omission of limiting words from the corresponding provision in the Public Service Act that an honorable senator was recently able to take objection to a regulation. If this limitation had found a place in the Act, it would have been impossible to raise any question on the public service regulations. I see no reason why' we should be limited to 40 days. </para>

                <para class="block">It does not affect anything which has been done under the rules. I think the honorable senator will see at once that it puts all the persons who are acting under the rules in a condition of uncertainty as to what is going to be done. That is the reason why, where the regulations under an Act have to be laid on the table of either House, and have to be acted upon, a time limit is fixed. We allow the Judges to make the rules. Now, rules have to be constantly made as the occasion arises. It may often be found in actual practice that a rule is altogether unsuitable - that it works an injustice. To remedy that injustice as soon as possible, a. regulation is made, laid on the table of each House, and if the Parliament says nobbing about it within 40 days, it becomes operative. What purpose would the honorable senator effect by the proposed alteration? His reason is that honorable senators may not be aware that the rules have been laid <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the table, and therefore may not be able to take any action. </para>

                        <para>- It is perfectly proper to preserve the right of Parliament.. But it only exists to do the business of the country, and it must have regard, in the exercise of its right, to the convenience and the interests of the people. It would be strongly against the interests of the people if it were impossible to lay a new code of rules upon the table without a. certain period being fixed when they could come into operation. We might as well hand over to Parliament the power of initiating these rules. Those who are acquainted with the practice of the courts will bear me out that the issuing of new rules is of immense importance in the interests of litigants, and if there is an indefinite period for their coming into operation injustices may be done. There may be no power of remedy in consequence of the uncertainty. Suppose we have three sitting days per week. Forty sitting days will then mean a considerable period. </para>

The difficulty of obtaining justice, the delays placed in the way of suitors, and the enormous expense have grown to be a public scandal. The lawyers may laugh, because if any one benefits from this state of things they certainly do. If I could only impress people with my ideas of the madness of going to law, there would not be so much litigation for the benefit of the lawyers. But seeing' that people will enter upon litigation, and that injustices are often done, it is extremely desirable that justice should be speedy and cheap. It. is a beautiful fiction that justice is free. But when an unfortunate litigant appears at the door of the justice hall, he finds that there is a barrier between him and the seat of justice. There is a door which can only be unlocked with a golden key- and the key has to be 22 carat gold at that,, with very little alloy in it. The position of things is growing to be a grave public scandal, and we want, if we can, to remedy it. I admit at once that the obstacles in the way are very great, but if we never try we shall never accomplish anything. I find that under these Rules of Court, the Justices have full power to. prescribe and regulate fees. It is extremely desirable that Parliament should have some voice in the fixing of fees. They are too high. </para>

                        <para>- We shall have to find ways and means of compelling the lawyers to register.: If we cannot accomplish our end in that way, we will try by a flank movement to break down their union, which at present stands in a great measure between the people and the obtaining of justice, and which is a menace to the welfare of the Commonwealth. We hear a great deal of shearers' unions, miners' unions, and shoemakers' unions, but they are paltry and beggarly concerns compared with the lawyers' ' union. It is desirable that Parliament should have some supervision over these gentlemen. The Judges have been practising lawyers themselves and are in sympathy with the profession, not with the public. </para>

We know what happened in connexion with the Public Service Regulations. They were laid upon the table, but they were not placed in the hands of honorable senators. They were entirely overlooked until a few weeks ago. As to what the Vice-President of the Executive Council says with regard to a long period placing the officers of the Court in a continued state of uncertainty, I remark that we are all. in a condition of uncertainty. Life itself , is uncertain. </para>

                        <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> first drew my attention- to this matter, it seemed to me that the limitation was rather an unnecessary one, but, on reading the clause carefully, I have changed my mind. There is nothing so important in the administration of justice as that there should be certainty not only as to the law, but as to the decisions and rules under which the Courts act. That certainty is necessary for the practical purpose that people come to lawyers and ask for their advice, and that the only way in which sound advice can be given is by having a sound basis, one that is not shifty in any respect. Lawyers are asked to advise upon the merits of a case, and those merits must be certain, in order that the advice can be relied on. Procedure and practice may determine whether a litigant can or cannot raise a certain point, whether the certain period has not expired, or whether certain interlocutory steps have not been taken. Therefore the rules are undoubtedly connected with the law itself; and the same policy which makes it advisable to have the law certain both as to decisions and Acts of Parliament makes it equally desirable that the procedure which moulds together the branches of the law shall be certain. I take the 40 days to be a probationary period. The rules will' be laid upon the table of the Senate, and, if they are not objected to within 40 days, lawyers will be able to advise their clients that a certain procedure can be adopted. If the rules were to be laid before Parliament for the session, and the session were a long one, legal advisers would be in a condition of doubt as to the basis upon which they should advise It is necessary to fix some period, and 40 days seems to me to be a reasonable period. </para>

                    <para>- When I was engaged as Acting Chairman, I asked that this clause might be postponed because I desired to move an amendment. That amendment was that this Bill should come into operation on the 1st January next. I am informed, however, that there are objections to that course. My desire was, as it always has been, to save the taxpayers' money if I could possibly do so, without causing inconvenience. Although I am not quite convinced that there is any necessity for this Bill, the will of Parliament seems to be that it should come into operation in a short time, and I have no desire to embarrass Ministers in any way. It might be argued that Judges could be appointed within a month or two, their appointments to take effect as from a later date. But probably any intention in that direction cannot be carried out. Then there is the idea that it would be as well to appoint the Judges while Parliament is sitting, so- that honorable members might have some voice in the matter, if it were thought that undesirable men had been chosen. I do not anticipate for a moment that Parliament will have any ground for complaint in that regard, but if some honorable senators are of a contrary opinion I do not desire to prevent Ministers bringing this Bill into operation when they choose. All I desire is that no appointment of Judges, registrars, or other court officials shall be made until the necessity arises. What I mean is that I hope these appointments will not be unduly pushed on ; but, under the circumstances, I am not prepared to move any amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> ought to withdraw the proposed new clause without taking the sense of the Committee. It appears to me that there is no reason for hurry.' Even if the Judges be appointed as soon as the Bill passes there is no reason why all the subordinate officers should also be selected. There is to be a registrar and marshal of the High Court and deputy-marshals and deputy-registrars, along with <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> host of other minor officials. What is the use of running the Commonwealth into an -enormous expense of nearly £1,000 a week ? If we can save a few thousand pounds, it is our duty to do so ; at any rate, we ought to be given some little time to reflect. I am not making these remarks with any view of interfering with the Government in the appointment of the principal officers, but it would be monstrous to use this measure for the purpose of immediately appointing a whole army of officials. </para>

When objections are raised to the expenditure provided for in the Estimates, the Government make explanations which appear reasonable at the time, and the items are passed ; and it is perfect nonsense to salk of reforms being achieved in that way. There might be some intermediate course pursued, and I suggest 3rd September as a compromise. </para>

Honorable senators should consider the' taxpayers just as much as they consider the servants of the Government. We ought not to be taxed to death, though that is a state of affairs which we are approaching at an alarming rate. The Commonwealth, instead of being the most lightly taxed community in the world, will soon be the most oppressively taxed. </para>

                        <para>- That is "drawing a red herring" across the track. The States Governments have made appointments which they cannot repudiate. In Victoria the pension bill alone is about £500,000' per annum, and the position is becoming really most serious. With" an income tax of ls. 4d. in the fi, and such a pension bill as I have mentioned, is it any wonder that people are going away to South Africa ? </para>

                    <para>- I am prepared to trust the Government, who will, I believe, exercise economy in every possible direction. It is not wise to tie the hands of the Government in matters of this sort; and, besides, the 3rd September is only a few weeks hence. I can guarantee that the Bill will not come into active operation before that date, and to fix any date places the Government in an awkward and unfortunate position. It is possible that amongst the members of another place, or of this Chamber, there may be those whom the Government would choose as Judges of the Federal High Court. These members, if not appointed to the position, would have to go before their constituencies in the ordinary course, and I contend that in common fairness they ought to be told whether or not they are to be appointed Judges. As to the appointment of the necessary court officials, I should, again, trust the Government. We must trust the Government, or turn them out. </para>

                        <para>- I have been a member of a great many Governments, and I am personally acquainted with several Commonwealth Ministers j and I feel confident that they will make only necessary appointments, and observe all due economy. It is probable that the registrars, marshals, and other officers will be chosen from men occupying similar positions under the States Governments at the present time, and doubtless negotiations will have to be entered into in this connexion. The States Governments will, no doubt, desire as many of the salaries as possible to be paid by the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth will be desirous of getting tiio work done as cheaply as possible ; and the result will doubtless be a good deal of bargaining. Some little delay must be occasioned in that way ; and I feel certain that the Attorney-General will make arrangements as cheaply and economically as is possible under the circumstances. I should advise the Attorney-General, in every case possible, to obtain the services of present State officials at perhaps some slight increase of salary. As I said before, we must trust the Government or turn them out, and if we cannot turn them out ourselves, we must trust to honorable members in another place. </para>

                    <para>I am afraid it will be very difficult to make this Bill amusing, or even attractive or interesting; at the same time it is a very important measure. I propose merely to state in general terms what the Bill is. It follows necessarily upon the Judiciary Bill with which we have just dealt, and provides for the procedure which is to regulate the. High Court. It provides, as to a portion of the Bill, for certain definite rules of procedure which are the main body of the Bill, and which cannot be altered ; but it also provides for a code Of procedure such as is generally laid down in regulations. This code of procedure, which will come into operation at once, is subject to alteration by regulations. It is necessar3r to have a code of procedure ready in order that as soon as the Court is established, it will be able to get to work at once and carry on its business. If this Bill were not passed, it would be necessary that Judges of the High Court should make rules, and it would probably be impracticable to have those rules laid before Parliament to enable the proceedings of the Court to be carried on within a reasonable time. A code of procedure has therefore been adopted in this; Bill, which so far as we can see, is perfect, and which is subject to amendment in the way I have mentioned. I may add that this code of procedure has been very carefully drawn upon the latest and best models. It does away with a great many old-fashioned and cumbersome methods. It is founded on the Queensland Code of </para>

                            <para>- The code of procedure here adopted is modelled, if not altogether founded, upon that in use in Queensland. As to the rest of the Bill, it provides for certain official matters, in connexion with the seal of the Court, the establishment of registries, and the transfer of a cause from one registry to another. It provides for the trial of issues, for new trials, for the law of evidence to be administered in the Court, for powers of amendment, for changing the venue of trials in cases, for the method in which judgment and execution shall be carried out, for the. way in which appeals are to be conducted, and security is to be given, and for procedure generally. Unless I were to go into the details of all these matters, it is hardly worth while that I should deal with any of them specially. </para>

                        <para>-The side note to this clause has attracted my attention. I have been looking through the Judiciary Bill, and 1 see no mention of a jury in that Bill. I notice that by clause 13, the High Court or a Justice may direct a suit to be tried with a jury. </para>

                        <para>- This clause refers to the qualification of jurymen, the preparation of jury lists, the summoning, attendance, and empanelling of juries, and so on. If I am not mistaken, the law with regard to juries varies in the States, and we shall have Commonwealth causes tried by one class of jury in one State, and by another class of jury in another State. That is not at all desirable. The persons who are eligible to sit on juries are limited. In all the States there is a property qualification which I think ought to be done, away with. </para>

                            <para>- In- Queensland I think a juryman has to be a householder with furniture valued at about £200 ; it is a property qualification. A young intelligent clear minded fellow, who is not a householder, is not eligible to sit on a jury. I have seen a number of naturalized foreigners sitting on juries, who", to my mind, had not a sufficient acquaintance with the English language to perform that duty, while young natives, not property holders, were disqualified. We have laid down the principle that every man and woman in the community shall have a voice in the framing of our legislation. I think that it ought to be extended to our jury system. </para>

                            <para>- Those cases could be sent to the States Courts for trial. If any cases did arise under the exclusive jurisdiction, some provision might be made for trying them. The .great bulk of criminal cases will be tried by the States Judges, but there is a right of appeal in every instance to the High Court. The clause deals with juries for trying civil cases.. There are two courses open to us when we establish the procedure in the High Court. We can pass a Jury Act. in which we can set out the qualifications of a juryman, the method of summoning juries, and the rules for challenging and choosing jurymen. If we took that course we should at once have to establish a jury system in each State. We should have to appoint officers to carry out all that work. Why should we incur that enormous expense when all the work is done for us in each State <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Another difficulty is that we should have all through Australia two systems of juries running - one in which men were liable to be summoned to ' attend State, juries, and another in which men were liable to attend juries for the trial of Commonwealth causes. We should have two lists. Even if we had a uniform system, it would impose a heavy tax on the members of the community. </para>

                            <para>- That could hardly be done. The reform which the honorable senator aims at is, I take it, first to secure a uniform jury panel for all Commonwealth juries, and, secondly, to make every man in the community liable to serve. That reform could not be carried out without special legislation, and without increasing the cost of the High Court enormously. What we propose to do is to use the existing machinery in the States as far as possible. </para>

                            <para>- In the Courts in which trial by jury is optional, the great bulk of the cases are tried by a Judge. It is perfectly open to any one to have his case tried by a Judge or a jury, as he thinks fit. It seems to me that, as a beginning, we have adopted the most economical way in this Bill. By-and-by, if. public opinion is in favour of adopting a new system of special juries for Commonwealth causes, and it is prepared to bear the cost, it may be instituted, but at the present time it would be wasteful and unjustifiable to introduce a. separate system of trial by jury. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had directed his attention to the pay of jurymen, he would have looked in the right direction. It is notorious that men have to leave their business to serve on juries for an allowance of a few shillings a day. The scale of payment is disgraceful. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> seems to think it a great privilege for a man to serve on a jury. If he had served on a jury many times, be would know that it isa great privilege not to be summoned. A neighbour of mine once complained to a. friend that he had not been put on the jury list, and he was told that it was very strange that he, a property owner who had lived in the neighbourhood for a long time,, had been left off the list. He immediately went down to see the sergeant of police in Toorak to learn why he had not been put on the. jury list. The sergeant, a genial, good-natured Irishman, said " Faith, ain't you on the list <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Well, we'll soon rectify that." Before my friend was two days older he found that his name had been placed on the jury list. After his first experience in a criminal case, he was not very anxious to be placed on a jury again. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator had served on a jury many times, I think he would have come to the conclusion that justice is better dispensed by a Judge, who is an intelligent man, and looks at the issue from a broad standpoint. In nine cases out of ten it shortens the length of the trial enormously, and saves suitors great expense. A case in which the liberty of a man is concerned should be tried by a jury ; but in nine cases out of" ten a Judge would , decide much better than a jury. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> could see his- way to increase the fee of a juryman to more than 10s. a day, he would be carrying out a great reform. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the Government could fairly be expected to make any other provision than they have made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has got hold of a very important point. But I can hardly go as far as he is prepared to go, for I do not desire to see incapable men or women sitting on juries. In Tasmania, and I suppose it is the same in all the States, we have common juries, which generally tiy criminal cases, and special juries, which generally try civil issues. I have no hesitation in saying that some of the common juries in the various States are a disgrace to our civilization. With me the question is not whether a man is a householder or a property holder, but whether he is educated. A juryman ought to be a ratepayer, and to have some little stake in the country. But, above all, he ought to possess a certain degree of education. In cases where men are tried for embezzlement or forgery - in cases involving handwriting or intricate and complicated accounts - how can we expect to have a proper system of justice, or to insure protection to the State on the one hand, and to the prisoner on the other, when we have jurors who cannot read or write? </para>

                            <para>- Our recent experience ought to teach us to be very careful about what is done. I have in my mind a Queensland case, the hearing of which was transferred from the back-blocks to Brisbane. The case involved the habits and customs of people living in the back country. The Crown was afraid that the people out there might be prejudiced in favour of the accused. Consequently, the venue was changed, and a Brisbane jury tried the prisoner. That jury had no knowledge whatever of bush life, and, in my opinion, was not competent to try the cause. In another case the Broken Hill strikers were tried at Deniliquin instead of at the place where the offence was committed, and where the circumstances were well known. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that there are cases of great difficulty, where local prejudice might be sufficient to override justice. But, on the other hand, there may be outside prejudices. In the Brisbane case there was an undoubted prejudice against the prisoner, which had been deliberately fomented by the press. The people in Brisbane from whom the jury was drawn were to a man, I believe, prejudiced against the prisoner. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; and I believe on insufficient evidence. If I had been a member of that jury I would have been no party to returning a verdict of guilty, even if I had had to be carried out dead. The man may have been guilty ; I do not know. But a jury is supposed to find a verdict according to the evidence, and I do not believe that the evidence was sufficient. The very fact that the jury was, or might be presumed to -be prejudiced, told very much against the prisoner. That case influences me in bringing up the question. Unless substantial reasons can be given there ought to be no change of venue. A man ought to be tried at the nearest court of justice to where the offence was committed. That rule should never be departed from except under circumstances of a most serious character. I see that the High Court may at any stage direct that the trial shall be held at some particular place to be specified in the order. Does that mean that the trial may be begun in one place and a jury impannelled there, and that in course of the trial the judge may disband the jury and change the venue to another place? </para>

                        <para>- This clause has no relation to criminal trials. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> criticism seems to me to be directed to the use that is made of the power of changing the venue, rather than to the reason for a power of this kind being given. I do not think there is any power which is more valuable in the administration of justice, to secure a fair trial, than that of changing the venue in certain cases. A prosecution may be begun in a place where it would be grossly unfair to the prisoner to have, him tried. There ought to be a power to change the venue in such a case. Take the very illustration which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> gave. Supposing the offence was committed in Brisbane. It might be utterly unfair that a Brisbane jury should try the case, and it might meet the interests of justice to change the venue to some place in the Country where the jury would be likely to take all the circumstances into consideration. Everything turns upon the way in which the power is used, but that there should be such a power is beyond question. How is this power exercised <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> An application has to be made to a Judge, who is impartial, and who has no reason to be guided by any other consideration than the requirements of justice. He has both sides before him - the view of the prisoner, and the view of the prosecutor. After hearing both, and with all the evidence before him, he decides. The honorable senator will see that his objections are more in regard to the way in which the power is exercised, than as to the existence of the power. The power should be exercised in public, subject to public comment ; and I think in those cases where any injustice has been done - there are very few of them, if any - it is easy to judge after the event that the best was done that could have been done, under the circumstances under which the order was made. To make the clause more clear I move - </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> two questions in regard to this clause. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> not think that, supposing a judgment of a State Court in Federal jurisdiction is appealed against to the Full Court of the State, and the decision is confirmed, and a further appeal is ma'de to the High Court, security ought to be given <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I see that the Judges of the High Court have power to order security ; but it appears to me that under the circumstances we ought to provide that security shall be given. The sum of £50 appears to me to be rather too low in view of the fact that the Order - in - Council regulating appeals to the Privy Council fixes the security at £200. Under the circumstances the security ought to be made £100, because, in many instances, an appeal to the High Court will be not less expensive than an appeal to the Privy Council. We can hardly expect leaders of the Bar to travel perhaps 1,000 miles from one State to another without charging a tolerably big fee, and, although such legal assistance may be regarded by some as a luxury, it might to some extent be justified. "We ought not to pretend to litigants that security will be given if the amount does not bear some relation to what the actual costs of the appeal will be. </para>

                        <para>- It is right that there should be an option to order security, because there are many cases in which <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> make such an order would be a farce. Where the party appellant is the Commonwealth or the State, or a banking company, or other institution which is notoriously well off, it would be absurd to ask for security, and, therefore, there ought to be an option. In any case where security is wanted it will be ordered ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will see that the security must be given, in such manner as is prescribed by the rules, the amount, unless otherwise ordered by the High Court or a Judge, being £50. That gives power to the High Court to order any security which is necessary and adequate, and it is only when no order is made that the amount will be £50. </para>

                            <para>- If so, then £50 is not a bit too low. One of the advantages we all hope from the High Court is that it will make appeals much more reasonable in cost and accessible to ordinary people. What has made Privy Council appeals impossible to many litigants is the large amount of security demanded. It is fixed, I believe, at £200 at the least. </para>

                        <para>- My disposition would be to amend the clause in quite a different direction to that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> As I understand the position, there are three classes of appeals established by' this Bill. First, there are appeals from the Supreme Court of a State to the High Court instead of to the Privy Council; secondly, there are appeals from Federal Justices to the High Court ; and thirdly, there are alternative appeals to the High Court or to the Privy Council. Except in one of those three classes of cases, mo security is now required. The effect of this Bill, which ought really to facilitate appeals, seems to be somewhat to curtail them. While now a litigant may pass directly from an inferior court to a Supreme Court without any security, and while we have a High Court Bill passed for the purpose of enabling a litigant to make a choice »nd go to the High Court, under this clause he may be debarred, by an order for security,' from going to the High Court. That is one objection I have to the clause, and another objection is in reference to the second class of case3 in which a litigant may go to the High Court direct from a Federal J Justice In nine cases out of ten, the matters with which Federal Justices may deal will be exactly the same as those dealt with by a Judge in nisi <inline font-style="italic">prius.</inline> A litigant may go from a Judge in <inline font-style="italic">nisi</inline><inline font-style="italic">prius</inline> to the Supreme Court without any security, but he cannot go from a Judge in <inline font-style="italic">nisi</inline><inline font-style="italic">prius,</inline> exercising Federal jurisdiction, to the High Court, which is on a parity with the Supreme Court, without giving security. The third class of case is where the litigant may go from a Supreme Court to the High Court instead of to the Privy Council, and it is here, and here only, that I think security for costs should be required. There should be security for costs in going to the High Court only in cases where now security must be given for costs when appeal is made to the Privy Council. </para>

                            <para>- The view I am now putting - although my sentiments are not always in this direction - is in favour of a poor man who has no money. One of the advantages of the High Court should be to prevent rich litigants from compelling poor men to settle or abandon actions by wearing them out by appeals from one Court to another. That is what I want to avoid as much as possible ; but the clause as it stands certainly - additionally hampers the poor man. If the intention of the High Court Bill is to make, in reference to the inferior courts, the High Court substitutionary for the Supreme Court, it ought to be as easy to go to the High Court from an inferior court as it is to go to the Supreme Court. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I may make myself clearer by stating the position in another way. When a Police Court, which, is the lowest court, is dealing with Federal matters, those matters are identically the same as State matters, except that their source is the Commonwealth Parliament. If the Police Court is dealing with matters, the source of which is the State Parliament, an appeal may be made at once to the Supreme Court without any impediment. But if the same Police Court is dealing with matters which have a Commonwealth source, appeal to the High Court may be prevented - although the High Court is the only Court open - because security for costs may be asked. </para>

                            <para>- But there is a liability to that order, which there is not in the other cases. Now we come to the next Court presided over by a single Judge exercising <inline font-style="italic">nisi</inline><inline font-style="italic">prius</inline> jurisdiction - that is jurisdiction in the first instance. Where such a Court is dealing with a matter which has a State source, appeal may be made to the Supreme Court without any impediment. But where such a Court is dealing with an incidental matter which, however, has a Commonwealth source, appeal to the' High Court, although it is the only Court open, may be prevented by an order for security. These are the two classes of cases which are put in a worse position by this clause, instead of, as intended by the Bill, being placed in a better position. In regard to the third class of cases, in which a litigant may go direct from the Full Court of a State to the Privy Council, security for costs has always had to be given ; and a litigant ought 1o be made to give security when he substitutes the High Court for the Privy Council. </para>

                            <para>- The question is - Are there cases in which justice can be done only by making such an order ? I say that there are such cases. An appeal from a Police Court or County Court in the same State is on an altogether different footing. Where is the High Court going to sit? A man may got a verdict in Bockhampton, </para>

                    </interjection><para>Bay, and he may be either a poor man or a rich man - I do not want to discuss "the matter from that point of view. If the unsuccessful party in the suit desires to remove the case, say, to Sydney, Melbourne, or some other centre, why should the party who has got the verdict be dragged all that distance, when he is certain to succeed, unless security for costs be given ? If it be a case in which there is no necessity to order security, no order will be made. If an appeal be made, for instance, from an -inferior court in Victoria to the High Court in the same State, there will be no necessity for security for costs, because there will be' only the legal charges which may not be very large. - But where a litigant has to travel, and perhaps take his legal adviser with him from one end of Australia to the other, why should there not be power to order security for costs <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> were carried out, it would take away from the Court all power of adjusting the balance in cases of the kind I have indicated. We all ' know that thera&gt; are many cases in which a verdict is given against a man, from whom it is perfectly obvious money is due ; but he may not be able to pay, and desires delay. Such a man. may appeal from one court to another, and when the end comes it is found that he has no money, and he goes into the Insolvency Court. That is . the other side of the picture. We may always lie sure that a; Judge who is perfectly impartial, andl simply desires to see justice done, will be able to decide as to the cases in which security for costs ought to be ordered.' The only cases in which security will be required are cases in regard to Supreme Court decisions, where there was at the establishment of the Commonwealth an appeal to the' Queen in Council. In those cases where security was given before* that is to say, cases involving certain subjects of jurisdiction and large amounts, it is only right that there should be an appeal given as there was 'before. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> admits that there is no reason why it should not be so in these cases. I hope I have satisfied the honorable and learned senator that in other cases where it is fair and right that there should be no security demanded, none will be demanded. </para><para>

                        (Western Australia). - I am somewhat converted by my honorable and learned friend in reference to one of the' points I have raised. I am quite right in saying that in a case now tried by a Judge of the first instance sitting in Victoria, either of the litigants can go to the Full Court of Victoria without giving any security for costs, and without being liable to any security for costs under ' any order. With precisely the same contract and parties, but having regard to the fact that one of the parties happens to live across the border, it becomes a High Court matter,: and then, though it is dealt with by the Judge of the first instance in identically the same. way as if one of the parties did ' not live across the border, if a party desires to take the case to the High Court he is liable to an order for security for costs. While that is true, the answer to it is one to which I can give no reply. It is that, even at the present time, if we take an action against a person outside the jurisdiction of our Court, we' must give security. In the third case I . put,. I will remind honorable senators that by clause 40 of the Judiciary Bill, paragraph (b), we provide that -

We do not make it by any means as easy of access if we place ah order of a Judge as an obstacle on the road to the High Court. To make our scheme symmetrica], I think the order should be banished in this case; but I am not inclined to press it, for the reason that where a litigant looking ahead is told that he can go either to the High Court or to the Supreme Court of the State, he may decide to go to the Supreme Courts and this provision will, therefore, have the effect of diverting to the High Court only those classes of appeals in which some real principle is involved - in which cases' no obstacle would be placed in the way - or where there is money on both sides, and an order for security for costs will not act as aft impediment. This may prove to be a desirable differentiation, since it may tend to keep in the States Courts poor persons who are parties to oases in which questions of im portance are sot involved, or in which small amounts are involved, and in other cases the obstacle will not be found to be insurmountable. </para><para>Clause agreed to. </para><para>Clauses' 36 to 39 agreed to. </para><para>Schedule verbally amended and agreed to. </para><para>Bill reported with amendments. </para></speech>
