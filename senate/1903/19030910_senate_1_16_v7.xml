                (Tasmania). - There is no excuse for allowing this Bill to leave our hands unless it is in a somewhat perfect condition. With all respect to the military authorities and other persons who have been concerned in its preparation, I think it contains one very radical defect. I take it that the training for our military system should be like the training of a boy for the battle of life. Education has been described as a ladder. We all know the consequences which ensue when one or two rungs of the ladder are absent or weak. In the States Government after Government have not only directed their attention to primary education, but have dealt elaborately with secondary education. We all know that the educational system of each State is a ladder by which boys may rise in life. Has that principle been applied to this Bill ? I think not. This clause provides for a voluntary system of military and naval cadets. Ten or seventy per cent, of the boys in a school might join the cadet corps, and the others might not. The movement might be proceeding with all rapidity at one moment, and languishing at another moment. To neglect the training of our boys between the ages of twelve and eighteen years - the latter being the age at which a youth generally becomes a volunteer or a militiaman - is a very great mistake. We all know that in another place a heroic effort was made to establish a system of compulsory drill for young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years. Although we might only ask these youths to drill thirty -two times a year, and to present themselves fourteen times a year for continuous drill in camp, still it would make a considerable demand on their time. It appears to me also that we should be dealing with our raw material a little too late in life. If we are to have any system of compulsory drill do not let it be given to the young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years, but let it follow closely upon the training which they have received in the cadet corps in the schools. Let us deal with the boys between the ages of fourteen and seventeen years. If this rung is absent from the ladder, the Bill will be passed in a most imperfect form. It reminds me of a cartoon in
                <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline>
                which was suggested by a quotation from the
                <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline>
                - &#34; The War Office must be put on a business like footing.&#34; It represented the furniture in the War Office upside-down, and the papers strewn about the room, with General Muddle holding up his hands in horror and saying - &#34; Put the War Office on a business footing ! Begad, has it come to this at last?&#34; The Military and Naval Defence of the Commonwealth should be dealt with in the same way as a man deals with his own affairs. We should see that some efficient training is given to the boys from the age of twelve years up to the age of seventeen years, when they will be in a position to judge for themselves.
            </para>
            <para>I propose to move that this clause be postponed, with the understanding that, if postponed, the Minister -will prepare, with the assistance of his experts, a provision for the compulsory training of these cadets. Is it not absolutely necessary to teach our boys the use of the rifle, so that they may he able by-and-by to perform their duties as citizens, in defending the Commonwealth? Although we are providing in this Bill for a force of 900,000 men, which can be called out to defend our shores, yet we do not find any provision in it for teaching our boys the use of the rifle. I desire to express my utter astonishment that, after all the talk in the press and from the Labour Party on the subject of a citizen soldiery, this Bill does not contain one little provision which would give us that force automatically, for all time to come. </para>

                    <para>- I am more anxious about the military than the naval cadets, because it is so easy to drill a boy and to teach him the use of the rifle. It is not quite so easy to put thousands of youths on a war-ship and teach them naval duties. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> that my suggestion ought to apply to both naval and military cadets. Whenever the word compulsion is used, conscription is at once suggested. But there is just as much difference between conscription in Prance and Germany and the system I suggest, as there is between a blood horse and a half- starved donkey. This system would only be compulsory until the boys arrived at man&#39;s estate. I should like to know what the Germans would think of our Bill in its present form. If we are losing relatively in the race with Germany it is owing to the superiority of its educational system, combined with thoroughness. 1 desire to steer quite clear of ite wretched system, under which a man is dragged away from his home, hi? business, or his trade, to serve for three years in the army. Switzerland furnishes an object-lesson to us. The cost of its army is less than that of any army that I know of. I shall quote a passage from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vincent&#39;s</inline> book, <inline font-style="italic">Government in Switzerland -</inline></para>
                </talk.start>
            </continue>
            <para>In Switzerland a standing army has never been a recognised institution. ... On the other hand, every citizen is liable to military duty, and the Federal Government makes the regulations under which he serves, establishes the system of . instruction, drill, clothing, form of weapon, the formation of divisions, and in time of war takes exclusive command. . . . The organization of the Federal Army is carried out with elaborate exactness. As stated above, every able-bodied citizen not otherwise engaged in specified Government service must be enrolled in the militia, and continues in some form to the age of fifty a part of the national defence. For this purpose the quarters are divided into three general sections, according to the age of the men composing them. On coming of age every young man is entered on. the list of recruits, and if after medical examination he is found available, is sent to one of the schools of instruction for about six weeks of his. first year . . . Education for military duties begins in reality when a boy has reached his tenth year ; for gymnastic training under competent teachers is obligatory on all sound youths, whether attending school or not, until fifteen years of age. </para>
            <para>So that honorable senators will see that all citizens have military gymnastics and training to fit them for a soldier&#39;s life hereafter. This takes place between the ages of ten and fifteen. All I desire to provide is that such military training shall be given between the ages of twelve and fifteen, or such other ages as the Committee may prefer. </para>
            <para>The method and scope of instruction is carefully presented by Federal law, and is carried out by the cantonal administrations. In 1806, all but about 10 per cent, of school children were taught military gymnastics. Thus, without maintaining a large standing army, great care is taken in the instruction and exercise of the militia, a record being kept of every available man and where he-, may be found, so that when troops are wanted they may be instantly called together. </para>
            <para class="block">I would specially call attention to this - </para>
            <para>Yet, after all, the mainstay of the Swiss Republic will be the sturdy patriotism which has been for centuries the bulwark of its liberties. It is the judgment of competent observers that the soldier of Switzerland is particularly gifted with that spirit which makes all the difference between a fighting machine and a man at war. It is hoped that no occasion will occur for its displa}&#39;; but when the time arrives, this robust love of country, infused through citizens in arms, will make a -small force great. </para>
            <para class="block">That passage describes the system under which in Switzerland every boy is taught to take a part in the defence of his country. They commence with boys of ten, and train them until they are fifteen ; and then, again, at the age of twenty, the youths, join the militia, and engage in certain drills and training. The objections made to this system, are, first of all, that it savours of conscription. I have dealt with that. I do not desire to bear it said that the system, which I advocate would mean interfering with the genius of the nation. I understand that it is the genius of the English people to be practical, common-sense, and business-like. All I ask is that this Bill should be framed on those principles. The next objection I expect to hear is that of the expense. We are told that there are in Australia 108,000 men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. I suppose that the number of boys between the ages of fourteen and sixteen would be greater than that. But there is no occasion to buy 108,000 rifles in order that one may be placed at the disposal of every cadet.. I take it that under regulations it could be prescribed that the boys in their tender years should not deal with the rifle at all. Afterwards, a few rifles could be supplied to them in order that they might learn to use that weapon ; and when they became members of the senior cadet corps they would be taught to shoot. If any objection is raised on the score of expense I would ask honorable senators to consider whether they want our defence expenditure to be applied to the foundation of our military system, or to leave that in a rotten and inefficient state, and apply the expenditure to the top of the tree. To draft a clause would be to some extent a difficult matter. There would need to be a conference of experts. I am perfectly &#39;prepared to draft a clause, but it might involve the recasting of several other clauses. I suggest that the necessary clause should be prepared by the draftsman, who is familiar with all the provisions of the measure. I would also point out that the cost can to a large extent be minimized. The boys need not all be drilled at the same moment, and there could be travelling inspectors and instructors to look after their training. I am quite certain that in some way or another we ought to insist that our boys at school shall be drilled, and I am absolutely certain that when they reach the age of fourteen years, and leave school, their training will have been wasted unless there are some means of continuing it. A few join the militia, but the rest simply become part of the. 900,000 odd people who are to be called out if ever a time of danger arrives. I am satisfied that nineteen-twentieths&#39; of those who will be called out under those circumstances, will be ill-equipped for a contest. Is that right, fair, and just to ourselves ? Is it doing justice to the citizens of the Commonwealth, or to the object which this Bill is introduced to promote? The measure has been before Parliament for nearly three years, and has had devoted to it an enormous amount of thought and ability. I feel very strongly upon the point, and hope that the Minister will give me a sympathetic reply. If he does not, I trust that honorable senators will express plainly what they think, and riot be driven away from the point by any bogy of conscription. They should insist on the young people of Australia being trained to defend the Commonwealth just as they are trained to read and write, so that they may become valuable citizens of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I can certainly give the honorable senator a sympathetic reply. I am glad to find him bringing the matter forward. I have no doubt that there is in his proposal the germ of a very good idea which in the future will be carried out. But the honorable and learned senator has done wisely in saying that he proposes simply to move the postponement of the clause under consideration, with a view of allowing some one else to give effect to his desire. He will see on consideration that the difficulties in the way are in a different direction altogether from those which he has pointed out. He has referred to Switzerland. In that country, I believe I am right in saying, the population is closely settled, and the educational system is in the hands of the central Government. Where that is the case, it is comparatively easy to insist upon military service. The Government have only to put that subject into the educational curriculum. By the machinery which they control, they can impart military drill and training. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out the impossibility of providing for every child having some military education. As the voluntary system, to which the honorable and learned senator can have no objection, is embodied in the Bill, it will provide a means whereby children of the ages of from twelve years upwards can have some amount of drill, and they can be senior cadets from the ages of fourteen to nineteen. It just overlaps the period of enlistment for men of the Defence Force, and we make provision for military training from twelve years, until those being trained are of full military age. The scheme of the Bill is this, and I do not know how; we can go further at the present time : that while we recognise that we should do all that we possibly can to provide for these corps, and everything necessary for the training of children, we do not take the step which we believe would interfere with the work of education undertaken by the various States, of making this training absolutely compulsory. Under the voluntary system, efficient cadet corps have grown up in the States, and good progress has been made with the movement. I have not had as much time as I should have liked to inquire into the matter, but it is one in which I take a very deep interest, and I hope, when I have a little spare time, to be able to investigate it thoroughly, and to discover how the movement is progressing throughout the States. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that since the movement was initiated good progress has been made, and that in most of the States cadet corps are to be found in a fairly satisfactory condition. I hope the movement will be continued, and that the present condition of the corps, though satisfactory, will be very much improved, and the system expanded. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> not to press his proposal to make the system compulsory. </para>

                            - I desire to raise the point of order whether it is competent for us to include the present clause in this Bill. I think that its inclusion is outside the four corners of the Constitution, which distinctly provides that education is not one of the subjects with which we can deal. The clause before the Committee provides for the training of cadet corps, and these cadet corps are clearly no portion of the Defence Force. This clause has nothing to do with the defence of the Commonwealth, but simply -with the question of education and training, and whether the education be military or classical, in my opinion, does not matter.

                        <para>-Col. Neild. - The Constitution does not grant to the Federal Parliament any right of interference in the subject of education. My second point is that the clause deals with education and not with defence, inasmuch as the cadet corps are not part of the Defence Force, which has been defined in the preceding clauses. The Defence Force is defined in this Bill under Part III., and it consists of permanent forces, militia forces, volunteer forces, and reserves, including rifle clubs. There is absolutely no line or phrase in this Bill, as it is before the Committee, which can possibly include cadets in the Defence Force. </para>

                            - That may. be so ; but that does not happen to be provided for by this Bill. I am not dealing with what we can do, but with the Bill as it is before the Committee. I submit that clause 60, now under consideration, distinctly deals with the training of youths, and that is education, and not military service. There is no pretension that it is military service. It is not pretended that these cadets are to be part of the military service, and being simply an aggregation of youths for purposes of education, the provision, in my opinion, is in conflict with the Constitution, which does not empower us to interfere in the subject of education. I ask for the ruling of the Chairman on the point, and I hope I shall not be trespassing upon any rule if I indicate that if he should be against me, I consider the question of so much importance that I think it might be desirable to have the opinion of the President, who is a constitutional lawyer.

                        <para>- I do not think so. There is a great difference between a training for educational purposes, no matter what the ultimate end of the training may be, and the enrolment of persons for naval and military service. There being no pretence that clause 60 provides that these&#39; cadet corps are to be members of the Defence Force, it is clear that it is merely a provision for bringing youths together for purposes of education, and that is a subject with which the Commonwealth Parliament is not, under the Constitution, competent to deal. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that any difficulty can possibly arise in this connexion. This is a Bill to provide for the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth, and although the composition of the Defence Force is described in the Bill, the description is not exhaustive. There is no reason why, for the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth, we should not have a Defence Force such as is described in this Bill, and cadet corps as well. The cadet corps are not included in the Defence Force, technically speaking, but there is no reason why we should not have a force of cadets for assistance in the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth. 10 g z </para>

                        <para>- It is true that they may not be called out. But they are there in preparation for the time when they may be required. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has in any way proved his contention that the training of cadets is education in the ordinary sense of the word. There is nothing in the Constitution that I know of with regard to education, except that it is not included in the powers given to the Commonwealth Parliament under section 51. Education, in the sense in which the term is used, clearly means the ordinary primary education carried on by the different States. My contention is that there is nothing whatever in the Constitution to prevent the inclusion of this clause in the Bill. </para>

The expression &#34;naval and military defence &#34; will cover anything which might come under that head, and there can be no military or naval defence without education. That is a portion of defence. I hope the Chairman will not sustain the objection taken. </para>

                        <para>- I point out that if we include in this clause 60 such provisions as have been indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to be the subject of an amendment he intends to move later on, obviously the intention will be to train these cadets for no other purpose than to be ultimately utilized for the defence of the Commonwealth. That &#39;being the ultimate object of the honorable and learned senator&#39;s intended amendment, we come to the consideration of the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> on this point of order. The honorable senator says that the&#39; matter of education is reserved solely for the States; but I remind him that the control of the railways is still left to the States, and, in spite of that fact, under section 17 of the Post and Telegraph Act, which we passed in 1901, and in connexion with which this or a cognate question was discussed, we provided that &#34; the principal railway official of every State, or the owner, controller, or manager of any railway or tramway in any State shall carry mails upon any railway or tramway under his control if required to do so by the Postmaster-General.&#34; At the time that section of the Post and Telegraph Act was before us, I raised the question whether it was competent for us to legislate in such a way as to make mandatory a provision of that character and so impose a duty upon a- State Rail way Department still under the control of the State. After considerable argument on both sides, the Committee of the Senate agreed that it was competent for us to do so. If we are satisfied that the object of the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has in view is to educate these cadets for the purpose of ultimately being of service for the defence of the Commonwealth, the question of our competency to legislate in such a way as to impose upon the States the obligation of so training them, has, to my mind, been settled by the attitude we have already taken with respect to the Railway Departments of the different States under the Post and Telegraph Act. It will, I think, be admitted that we have full powers under the general provisions of section 51 of the Constitution to legislate in such a way as to throw upon the States the responsibility of fulfilling the obligations created by our legislation in the interests of the&#39; Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The instance cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> with regard to the postal service is scarcely on all-fours with the difficulty raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> on this point of order. We have the power, under the Constitution, not only to deal with postal, telegraphic, and telephonic, and other like services, but to make laws which are incidentally necessary for the execution of any power vested by the Constitution in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. In dealing with the postal service, it became necessary that the Commonwealth should provide&#39; for an efficient service. Therefore we made provision, under subsection 39 of section 51 of the Constitution, to compel the Railway Departments of the States to carry mails. But the Railway Departments of the States were to be paid for the service they rendered, and it was incidental to the execution of the powers vested in us to deal with the Post and Telegraph Service that we should, to a certain extent, have the power to control the railways, which were the most important means of communication. </para>

                        <para>- I say that these incidental powers were necessarily availed of in order to carry out efficiently the postal service of the country. It is not disputed that the Commonwealth has power to legislate for the defence of the country. It is part of our duty, and we are now attempting that legislation. The question raised is not so much, whether this is a matter of education, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, but whether it is necessary that we should provide cadet corps as a matter incidental to the execution of the power invested in us to provide for the defence of the Commonwealth. The Bill provides for the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth, but under it, the establishment of cadet corps forms no part of the naval or military defence of the Commonwealth, for the reason that there is no obligation imposed upon the cadets to be available for service in time of war, when it becomes necessary to call out our armed forces. </para>

A man may be liable for service by virtue of. his citizenship,&#39; but not by virtue of his being a member of a cadet corps. We propose here the establishment of cadet corps of boys over twelve years, attending school, and lads between fourteen and nineteen, not attending school.

                        <para>- Yes. The point I take is, that while we provide for the training of cadets, we provide in no way whatever, for making use of their services as a part of the Defence Force in time of war. These boys, as cadets, cannot be called upon to serve under the Colours. We do not provide, for instance, that they may be called out under any clause in the Bill, as ordinary citizens may be. They may not be willed upon for service as cadets ; and I therefore submit that the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is correct, and that this clause dealing with cadets is not properly included in the Bill. Honorable senators may say that we can enlarge the Bill, and by providing that cadets shall be liable to service, we may make them part of the Defence Force ; but that is not provided for in the Bill as it stands, and it would be regarded as altogether outside the ordinary scope of defence to render boys from twelve to fourteen years of age liable to service.&#39; While taking this .view of the point of order, I do not desire that honorable senators should misunderstand my attitude upon the cadet system generally. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0&#39;Keefe</inline> will keep as closely to the question as 1 have done. I submit that the point of order is justified. The cadet corps form no portion of the Defence Force of the Commonwealth, although cadets under this Bill may, when they arrive at a certain -age, be liable for service just as any other citizen is liable. I do not go so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in suggesting that the training of cadets would be an interference with the duty of public instruction, which is left  entirely to the States under the Constitution ; but I do agree with the honorable senator that as it stands at the present time the establishment of cadet corps under this clause does not come within the purview of this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in the contention he raises that the clause dealing with cadets, is outside the scope of this Bill, as indicated by its title. This is a Bill to provide for the naval and military defence, and protection of the Commonwealth, and the Defence Force is clearly defined in clause 29. It is to consist of the military and naval forces of the Commonwealth, which are divided into two branches. The cadets form no part of either of those branches. It is therefore clear that the provision for cadets is outside the scope of the Bill. It is, however, a .very easy matter to remedy. All that we have to do is to insert some allusion to the organization of cadet corps . in the title, and so make provision for clause 60. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I can understand, the matter is amply covered by authority. I glanced over the authorities when the question of the Federal Government stopping the letters to Tattersail&#39;s was under discussion, in order to see whether we were interfering with States rights, and I ascertained that if a power is given to a Federation, the Government has ample authority to do anything that is necessary to enforce that power. I met with instances where, in order to carry out some power which was committed to the Federation, the Government ordered a State policeman to help them, and it was held that they had a perfect right to do so. Here we are dealing with the naval and military defences of the Commonwealth. Every power consistent with providing for that defence is committed to the Federal Government. We have power to call out 900,000 odd citizens of Australia, including the old men ; and is it to be contended that we have absolutely no power to insist that boys between the ages of fourteen and seventeen shall be trained in order that they may carry out the very objects which this Bill is introduced to insure <inline font-style="italic">1</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> says that the cadet forces are not a part of the Defence Force provided for under the Bill.

Surely those objects embrace the possibility of training boys in military work, so that when they reach the age of eighteen or nineteen they can efficiently discharge the duties they may be called upon to undertake. And even if there is any serious objection to the title of the Bill as .not being in itself sufficiently comprehensive, honorable senators will know that the title is completely subordinate to the clauses of the Bill. The very object of postponing the title until the clauses are passed is to make it conform to those clauses. Moreover, as honorable senators are aware, the second reading of the Bill has already been carried, and its scope and objects embrace, among other things, this provision for the training of cadet corps. Therefore, I think that the clause is rightly and constitutionally inserted, and I overrule the objection which has been taken. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand the reason why any honorable senator should wish to prevent me from giving very important information to the Committee. The Minister said that he would make inquiries about the question of the cadets, but he understood that the movement was progressing favorably. In New South Wales there are eighty-nine cadets under the Military Department, and, for all I know to the contrary, there may be thousands of cadets under the Education Department -over which we have no control. In Victoria there are 4,150 cadets under the Military Department. In fact, all the -cadets are under that Department. In Queensland and Tasmania there are a considerable number of cadets under the Military Department. In South Australia all the cadets are under the Education Department. The movement needs to be inquired into and placed on a business footing. I believe the Minister will find that it is in a state of chaos. I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> for giving me the opportunity to furnish this information. </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry that so much time has been taken up in discussing points of order, because otherwise we should have ended this discussion. I am very glad, sir, that your ruling enables us to discuss the merits of this proposal. We are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> for having originated this discussion. Broadly speaking, I am very much in favour of the principle of having cadet corps. Whether it will be possible for the Minister, with the advice of his colleagues and his experts, to formulate a scheme which will be found workable, I cannot pretend to say, but I do not see why it should not be done. We have heard a great deal about the kind of defence which is likely to be of most use to Australia if it should ever be involved in trouble. Those statements have been based upon a knowledge of what took place in South Africa. It was the very expertness of the Boers in the use of the rifle which led to the prolongation of the war. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> seems to go to the very root of rifle shooting in Australia. If his proposal could be carried out, the cadets would be given a certain amount of drill, and be taught the use of the rifle. How many persons in Australia over the age of eighteen years could hit a haystack at a distance of 500 yards, much less a man? How great is the number of men who have even the most elementary knowledge of the use of the rifle ? It is very limited indeed. We have decided to depend upon a citizen force for the defence of the Commonwealth. We have agreed that rifle clubs shall constitute the chief portion of that force. What is the use of our deciding to depend upon a citizen force, and the efficiency of Australians in the use of the rifle, if we do not inculcate in the boys a desire to learn the use of the rifle? I hope it will be found possible by the Minister for Defence to take some step in that direction. Some time ago I heard Colonel Templeton, who is regarded in Victoria as a military expert, make the remark that it takes as much money to maintain three men in the permanent military force as would provide for eighty-four members of rifle clubs. If that statement is correct, it confirms me in the belief which I have always held and expressed - that we ought to teach young Australians to be efficient in the use of the rifle, and to make the members of rifle clubs in as large a proportion as possible members of our Defence Force. I believe the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will tend to inculcate in our boys a desire to learn the use of the rifle, and to acquire the necessary drill. I submit that the question is worthy of our serious consideration. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">SenatorPLA YFORD (South Australia).There is no doubt that this proposal is worthy of our very serious consideration, because it involves the old question whether the system should be compulsory or voluntary. For a long time I have been in favour of a compulsory system all round. I do not believe in compulsion for the boys alone. I believe in the Swiss system, under which a person commences as a boy and ends as an exceedingly old man. I contend that compulsion is the correct system to adopt, if we intend to provide a Defence Force of the best possible character. In South Australia, when the Right Honorable Charles Kingston was my Attorney-General, we prepared a Bill, but the people were not prepared for compulsion, and I doubt whether the people throughout the States are prepared for compulsion. It would be a great mistake to attempt to force upon the people a compulsory system, when they are not prepared for its adoption. When we found that the feeling in South Australia was so strongly against the compulsory principle we abandoned our Bill - and very properly so, too. I am certainly not in favour of the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> If we compelled the children in the States schools to attend a certain number of drills, we should interfere with State rights in the matter of education, and cause <inline font-style="italic">&#38;ny</inline> amount of trouble and friction. The States are now looking with very jealous eyes at the action of this Parliament in interfering with their rights. The States are exceedingly jealous of their rights, and our policy should be to give no cause of complaint. We should give cause of complaint at once if we were to compel the children in the States schools to devote a certain amount of time to drill - during school hours, I suppose. I believe that the system which the Government have submitted in their Bill is the correct one to adopt. In South Australia we have a good many cadets, although not under military control, who are being fitted for performing the duties of citizen soldiers in later years I understand that in Victoria there are a considerable number of cadets under military control. In New South Wales there are exceedingly few cadets under military control, but that does not suggest that they have not many cadets under the Education Department. I am exceedingly glad to notice how the boys rejoice in the training which is given to them, and with what pride they march through the, streets to the music of their little fife and drum bands. They are receiving a certain amount of. training which will be useful by-and-by to the Commonwealth. I believe that eventually the people of the Commonwealth will be ripe for a system of compulsory training all round. I hold that it is the duty of every man to fit himself to defend his hearth and home, and to undergo a certain amount of training every -year. Eoi&#39; the reasons I have given, I shall oppose the postponement of the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I rise with much diffidence to .address the Committee, particularly after having listened to the excellent speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> which breathed a pure patriotism. I desire to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> for having brought forward this question. In listening to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> I was reminded of the old proverb, that it is of no use to attempt to teach old dogs new tricks. The desire of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is to teach the pups the tricks that we wish them to know, so as- to be of some use in defending our hearths and homes by-and-by. The Minister for Defence has raised a serious, objection to the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> but I submit that where State rights are not being unduly infringed, and where the national requirements are so* vital, too much prominence should not be given to that point in the discussion.. The question that of course is involved is one of vital importance to the community. We are at the parting of the ways now, and should start with a system whereby may be built up such a system of defence as has been found by recent experience to be necessary. In every hamlet in England men are being trained for the defence of the country.. Every- able-bodied man and boy is being taught to handle a rifle effectively. I cannot help saying, with due deference to the Minister, that we have before us a very unsatisfactory proposal. If I had not known the indifference of some of the States in regard to military affairs, and to the cadet movement in particular, I should not lay any stress upon the point. But we have to bring the whole Commonwealth into line, and to make our youth able to. take their proper part as citizens. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> cannot propose an amendment embodying the views which he has expressed, I hope the clause will be postponed so as to give the Minister an opportunity to reconsider the point. It is of such vital importance that a start should be made at. once upon a sound foundation. If I were to talk for an hour I could not express, myself more strongly. I am bound to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in his endeavour to make an initial movement on the lines he has indicated. Without occupying any more time, I state that his proposal has my most cordial support. </para>

Consequently he was quite relevant in the matter which he introduced. Nothing has been brought forward in this debate that has not been immediately relevant to the clause. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that you should have misunderstood me, because ic never occurred to me that any&#34;thing which has taken place was not strictly parliamentary. If I had been allowed to &#34;finish my sentence you would have found that that was what I was about to say. A particular procedure may be strictly in accordance with parliamentary custom, and <inline font-style="italic">yet</inline> may lead to a greater expenditure of time than if it were dealt within another parliamentary form. All that I was going to suggest was that it would be desirable for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to submit some definite proposal which when submitted from the Chair would lead to a definite vote being given. All that we have now before us is a suggestion, and we are discussing that suggestion with apparently no possibility of coming to -any final decision. I had not the remotest idea of reflecting upon the manner in which &#34;the business is being conducted. Such a thing never occurred to my mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> read some figures, and having heard his explanation that the New South Wales figures only related to the cadets under military authority, I think that he has given une a text from&#39; which I must preach a brief homily in opposition to what he has indicated that he desires to do. In New South Wales there are less than one hundred cadets under the authority of the Defence Department, but as ray honorable and learned friend admits there are thousands who are not subject to that authority. To-day the State from which I come is clothing, training, and drilling these cadets. The adjutant for volunteers in New South Wales is a gentleman who wears the medal of the Distinguished Service Order for service in South Africa, and the Colonel wears a foreign service medal. </para>

                        <para>- Perfectly right. I entirely agree with my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson-</inline> and I have made my views known from the platform, in the press, and in this Chamber - that it is a most shocking waste of public money to train cadets up to fourteen years of age and then turn them loose to waste four years. They forget all they have learned in that time, between when they cease to be cadets and when they can become members of the regular forces. I quite agree that something should be done to bridge over that four year3. That is done under the clause before us, which provides that youths may remain cadets to the age of nineteen years. That prevents any necessity for a break between the time when a youth leaves his cadet corps, and when he can join one of the ordinary volunteer regiments. I am entirely at one with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> with regard to that point. In New South Wales the State is paying large sums for the training of school cadets. I do not see how I can come here representing a State that is doing that, and assist in passing a clause which would take this power out of hands of the State, and substitute compulsory Commonwealth service. This is a matter which in my opinion can only be accomplished satisfactorily by negotiation between the Commonwealth and States authorities. </para>

                        <para>- If- the honorable and learned senator will be kind enough to give us a tangible proposal which we can discuss, we shall know what it is that he really proposes. But the moment we answer him on one point he starts another &#34; side show.&#34; I cannot run a discourse on those lines. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that however valuable it may be to have compulsory service, it is not possible in Australia. As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> I think that his enthusiasm for the service of which he is so distinguished an ornament, rather led him into a phrase of speech which is calculated to mislead. He seemed to indicate that there was such a thing as compulsory service in England. He did not actually say so, but it was implied in the phrase &#39;which he used. I am sure that many persons reading his speech would, knowing his authority in the military world, be inclined to think that there was some sort of compulsory military service in the old country. There is nothing of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- I have got the Militia Act here, and if the honorable senator looks through it he will find that even in the militia there is practically voluntary service. But there is another reason why I must be in opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> idea. Up to a certain point it is absolutely on all fours with the proposal which was submitted in another place, not by a &#34; crusted old Tory &#34; - I am quoting a friendly phrase which has sometimes been applied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> himself - nor by a person of Conservative instincts, but by a member of the Labour Party. But it was hopelessly defeated. </para>

But I am. not going to vote for compulsory service in regard to boys of eighteen or nineteen, when I dare not - or some people dare not - make it compulsory for the same persons when they have votes a couple of years afterwards. A boy of fifteen or sixteen may have a widowed mother to support, or younger brothers and sisters to keep. To compel that boy to give compulsory service for military purposes, which we do not ask a full-grown man and a voter to give, is a policy which any Englishman should be ashamed to support. I quite agree that every able-bodied man should fit himself to take part in the defence of his country. I do my bit of soldiering, and should be glad to see every member of this Senate doing his bit as well. But I am not going to enforce compulsory service on those who are weak, whilst not doing it in the case of those who are strong because they have votes. </para>

                <para class="block">During the debate in another place in. reference to compulsory service for youths just before they reach the voting age, the- argument which I have been advancing was used . in opposition. It was said - &#39;.&#39; You are willing to institute compulsory service for those who have no votes, but you are not game to make the same proposal foithose who have the power of the franchise behind them.&#34; I am in favour of cadet corps. I look upon this clause as a very valuable step in the right direction, inasmuch as it carries on the training of a youth until he is competent to enter the general Defence Forces. I also submit that under this Bill there is ample provision made for the issue of regulations to manage this business, and to carry out all the details. We are making a considerable advance in relation to cadet corps. And here let me say that I think that one of the grandest, features of the Defence Force in Victoria is the senior cadet corps. They are very fine indeed, and I admire them very much. I respect them, and I wish that New South &#34;Wales had her senior cadet corps as well as her junior corps. But when we are making such a step in advance I cannot agree to any attempt to outrage the principle of voluntary service to such an extent as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> proposes. Therefore I shall vote for the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the clause will be passed as it stands. It appeal&#39;s to me that we are trying to do too much, not only in this Bill, but in many other respects. Some persons want to hurry on everything. No freedom is to be left to us. Everything is to be compulsory. The machinery of the Commonwealth is to be exercised to its utmost, and the local authorities are to be left without any authority. What is the argument in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> amendment ? We are told what happens in Switzerland. Where is the analogy between Switzerland and Australia ? Switzerland is&#39; the battle-ground of Europe. The geographical position of that country necessitates the military training of its citizens. But what have we to do with that?&#39; What battle-field have we in the Commonwealth? We are not a military nation, never expect to be, and do not wish to be. We are, I hope, a vigorous people, &#39;and should be able to take care of ourselves in case of need. But- </para>

                <para class="block">*,ny trouble that is likely to come to us will be more likely to come from the sea than the land. It is on the sea that our main fighting will have to be. The Bill goes as far as I can agree to go, and perhaps a little farther. We have had sprung upon us all at once the notion of making military service compulsory throughout the Commonwealth - interfering, with every State, interfering with every parental right, and making a deep-rooted alteration in the present system, involving large expense and waste of time in the education of the children. The boys throughout the Commonwealth are to be provided with rifles. There will be great expense in that. They are to be taught to use the rifles. There will be more expense. The time that ought to be devoted to their education is to be 3pent in learning to shoot, and there will be further expenditure upon ammunition. All this is not necessary for -the defence of a country separated from the rest of the world, for a people who do not wish to be a warlike people, and whose dangers are problematical and remote. My opinion has always been that our principal defence should be upon the sea. At the same time, however, we should not be without police. Though we are a peace-loving people, it -is necessary to have a few constables to prevent offences against the law. But here is a proposal - based upon an analogy with Switzerland, which, from its situation, has to be a military country, and, being poor, has to obtain its military defence at the cheapest possible cost - to make Australia set up machinery on an elaborate scale for defending itself against an enemy who probably will never have to- be encountered. There is no occasion for any such proposal as the one before us. Of course the idea of bringing up our boys so as to make them capable of defending their hearths and homes is not a new one. As a matter of economy, I think it would be well that occasionally a hearth and home should be sacrificed, rather than that we should incur the immense waste of life, time, and labour involved in providing for a contingency so absolutely remote that we may say it can never occur. We must have some economy in this matter. </para>

If my honorable friend asks me the extent to which I would go in the matter of military expenditure, I tell him frankly that I do not know. I am dealing with a concrete proposal - that there should be compulsory military education in the schools ; that the States should incur the expense of supplying rifles and ammunition to all the boys, and of teaching them, and that the proposal which the Government make - and which I think is quite sufficient - should be set aside. From that point of view I am entirely against the suggestion made, and I hope the Bill will be proceeded with. </para>

There is no reason why I should reiterate the arguments already advanced ; but, in common with other honorable senators, I welcome every opportunity which can be afforded to the youth of the. Commonwealth to obtain training in the use of arms, and in discipline. Under a clause of this &#34; character we shall not only be providing for the training of youths who in future may have to become the defenders of the country, but we shall be inculcating habits of discipline, obedience, and respect, which are urgently needed by young Australians. </para>

                        <para>- We shall also be adopting means for promoting their physical development. From time to time complaints are made about the way in which Australian children roam about ; how dead they are to all sense of respect for their seniors, and how difficult they are to control. And it is important to remember that, apart&#39; from the advantages from .the point of view of defence, there is much to&#39; be gained by a military training for boys, which will teach them discipline, obedience, and respect to superiors, and will make good men of them. Boys take kindly to this training, and if honorable senators have ali opportunity of comparing a number of youths serving as cadets in any of the States, with an equal number who have had no such experience, they will have no doubt as to the superiority of the former. No one can doubt the advantage of having a number of youngsters trained so that in after life- they will be capable of defending the community in time of need. But when we come to the practical question of whether this training should be compulsory or purely voluntarily, I say, with all due respect&#34;, to honorable senators who believe in the compulsory system, that it will prove to be a failure if attempted in the Commonwealth of Australia. It will break down, not only because the people of Australia will not accept it, but because of its own inherent weight and unwieldiness, and of the impossibility of carrying out such a system in the Commonwealth. Education has been spread throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. We have, in various States, schools established in remote places, where it will be found to be quite impossible to introduce any system of military training. Speaking of the State from which I come, I know that there are many schools in sparsely populated districts at which the attendance is from ten to twelve or fifteen,, and these schools are many miles apart. It will be impossible to give the children attending these schools a military training. How can we say that the teachers appointed by the States Governments shall fit themselves for military instruction, in order to carry out the desires of the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- In the more sparsely settled districts, five or six children are to be found attending school in one locality, and as many in another, and the States have adopted what are termed the half-time system. These children are so far apart that it would be impossible to bring them together for drill, or for the military training contemplated under a compulsory system. Such a system could only be applied to cities, and the larger towns in which there is a dense population. Under the proposal made by the Government, wherever a sufficient number of pupils can be got together to form a cadet corps, steps will no doubt be taken to have such corps established, if it be found that the expense will not be greater than we can afford to bear. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> is getting on to a side track. The question we have to consider is whether this training of cadets should be compulsory or not. It cannot be supposed that we shall pass an Act which will apply the compulsory system in Victoria and not in New South Wales. The Victorian Government might say that they were prepared to accept the compulsory system, whilst the New South Wales Government might object to it. In that case we should have a different, system operating in different States, and we do not desire that there should be any diversity of that character in the carrying out of our legislation. I say that the difficulty, of expense will be found to be insuperable. Under the volunteer system, we find that boys are only too delighted to go in for training when they have the opportunity. We shall have no necessity to tell boys that they must enter cadet corps, as they will gladly take advantage of the training wherever they can. That is as. much as we can expect at the present time. We know that a compulsory system of any kind is obnoxious to a British community ; whilst if any danger arose every single able-bodied man in a British community would be found ready to respond to the call to arms in defence&#39; of his country. </para>

That is an incident which may be referred to now, and I contend that we shall make a serious mistake if we attempt to adopt this system of compulsion.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    is in favour of compulsion all round. He would compel all men up to the age of fifty to attend drill, and yet he will not swallow the very small dose of compulsion I am suggesting. Though he believes that all adults in the Commonwealth up to fifty or sixty years of age should be compelled to attend drill, he will not support me in the suggestion that schoolboys from fourteen to seventeen years of age should attend a certain number of drills. I cannot congratulate the honorable senator on his consistency.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                    has made a most extraordinary speech, suggesting that while we dare not compel men who have votes to attend drill, we are willing, because these youths have not votes, to put upon them the stigma of compulsion, and drag them to the drill -room. The honorable senator ought to know that we have compulsion in many Departments of the State. I can see no more harm in compelling a boy to drill than I can see in compelling him to learn to read and write to fit himself to become a citizen.

                        <para>- It is part of his duty, as a citizen, to defend the country, and I cannot understand how the honorable senator can draw &#39; a distinction between compelling a boy to read and write and compelling him to learn the use of the rifle, to keep the robber or the foreigner from his door. The honorable senator has suggested that I propose to drag poor little boys to the drill-room, who may have a mother depending upon them. But will he contend that boys should be dragged away from school to help poor mothers by chopping wood or selling matches, and running the risk of growing up in dense ignorance % .The honorable senator&#39;s arguments have astounded me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has told us that the system of compulsion is bound to break down. Why? Are there are not tens of thousands of boys between the ages of thirteen and seventeen running about the streets from morning until night, and are there not large townships in which there are hundreds of boys who could be brought under a system of military training ? Because a few boys in the back-blocks are so far apart that it would be difficult to get them together for military training, the whole system is to be given up, and thousands of boys in the cities and towns are to be left without this very necessary part of a compulsory education. The Minister for Defence has said that there will be the utmost difficulty in carrying out this system in outlying places ; but I do not desire that the system should be brought into force all at once, that 100,000 rifles should be purchased, and drill instructors employed all over the Commonwealth. I do desire, however, to see embedded in our Defence Act the beginnings of the system. To say merely that the Governor-General may form cadet corps without compelling boys to join these corps is little better than a farce. If honorable senators reject this proposal, they will find that they have a Defence Act, admirable in many respects, but rotten at the foundation. We have been speaking for months and months about organizing a citizen army, and honorable senators will not put forth a hand 1:o train that army. We have been told that we do not require the frill and the frippery of the headquarters staff, but a citizen soldiery, and honorable senators reject the elementary means of making citizen soldiers which I give them the opportunity to avail themselves of. </para>

                        <para>- I do not; but I desire to train our boys; and I need not do more to prove the necessity for such a clause as I suggest, than refer honorable senator&#39;s to the present state of the cadet corps in the Commonwealth. We have over 4,000 cadets in Victoria under the control of the Military Department. The cadets in Tasmania are also under military control. In New South Wales they are not under military control. I call that chaos, and, in my opinion, it is almost a disgrace to the people who have to deal with military matters that such a system should exist. We should have a uniform system, and the training should be efficient. In a few years time the whole system would be in working order, and we should provide automatically for a citizen force for all time. I have been reading up the matter to some extent, and I find that in England and Scotland, and in the different States of Australia, some difficulty is experienced in getting recruits. Recruits can be secured for our militia if they are paid, but I desire that every boy should, be taught the use of the rifle, and some knowledge of drill, in order that if hereafter we cannot afford to pay sufficient men to look after our defence we shall have at hand a number of boys who have had some training, and who in a few weeks can be made efficient soldiers. Surely there is common sense and prudence in the adoption of such a course ? Unless a clause of this kind is inserted in this Bill, the very foundation of our Defence Force will be absolutely wanting. It has been a terrible disappointment to find evidence all over Great Britain of a serious decline in the physique of men, and it is positively alarming to learn that hundreds of thousands of men are absolutely rejected on physical grounds as being unfit to join any defence force. </para>

                        <para>- I call attention to the fact that in Scotland a Commission, consisting of some of the first military authorities of Great Britain is investigating this matter, and, as one of the means of checking the physical decline which is complained of, they recommend compulsory physical drill in all the schools. Is the Senate going to reject such a proposal when the people of the old world, from bitter experience, are taking the absolutely opposite course, and competent authorities are there advocating that boys in the schools should be compelled to undertake physical or military gymnastics according to the Swiss system ? The great nations of the world have adopted the compulsory military system, and we know the magnificent armies they have raised under that system. I say that a system of compulsory military training should be adopted in our schools as a part of the ordinary education of our boys. If the clause be postponed, I shall be able, after the dinner hour, to bring down another proposal which I hope may meet with approval. </para>

                    <para>- Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> consulted the Government as to how the funds are to be provided? There would be from 150,000 to 200,000 cadets to be supplied with rifles, and the cost would amount to pretty nearly &#163;500,000 per annum. The proposal before us deals to a certain extent with the population of the towns ; but what about the people in the country ? There are hundreds of schools where there are only a few scholars, and we could not expect school - mistresses to teach military drill. We ought not to spend fabulous sums of money because of an imaginary danger. I am thoroughly in favour of teaching the boys military discipline, but it must not be forgotten that many boys above the age of fourteen years are the support of their parents. </para>

                    <para>- I propose for once to part company with Senators Neild and Gould and support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> A postponement would give us an opportunity of seeing the clause which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> proposes to submit. I am not altogether in favour of compulsion, but I recognise that it is a great advantage for young fellows to be properly trained. I understand that in Victoria the cadets are under the Defence Department, but that it is not so in New South Wales ; and I should like to know the reason. However, I have an open mind on the matter ; and I therefore suggest that the better course would be to postpone the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I support the proposal to postpone the clause, though I think that the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> and the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> might very well be submitted together. I am a believer in the compulsory system, because I believe that if the whole of the male population had to do a little drill, the military ardour of Britishers and Australians would cool, as would the enthusiasm of those gentlemen who write warlike leaders for the newspapers,  if they knew they had to &#34;take a hand&#34; themselves. There is an impression throughout English-speaking countries that we can go to war by proxy, and, therefore, public opinion is against the compulsory system. There is a great objection on the part of Britishers and British Australians to the conscription, but so far as I can learn from reading and conversation that system is the pride of the German people. It has been argued that until we have some system of the kind, British soldiers will not be respected. </para>

                        <para>- It was- reported in the newspapers some time ago that, in London, a soldier had been refused admission to any part of the theatre except the pit ; and the opinion was expressed by a Frenchman that until there is compulsory service the British soldier will not be appreciated. On board a German mail ship, not long ago, I asked a German whether the compulsory system in his country was not regarded as degrading, and he replied - &#34;On the contrary, we take a pride in it, and think we owe a duty to our country.&#34; </para>

I regret to find that on the part of the&#39; General Officer Commanding there is great objection to the cadet system. A friend of mine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catherwood,</inline> who has a. perfect genius for training cadets, and who was most successful with demonstrations by his pupils, was recently engaged in that work in Queensland ; but Major-General Hutton has dismissed him from the post of instructor,- and he has had to return to his position in the Education Department, and teach some thirty or forty scholars in a little school at Wallangarra. </para>

It has been suggested that a boy forgets drill and instruction; but as a matter of fact that is not so. &#39; The present system is to allow a person to attain the age of twenty-five or thirty, and then put him in the awkward squad, where he turns the instructor grey-headed with his inability to stand up straight or keep step. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to say a few words in connexion with the possibility of boys being armed with short rifles. In Victoria the cadets are to a large extent armed with little rifles, purchased for, I suppose, about a sovereign, and quite efficient for the purpose. The boys can handle the rifles perfectly well, and learn all the movements necessary for aiming and drill. It is absolute nonsense, therefore, to speak of the rifles as an obstacle to the formation of cadet corps. I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> because I believe that the reasons which he has adduced for his motion are good and reasonable. </para>

                    <para>- Apparently the only way to get on with the consideration of a Bill in the Senate is for every one to talk as much as he can. I hope that this clause will not be postponed. By this time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> ought to see the wisdom of affording to the Government an opportunity to carry out their intention of giving the cadet movement a start on the voluntary principle. If it should be found necessary or advisable, as time went on, to adopt the compulsory principle, it could be done. Every honorable senator, not even excepting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> is talking in a manner which would lead any one to suppose that we were on the eve of a war. I hope that the boys of to-day will be very old men before there will be any necessity for the Commonwealth to go to war. It is one thing for Switzerland, which always has the sword at her throat, to be prepared for war, but quite another thing for Australia, which is distant thousands of miles from any danger of that character. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; I am prepared to do away with the military force. I do not see the necessity for either a military force or a naval force of any kind. We are in such a position that, if we mind our own business, and do things as we ought to do them, there is no necessity to provide any system of defence. But seeing that I cannot get my way in these matters, I am prepared to accept a compromise when it is offered by the Government. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> ought to be satisfied with the proposal of the Government. If honorable senators are to rise on every conceivable occasion and submit amendments, there will be sufficient work in the Defence Bill to keep us going until Christmas. It will be time enough to take some step in the direction indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> when we find that the scheme of the Government has failed. In the past, with the States acting independently, there was bound to be chaos in the cadet force. The Government are now prepared to put the cadet movement on a sound basis, but on the voluntary principle, and in my opinion they should be afforded an opportunity to test that principle in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    CAMERON (Tasmania). - I rise to ask the Committee before it goes to a vote to endeavour to realize what I hold to be a fact that the cadet movement is the basis of the structure which we hope to build. We desire not to create a military power in the southern seas, as some persons seem to suggest, but simply to teach our boys the most elementary principle of citizenship. Was not the foundation of the&#39; power of the British Empire laid in centuries gone by making the people good archers ? There was no militarism involved in that proceeding. On every conceivable occasion the ability to shoot straight has been the basis of the success of the British nation. Why should we at this stage look upon an elementary duty of citizenship - of education, if the term is preferred - as if it were an extraordinary weapon with which we were going to deluge the world with blood. If

                    had ever seen in his own country what warfare means, neither he nor any other senator would hesitate to support this movement. The least which can be done is to postpone the clause in order to give a little more time for the consideration of this proposal, and to allow the public to have a voice in its determination before we start to build our edifice on an unsound basis.

                    <para>- Under the Constitution we have the right to make use of the railways for military and naval purposes without payment. We propose, as we have done hitherto, to make a payment. We are paying rates as agreed, but I do not think it is advisable to give up the right which we enjoy under the Constitution of being able to use the railways, if necessary, without payment. I submit that it is both unnecessary and unwise for the Parliament of the Commonwealth, by its legislation, to take up an inferior position. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to call attention to this clause in connexion with clauses 63 and 64. It is distinctly laid down there that it is intended to pay in other cases, but this clause says that no toll shall be payable or demanded. It seems to me that the clause cannot be reconciled with the previous provisions. </para>

                    <para>- This clause is analogous to one which we discussed in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Act. In that measure we provided that no toll should be demanded from carts carrying the mails. In the same way we say in connexion with the Defence Forces that they should be allowed, when on duty, to travel without paving tolls. It is not unreasonable. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - The Defence Forces are not on all fours with the mail services. Similar clauses to this may be found in State Acts, but it is to be remembered that the States Governments were dealing with what was within their own jurisdiction. I am not clear that, in spite of the drag-net provision of the Constitution, sub-section 39 of section 51, the Commonwealth has the right to legislate in connexion with the wharves, landing places, bridges and gates, which are the property of the people of a State. Where is the authority ?

NEILD (New South Wales). - I think that the difficulty which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> properly raises, will be met by the insertion of the word &#34; such &#34; before the word &#34; uniform,&#34; and the omission of the words &#34; or dress.&#34; The clause would then apply to the use of any uniform of the Defence Force or any colourable imitation of such uniform. </para>

                    <para>- The object of the section is clearly to prevent persons masquerading in the uniform of the Defence Force presumably for some improper reason. That is the- general principle, but we must recognise the fact that, in some cases, it will be absolutely necessary in order to properly present a play, that a uniform should be used. For instance, in the &#34; Pirates of Penzance&#34; there must be a &#34; Modern Major-General,&#34; and he should be properly dressed. </para>

                        <para>- It might be necessary in presenting an Australian play to have a representation of an Australian officer, and the audience would certainly demand that he should be dressed in a proper uniform. I am aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> draws a distinction between stage play and a representation at a music hall or circus performance. But it would be very difficult to draw any such line. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the objection raised is absurd. If we allow the use of a uniform on the stage for the purpose of making a butt of the Defence Force there is no reason why it should not be allowed in a music-hall or circus. I enjoy a joke as well as anybody, and I like a little bit of fun even though it should be at the expense of an individual appearing in the uniform of one of the branches -of His Majesty&#39;s Defence Force. People often enjoy a laugh at the stage-policeman appearing in the magnificent uniform of the constabulary, and we know the object is not to discredit the force. A little fun is sometimes made of the disposition of some members of the Defence Force to show themselves off, and to give themselves airs and graces, and why should there not be a little fun of that kind on the stage when the individuals are often ridiculous enough in every day life. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> appears to me to be exceedingly sensitive on behalf of the Defence Force of which he is so distinguished a member. </para>

I do not quote that as a precedent for us to follow, but to show that there is something in the objection taken.

The military self-love of some persons is insufferable, and they cannot bear any little sarcasm or ridicule on the stage. Honorable senators ought to have had sufficient parliamentary experience not to object to this kind of thing. Politicians are often the subject of ridicule ; honorable senators have only to read the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to know that, and if we were afflicted with the vanity of military officers we should have been in our graves long ago.

                <para class="block">Such a provision may be very suitable for the permanent forces, but every member of. the militia or of the volunteer force ought not to be able to demand a court martial, which is a rather difficult and somewhat expensive tribunal. I may mention incidentally that I intend to submit an amendment providing that a member of the citizen forces, who is discharged or reduced shall be so informed in writing. There was an amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> and another by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to a similar effect, and my proposal is a modification of the two. The question before us is that of the power of any member of the Defence Forces, which include the volunteer forces, to demand a court martial on being dismissed or reduced. I do not know whether those who supported the amendment in. another place recognised its full effect, but I certainly think that the power to demand a court martial should be restricted to members of the permanent force.

                        <para>- I cannot say just at the moment. If a case is to be <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> desperate as to be the subject of a court martial, an alleged offender cannot have much chance, and will probably content himself with stirring up groundless scandal against his superior officers. I do not think that more is required than we have already provided, in order to meet the case of officers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has indicated an amendment which is similar to one previously brought under the attention of the Committee by myself, and which is copied by the British Volunteer Act. It provides that a man who is to be dismissed or reduced&#39; shall not be &#34;thrust out of the synagogue&#34; without any intimation. It is not desirable to enable every member of a force with a grievance to demand a court martial ; but, in any case, I am opposed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the idea of limiting the right or privilege -to one class. The policy of the Bill is to place the paid men, the partially paid men, and the volunteers on exactly the : same basis ; and the commission of the non-paid officer is as valid and entitles to the same seniority as the commission of the paid -man. </para>

Some military men are so carried away with a sense of their own dignity and importance that they cannot tolerate the slightest offence.

                        <para>- Fortunately it does not exist to the same extent here ; but it will be Imperial officers who will dismiss the men whom these words, inserted in the clause by the other House, were intended to protect. Of course, some difficulty would arise if every dismissed man were to ask for a court-martial ; but I venture to think that if a man were dismissed for a real grievance, he would not be likely to wish to have that grievance further ventilated. These words were intended to meet the case of any man who believed that an injustice had been done him. I might instance the cases of Lieut.-Colonels Reay and Braithwaite. </para>

                        <para>- The reason why I made this distinction in the first place between the permanent and the citizen forces was not that one is regarded as inferior to the other. A member of the permanent force is living in the barracks, and there is not the slightest difficulty in constituting a court-martial to try him for any offence which he has committed. If the clause should be passed without this amendment, any one ot our 50,000 members of the permanent and citizen forces would be able to demand a court-martial. Honorable senators can see how extremely difficult it would be to provide a court-martial to try a man in some out-of-the-way part of Australia, perhaps for a mere trivial offence. Knowing that he enjoyed the right under the statute, a man would demand to be tried by a court-martial, and it would have to be convened. If the privilege of the section were availed of to any extent, it would mean an increased expenditure on travelling allowances. Any provision which entails the moving about of officers means additional expense in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- We do not provide in the Bill for the constitution of the courts-martial. We merely adopt the provisions in the King&#39;s Regulations. A tribunal consisting of one officer and a couple of privates would not be a court-martial. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has said that courts-martial are not held in New South Wales, except in the case of the permanent force. That is very probable, because the Act contains no provision for the purpose, nor, so far as I know, does the law of any other State. So far we have been able to get along without a provision of this kind, and a man in the citizen forces, when dismissed or disrated, has never dreamed of asking for a court-martial. We have already made provision to enable a man to get ample justice. Possibly when the words &#34; sailor and soldier &#34; were inserted in the clause, the other House was under the impression that the latter word applied to a member of the permanent force, and not to a citizen soldier. I think it is going too far to confer the power of demanding a court martial on the vast number of citizen soldiers, who are scattered all over the Commonwealth. </para>

                    - and I think Senators O&#39;Keefe and Barrett - desire to protect the members of the Defence Force against such incidents as have been mentioned here to-night, it will lie necessary to substitute the word &#34; member &#34; for the words &#34; sailor and soldier,&#34; so that the right of applying for a court-martial shall extend to all ranks of the&#39; service. Otherwise, the cases which have been cited would not come under the clause at all. The words &#34;sailor and soldier&#34; are defined by the interpretation clause to mean privates, not officers. I entirely agree with what
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>
                    hassaid as to the costliness of having courts-martial in out-of-the-way places. It would be very unfair indeed to hold a court-martial, composed of officers in the vicinity of such spots, because they would in almost every case be officers of the company of which the accused person was a member. In such circumstances we could not expect a man to&#62; have an independent trial, because, however desirous an officer might be to do justice, there is such a thing as unconscious bias. Suppose that a man were dismissed from a company - which in future is to consist of sixty men only - because of impropriety, how could the officer who had dismissed him fairly sit in judgment on a court-martial: on the same man? Therefore it would be needful either to bring officers from a distance, or to allow the accused man to travel for a distance, and possibly take his witnesses with &#39; him. There is no doubt, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>
                    said, that it would involve a large expenditure ; but perhaps he has overlooked the possibility that very few of these demands for a court-martial would arise. I have not heard of a case in New South Wales of a man asking even for a court of inquiry, which could easily be had ; certainly no such case has occurred in connexion with my regiment. A man pretty well knows that when he gets his gruel it is deserved. The cost of training and clothing a man is such that no officer of a citizen force wishes to get rid of him lightly; he will, in fact, stretch a. point to keep him. Under the new regime, only 30s. a year is to be allowed for clothing, so that a commanding officer cannot lightly throw a man out of his regiment, and have his uniform rendered useless, because he- would have no money available to buy a uniform for the man who would take his place. All these considerations operate with an officer. In New South Wales there is a good deal of &#34; winking the other eye &#34; at little military peccadilloes - offences have to be pretty bad before much notice is taken of them.

                        <para>- I hope that other officers are as reasonable as I am ; no doubt they are. In connexion with the citizen forces there are very many peculiar incidents. Perhaps I may be permitted to mention one case, merely to show how leniently offences are dealt with. It is the case of an old soldier - a member of a citizen regiment - who got rather &#34;owerfou &#34; on his way to an Easter camp for a period 6&#163; continuous training. He behaved so improperly that it was necessary to put him under arrest, and he was lodged in the guard tent. &#39; Some young soldiers, who were doing their first time in camp, were placed as guard of the tent. About an hour and a half afterwards - at midnight - when the sergeant-major went round to see that, every thing was all right, he witnessed a strange spectacle. The guard were inside the guard-tent, as sleepy as tired lads could be and the prisoner, in his stockinged feet, with a rifle on his shoulder, was marching up and down outside, keeping guard over them. He observed to the astonished sergeant-major - &#34;It is all right, sergeant-major ; I am looking after them.&#34; That was a pretty bad case. Yet &#39;the man got nothing more than a reprimand from one side of the commanding officer&#39;s face, and a pretty broad smile from the other. So far as my knowledge goes, it is the poor man in the force who gets the best half of the show. It is only when men get highly placed, and tread on the corns or the toes of somebody a little greater than themselves that the real trouble begins. Cases have been mentioned of the particulars of which I know nothing more than I have read in the newspapers. They seem to be cases of hardship. But retaining these words will not meet the difficulty. &#39; I do not think there is any need to insist upon this absolute right, because, whether we retain the words or not, there will be nothing to prevent a man having a court-martial if he asks for it, no matter whether his officer likes it or not. It is rather loading the Bill to make it a statutory obligation that there must be a court-martial in every case. Still, if the matter goes to a division I shall vote to retain the words. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                    is right. It would be possible for an officer of a lower grade to have a complaint against his superior officer. According to the military regulations he would have no opportunity of acquainting the General Officer Commanding of his grievance, because he would have to send the complaint through the officer against whom he had the grievance.

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - If an officer fails to forward the communication of an aggrieved person that person can pass by his commanding officer and communicate with higher authority. Suppose a captain has a grievance against his colonel. He can appeal to the general. If the colonel does not forward his communication the captain can ignore the colonel, and go straight to the general ; and if the general does not give such satisfaction as the captain thinks he is entitled to, he can appeal to the Minister. An officer can always pass by a superior who has failed to do him justice in forwarding his communication. But the honorable senator is quite right in saying that all communications are supposed to go through the superior officer, who may be, and commonly is, the person who is alleged to be the cause of the grievance.

                    <para>- I think there is a great deal of cry, and little in it. Whenever any man has a penalty inflicted on him he has a right, under the Army Act, and according to every usage of the British Army, to demand ti court-martial. But where a man is simply dismissed or reduced it is a matter of administration, and the Government should exercise that absolute power unquestioned. That is the custom of the army in England, and has worked well. I can see very grave reasons, which I should not like to mention in public, why the power should be retained. I must say that in the administration of it I . have never known an injustice done. Such a thing could not exist for a moment in Australia, because if an injustice were to arise, Parliament would right it at once. A man might demand a court-martial, and for high reasons of policy the demand should not be acceded. There might be such cases. The power to demand a court-martial should not be given.

                            will desire me to make one remark in elucidation of the position he has taken up, not with regard to myself, but with regard to the opportunity which a man has of appealing to superior authorities. There is in the British Army a. distinct regulation to the effect that every man at an inspection, when the General asks the question - &#34;Is there any complaint?&#34; has the right to stand out of the ranks, without going to any other officer, and, even though the inspecting officer should be the Commander-in-Chief, he can lay his complaint before him. That is a regulation which practically has the force of a law in the British Army. That is an answer to what

                            has said.

No doubt a court-martial, when asked for, is in a large majority of cases granted. The clause in this Bill absolutely compels the holding of a court-martial, no matter what the Governor-General in Council may think. </para>

It will be seen that that section exhausts the matter, because the next section in the Act deals with punishments. I have quoted two sections, one dealing with the officer and the other dealing with the man, and neither of them indicate any right to demand a court-martial. The probability is that an officer will obtain a court-martial if he asks for it, but I am not so sure that Tommy Atkins would.

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - I believe that the Minister for Defence has prepared an amendment to this clause, and if it attains the object I have in view 1 shall be thoroughly well satisfied. The amendment of which I have given notice is to make clause 87, by the introduction of a few words, applicable to persons not now subject to military law. The law in the United Kingdom differentiates absolutely between the power of a court martial to deal with persons who are subject to military law, and the power to deal with persons who are not so subject. The remarks I am now making apply to this and the three succeeding clauses, and I ask the liberty of making some gentle reference to the powers of a court-martial as therein set forth, while not discussing the provisions in detail. Honorable senators may take my assurance that in the amendments which I purpose to submit, the actual phraseology of the British Army Act has been copied, because that Act protects an accused civilian in a way that these clauses unfortunately do not. A civilian who may refuse to attend a court-martial as a witness, or who, being there, refuses to be sworn and give evidence, or commits other contempt, cannot be dealt with by that court. By an informal writing - there is no form provided - under the hand of the president, such a person may be remitted to a civil court just as if he had committed the offence against that civil court, whether the offence be recalcitrancy as a witness, or giving other ground for the charge of contempt. Under the British law, no military court can in any way deal with such an offender. A court-martial may, under British law, deal with a civilian who has been guilty of sketching, photographing, or taking plans of military forts or other premises, who has interfered with the carrying out of the Enlistment law, or committed other offences which are a distinct interference with the proper working of the military machine, but not where contempt of court is involved. Even members of the military forces who are charged with refusing to give evidence or of committing similar offences can, only in heinous cases, be dealt with by the court offended, and are usually sent to be tried by another

If in the case of the British Army, with all its penalties, and I was going to say, the unknown consequences of responsibility which attach to members of the army, it is laid down in the most explicit terms that an offending civilian under the circumstances I have indicated shall not be punished by the court-martial, and that a soldier similarly offending shall be tried by another court-martial, why should we, in this and </para>

Except it be a gross offence a soldier is tried by another court-martial free from the influence of having had its feelings outraged <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> his conduct. We should like to be in this position, that if we unhappily had committed a contempt of a civil court : we should feel that we were being best protected if we were being tried not by a court whose feelings we had ruffled, but by a court which was free from all sense of irritation. I have to thank the Committee for having patiently heard me, and you, sir, for having permitted me to take a rather wider range than is usual in order that in one speech I might explain the meaning of my present and subsequent amendments in regard to clauses 87,88, and 89. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; because for such offences as taking sketches of fortifications and so on, penalties are provided which could be recovered in a civil court. I propose to ask the Committee to provide that a person who is not subject to military law shall not be tried by a court-martial for contempt of court or anything else, but by a civil tribunal. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; because it makes it an offence for any person, whether subject to military law or not, to interrupt the proceedings of a court-martial. I should like to know from the honorable senator whether this new clause would carry out his idea : - 87a.Noperson other than a person subject to naval and military law shall be proceeded against before a court-martial ; but if a person not so subject commits any act amounting to contempt of court within the view and hearing of a court-martial, he may forthwith be arrested pursuant to the order of the president of the court-martial and taken before a civil court having jurisdiction to try him for the offence, to be dealt with according to law. </para>

                    NEILD (New South Wales. - The penalties which are prescribed in this clause are altogether out of keeping with those provided in the Army Act. The longest sentence which a court-martial in the old country can give a soldier is three weeks. But this clause proposes to inflict a punishment exactly four times as great as the Army Act metes out to a professional soldier.

                        <para>- I am not in a position to say what the relative horror amounts to. I do not propose to alter the penalty which may be meted out by the High Court or the Supreme Court of a State, or by a Justice of either court because cases of a gross character may occur. But a court of summary jurisdiction includes a police court, and I object to a police magistrate having the power to fine a citizen soldier &#163;50 for an offence, which perhaps may have been the result of an indiscretion, or an accident, or a little lapse of temper. It is an outrageous maximum to prescribe. If the offence is so small and unimportant that it should be dealt with by a police magistrate, &#163;5 is a sufficient maximum to prescribe. But if it is a heinous offence, and it has to be sent to the higher court provided for in the Bill, let the offender be fined &#163;1,000 if you like. Instead of carrying out my original intention, I shall move for the infliction of a penalty of &#163;10 instead of &#163;50, and a sentence of one month instead of three months, leaving the superior courts to do as they please.

It is a maximum penalty which is provided for, and it should be borne in mind that courts of summary jurisdiction have very extensive powers of imprisonment in civil cases.

                <para class="block">It is quite right that a paid soldier, whose services are entirely at the disposal of the Commonwealth, should attend when ordered; but it is a different thing to be in a position to order and punish for non-attendance a militiaman who does not draw more than ten shillings a month, and cannot leave his office, shop, or plough ; or a volunteer who gets nothing for his services. It is not right that a militiaman or a volunteer should be obliged under military law to dance attendance on a court-martial whenever ordered, without even the formality of a summons. I do not think it was ever intended to treat citizen soldiers in that way, and therefore I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to allow my amendment to pass. It may be ruinous to a man to be ordered about in this manner. Wo know that in a court that is not governed by set rules, and which may have no knowledge of conducting legal business, the proceedings may be spun out in the most inordinate manner. </para>

                    <para>- We have been giving various privileges to citizen soldiers, including the right to demand a court-martial, and I do not see why they should not give evidence before such a court when called upon. Every citizen is liable to be called upon to give evidence before a court. A supoena is an order to attend before a civil court. An order to attend before a court-martial is the same thing. </para>

                    <para>- I trust that the Committee will not agree to negative this clause. There is a subsequent provision for the payment of the expenses of civilian witnesses. The proper place to deal with that is in the regulation clause. But I am willing to put in some words to make it absolutely certain that civilian witnesses shall be paid. </para>

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - I think that the main part of the new clause which I have circulated is covered by a clause which the Minister proposes to insert by-and-by. My object can be attained, at the present stage, by omitting the words &#34; ordered or,&#34; in the first line. Then, after the word &#34; court-martial,&#34; we might insert the words, &#34; and after payment or tender of the reasonable expenses of his attendance.&#34;

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - I desire to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence to the fact that this clause deals with persons found guilty &#34; of any naval or military offence.&#34; Those words are about as vague as they could be made by the use of the English language. Apparently any assemblage of three or four officers is to be entitled to define what is a naval or military offence.

                    <para>- I have given notice of a long list of amendments in this clause, but they are very necessary, and I am sure the Minister for Defence will accept them. Briefly, this is a clause to give the power of military law over subscriptions to corps, and in respect of property belonging to parts of corps, not being public property. The Minister, I am sure, will recognise that these moneys and properties do not, as a rule, belong to corps or to the ship&#39;s company, but to parts of the corps or ship&#39;s company. For instance, the moneys belonging to a regimental rifle club do not belong to the regiment ; a sergeant&#39;s mess may have little fixings which do not belong to the corps ; and the same thing applies to officers&#39; funds, band funds, and funds of that description. I have given notice of amendments to insert after the words &#34; corps &#34; and &#34; company &#34; wherever they occur in the clause, the words &#34;or part thereof.&#34; I desire also to make another amendment, inserting the words &#34; or pawning &#34; after the word &#34; alienation.&#34; </para>

I take it that the whole clause relates to money ear-marked for military purposes, and over which there is official jurisdiction. Does the amendment mean private subscriptions for a sergeants&#39; mess, an extra feed at Christmas, or for a little speculation at Flemington ? </para>

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - My amendment does not remove any of the authority which the clause proposes in reference to money belonging to the corps, but merely extends the operation to money which belongs to part of a corps, such as a rifle club.

                    <para>- This clause cannot possibly be carried into effect as it stands. I should like, in the first place, to insert after the word &#34; offence&#34; the words &#34; or misconduct &#34;; but, though such an amendment is desirable, it may not be absolutely necessary. My principal objection to the clause is that it gives power to detain in naval or military custody a member of the force who is alleged to have been guilty of an offence while in uniform or on duty. Unfortunately, the Bill contains no definition of &#34; on duty.&#34; The point was discussed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> and myself this morning, and we agreed that though a definition of the words is highly desirable, it would be very difficult to find one. In any event, it would be impossible to put the clause in operation. A. volunteer who might get intoxicated before a drill, and disgrace himself in the ranks on a Saturday afternoon, would have to be detained in custody until he could be tried for the offence. </para>

                        <para>-Col. NEILD. - How can a member of the volunteer force be held in custody? All that can be done with a volunteer is to kick him out of the corps or fine him. There is a clause in the Bill which absolutely prohibits the imprisonment of a member of the citizen forces for a military offence, and yet, in the clause before us, power is given to detain him in custody before he is even tried for an offence. The object of the Department, no doubt, is to protect the reputation of the uniform ; and in order to get out of the difficulty, I move - </para>

                <para>That the following words be added : - &#34;but in the case of a member of the citizen forces such arrest or custody shall not continue longer than while the corps or ship&#39;s company to which such member belongs shall then remain under arms or on duty, or, if not then on duty, until such member shall have resumed civilian attire, which he shall without unnecessary delay be permitted to do.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">Under the amendment a member of the citizen forces who became intoxicated in uniform, or while on duty, would be held in custody until he had been taken home, and had there removed his uniform and resumed his position as a civilian. He would not be permitted to continue t he offence. No one would contend that a citizen soldier should ordinarily be punished by the military authorities for an offence committed while in plain clothes. In England, under similar circumstances, the arrest terminates with the termination of the duty ; but I go further, and make the clause cover military offences committed when there is no duty in progress - when, for instance, a parade has been dismissed, and a man gets drunk and disgraces himself on his way home. The object of the last few words of the amendment is that the man shall not be kept in custody longer than is necessary for him to resume his position as a citizen. </para>

                    <para>- Some alteration of the clause is necessary, and I think it can be done as well by this amendment as in any other way. It must be clear to honorable senators that in country districts we should have no means of keeping a man in military custody, even if it were necessary or desirable. As soon as he ceases to be on duty and resumes his civilian status, we do not wish to retain custody of him. He will be properly tried and punished for whatever offence he may have committed. In the meantime there will be no advantage in keeping him in custody if that were possible, so that I have no objection to the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot see any reason why a member of the permanent, force should not have a statutory right to volunteer. The clause relates to a force which may be raised by the Commonwealth for service beyond its limits. Why should the clause be altered to say that the members of the permanent force shall not be allowed to volunteer for such service? The authorities would not be bound to accept the services of any member of the permanent force who might volunteer. His volunteering would be of no effect unless he got the consent of the Commonwealth. He would be under a term of service in the permanent force, and he could not break that engagement. </para>

                <para class="block">That would give to the members of the permanent force permission to apply individually, if they wished to volunteer for outside service. The number of these men is extremely limited, and their services would be absolutely essential to the local defence of Australia if it should ever be attacked. Of course, if a superior officer should consider that the services of any member of the permanent force could be dispensed with, and that he should be allowed to volunteer, well and good ; but I contend that he should not have the right to volunteer and to go in opposition to the desire of the officer. </para>

As he pointed out, it would enable every man in every branch of the Defence Force to volunteer for foreign service; but, if any permanent man volunteered against the wish of the authorities, his volunteering would not disassociate him from the permanent force. He might volunteer himself into foreign service, but it would not have any effect as between him and the authorities, unless he had their consent. </para>

                    <para>- -I would submit to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> that a member of the permanent force, who was an officer, could not go away without the consent of the Governor-General in Council. He could volunteer, but he could not leave his . employ without that permission. A member of the rank and file who is engaged to serve for a specific term, would not be able to go without permission ; he would be no more free to go than a man to leave a shop without the consent of his employer. If we put a bar in the way of members of the permanent force volunteering for and going on outside service with the permission of the authorities, we might prevent the very one man going whom it might be very desirable to allow to go. That eminent medical man, Surgeon-General Williams, whose capacity for organizing the medical service won golden opinions in the British Army in South Africa, would be barred by this amendment from going on foreign service. The Minister has said that the implication would be that that distinguished officer could not go, but I submit that, according to the well-known legal aphorism <inline font-style="italic">expressio unius</inline><inline font-style="italic">est</inline><inline font-style="italic">alterius exclusio,</inline> if we say that certain persons may go, by implication we excluded other people from going.

                    <para>- This clause was much debated in another place. It was intended to deal with the case of an order given to a subordinate by an officer, but was somewhat carelessly drafted. The fact has been quite overlooked that an order or summons of a court-martial may go out against civilians who are not under military discipline at all. Under clause 21, the president of a court-martial may summon witnesses to give evidence and produce documents. That applies to civilians; and, certainly, every civilian is entitled to receive an order of the court or a summons. I intend to move to insert the words &#34;a summons.&#34; </para>

                    is rather playing with the word &#34; order,&#34; and giving it a restricted sense. He is treating the word as a verdict of the court. If he treats it in any wider sense, an order of the court applies to any order given in respect to any civilian upon any matter with which the court is concerned. Courts-martial have been given very extensive powers over civilians. It is all very well for &#34; orders &#34; to military people to be given verbally, but when we are dealing with civilians, we should proceed in the ordinary way in which any other court would proceed. Civilians must be protected by having orders against them in writing.

                    <para>- The only objection I have to the amendment is that there is no desire to interfere at all with these matters, or to undertake any control in connexion with them. The rifle clubs are on a somewhat different footing, because they form part of the reserve forces, and are frequently in the position of trustees of Government property, having rifles lent to them, and having in some instances the control of rifle ranges. Some superintendence is therefore necessary, and power is taken to deal with the formation of rifle clubs as being part &#34;of the defence scheme of the Commonwealth. But we have no desire to interfere with such matters as the formation of officers! funds and sergeants&#39; mess funds. </para>

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - I am not proposing anything new. I am proposing in the briefest possible way to give the Governor-in-Council a power which is provided for in the New South Wales Act in half-a-page of matter that is a transcript of the English Volunteer Act, and which has been the law in that State for the last forty years. I , should like to inform the Minister for Defence also that officers&#39; mess funds come under the King&#39;s regulations, and indeed it is necessary to have the- assistance of regulations under authority for maintaining order and honesty in the management and control of these funds. If the amendment be agreed to it will impose no obligation on the Governor-in-Council to make these regulations, but I give the Minister for Defence my assurance that the power to frame regulations governing these matters will probably be one of the first requests which will be made to him by the General Officer Commanding, in order that these funds may be maintained and controlled under the basis of military law. How can funds of this kind be properly managed under the civil law ? This is essentially a military matter, and those charged with responsibility, financial and otherwise, in connexion with these funds should be under the military law in their operations. The Minister for Defence was good enough to accept certain amendments in a previous clause dealing with such funds, and what I propose is but a corollary of the legislation to which we have already agreed. It is the invariable rule in regiments that officers shall subscribe to funds to assist the band, sometimes to pay bandsmen, sometimes to buy music or accessories required for performances after dark, sometimes to help an impecunious member over life&#39;s style, and sometimes to provide rations for a day&#39;s voluntary parade. I can assure
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>
                    that these funds are established in almost every regiment in New South Wales.

How can the commanding officer enforce order and honesty in the handling of such matters if he has not the assistance of regulations promulgated by the superior authority. I am urging the Committee to give the Minister for Defence more authority than he is asking for under the Bill, and if he does not care to exercise that authority when it is given, I cannot help that.

                <para>South Wales regiment which has been waiting ever since the Commonwealth was established for authority to carry out these funds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> will admit that the establishment of such funds is quite common, and that it is desirable that they should be under military authority rather than that the civil law should have to be invoked every time anything goes wrong. I hope the Minister for Defence will not refuse to accept an authority which, while he will not be compelled to exercise it, can be wisely exercised in the best interests of the forces of which he is the Ministerial head. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that the honorable senator is asking the Department to take the power of control in connexion with these matters, but I am inclined to resist his request in the interests of the Defence Force. If I thought it would be of any assistance I should be most happy to accept what the honorable senator offers. It seems to me, however, that officers&#39; funds and sergeants&#39; mess funds and their regulation should be left entirely to the corps in which they are formed. If the amendment is agreed to a demand will be made that regulations shall&#39; be issued, and we cannot frame different regulations for every corps. We shall have to frame one set of regulations by which each corps will be bound hard and fast. I think it would be better that in matters of this kind each corps should make its own regulations. </para>

I had charge of a brigade of yeomanry consisting of two regiments on a similar footing to that upon which our partially-paid forces will be. With the exception of one fund, the amount allowed for each efficient yeoman, which was Government money and paid by the War Office, the whole of the regimental funds - officers&#39; fund, sergeants&#39; mess fund, and horse fund - were vested in the officers alone, and were managed entirely by them. </para>

I feel positive that the Federal Parliament has absolute power to educate these boys in regard to military training, whether in or out of school. It would be a perfect farce if the Constitution gave us the right to manage the whole of the defences of the Commonwealth, and did not allow us to educate our youths so that they might become soldiers.

At a later date, when some scandal may have arisen, and an honorable member or an honorable senator is approached by. his constituents, it is found to be too late to have a particular regulation rejected. These regulations ought to be subject to alteration by Parliament at any time, and a provision having that effect could not prejudice the public in any way. On the contrary, it would&#39; be a great advantage if Parliament were always able to place the regulations under revision, and to alter them if they were found to operate improperly or harshly. </para>

                    is to some extent right, because Parliament, which may have other business, ought not to be pre- . vented from criticising and altering regulations. But Parliament should not, week after week, be tinkering at regulations which ought to be brought up and approved of for the session.

                        <para>-Senator Dobson is quite right. There ought to be some limit to the time during which Parliament is invited to either reject or accept regulations. There could be no advantage in allowing the question to remain open, because such a course would offer less inducement to criticise regulations at the proper time, which is when they are first brought down. Regulations affecting the pay and other conditions of the men, for instance, should be attended to at once, and should not, when they may have been in quiet operation for months, be suddenly brought up for consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Parliament can always call attention to a real injustice, and compel the Government to make a necessary amendment; but there must be some finality. The Government ought to be &#39;able to assume that if within a certain time Parliament has not disapproved, the regulations are indorsed. The time allowed by the clause is fifteen sitting days, and as at the commencement of the session we do not on the average sit more than three days each week, we have the long period of five weeks. I think that is quite sufficient. </para>

If we should provide that the regulations might be altered at any time, we should withdraw what pressure there might be on the Parliament at the present time to note when any regulations under an Act are laid upon the table, and to take the necessary action within the statutory time. </para>

                    <para>- This question requires very careful consideration. 1 wish to draw the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to a case in point. On the 2nd June last, the regulations under the Public Service Act were laid on the table of the Senate. Unfortunately, through an oversight, the regulations were not printed as a Senate paper, with the result that they got lost sight of by honorable senators, and in due course acquired the force of law. We had no opportunity of discussing the regulations within the prescribed time. Although, no doubt, the regulations were framed with very great care by the Commissioner, still in many instances they are totally inadequate to meet the requirements in Queensland. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and I moved in the matter, a few regulations were merely tinkered with. The regulations as a whole did not undergo that critical examination and revision which they ought to have received. No set of regulations should be allowed to acquire the force of law until such time as each House of the Parliament has had a proper opportunity of criticising, and, if necessary, revising them. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> in wishing to alter the clause in that direction. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>
                    if he can consent to a provision of this kind - that for one week or three weeks after the regulations shall have been laid on the table, there shall appear on the notice-paper an entry to the effect that the regulations under the Defence Act were laid on the table on such a day, and are open for discussion until such a date ?
