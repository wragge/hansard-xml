                            <para>- I am taking this course in order to discuss a matter of urgent public importance with regard to the administration of the Customs Department. Exactly one year ago, on the motion for the second reading of the Appropriation Bill, I was criticising the Customs administration, and amongst other cases of prosecution to which I referred was that of Farmer and Co., which I described in these words : - </para>

                        <para>The firm of Farmer and Co. is an important Sydney house, and passes entries, I suppose, every day. On the 9th July it passed an entry for a bale of rugs. I have here a copy of the entry and of the statement of value or invoice which was sent in with it. What is known as the slip reads " one bale of rugs, value £37 4s. 6d." The clerk, in making the entry, transposed the figures, and made the amount £34 7s. 6d., which reduced the duty by about 9s. As the slip which I have read was handed in with the entry, the mistake was an obvious one, and there was not the remotest attempt to defraud the Department ; but the firm was nevertheless dragged before the Police Court, and fined £5 and costs. </para>

                    <para class="block">With regard to that statement, I heard nothing further until the month of May, when the late Minister for Trade and Customs addressed a public meeting in the Sydney Town Hall. In the course of his address, he referred to my criticisms on the Customs Department, and made an attack on myself, which was marked, shall I say, with that vigour, of which he, as every body knows, is a master. He said that the statement which I have just read " did not contain a word of truth in it." In consequence of his statement I visited the police court where the prosecution had taken place, and asked leave to see the depositions. I found that they sustained my statement - that the prosecution had taken place on that very case. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> said something else at the public meeting. He said that that case was withdrawn and that the prosecution took place in regard to another mistake of a larger character. I also saw the depositions in that case, and I found that it was marked "withdrawn." Naturally I communicated the result of my visit to the Sydney press some time in May. In June <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> in defending his Customs administration generally in the other House, reverted to this matter, and made a more severe attack upon myself. I believe I shall not be in order in referring specifically to what he said. Therefore, I cannot deal with his remarks except to say that they were of a more grave character still. He wantonly declared that there was no truth in what I stated, and imputed positive misrepresentation to me. I followed up the matter, and the firm told me that the Customs House documents would sustain the statements which they had made, that before they could get delivery of the bale of rugs they had to give a guarantee which was marked " prosecution having taken place," and that the other guarantee was marked, " in the event of a prosecution being ordered." In the Senate I endeavoured to secure the production of the papers. I had a motion for that purpose on the business-paper for several weeks, but there was an objection to its being taken as formal business, and, therefore, it could not be moved. At last the Government consented to my asking for the production of the papers. On the 22nd July I asked the question, and the Government agreed that the papers should be sent for. On the 13th August a packet of papers was laid on the table. In my question I asked for the production of all the papers, especially mentioning the guarantees, and so on, but to my surprise I found that those special papers had not been included in the return. I mentioned the fact to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> and he at once said that the Government would write for the balance of the papers. Evidently his promise was kept, for a week later the Customs authorities sent them to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline> He handed them to me to look through, and I found that the guarantee paper given to the Customs House, like the document at the Police Court, sustained the truth of what I had said - that a prosecution had taken place in regard to this matter ; but, strange to say, this guarantee was accompanied by a statement signed by a Customs officer as follows : - </para>

I regret to say that in making the alterations visible' the rug case was taken, and not the furniture one. The importers were anxious and' bustling for delivery, and I took the" statement of the shipping clerk who had been present at the Court as to the particular case in which the prosecution had taken place. I much regret the error, but I am sure the Collector will bear me out when I say that I am not usually so credulous. </para>

                    <para class="block">We are face to face with one of the most remarkable things that I ever experienced. A prosecution took place; the Ministry say that it did not take place in a certain case ; the depositions at the Police Court show that it did, and a guarantee given to and accepted by the Customs House also shows that it did. . It is not for me, after having argued so frequently here that in all business there must be a certain margin of mistake, to say that the Customs and Police authorities did not make a mistake in this case. It is quite - possible that they did. It is possible that it will never be known exactly in which case the prosecution did take place. But it is quite evident that the statements which I made were amply justified ; that there was no lack of fair play ; that there " was no straining a point ; that there was no misrepresentation in anything I said either in the Senate or in the press of Sydney. I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Customs officers in Sydney were aware that a grave - imputation had been made against myself, that they made no effort to remove it, and that, apparently, even the Minister was misled ; that - further and worse than all - when these identical papers were asked for, in the first instance they were suppressed,, and that the Government had to write a second time before they were obtained. I am satisfied to have been able to make this public explanation. It remains for the Government to consider whether they ought not to call upon the Customs Department to make an inquiry as to the reason which actuated the officers in remaining silent so long as they did, and why when they were asked for these papers, they apparently endeavoured to suppress them. </para>

                        <para>. - I have not the papers in this case before me. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> say last night that he intended to move the adjournment of the Senate to refer to the Customs administration, but I did not know that it had any reference to this case. I gather from his statement this afternoon that he has been supplied with all the papers that he has asked to see. I have not the? details to supplement the outline of the case, but my information is to the effect that there was confusion between two cases, one involving only a few shillings, and the other involving.£4:0or £-50, and that a guarantee "was given in each case. In the Police Court, one case - the big case, I believe - was called on, but the papers were marked wrongly by the depositions clerk, and that appears to be the ground-work of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> complaint. A conviction was obtained, and the other case was withdrawn, but it appears that the papers which related to the case involving the smaller amount were marked as referring to the case involving the larger amount. I cannot see "that the honorable senator has any substantial grievance. </para>

We are all sorry for the honorable senator, but we know that his impetuosity sometimes leads him astray when anything connected with fiscal matters is under discussion.

                            <para>- I believe I am not at liberty to quote the words used by the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs in another place. Had I been at liberty to do so, I should have referred in the Senate to what the right honorable gentleman said the week following that in which the statement was made. It is a matter of no interest to the public to know in which of these cases the prosecution took place. I gave the details in one case, and in the other the Clerk took one invoice in two sheets, and did not notice that the amount on the first page had not been carried forward to the second. Any one who knows anything about commercial affairs is aware that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the amount is carried on from page to page to the final total. </para>

                <para class="block">I should not ask honorable senators to suspend the Standing Orders to deal with a contentious matter. A simple alteration is found to be necessary in the High Court Procedure Act, and I think the Bill it is intended to introduce will not give rise to any debate. I may now explain the object of the Bill in order to avoid the necessity for referring to it at length upon the second . reading. In the High Court Procedure Act there is a. section- under which a case may be removed out of the District Registry to the Registry for the purpose of making an application. When the Bill was framed it was contemplated that there would be five Judges, and that there would consequently be no necessity to make provision for removing a cause from one Registry to another. As there are only three Judges of the High Court, it may frequently happen that there will be no Judge at one of the principal Registries to deal with applications that may require to be made, and a slight amendment of the Act is therefore necessary to provide that causes may be removed from one Registry to another for the purpose of an application. If, for instance, a' writ is issued out of the Registry here in Melbourne, and there is no Judge in Melbourne at the time, the object of the Amending Bill is to provide that an application in connexion with the cause may be made at some other Registry - for instance, in Sydney. Where a cause is pending in one of the capitals, an application may be made to a Judge, who may be in another capital, to deal with some matter connected with it. </para>

                        <para>- No ; just the other way. The intention is to study the convenience of litigants by enabling causes to be removed from one Registry to another in the same way as power is given under the High Court Procedure Act already for the removal of a cause from the District Registry to the Registry. In order to effect the required alteration, the proposed Bill provides for the striking out of sub-section 1 of section8, and the substitution of another provision therefor, because the phraseology would be different ; and for the omission of the word " district " from each of the sub-sections of that section and sections 9, 10, and 11. The amendment sought to be made is entirely in the interests of litigants. </para>

                    <para>- I am not exactly clear about this provision. I suppose it is all right, but these Bills which are passed ostensibly in the interests of litigants usually turn out to be rather in the interests of the legal profession. A leading provision of the Bill is intended to permit a party to a cause to temporarily transfer the hearing of the cause from one place where the High Court sits to another place where it may be sitting at a particular time. Is it not desirable that the consent of the other party should be given to any transference of the kind ? </para>

                        <para>- Suppose a cause is being tried at Melbourne, and one of the parties applies for its transference to Sydney. It would appear to be necessary that the other party to it should hire counsel and agents to represent him there. It appears to me that in some instances this provision will merely result in the piling up of legal expenses. I do not profess to understand these things, but it does appear to me that some difficulty of the kind I have suggested might arise. It is provided that an application may be lodged with the Registrar, but there is no provision that the Registrar shall give notice of the application to the other party to the cause. </para>

            </para>
            <para>Australia). - I wish to call attention to three items which have reference to the salaries to be paid to officers of this Chamber. As the Estimates appear before us now, the Clerk of Papers and Accountant receives a salary of £380 ; the head housekeeper and doorkeeper a salary of £205 ; and the President's messenger, a salary of £188. When the Estimates were first submitted to the House of Representatives by the Government, these salaries were respectively £420, £235, and £204, which are the salaries paid to similar officers in the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives, however, reduced the salary of the Clerk of Papers by £40 ; that of the housekeeper and doorkeeper by £30 ; and that of the President's messenger by £16. I admit that from a pounds shillings and pence point of view the amount is not very large, but there is a principle involved. Are the officers in the Senate to be placed in a position inferior to that of officers of the House of Representatives? Attention should be called to the fact that the House of Representatives increased the salaries to be paid to their own officers by the sum of £70. I do not mean to say that the Estimates were increased by that amount, but the House of Representatives assented to the Estimates which raised the salaries of the officers of the House of Representatives by £70. A junior clerk employed by the House of Representatives has received an increase of £10, and there is an item of £60 - which did not appear in last year's Estimates - in order to provide for increments and adjustments of salaries. What the House of Representatives did was to increase the salaries of their own officers by £70, and decrease the salaries of the officers of the Senate by about £100. </para>

                    <para>- That is what I meant to say. The House of Representatives decreased the Senate salaries so far as the Estimates presented by the Government are concerned, but they did not decrease the salaries as compared with those paid last year. This is a question of some importance from the point of view of the Senate. Ought we, or ought we not to assent to such a course of action <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not suppose for one moment that if the Senate proposed to decrease the salaries of the officers of another place, the suggestion would be concurred in by the House of Representatives. It seems to me, however, that we have just as much right to take that course of action as the House of Representatives has to reduce the Estimates in the way I have indicated. I do not dispute the legal right of the House of Representatives to do what they have done. Nor can it be denied that the Senate has a legal right to request that the salaries of the House of Representatives be decreased. But the question, as it appears to me, is whether it is in accordance with the fitness of things that either House should interfere with the salaries of the officers of the other. Ought not each House, as a matter of courtesy, to be allowed to regulate its own internal arrangements ? It never would be suggested that the House of Commons or the House of Lords should interfere with the internal arrangements of each other. I cannot speak for all the States of Australia, but I know that in South Australia such action could not be taken, because, under the Constitution Act of that State, the salaries of the officers of both Houses must be the same. This question may be considered from several aspects. What are the duties of the officers of the two Houses <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not think it possibly can be denied that, taken collectively, the officers of the House of Representatives have more work to do. </para>

                    <para>- There is a larger number of members in the House of Representatives, and the attendants have a larger number of rooms to look after ; and, therefore, as I say, they have collectively more work to do. But leaving out the Clerks at the table and the Sergeant at Arms in the one case, and the Usher of the Black Rod in the other, there are five men in the House of Representatives to do work which is done by two men in the Senate.. In the House of Representatives there is a Clerk of Papers and Accountant at £420,. and a Clerk of Records at £350. We have no such corresponding officer as the Clerk of" Records. In the House of Representatives there is an Assistant Clerk of Committees and Reading Clerk at £300, and we have no such corresponding officer. We have a. shorthand writer and typist at £180, and there is no such corresponding officer in the House of Representatives. There is an Assistant Reading Clerk at £200, and a junior clerk at £80, and we have no such corresponding officers. It will be seen,, as I say, that there are five officers in the House of Representatives to do work which is done by two officers in the Senate, and the officers of the House of Representatives receive £1,350 per annum, as compared with £568 paid to officers of the Senate. I mention these facts to show that the Senate officers have at least as much work to do individually as have the officers of the House of Representatives. , The question may be viewed from another point ; but I do not think either this or the other point of view I presented covers the main issue. It may be stated that the officers of the House of Representatives have a claim to higher salaries on the ground of longer service. But if we look at the facts, we shall find that there is very little in that argument. Although in some cases the officers of the House of Representatives may have a longer record of public service, in one case at least a Senate officer has the advantage in this respect. But taking all the facts into consideration, there is very little difference to be observed from that point of view. The Clerk of Papers in the Senate was appointed on 17th March, 1890,and the Clerk of Papers in the House of Representatives was appointed on the 1st August, 18S3 I am now alluding to officers appointed by the States and transferred to the Commonwealth -service ; and in the particular instance I have just mentioned, there is no -doubt that the House of Representatives officer can show a longer record than can the officer of the Senate. Our housekeeper was appointed on the 1st March, 1873, while the housekeeper of the House of Representatives was appointed on the 12th May, 1 <inline font-style="italic">'660,</inline> so, in that instance, our officer has the longer record. The President's messenger was appointed on 25th May, 1SSS, and the Speaker's messenger on the 1st February, 1875, which gives the advantage to the latter. But as I have already said, there is not much difference between the Houses from that point of view. I do not, however, place any great weight on these considerations, because this is a matter between the two Houses. The question is whether the officers of the Senate ought to receive the same remuneration as that paid to the officers of the House of Representatives. I crave the indulgence of the Senate to go back a little in order to explain how the discrepancies between the salaries have -arisen. In the first Estimates which were submitted, no  President  or  Speaker  was provided for on the matter of messengers, and the Treasurer, who is an ex-Treasurer of Victoria, adopted the Estimates of the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of that State. These Estimates, however, in this particular, were altogether out of place in reference to a Federal Senate, and the result was that our officers were provided with salaries a great deal smaller than those paid to the officers of the House -of Representatives. It was natural that there should be such a position of affairs in Victoria, because the Legislative Council sat for only a few hours a week, while the Legislative Assembly sat considerably longer, and provided more work for the officers. These discrepancies, however, as between the salaries, have been gradually wiped out during the three years of our existence, and- many of our officers and messengers are now paid salaries corresponding with those received by the officers -and messengers of the other House. In the particular cases to which I have referred, however, the discrepancies had not been removed, and at a meeting of the Senate House Committee, it was unanimously resolved, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> that the salaries of corresponding officers should be placed on an equal footing. Consequently, on the 19th June, I wrote a letter to the Treasurer, from which the following is an extract : - </para>

                <para>I may, however, add that the House Committee of the Senate expressed the unanimous opinion that the salaries of all officers, messengers, Sc. , of the Senate should be the same as the salaries of similar officers, messengers, &amp;c. , in the House of Representatives. </para>

            <para class="block">The Government recognised that the claim of the Senate to be a House of co-ordinate jurisdiction and power with the House of Representatives ought to be acknowledged, and they brought down the Estimates in such a way as to carry out the view expressed by the House Committee. I take it, therefore, that the Government will support the suggestion that the House of Representatives should be asked to restore the salaries in the particular cases I have mentioned to the amounts which appeared originally in the Estimates. I, personally, do not want to move that a request to that effect be sent to the House of Representatives, but would rather leave that duty to some other honorable senator. I think it my duty, however, to bring the matter forward, because it is one in which I think the Senate ought to take action. I confidently rely on the Government support, seeing that such a request would only be carrying out a part of the Government policy. </para>

                    <para>- I am very glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has brought this question before the Senate. I heard of the alteration in the Estimates, and I was rather surprised at the action of members of the House of Representatives. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> I have no desire to say that this reduction of salaries was an undue interference on the part of the House of Representatives with our affairs. No doubt the House of Representatives have a perfect right to reduce the Estimates as they please; but I think their action was in very bad taste, seeing that they at the same time ratified increases of salaries proposed for their own officers. In my opinion, the House of Representatives very unjustly interfered with increases of salaries which had been unanimously agreed to by our House Committee, and accepted by the Government. It may be urged that the officers of Parliament are fairly well paid. It must also be recognised, however, that the officers of Parliament have very responsible duties to perform. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is as much to blame as anybody for the scale on which members of the Federal Parliament are remunerated ; but that is not the question we are discussing at the present time. The officers of this Chamber have responsible duties to perform, and can show long and faithful service. They are trustworthy, obliging, and reliable, and if they receive higher wages than are paid to men occupying similar positions outside, that may be regarded as some return for a life-time spent in the Public Service. I am sure that the general public would not begrudge the increases which were sanctioned by the House Committee in the case of men who have carried out their duties so faithfully and well. There is no necessity for any lengthy debate on this matter. I am aware that in another place there was a good deal of misunderstanding when the question arose on the Estimates, and I believe that if we request the House of Representatives to restore the salaries to the figures originally proposed, very little objection will be raised.

                    <para>- The whole amount involved in the proposed increases is only £98, which, from a financial point of view, may be regarded as a mere nothing. The question is whether officers of the Senate, who perform duties quite as onerous as those performed by the officers of another place, shall not receive the same remuneration as is paid to the latter. It would have been more courteous and considerate on the part of the other House if it had left it to the Senate to decide what salaries should be paid to its officers. I do not think it would ever be proposed that the Senate should interfere with the salaries paid to the officers of the House of Representatives after the latter had decided on the amounts. I should like to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that the remuneration paid to the shorthand writer and typist employed in the Senate has been reduced from £200 to £188. Perhaps that item was overlooked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> when he introduced the subject. I shall move a request that the proposed increase be granted. In my opinion a typist and shorthand writer, capable of doing parliamentary work, is not too well paid at a salary of £200. The housekeeper and doorkeeper, who has been getting a. salary of £18S, has been in the ser- vice of the State and Federal Parliaments for thirty years. I am sure that it will be generally admitted that he has carried out his work faithfully and well. He is in charge of a staff, and is responsible for everything on this side of the building. He has to go on duty at an early hour, and to remain on duty until a late hour. He has to perform duties which the housekeeper on the other side has not to discharge. He has to act as doorkeeper as well as housekeeper, so that he is on duty during the day as well as during the night. He has been in the Public Service nearly twice as long as the housekeeper on the other side. It was proposed in the Estimates that these two officers should receive the same rate of salary, but the other House cut down the salary cf our housekeeper and doorkeeper by £30, and that I think was most unfair. He has also to distribute all the papers of the Senate. He has never had a day's holiday since this Parliament was opened. Soon, after the close of last session the State Parliament removed to this building, and it was necessary for him to remain here all the time to render to the Legislative Council similar service to that which he had rendered to the Senate. The Inter-State press-room is located on this side of the building, and therefore it has to be kept open until an unusual hour. I hope that the Committee will not hesitate to request that the proposed increase be granted. The increases for the Senate's officers involve a total sum of only £98. </para>

                    <para>- Before the question is put, I wish to draw attention to the salaries of other officers. We ought to be extremely careful of what we are doing. We know perfectly well that the finances of the Commonwealth are not in too healthy a condition, and the other House, which lias control of the purse, has - on the score of economy, I suppose - refused increases to certain officers who, I believe, do not receive over much as it is. I do not wish to refer to their salaries, but to draw attention to the extravagant sums paid to the President, the Chairman of Committees, and the two Clerks at the table. We might very well save £1,000 a year on those four officers. Honorable senators may think that it is heresy for me to talk in this fashion, but I conceive that I am merely doing my duty. What does the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the other House do to earn a salary of £1,500 - £400 as member and £1,100 as presiding officer. I consider that these officers are extravagantly paid. In all the States, in Canada, and, I believe, in the United States, the J salaries are fixed on a very much lower scale. In the States Parliaments the salaries of the Speakers average £1,000, and I am not very sure that it will not be reduced in the near future, now that the rage for economy is abroad. I would reduce the salaries of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the other House to £1,000 - namely, £400 as member and £600 as presiding officer, which I believe to be ample. Again, with regard to the salary of the Chairman of Committees- </para>

I know a number of honorable senators who would like to pay a premium for a seat in the Senate in the absence of payment of members. I consider that £750 for the Clerk of Parliaments and £650 for the Clerk Assistant would be handsome salaries. Last session I made some remarks about the Usher of the Black Rod and Clerk of Select Committees. We might be able to economise in his case. What he does for a salary of £550 I cannot discover. When I look at the Sergeant at Arms putting the mace on the table of the other House, taking it off, placing it below the table, returning to his seat and merely looking at the proceedings, I begin to wonder whether we are fit to conduct the business of the country when we vote for his office a salary of £550. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> laughs, but his mind is bound up in obsolete customs. No doubt he reverences the mace, and would like to see a mace in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- It ought to be taken away from the other House. In my opinion, the Clerk of Papers and Accounts is very well paid at £380 a year. So long as the officers do their duty their bread and water is sure. I do not know whether I should get any support if I moved a request for a reduction. I am afraid that I should not, but I think that this is a proper time to intimate that in the future the President may expect a reduction in his salary. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that this rule obtains in the States, except, perhaps, in the case of Victoria. It was provided in the Constitution Act of South Australia that the officers of the Legislative Council should receive the same salaries as the corresponding officers of the other House. After making inquiries I found that the duties which our officers were performing were quite equal to those of corresponding officers in the other House, and on that ground I asked the House Committee to recommend the Government to propose an increase for each officer. The increase was submitted on the Estimates as we desired, but to my regret it was struck off by the other House. In the circumstances the only course open to me is to assist honorable senators in carrying a request to the other House to reinstate the increase. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the Committee should only consider the question whether the officer is getting sufficient remuneration for the work which he is doing. That is the only reason which will influence my vote. If it can be shown to me that any officer of the Senate is not paid a fair salary I shall be prepared to vote for an increase, but not otherwise. Any argument that a corresponding officer in another place is getting a higher salary will not appeal to me in the slightest degree. I believe that it can be clearly shown that the housekeeper and doorkeeper is not receiving an adequate remuneration for his work. I am prepared to vote for an increase to his salary, but, after looking into the matter carefully, I am not prepared to vote for an increase to any other officer or to any messenger. The argument that the salaries of our officers should be the same as those of corresponding officers in the other House could be used as a reason why the latter should be reduced, so as to correspond with the former. I hope that the argument will not prevail with honorable senators. It was used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> and to some extent by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> Is a salary of £380 adequate for the work which is done by the Clerk of Papers and Accountant? It must be remembered that the salary is being fixed not for ' this year, but for a long time. Whatever sum may be decided upon now will not be reduced, but will probably be increased as the years go on. Will the tendency be towards long sessions ? Is it not a fact that, as our legislative powers are exhausted, the sessions will become shorter, and consequently the work of the officials will be lessened ? It should also be remembered that we had to take over certain officers from the States. We found that their salaries had been increased, until they were quite out of proportion to the importance of the work which they were doing. The natural consequence was an outburst of indignation throughout the Commonwealth, and, of course, some officers had to suffer. </para>

                    <para>- I have been anticipated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> This spurious sense of dignity which we are trying to assume lias no weight with me. I do not see why we should regard all these officers as being exact duplicates of the officers of the other House. As a matter of fact, when we look at the Estimates, we find that they are not. Yet the chief argument which was adduced by the honorable senator who introduced this discussion, but did not move a motion, was that we should put ourselves on precisely the same footing as the other House. He was followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who, until I interjected, was using the same argument, and trying to induce the Committee to vote for higher salaries, simply on the ground that the positions were paralleled by positions in the other House to which larger salaries were attached. I entirely indorse what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said. If that argument was any good, we should find ourselves in this disastrous position that, if the other House were guilty of extravagance, it would have to be duplicated by the Senate. We should find a majority in the Senate contending that whatever the officers of the House of Representatives received for work done' should be paid to officers performing similar duties for the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I am not advocating a reduction of salaries. The honesty of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in this matter makes his opinion preferable to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor;</inline> and I agree that we should pay full value for services rendered, giving as close attention to these matters as the items of the Appropriation Bill will allow. I see no reason why the officer who, in the Senate, occupies the position of housekeeper and doorkeeper, and to whom it is proposed that a salary of £205 shall be paid, should not receive £235, the salary paid to the housekeeper and doorkeeper of the House of Representatives, or possibly more. I instance that as a strong reason why we should not be bound down to a close parallel with the House of Representatives. I can conceive that the housekeeper and doorkeeper of the Senate may perform work which is better deserving of a salary of £240 than is the work performed by the officer holding a corresponding position in the House of Representatives deserving of a salary of £235. The argument that officers in the Senate should be placed exactly on the same footing as officers in another place, because it is right that we should assert some spurious sense of dignity, is to my mind valueless. I indorse the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that so far as we can we should pay value for services rendered. It is possible that I and other honorable senators may vote wrongly in this matter. The amount whch we think should be paid to the Clerk mght be right or wrong, but in such a case I should prefer to err on the right side so far as the officials are concerned, and would rather overpay than underpay them. I regard that as a healthy solution of the difficulty. But with respect to the housekeeper and doorkeeper I am perfectly satisfied that I shall be right in voting for an increase in his case. With regard to the other increases, I shall risk it and vote for them also. </para>

                        <para>- On the ground of economy. As President of the Legislative Council I strongly protested against this action. It is not just that the Legislative Assembly in that instance, or the House of Representatives in this, should single out officers of the other Chamber in order to make reductions in the salaries paid. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has referred to the housekeeper and doorkeeper in the Senate. I can say from my own knowledge that that officer has been here for over thirty years ; and I am at a loss to understand why it should be proposed to pay him a smaller salary than that paid to the housekeeper and doorkeeper of the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>- He ought to be paid fairly, and honorable senators must agree that it is very unfair that honorable members of the House of Representatives should propose to reduce the salaries of officers of the Senate. My contention has always been that the President of a Legislative Council, and, in this case, of the Senate, should frame his own estimates, and that these salaries for officials of the Senate should be voted <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> by honorable members of another place. I am quite sure that the  President  might be trusted to see that the salaries proposed to be paid to officers of the Senate are fair and just. He will probably be guided to some extent by what is done in another place, as well as by the services rendered by Senate officers. I ask honorable senators to protest against the practice of the House of Representatives of cutting down the salaries of officers connected with the Senate. If this is permitted we shall some day find the House of Representatives, when there is a little disturbance between the two Houses, showing their displeasure by striking off 25 or 30 per cent, of the salaries of officers of the Senate. That kind of thing has been done before in the State Parliament of Victoria. </para>

They have to discharge as important duties as the officers whose salaries we are now considering, and, speaking for myself, my vote upon this request will be very much influenced by the attitude which the Government propose to take. I wish to see justice done all round ; and, so far, it is not proposed that the salaries of the other messengers shall be increased. The messenger who looks after the papers performs as important, if not more important, duties than those performed . by the officer whose salary we are now considering ; and I wish to know whether it is intended to raise the salaries of all the messengers from £188 to £204. </para>

                        <para>- Then I am satisfied that I quoted the honorable and learned senator correctly. Such an argument is hopelessly bad, because it simply comes to this : that if the other House is extravagant, we must also be extravagant. The proposal is that we must increase a salary, not because the increase is deserved or has been earned, but because there has been extravagance elsewhere which we ought to live up to. I shall not vote for any increase of salary for a reason of that kind, and unless a better reason is submitted for this request I shall not support it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker's</inline> contention is correct an opportunity is afforded him to move that the salary of the Speaker's messenger be reduced to £188. We have so far heard no reason why the messengers attached to the President and Speaker should be paid more than the other messengers who are receiving a salary of £1S8 each. Being limited to the services of the President and Speaker, these officers would appear to have less to do than the ordinary messengers. Unless some satisfactory reason is given why the President's messenger should be paid more than other messengers, I shall vote against the proposed request. </para>

                    (Queensland - Attorney-General^. - In justice to this messenger, it should be said that his duties are not entirely confined to waiting upon the President. He is also exceedingly useful to Ministers. It is very hard to draw comparisons between the work performed by one messenger and another, especially in the case of a messenger who occupies a somewhat confidential position. The officer whose salary we -are now considering certainly performs services for Ministers which are of considerable value.

                    (Western Australia). - I wish to notify honorable senators that if this request is carried I intend to move requests that the salaries of the other messengers be increased by the same amount. We should not make any distinction between messengers, who, it appears to me, do equal work. It must be remembered that the President is away at the week end ; and that he will be away during the recess. Honorable members are constantly here, and at the week end the other messengers are on duty all day long in attendance upon them. I am of opinion that they do quite as much, if not more, work than that done by the President's messenger. I remind honorable senators that the Speaker's messenger last year received a salary of £204 : and the Senate permitted the disproportion to exist in last year's Estimates. I shall vote against the proposed increase ; and I certainly think that if we are fair to the other messengers we shall see that if a salary of £204 is given to one it shall be given to all.

                        <para>- If any mistake has been made the Government are responsible for it, and it is simply my duty as a senator to see that justice is done. It is absurd to ! say that messengers, who are at the beck and j call of every member of the Senate for the i whole of the year- and we know that they were required by senators during the recess - should be paid less than a messenger whose chief is away from the building for five or six months at a time. </para>

                    <para>- Some, one has described this as a question of economy, but in my opinion it is a question of giving equal pay for equal work performed. I shall not support any suggestion to recommend that the salary of the corresponding officer in the House of Representatives should be lowered, because I do not think that another place would consent to any such reduction. The proper course is to increase the salary of the President's messenger to £204 : but, if that course be taken, I contend that the salaries of the senior and junior messengers ought also to be increased. </para>

                        <para>- But we have also to bear in mind that, whereas there are nineteen officers in the House of Representatives, there are only sixteen in the Senate ; and that clearly proves that at the very least the Senate officers must do an equal amount of work. After all, these messengers receive very small salaries, and I know that, even when the House is not sitting, they are sometimes called upon to stay in the evening for the convenience of two or three members. If a comparison lias to be made, I am of opinion that these messengers ought to be considered before the President's messenger. </para>

                    or myself may be, they should not concern any honorable senator if we are trying to do what we think is right. So far as I understand, the recommendation for the increases of these salaries came from the House Committee, whose duty it is to inquire into all the circumstances. If that committee omitted to consider the claims of any messengers during last session, we can only hope that they will rectify the omission during next session. It would be throwing great discredit on the House Committee to ignore their work, and my belief is that they did their best to adjust the salaries according to the work. The request before the Committee is a proper one ; but if we begin to suggest amendments in connexion with matters which have not already been discussed in another place, difficulty will arise. Is that a wise course to pursue, even although we may believe that certain anomalies exist? It would be better to accept the recommendations of the House Committee, leaving it to that body, as soon as opportunity offers, to recognise any injustice which may have been done to any servant of Parliament. When
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    and other honorable senators argue so strongly as to the value of the work done, the question arises as to who is to estimate the value? If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    had to work for eight hours a day with a pick and shovel, he would expect to be paid £1,500 a year, when he compared that work with the work he does at the present time. Faithful service must sometimes be recognised. The services of an officer of Parliament, or any other institution, are not always to bo gauged by the amount of sweat that he sheds, but rather by the confidence that can be placed in him, and by the value he gives. I have every confidence in the recommendations of the House Committee, and, therefore, I shall support the request moved by

                    <para>- I should like to have a little information on one or two points. In the first place it is our duty to consider not only the interests of the officers, but also the interests of the taxpayers. On looking down the list of officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, I am inclined to think, comparing the salaries with those paid outside by private employers and by the States Governments, that their remuneration is fairly generous. I can quite understand that if a man, who is junior in length of service, and possibly lass efficient, is chosen as the President's or Speaker's messenger at a higher salary, it may cause friction and some dissatisfaction amongst the other messengers. I should like to know from the President, or the representative of the Government, whether the President's and Speaker's messengers were selected for length of service, or on any other special ground, and whether they are entitled apart from their special positions to any increase of salary? I am not inclined, as representing the taxpayers, to increase the salaries of the rest of the messengers. We have just agreed to a request for an increase of the salary of the typist and shorthand writer to £200 per annum, and, taking that as a correct standard of payment, I do not see that it is fair or right to give salaries of £200 to messengers whose work, is not so important. If the messengers were here to speak for themselves, I think they would recognise that, as between them and the taxpayers and other States servants, they occupy well-paid situations. We ought not to be dragged into a position which compels the Senate to increase these salaries, which, I understand, were increased only last year. If a man receives £3 10s. per week as a messenger, he is very fairly paid. I acknowledge sincerely the efficient and careful way in which the messengers do their business ; but at the same time I think they are adequately paid. If we are forced into increasing salaries all round, and the Government are compelled to take the step of receiving another message from the Governor-General, it would be better to face the question at once, and ascertain whether the President's messenger has any special claim to extra payment. If there is no such special claim, the salary ought to be left as it is, and a request made to the other House to reduce the salary of the Speaker's messenger. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline>
                    but I can only answer it partially. I cannot say anything about the reasons which induced the Speaker to select his messenger. In my own case, my present messenger entered the Public Service in South Australia in 1888, and was messenger for a very long time. He is a most efficient messenger, who does his work very well, and that is the reason I chose him.

                        <para>- What have we got to do with Governor-General's messages ? The Government, will have to attend to that. Let honorable senators have the courage of their opinions. I claim that if the services of one messenger who only attends upon one senator are worth £204 per annum, the services of other messengers who are at the beck and call of every senator ought to be paid for at the same rate. I do not think that any honorable senator can give any reason why this request should not be supported. Why should the President's messenger be singled out for an increase ? </para>

The one devotes his services to a single member of the Senate, whilst the services of the other messengers are busily engaged upon the requirements of thirty-five other senators. </para>

Seeing that we have proposed to increase the salary of one of the messengers who is junior to some of those who are receiving £188 per annum, we ought to be consistent, and increase the salaries of the latter. </para>

                        <para>- The question did not come before the House Committee. If it had, the anomaly that appears on the original Estimates would not have remained if my vote could have altered it. We ought to put the messengers on a level. It is very hard to grade the work they have to do, and to determine which of them has the most onerous duties to discharge. But seeing that some of the messengers who receive £188 are senior to the one whose salary it is proposed to increase to £204, I shall vote for the request. </para>

We have power to make regulations and to classify officers. We have not done that yet. As a matter of fact, it depends to a very considerable degree upon the action of the two Houses as to whether we ought to do it or not, or as to whether the salaries of officers of Parliament should not be fixed. That is a question to be decided. In the meantime, the Speaker put down this amount to provide for possible increments, but I did not put down any sum. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to have some information from the Vice-President of the Executive Council with respect to the attendant in connexion with the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. Is it a fact that that officer is very frequently on duty from 10 in the morning till 2 o'clock the following morning ? Apparently he is in the unfortunate position of being nobody's child. He has to attend both the Senate and the House of Representatives. He has to obtain the quotations which honorable senators use, and to see that they are returned. I am under a deep debt of gratitude bo him in that regard, and that is what prompts me to ask for some information. </para>

                        <para>- It is assumed by some honorable senators that in the future a session of Parliament will not last for more , than a month or two. I fell into a similar blunder on looking at the records of the American Senate. Desirous of judging how long we should be likely to sit, I turned up the <inline font-style="italic">Congressional Record</inline> one day and I found that day after day the Senate met at 2.30 and adjourned at 3.30 p.m., and that it sat for only two or three months in the year. I feel sure that for the next five years a session of this Parliament will last for seven or eight months, and when we have exhausted our legislative powers and made a reputation throughout the Commonwealth, the States will be only too anxious to give us more powers. In New South Wales, for instance, there is a proposal - which, to my mind, is ridiculous - to abolish the State Parliament and to hand over its powers to this Parliament. We shall be in session for some time every year, and we ought to see that the attendants are fairly treated. For sixteen years, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> attendant was engaged in the Government Printing Office of New South Wales. His work was mostly in connexion with the publication of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> He came into the service of the Commonwealth with practical knowledge. No person but a practical printer would be of any use in the position. </para>

Frequently he is in attendance from 10 o'clock one morning until 2 o'clock next morning. All the recreation leave he received last recess was a fortnight. He had to assist in the distribution <inline font-style="italic">of Hansard,</inline> and to address envelopes and so forth. It is stated on the best authority that he does five times as much work as is done by other attendants who get more salary. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know this, officer, but I can quite believe that during; the session his hours are long. The hours, of a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> official are often very long, but I can hardly believe that the attendant is hard at work all the time. Probably th&amp; work is congenial to him, and he feels that, he is working his way up to a better position. I dare say it is a position which scores and scores of men would break their necks to get. We cannot increase salaries, all round by big jumps every year ; the taxpayers would not stand it. If the services of this officer are appreciated, as they" evidently are, I think he should be satisfied. No doubt he is satisfied, but some of his friends who have a very high opinion of his services would like to see him more generously treated. Probably, If inquiries, were made, it would be found that he is. satisfied with the increase of £10 which he received this year. </para>

There is no possibility of the Governor-General being asked to send down a fresh message this session, so that we should be only making ourselves ridiculous by requesting an increase in this salary. But I hope that the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will cause the President and the Speaker to make full inquiries into .the position of the attendant, and that, if they find that anything more can be done, it will, on the first opportunity, be done. On the understanding that the attendant's salary will be increased by £10 a year until he reaches the status of a senior messenger, I. think it will be well for my honorable friend to withdraw his motion. </para>

                    that an increase should not be proposed because a hundred persons outside would be glad to get the position. If the position of a Minister were put up to tender, probably he would find that thousands would be willing to take less than £1,500 a year, and if the office of Attorney-General, with the right to appear before the High Court, were put up for "tender, he would find that very many persons would be perfectly willing to appear, and to mark a brief, not fifty or one hundred guineas, but, probably, ten guineas, while the refreshers would be a guinea instead of twenty-five guineas. Neither the Commonwealth nor the State should take advantage of the necessities of the people to compel their servants to work for less than a fair thing. If it is not a fair thing that the

There is a "bust "on record already in the 100 bottles of champagne he gave to the unemployed. If we have money to spend in this way there are several of our public men who might be so honoured.

No doubt he was extremely zealous in that regard, but he did nothing to entitle him to this distinction. I shall support the motion.

His final action, in respect to the Governor-Generalship, was an insult to the Commonwealth. That is my opinion, and I am here to express it. I would just as soon vote for the expenditure of £200 to erect a bust to one of the Chirnsides, who got about three times the value of their land at Werribee from the Victorian Government, as I would vote for a bust of the Marquis of Linlithgow, who has received nearly double its value for land situated not far from the Firth of Forth. He is not Governor-General now ; I may say what I like about him, and I intend to do so. I am not going to toady to those people, who, under the guise of patriotism, avail themselves of every opportunity to fleece the country to which they belong.

If they are not prepared to assist the poor and lowly, I am not going to assist them to honour a person who never did anything to recommend himself to me. </para>

He came here without any intention to make his home in the Commonwealth, but merely for the honour of the position which he held. We have heard lately of another distinguished visitor who will not have his children educated as Australians. He proposes to go to the old country, because he desires his children to be educated amongst the boys and girls who will be their friends in after life. The claims of these distinguished visitors ought not to be considered before those of Australian statesmen. </para>

                    Parkes were alive and were a member of the Senate he would support it, and he would deprecate any such action as is now proposed to be taken. There are a great many busts of

                    Parkes in Australia to-day ; but I do not know that there are any of the first Governor-General of the Commonwealth. We do not form a Commonwealth of Australia every day, nor yet every century ; and we shall be doing honour to ourselves and to the Commonwealth by a due recognition of those who fill the very responsible office of Governor-General. I do not think it necessary to say any more. I hope honorable senators will carry the Government proposal.

                            as a representative of the people, does his duty in trying to lead public opinion in certain matters, and he is of much more consequence than he seems to think, and of much more consequence than was the late Governor-General.

                            I should vote for the Pulsford bust. But I do not believe in wasting money in this fashion ; we have no £200 to fling away here and there on pieces of marble. This, I suppose, is a precedent, and a bust will be requested for the present Governor-General when his term expires. It will be pointed out that as we have a bust of the first Governor-General, we must complete the set. Why not have busts of all the senators? There are thirty-six of us, and £200 would allow £5 or £6 for a decent representation of each of the first senators of the Australian Commonwealth ; and I consider that we are of much more importance to the community than ever was the late Governor-General. I trust that the Government will not insist on this idiotic vote. Does the Vice-President of the Executive know how the sale of this bust was manoeuvred ?

In this the Commonwealth is following the example of older and more foolish communities, although I thought that we were wiser in Australia. My idea was that, being a democratic community, we should not stoop so low as to toady to Scotch noblemen. In Scotland noblemen are so plentiful that we pay no regard to them, and I can only suppose that it is their scarcity which makes them so valued in Australia. In Scotland we are all noblemen - we are all sons of kings - and no one is better than another. Out here the Australian community appears to be suddenly afflicted with- </para>

That is not because I think <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes was the great man <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> would lead us to believe he was, but because I think he did much more service for Australia than did the late Governor-General. </para>

It will be a. great mistake if this vote is not passed. In years to come there will, no doubt, be a Commonwealth picture gallery containing statuary and busts of celebrated men who have done good work for the nation, and it would be a great pity if there were not included a memorial of the first Governor-General. I disagree with the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> because I believe it was very necessary indeed for us to have a gentleman like the present Marquis of Linlithgow in the position of first Governor- General. No better choice could possibly have been made, and the late Governor-General did great service for the Commonwealth. For the, comparatively speaking, small sum proposed we shall be able to obtain a very good bast of our first Governor-General, and we ought to aVail ourselves of the opportunity. If we do not we shall certainly regret the fact. </para>

I speak with a little experience, because, some years after the death of a relative of my own, it was -desired to have a bust of him executed. We sent the best photographs obtainable of him to England, and paid 300 guineas to an eminent sculptor, and when the bust came out no one who was interested could tell for whom it was intended. If we are to have a bust of our first Governor-General it ought to be executed during his life, and I am sure -we all wish that he may live for many years to come. May I here suggest that when the name of the Federal Capital is under consideration, that of our late Governor-General will, not be forgotten. </para>

                    <para>- I am somewhat in a difficulty as to how to vote in this matter ; but I certainly think that the late Governor-General was treated exceedingly well in the Commonwealth. I am also of opinion, however, that he did a great injustice to the Commonwealth by creating an impression in England that we are desirous of having a Governor-General who is able, and ought, to spend something like £20,000 per annum of his own money in maintaining the dignity of his position. That idea is still existent in the minds of the people of England, and only a short time ago I saw in a newspaper satisfaction expressed that the (Governor-General elect is rich enough to be able to spend some of his own private income while in Australia. Considering the manner in which the late Governor-General was treated in the Commonwealth, he ought not to have created such an impression in England. If we have any cause to be grateful, it is to our present Governor-General, who has set a very good example in living within his official income, or, at any rate, if he is not doing so, is not saying anything about his having to resort to his private means. The people of the Commonwealth are quite willing that the Governor-General should live in any manner he chooses, expecting nothing more from him than he is willing to spend ; and I feel it very deeply that we should have been so unjustly criticised in England. The present vote is so small that one does not like to vote against it, but if I should do so, it would be as a protest against the wrong impression which has been created, namely, that Australians are extremely anxious to extract about twice as much from a Governor-General as they are willing to pay him. I have never mentioned this matter in the Senate before, but I think this a fitting opportunity to express my disapproval of the action of the late Governor-General. At the same time we might as well continue the generosity we have shown in the past, and expend £200 on a bust, not so much on account of the Marquis of Linlithgow personally, as to have a memorial of the man who by good fortune happened to be the first Governor-General, and who will go down to posterity as such. It is possible that in time to come the people may forget the unjust remarks which the late Governor-General made in regard to ourselves. </para>

                        <para>- It was circulated that one of the reasons why he retired was that the people of Australia make such large demands upon their Governor-General. In that respect he gave a very wrong and false impression with regard to the people of Australia. But, nevertheless, as the amount is so small, and as the bust is to commemorate the first Governor-General, I shall not vote against it. </para>

                    LARGIE (Western Australia). - It is very unfortunate that this item should find a place in the Bill. It compels those of us who are not at all pleased with the impression left by the late Governor-General when retiring from his office to say what we think of him. It compels us to make comparisons which otherwise we should be glad to refrain from making. It would have been better had the Government considered the unpopularity of the late Governor-General when he left Australia.

                        <para>- With public opinion generally, excepting the small class who are ever ready to pander to men in his position. There are certain people who would be ready to lick the boots of a man in the position of the Governor-General, no matter what he did. But the late Governor-General was undoubtedly unpopular on account of the position he took up in respect to the allowance paid to him. Those of us who hold that opinion are bound to state that we do not think he is worthy of this honour. If we are to erect busts, there are scores of men who are more entitled to the honour than is the Marquis of Linlithgow. What about the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and the first leader of the Senate, both of whom did good work and deserve some recognition of this character? It is deplorable that the matter should have been introduced, and I hope that the Committee will support the request. </para>

The Marquis of Linlithgow spent his money freely, and did everything that a mortal man could do. Indeed, he did more than his strength permitted, and, as his health gave way, he had to retire. Of course, the labour crowd will do everything they can against any man in the Marquis of Linlithgow's position. They are against all Governors and all high officials, except such as are in sympathy with their ilk. </para>

                    <para>- I notice that the expenditure on clerks is increased from £1,210 to £1,790, and that the number of officers has been increased by two. I wish to know from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> - first, what has necessitated the increases ; secondly, whether the Public Service Commissioner was asked to report as to the necessity for the increases, and, if so, whether the two additional officers were appointed at his request ? We went to a great deal of trouble to enact that all appointments to the Public Service should be made on the recommendation of the Commissioner. Whenever we desire to ventilate a grievance in connexion with the administration of the Public Service, we are referred to the Commissioner, and we ought to have a guarantee from the Government that they are observing the law relating to appointments. It seems to me that during the past year no additional work has been laid on this Department to necessitate the appointment of two additional officers. It is charged with the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. It has been stated by the Sub-Collector of Customs, at Fremantle, that he is hindered in the performance of his official duties by the want of an officer to carry out the administration of that Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> in answer to a question, has said that the Government did not think it was necessary to appoint an officer, as they were not aware that the number of Asiatics was increasing in Western Australia. It is the duty of this Department to see if the Act is accomplishing its object and to stop the influx of Asiatics. If they had taken the trouble to look through the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register</inline> of Western Australia, they would have found that the number of Asiatics is increasing. Although we are asked to vote for the Secretary to this Department £800, and for ten clerks £1,790, or, in all, £3,465 for salaries, still the officers are not aware that the number of Asiatics is increasing in Western Australia. It exists for the purpose of seeing that Asiatics do not come into Australia ; but I can prove from the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register</inline> that the Asiatic population is increasing at the rate of 90 per month. </para>

                    <para>- I am not going into the question of whether or not the Department ought to have known that there was an increase in the number of Asiatics in Western Australia, but I shall answer the inquiry in reference to the increased expenditure. A chief clerk, receiving a salary of £600 was dispensed with last year, and the Department has been furnished with three extra clerks, of whom two had been temporarily employed. If the item £600 for the chief clerk is added to the appropriation of £1,210 for seven clerks last year, it will be found that the total exceeds the sum of £1,790, which we are asked to vote for ten clerks this year. Last year the total vote for </para>

                <para>Salaries for the Department was £3,415, and this year we are asked to vote a sum of £3,465. The difference, I suppose, is required to pay increments which are due under the Public Service Act. Although we are actually saving money, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> thinks that we are working the Department more expensively than formerly. "We are doing nothing of the sort. </para>

I asked whether the appointment of the two additional officers had been recommended by the Commissioner ; but to that question he has not replied.

                    <para>- There is a saving of £20 in these salaries. Last year there was a chief clerk at £b'00 and seven other clerks at £1,210, making £1,S10 for the clerical staff, including the chief clerk. Provision is made this year for ten clerks at £1,790, which is a saving of £20 in the expenditure for clerical services. The total vote for the Department is a little more, because there is an increase for messengers from £180 to £200, and a vote of £50 to provide for increments and adjustments of salaries. So far as the clerical staff is concerned, there is exactly a saving of £20, and this has has -arisen because the high salaried chief clerk at £600 has left the Department, and his place has been filled by promotion from below at a reduced salary. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to impress upon the Government the necessity for carrying out the promise given by the ex-Prime Minister to appoint a special officer to look after the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. .From the Government returns for Western Australia there would appear to be an alarming increase in the number of Asiatics, and if any new appointments are to be made in the department, that promise by the ex-Prime Minister should be borne in mind. The Government should see to it that something is done to enable them to exercise some control over the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. If it is not properly administered it will be a failure, and I am sure no honorable senator desires that it should be. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie's fears on the subject of the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, so far as it effects the pearling industry of Western Australia, are groundless. The Federal Government has in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> S. Wharton an official who is most careful in the performance of his duties. He keeps a register which shows exactly when every coloured person is introduced for the pearling fleet, what boat he is employed upon, the term of his engagement, when he leaves Broome, and what boat he goes by. Every pearler employing a coloured man is required to deposit a bond for £100 that the man at the end of his term of engagement shall be brought into the office at Broome and if not re-engaged shall be deported by the first boat. I may say also that in order to avoid personation each coloured man is photographed when he arrived, and at the end of his term each man is compared with the photograph previously taken. I spent half a day going through this register and I found that with but a single exception every coloured man introduced in connexion with the pearling industry, not only since the passage of the Commonwealth Act, but .since the passage of the first State Immigration Act, has been accounted for. A mistake has been made in the return in including, amongst people coming to reside in Western Australia men who have been engaged for the pearling industry, and who must be returned when their term of engagement is up. I am in a position to say that the officials at Broome are overworked. In the laying-up season, when the men come in to be paid off the officials are working day and night, and their duties are carried out with the greatest strictness. A few months before I visited Broome some coloured people came down from Singapore, and a wire was received from the Attorney-General refusing them permission to land. The reason for this refusal was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wharton</inline> had not followed the usual procedure of writing to the Government asking for the permission and giving reasons why ; it should be granted. When he wired for permission, and gave the reasons, these men were allowed to land. When I was there the Act was' being administered with the greatest care, and it would be well if the same strict administration were adopted at 1 </para>

                <para>Thursday Island. There was no such.. administration up to the time of the passage of the Commonwealth Act, and coloured people were allowed to land at Thursday Island without any condition at all. It is most regrettable to find that there are about 2,000 coloured people at Thursday Island, and employed in the pearling fleets in those waters, who are at liberty to travel to any part of Australia as soon as their term of engagement is up. At Broome, with the exception of about 100 men, who were introduced before the first State Immigration Act was passed, and who are called " free men," the coloured men employed . in the pearling industry only came into the place in the laying-up season ; they can do no work on shore, because, if they do their employers are liable to a heavy fine, and they must either be deported or go off in the boats as soon as the pearling season starts. So far as Broome is concerned, there is no danger to the Commonwealth, but the way in which affairs have been conducted by the State Government at Thursday Island was scandalous. We find, also, that at the present time thousands of Chinese are coming from the Northern Territory of ' South Australia to all parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- Looking into the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, I wondered that the cost should be only £750, but I find in the miscellaneous division a further item of £900 for payment to Customs officers employed in connexion with the administration of the Act. This brings the cost of its administration up to £1,650 a year. I take the liberty of suggesting that next year these items should be brought together, in order that we may see what the administration of the Act i-s really costing the Commonwealth. </para>

If an honorable senator desires to find out exactly what is going on in any of the Departments, he has to read through a long rigmarole about the Governor-General and the Commonwealth of Australia, and, when the grain of wheat is winnowed from this bushel of chaff, he finds that some messenger is to be temporarily appointed at some outlying place in the Commonwealth. I sent an example of a Customs advertisement to the Minister for Trade and Customs, showing the number of unnecessary repetitions. I ask Ministers representing the Government in the Senate to bring their influence to bear in this matter, and see whether they cannot get the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> published on common-sense lines. </para>

Government notices used to be fully advertised in the newspapers, but we have adopted the practice of inserting a short notice in the local newspapers directing attention to notices in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> is circulated to police magistrates, postmasters, and so on, in order that the people interested in the announcements may have an opportunity of perusing it. That we may get the full advantage of this practice, it is necessary that the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> should be largely circulated. Last year the vote of £1,000 was exceeded, and that is the reason why a larger vote is now asked for. It necessarily follows that as the operations of the Commonwealth Government are extended, it becomes more expensive to publish the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette.</inline> I do not anticipate that the vote asked for ast year will this year be largely exceeded, ut it was not thought safe to only ask for £1,000. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit this motion as a protest against the action of the Government in dropping the Papua (British New Guinea) Bill. That measure was introduced into the other House, where it was considered at considerable length, and went into Committee. But because the principle of land alienation was condemned, and a provision was inserted prohibiting the sale of liquor, it was dropped. The administration of British New Guinea is being carried on under ordinances, under which it is possible for the fee-simple of the most valuable land to be sold. Seeing that the Government opposed the principle of preventing the alienation of land, it is reasonable to assume that they are willing to part with the fee-simple. When we have an opportunity of dealing with the Bill we shall be able to test the point, and to say whether land shall be sold or not. I feel satisfied that the Bill as amended by the House of Representatives would have been passed by the Senate in a few hours, and I submit this motion for the purpose of giving an opportunity to honorable senators to protest against the action of the Government in practically refusing to accept the decision of the House of Representatives and in not giving the Senate a chance of expressing an opinion. </para>

                    <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will recognise that if the Papua. (British New Guinea) Bill had been passed, including the amendments made in it by the House of Representatives, it would have been necessary largely to supplement the grant. The amount voted is calculated upon the receipts and the expenditure in New Guinea. It is estimated that a certain amount of revenue will be received from the sale of land, and a certain amount from the sale of liquors. I am not saying a word as to whether it is desirable that the amendments in question should be made or not ; but I am endeavouring to emphasize the point that if those amendments were made, and the Bill were passed in that form, the grant of £20,000 would not be sufficient. </para>

                <para class="block">The sale of liquors to the natives is prohibited, and the revenue is derived from the sales to white men. That consideration justifies the Government in determining at this late stage of the session to allow the measure to stand over for reconsideration until next session. I do not think the honorable senator need have any fear that land will be alienated in large quantities. In the past, whenever attempts were made to alienate land in British New Guinea, there was such a strong expression of public opinion against it that the sales did not take place. Probably if the Possession continues to be governed by ordinances as in the past, there will be no large sales of public land, or no sales whatever. '.Che House of Representatives, having made important alterations in the Bill, it was not unreasonable that the Government should allow the matter to stand over. To do so was not expressing a judgment one way or the other upon the merits of the amendments, but was simply a recognition of the fact that if they had been made Parliament would be faced with the necessity of making larger provision in aid of the revenue of British New Guinea. I think that the Government, under all the circumstances, has done quite right. </para>

                    <para>- The line of argument adopted by the Attorney-General is a peculiar one. Of course he is quite justified in making out the best case he can for the Government, but it is clear that the will of another place has been plainly indicated in a certain direction, and that the Government refused to carry out that will. The House of Representatives declared against the alienation of land in British New Guinea - or, as I prefer to call it, Australian New Guinea - and also indicated their disapproval of the sale of intoxicating liquors there. I have not the least doubt that if the Bill had been sent up to the Senate it would have been accepted, and those provisions would then have become the will of Parliament. The Government practically say, " We are not going to fight against the will of Parliament, but we are going to defeat it in another way." The Attorney-General tells us that if the amendments had been carried, it would have been necessary for Parliament to vote a larger sum in aid of the Government of British New Guinea. Did not the House of Representatives know that it would be necessary to vote a larger sum if Parliament prohibited the sale of intoxicating liquors and the alienation of Crown lands ? They knew it as well as the Government did, and were prepared to take the consequences. I am sure that the Senate would also have been prepared to take the consequences. But the House of Representatives recognised that the ultimate results would be beneficial to Papua and the Commonwealth. They were not looking merely to the results this year or next year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is quite justified in submitting his proposal, if only for the purpose of affording an opportunity to honorable senators to indicate to the Government the feeling of the Committee upon this question. Although the motion may not be carried, I trust that when honorable senators have spoken, the Government will take good care that the expression of opinion will be regarded as sufficient warrant to prevent them from selling Crown lands in Papua. The Attorney-General says that the Government will not permit the sale of large areas. But in the early days land was sold in small areas in the city of Melbourne, and it has been made clear that those sales were to the detriment of the revenue of Victoria. I trust that land will not be sold in New Guinea in any areas whatever. If it is sold, it will, in the future, be a source of regret to the people of the Commonwealth and to those who are living in Papua. I trust that as early as possible next session a measure will be passed making it impossible for the same conditions to exist in New Guinea as have existed in Victoria and other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    motion will be carried. The members of another place and honorable senators have very good cause to complain of the conduct of the Government. They brought in a Bill relating to the management of the affairs of New Guinea, and because certain provisions to which the Government were opposed were carried in the other House, they dropped it. That course of conduct may be constitutional, and in accordance with the custom of Governments, but, taking all the circumstances into account, it was altogether discreditable. What a fine Government it is that we have got ! How accommodating it is ! It brings certain measures before Parliament - very important measures ; it allows Parliament to mangle them in any way it pleases, and it accepts the amendments in the most meek and humble fashion. They are passed in a torn and tattered condition. That is how the Government act with regard to certain Bills. I will name one of them, which must be fresh in the recollection of honorable senators. I refer to the High Court Bill. What a brave measure it was when it was introduced into the House of Representatives ! What a poor, pitiable, wretched spectacle it was when it emerged ! But the Government accepted it. Why ? Because members of the Government were interested in it. I give that by way of illustration. Here we have a Bill regarding Papua. I have hitherto known that country under the name of British New Guinea ; I prefer to call it Australian New Guinea. Petition after petition was poured in upon both Houses from the people of the Commonwealth, praying Parliament to prohibit the sale of intoxicants in New Guinea. One portion of Parliament did prohibit the sale - and very properly so. We know perfectly well what the result will be if the sale of spirituous liquors is allowed in a country inhabited by somewhere about half-a-million of coloured people. We also know the value of the statement that spirituous liquors are not allowed to be sold to the natives. We are perfectly well aware that they get it. Now the Government raises the plea that if the sale of spirituous liquors and the alienation of land were prevented it ' would diminish the revenue of the Territory. My contention is that the House of Representatives, when it passed those amendments, accepted the responsibility in connexion with them. AVe have government by Parliament. Of course the House of Representatives did not kick out the Government when its bidding was not done. I do not know exactly why it was not done, but if that wholesome lesson were administered occasionally, the power of Parliament and government by the people, instead of by a few men, would be established. I was amused very much by the speech of the Attorney-General. One portion of his speech was based on the assumption that if land sales were prohibited the revenue would be very much les
                    <inline font-style="italic">i,</inline>
                    but when he was trying to soothe the fears of honorable senators in this corner, he said, " We shall not be able to sell any land, and, if we do, it will be sold in only very small quantities." I consider that the wish of the large majority of the members of the other House ought to have some weight with the Government. Either the Government intend to sell land, and to allow liquor to be sold - which things I believe to be bad - or they do not. If they do not intend to do these things, why do they not ask the Parliament to pass the measure this session ? But if they do intend to do these things - and that is the conclusion I have come to - they ought to say so and let us know exactly where we stand. I do not know whether they realize the gravity of the task which has been undertaken by the Commonwealth in taking possession of this territory. We find that almost everywhere the native coloured races disappear after the advent of the white man. They are poisoned by drink ; they acquire diseases which are unmentionable ; they learn the habits of the white man, and the consequence is that, in a very short time, they disappear. In these matters the Commonwealth ought to lead the nations of the world. We ought to show that it is possible to govern a country of semi-barbarians in a Christian and humane fashion. We ought to save them on the one hand from the evils which have been shown to follow in the train of intoxicants, and, on the other hand, from the extortions of the land grabber. I believe that British New Guinea contains a large area of very fertile land, has a very good climate and excellent rainfall, and offers many inducements to persons to settle there. If those conditions prevail, we may very reasonably come to the conclusion that in the future, if not soon, there will be an overflow of population from Australia to the island. Therefore, it is our duty to lay down the lines on which its mode of government ought to proceed. I need not refer to the evils which follow in the train of the liquor traffic, because they must be apparent to everybody. But, with regard to the land question, we find that in each State of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that its population is so sparse and its territory so large, the Government are compelled to buy back land from private holders so as to make settlement possible. That is the supreme question in Australia. We are laying down rules for the government of a new country with all this experience to guide us, and yet the Ministry deliberately cast every lesson of the past and the present to the winds, and cling to the old system of land sales. I believe that it is a question of revenue, more or less, but surely the resources of civilization are not exhausted. There are sources of taxation, and I believe very rich sources, which have not yet been tapped, and which, if tapped, would conduce to the progress of civilization. What are the Government going to do ? I suppose that we need not expect to see the Bill this session, and goodness knows what will happen next session, or who will be here. I think that, in order to mark its disapproval of the action of the Government, the Committee ought to vote for the motion of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline>
                    We do not wish to harm the Government, but simply to show that we do not approve of their dropping a measure simply because it cannot be carried according to their particular ideas. We have government by the people, for Parliament represents the people, and the members of the Ministry are merely a Committee of Parliament. If we agree to the motion we shall simply assert the right of Parliament, not the Ministry, to govern.

                    <para>- I hope that the Committee will reject the motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has alluded to government by the people. I read recently that at a public meeting in Samarai, the Anglican Bishop and the London Missionary J Society's agent, the Rev. W. Abel, regretted the possibility of this Bill being passed. These gentlemen, I take it, possess a better local knowledge than does any honorable senator, not even excepting the Columbus of Australia, who, I believe, visited the Possession not very long ago. If the importation of spirits and narcotics were prohibited, it would lead to an immense amount of smuggling across the German border, and necessitate the introduction of a large coastal guard system, and conse- I quently an increase in the annual subsidy. I My impression is that we shall do well to listen to the advice of the local authori- j ties before we proceed any further. Those who think that the Government have acted wrongly ought to have brought forward a ] motion of want of confidence. One thing for which I think the Ministry deserve great credit is the postponement of legislation 1 on this subject until the voice of those best able to speak can have been heard. The question of the acquisition of British New Guinea was not discussed at the time when the members of this Parliament were being elected, and those who think that the Government have acted unwisely may have an opportunity at the next elections to express their opinion. For some years the Possession has been governed by a Legislative Council, and surely its members ought to know what is best for the people. I would recommend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to pay a visit to the island and see whether it is a place to which white men would care to take their wives. In many cases the civil servants will not allow their wives to live in the island, because the climate is so bad, and they are obliged to maintain their families in Australia, to which they come from time to time. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will visit the island before he repeats the statement that it is an attractive place for our surplus population. Although it has been a British Possession for nearly twenty years, still the British population numbers only 400 or 500. The persons in control of the Possession have surely much more local knowledge than we can have, and yet some honorable senators are prepared to be guided by their own limited knowledge. An annual grant of £20,000 is little enough ; to supplement the local revenue, and if the importation of spirits and narcotics were j prohibited it would have to be increased. </para>

I was reading some of the Epistles of St. Paul the other day, and he says in effect, that one man's faith will enable him to eat anything, whilst another man's faith may be so weak that he can only eat vegetables. That applies also to drink. Certain people can take drink, and others cannot. I can understand honorable senators who believe in the prohibition of the liquor traffic, and who are teetotalers themselves supporting the prohibition of the liquor traffic in New Guinea, but . 1 cannot understand members of Parliament who are not teetotalers, and who take a little wine for their stomachs' sake, refusing to allow white people in New Guinea to get any liquor. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> could not have heard what I just said. The honorable senator will remember that in the early days of the settlement of New South Wales, the Britishers who came to the colony were attacked by miasma, malarial fever, and such diseases ; but these malarial troubles disappear as new countries become settled. I have no doubt that in some years' time this will be found to be the case in New Guinea. I say that we shall be proceeding upon wrong lines if we endeavour to enforce a provision of this kind in New Guinea. The proper course to adopt is to teach the people of New Guinea self-control. We can never advance if we require to have a number of policemen following us round to see that we do not do certain things. Men must be taught to rely upon themselves, and honorable senators will admit that it is the principle of self-restraint and self-control, inculcated during the last fifty years, that has -been effective in doing away with a good deal of drunkenness. At one time it was deemed to be the correct thing for a man to fall under the table from drink. We read in history that boys were kept for the purpose of loosening the neckties and collars of gentlemen who fell under the table from the effects of drink. It was then deemed to be quite a gentlemanly thing for a man to become intoxicated ; whilst the man who becomes intoxicated now in any company is looked upon with disdain and contempt. I am I very glad to find that the feeling is growing, and that there is not now anything like the same amount of drunkenness as there used to be throughout the civilized world. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that that is so. I have no knowledge of the Alexandra Club, or of the women's clubs in the old country that have licences to sell drink. We all know that there has been a great improvement amongst the people of Australia in this respect, and though drinking is carried on to a great extent in the old country, it is not nearly so prevalent now as it was some years ago. The proper lines upon which to proceed are those which will inculcate self-reliance; and the way in which we should deal with the liquor question in New Guinea is not to prohibit liquor, but to put the traffic in liquor under State control, that no temptation may be offered to individuals to sell adulterated liquor in order to fill their pockets. I hope the Government will have the courage to proceed with the Papua Bill. I am sure that a majority of the members of the Federal Parliament are in favour of trying an experiment in land nationalization in New Guinea. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> said that it was unlikely that there would be any revenue from land in New Guinea unless we allowed land to be sold, but there would certainly be some revenue derived from land under a system of land nationalization. </para>

                        <para>- The banking instinct in the honorable senator got uppermost, and he said we should make some money out of it. Surely it is not a good reason for allowing the liquor traffic to be carried on in New Guinea that we should derive revenue from it? I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in what he has said with respect to the nationalization of land in New Guinea. If I had my way I should not sell an acre of land in that territory. I should prefer to allow people to occupy it for a generation for nothing, in order that they, might open up the country. I do not know that any Act which we can frame will keep liquor out of New Guinea, and if a rich gold-field is discovered there many means of getting liquor will be devised, notwithstanding any prohibition we may pass ; but it is the duty of members of this Parliament to, as far as possible, keep it from the aboriginal natives of the country. </para>

                    <para>- I am very glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has made a proposal for a reduction in this vote as a protest against the action of the Government. When we come to analyze the motives which have actuated the Government in withdrawing the New Guinea Bill, we shall find that the}' do not redound to their credit. They introduced the Bill with the full intention of carrying it, but because honorable members of the House of Representatives, directly representing the people of Australia, carried two amendments providing for the prohibition of the liquor traffic and the nationalization of land in New Guinea, the Government withdrew the Bill. I say, unhesitatingly, that their action has been an unwarrantable misuse of the functions of a representative Government. The Government have no right to flout the will of the people. The people's representatives decided that the Bill should be amended in a certain way, and the Government have snapped their fingers in the face of the people of Australia. We are placed in an anomalous position with regard to New Guinea. We have passed resolutions, in both Houses of the Federal Parliament, declaring that New Guinea should be taken over as a Territory of the Commonwealth. At the present time it is a Possession of Great Britain, and we are paying the whole of the expenses of the Administration, though we have not the power to appoint a Lieutenant-Governor, or to control in any way the management of this alleged Territory of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The Senate never had an opportunity; but, if they had, they would have a perfect right to legislate in favour of prohibition. What is the Government's objection to land nationalization, seeing that the land of New Guinea is practically unalienated ? The Government are strenuous in their opinion that not only should the Crown lands in the Federal territory remain unalienated, but that the alienated land should be purchased, so that for all time it might remain the joint inheritance of the people of Australia. In New Guinea, however, they favour the extraordinary policy of opposing nationalization, although the land has not yet been alienated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> talked about the danger of illicit traffic in liquor between the German territory and the Australian territory. That reminds me very much of Mark Twain, who once said that if he had to give a lecture on any subject, he would choose astronomy, because he knew nothing of it, and it left so much more to the imagination. It is absolutely impossible for an illicit liquor traffic to be carried on except by water. There are no tracks or roads parallel with the sea coast, the roads simply running inland to the parts where the people desire to go ; and the German settlement is 100 miles north of the border line. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator does not like to take my testimony, I refer him to the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roth,</inline> the Inspector of Aborigines, in which there is testimony from a sergeant of police, and also from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bennett,</inline> the representative of the aborigines, to the fact that the natives get drink. As an illustration, Queensland is about the worst that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> could have cited. I am absolutely certain that if liquor is allowed in New Guinea, ostensibly for the white people, the coloured people will be able to obtain it. It will be a crime and a stain on the escutcheon of Australia if we wipe out this handsome and physically and mentally well-developed race. I have seen aborigines drunk on Thursday Island, and I never witnessed more degrading exhibitions of humanity. I have seen similar natives in New Guinea, as a fine body of people capable of great advancement. It is said that the natives do not get liquor in New Guinea. I know that the Government Resident at Daru - which is the most westerly British station - had to prohibit islanders from Saibai coming to the mainland, because they were the means of introducing drink. Saibai is in Queensland, because the Queensland border was extended to take in all the islands of the archipelago. It is a notorious fact that some of the natives in the western division will do anything for liquor. There are over 100 New Guinea natives employed on the pearling fleets, and when they come to Thursday Island they prove themselves as fond of liquor as the Poly-' nesians or any other of the coloured people engaged in the same trade. Let us look at this question from the point of view of the white people. There are about 500 whites in New Guinea, 120 at Woodlark Island and about 380 on the mainland, and as there are about 400,000 Papuans, we may say there are 1,000 Papuans for each white man. </para>

Every white man there ought to deny himself liquor as a luxury, in order to save the lives of 1,000 Papuans. The white person who goes to New Guinea, and is not willing to deny himself liquor as a luxury for the sake of the coloured people, is not worthy of the name of a white man. </para>

                        <para>- No ; and I can assure the honorable senator that there are a great many church people who support the missions, and who are disgusted with the conduct of Bishop StoneWigg in this respect. If it has been impossible in any part of the world to prevent coloured races from getting liquor where white people are allowed to use it, we may infer that New Guinea would prove no exception. We have two courses open to us - one to kill off the native race by allowing liquor, and the other to prohibit it except for use medicinally. I hope that a Bill dealing with the question will be introduced this session; if not, that there will be next session, and I can assure the Government that the representatives who will be returned to the next Parliament will be more strenuous than those of this Parliament in their determination to prohibit the ' liquor traffic in New Guinea. I hope that we shall not be responsible for the decimation of the inhabitants of New Guinea, as we are responsible for the decimation of the inhabitants of Australia. This land of Australia has never been stained with the blood of our fellow man in war or civil strife, and we have a history of which we may well be proud. But there is one page of the history which is besmirched, and that tells how we have treated the aborigines, who have been killed, not by civilization, but by the vices which accompany civilization. We found in Australia a land with a contented, happy, if indolent people, living a somewhat precarious life ; but these native inhabitants have practically been wiped out of existence. </para>

                        <para>- We have only to read the testimony of Booker Washington, and similar authorities, to learn that one of the reasons for the degradation of the negro is the facilities which are afforded him for obtaining liquor. We annexed New Guinea, not primarily for the purpose of colonization, or in order to develop the industries there, but because we were afraid some other nation might take the land. Having annexed New Guinea for strategical and defence purposes, we find ourselves in the position of governing a coloured people; and we ought not to introduce certain factors which will inevitably have the effect of killing them off. I feel confident that if members of the Senate could see on each side of Torres Straits and see the effects of the drink traffic - and I am sure we are all actuated by a desire to do what is best in the interests of humanity - they would be unanimous in absolutely prohibiting the traffic in New Guinea. Experienced men like the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Chalmers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Macgregor have pointed out the evils which follow the traffic. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Macgregor contends . that liquor is most injurious to white people in such a climate, and that it is responsible for a great many deaths. He said it would be far better if the. liquor were absolutely prohibited even from the point of view of the white population. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Macgregor is a man who has had more experience with regard to the government of coloured races in tropical climates than any other man here. He is the best man we have ever had in New Guinea, and he came to the conclusion that the drink traffic was absolutely injurious. If we considered the white people alone it would be better to prohibit the sale of liquor there, but when we consider the aspect of the question as to coloured races, we must recognise that it would be a lasting crime if Australia allowed drink to kill off these people. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to call attention to the vote, " Books for departmental library, £500." It will be remembered that £1,000 was voted for books in connexion with the Parliamentary Library. It is perfectly true that that sum covers book-binding and fire insurance. Then we have £150 voted for books for the Crown Solicitor's office, and £400 for books for the High Court. This is a very large sum to spend upon law books. We have a magnificent Parliamentary Library at our disposal, containing a great number of law books, and a considerable quantity of reports. I consider that these votes are most lavish, and I move - </para>

                    <para>- It is absolutely necessary to have some law books in the Attorney-General's office. Each year since the initiation of the Federation we have had a vote. I think the sum was £700 last year, and of that we spent £697. Now we propose to spend £500. I presume that if a vote is necessary next year the amount will be smaller. It is necessary to obtain a good collection of reports. We have purchased many of the American and Canadian reports, and hope to make them complete. When that is done it will not be necessary to have so large a vote ; but it is essential that there should be a good collection of reports for the Attorney- General's Department. We cannot rely upon the Parliamentary Library, which is not our own, for our law library. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will know that a lawyer cannot work unless he has his law reports close at hand. They are his tools of trade. It would be the worst possible form of saving to attempt to carry on the Attorney-General's Department without a law library. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that I must oppose this expenditure, because I regard it as unnecessary. The answer of the Attorney-General has not dissipated my doubts. I have a distinct recollection that the ex-Minister for Home Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, said on more than one occasion that he was not going to attempt to conduct his Department unless all the officers were under his control. He did not seem inclined to carry on public works with the assistance of the numerous skilled officers of the States, who for years past have been familiar with the construction of post-offices, defence works, Customs buildings, and so on. The Department has been carrying on works with the help of the States engineers and architects, but now the Minister has got back to his old idea, and wants to have an Inspector-General at -£1,000 a year. What for? Not for the technical inspection of defence works about which a colonel might know something, but for the inspection of post-offices and other public buildings. Let me show how it works out. A post-office in Tasmania foi1 a fairly large township would cost £1,000 ; for a small place it might cost £500 or £600, and for a large town, £1,500 or £2,000. These buildings are constructed under the supervision of a clerk of works and an architect. While the work is going on, the clerk of works is present daily, and the architect visits the building twice or thrice a week. But we are to have a galloping Inspector-General going round the Commonwealth and inspecting the erection of buildings. What will be the value of his inspection <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is impossible for him to do the work effectively. If the officers on the spot do their work properly there is no need to have it done twice over. The work can be inspected by the architect and the engineer and can be supervised by the clerk of the works. The Inspector-General's whole life will be taken up in travelling from place to place, and he will really know nothing as to how works are carried on. He will not be able to say whether the timber was sound, whether the cement or the plaster was good, or whether the masonry was well constructed. He may have a look at the shingles on the roof, but he will not be able to say much about them. We are also to have four superintendents. What are they wanted for? The Attorney-General has forgotten, a return which the Senate some time ago ordered to be furnished, specifying what arrangements had been made with the Public Works Departments of the States for carrying on Commonwealth works. There is a Public Works Department in each of the States, officers of which have been accustomed to the construction of post-offices and other public buildings. The officers of these Departments are ready to hand. If our own business had to be conducted under these conditions, we should make use of the States officers, and why the Commonwealth Government cannot avail itself of their services, I do not know. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard that argument before, but I do not quite credit it. Although the work is done for the Commonwealth, the buildings require to be used in a State and for a State. That argument is a mere bogy. If some persons in a place desire the State Government to construct a building, and other persons in that place wish the Federal Government to erect a post and telegraph office, is it not more likely that the latter will agitate far more than the former ? I think so. I do not believe that there is a building which is so promptly clamoured for when it is needed as a post and telegraph office. We have heard a number of arguments here which have gone to pave the way for the appointment of these officers, but there is absolutely nothing in them. I shall feel bound to vote against the item, unless the necessity for the appointment of this officer is proved. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for the honorable senator to make that statement, but when two parties have to come to an agreement about a matter, it is of no use for one of them to say that something must be done. The experiment has not worked well in a great many cases, and we find that it will be much better to have Federal control of the construction of public works. The total vote for the construction of Federal buildings by this Department amounts to £192,000; and it will be no economy to allow their construction to be carried out under the control of persons who are not directly responsible to the Department. In some cases the States have made a somewhat heavy charge for the services of their officers, and it has been found in many cases that it would have been more economical to have had the work supervised by our own officers. Taking into account the large expenditure which has to be supervised, the proposed vote for superintendence is not excessive. The appointment of an Inspector-General of Works has not been made yet, but it is under consideration to appoint a gentleman who is performing certain duties in the Defence Department. </para>

                        <para>- Here is the first instalment of £4,000 or £5,000 a year for a Public Works Department which is not required. No men can be so well acquainted with the requirements of the Post and Telegraph and Customs Departments as the State officers who have been erecting and repairing such buildings in the past. Suppose that Colonel Owen were appointed, he would have to apply to those very men for assistance in the shape of plans and specifications. No provision is made here except for a head draftsman at £300 a year. Whoever heard of such a salary being voted to the head draftsman of a large Department ? It is ridiculous to pay a man £1,000 a year to gallop all over the States who has a special knowledge which is not required. We are not going to erect defence works. Every building will be erected under the supervision of an architect. Suppose that a State has charged a little more than ought to have been demanded. The money has had to come out of the pockets of the people of the State. I am surprised, after the opinions which have been expressed here time and again, that such an item should be allowed by the Government to appear in an Appropriation Bill. I shall support a request for the omission of the item if it is moved.- I cannot understand why it was considered necessary to appoint an Inspector-General of Public Works at a salary of £1,000. For the repair and enlargement of old buildings, and the erection of new buildings - mainly for the Post and Telegraph Department - the services of an architect, not a civil or military engineer, are required. There is as ! wide a difference between one engineer and another as between a blacksmith and a fitter. Generally speaking, a railway engineer is of no use for carrying out a water supply ; nor is a water supply engineer of use for supervising the construction of defence works. I could understand the Government stating that they required an officer or two to see that the construction of public buildings was properly carried out, but I cannot see that an Inspector-General and a staff are required. If they had proposed a salary of £500 or £600 a year for one or two inspectors to see that the requirements as laid down by the officers of the Post and Telegraph Department were properly complied with, I should not grumble, but I submit that the construction of our public works could be better and more economically carried out by the officers who have been charged with that duty for the last generation. </para>

                    <para>- I can quite understand that the Government will not be satisfied to have a large number of Federal works carried out under the supervision of State officials, because the responsibility to them is not direct. I should have been much better pleased if the Government had made overtures to the States to take over some of the officials who, previously had to carry out the construction of such works, and who undoubtedly are competent and trustworthy. If they had taken that course, and their overtures had not been entertained, they would have been provided with an answer to the charge which has been made against them here to-night. It cannot be denied that we are duplicating expense. This unfortunate country is not in a position to stand that. </para>

There is no doubt that the Commonwealth is carrying out works which previously were carried out by the States. Suppose, for instance, that some slight repairs are required at a post-office in Farina, nearly 400 miles from Adelaide. The postmaster reports that a leak ought to be repaired ; his report comes down to Adelaide ; and a man has to be sent up to Farina to inspect the leak and to report. The postmaster sends word to the Deputy Postmaster-General, and a man is sent perhaps 400 miles to find out what is wanted, and then another is sent to do the work. Some trifling repairs may be required at the public school in the same place, and another man is sent from the State Public Works Department to inquire about that. </para>

                        <para>- They do not necessarily charge a high commission. I can assure the Attorney-General that some claims which were sent in to the Home Affairs Office from South Australia, and were considered to be excessive, were not found to be excessive when they were carefully looked into. I believe that the work will not be done for anything like the same amount if we have a separate Commonwealth staff, as is now proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I feel sure that it will not, because of the duplication of work. The officer who is to superintend these works is a man trained to design fortifications ; but a very different training is required to design a post-office and ordinary building. I hope the motion will be carried, and that some effort will be made to utilize the services of the officers of the various States. </para>

                    <para>- That is just what is being done. We are making use of the services of .States officers throughout the Commonwealth at the present time in carrying out works from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, and we are paying them a commission of 6 per cent. But we require an inspector to look after the work, and we specially require a man who is skilled in the designing of fortifications. The principal public works now being carried on by the Commonwealth in the State of Victoria are fortifications, and it is nonsense to say that a man who has special knowledge in designing and building fortifications will not know something about ordinary buildings that may be roofed with shingles. If we appointed an ordinary architect for the position, he would not have the special knowledge required to enable him to superintend the designing and construction of fortifications, whilst a man having special knowledge of fortifications may be assumed to be competent to superintend the construction of other public works. We are at present paying a commission of 6 per cent, to States officers for looking after our public works.. </para>

                        <para>- I do not pretend to an intimate knowledge of ' everything connected with the matter, but I do know that we are paying a commission of 6 per cent., and I admit that that is a reasonable charge. At the same time, we find that it is absolutely necessary that we should have some one to superintend the work of the States officers because they are States officers, and are liable to be extravagant unless controlled. We must have some one to control them. I am informed that no less than £3,000 has been saved by the inspecting officer in connexion with one building in New South Wales. We may by this appointment save the amount of this salary over and over again ; whilst if we trust entirely to States officers, who will not be responsible to the Commonwealth, they will prepare plans for buildings of a very extravagant character. They will want to erect fine buildings, that they may be able to say, " Look at the beautiful Commonwealth post-office I have built here." And it must not be forgotten that the more money they spend, the more they themselves will get. The payment to them of the commission will induce extravagance. We must have supervision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> has spoken of men being sent great distances to look after little repairs to post-offices ; but it is the States officers who do that work, and we must have some general supervision. Without it we shall have gross extravagance in all the States. We are not duplicating the work any more than is absolutely necessary in the interests- of true economy, and I therefore, ask honorable senators to pass the vote. I believe that the officer who is to be appointed Inspector-General of Works is specially fitted for the position. We require a man having a special knowledge of fortifications, and as an intelligent intellectual man this officer will be able to look after the interests of the Commonwealth, and see that post-offices and various other public buildings which we have to add to or construct are added to' or constructed in a proper manner. </para>

I will guarantee that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Smith could put up a very expensive building for the benefit of the Commonwealth, especially if he got 6 per cent, commission on it. It is unmistakable that we must have supervision of public works in the interests of economy. </para>

                    <para>- I have heard a lot about supervision, designs, and the extravagant cost of this Department : but if a proper man is obtained by the Commonwealth Government to carry out the duties of head of this Department, the salary provided on the Estimates is not too high, and the Government will be very lucky if they get such a man. It is not a man to design fortifications, public buildings, or anything of that kind that \\ e require, but a man who will be able to organize a Department. I do not know Colonel Owen, but I may say that nearly everybody who is coming into the Commonwealth service is a colonel, a captain, a general, or something of the kind. </para>

I would not object to his being an admiral if he had the necessary ability for the position. I am endeavouring to point out that what we require is not a man possessing great designing capabilities. He may have designing capabilities which will run the Commonwealth into hundreds of thousands of pounds of expenditure. What we require is a man who can organize a Department, and who will be able to see that money voted by the Commonwealth Parliament to provide accommodation for Commonwealth officers, and for carrying on public business is not wasted. </para>

                        <para>- But do honorable senators not see the position ? If 6 per cent, is paid to a State it increases the State income while it increases the Commonwealth deficit. That gives room for Fairbairn, Dean, Bryant, or any Kyabram representative to charge the Commonwealth with extravagance and to credit the State with financial ability. As I have said already, £1,000 per annum is not too much to pay for such a man as I have described. He must be a man who is thoroughly acquainted with the conditions in every part of the Commonwealth and who, with everything under his complete control, will at any moment be able to place his hand on the State officer or Commonwealth officer most fitted for economically carrying out a particular work. Such a man will save money for the Commonwealth, and we cannot pay ' him too high a salary. I do not say that Colonel Owen is not the right man for the place, but if his only qualification, is that he can design a fortification or approve of the architecture of a post-office, that is not all that is required. </para>

                    <para>- We have heard the name of a certain individual frequently mentioned, and, it seems to me, that we are rather losing sight of the main question. I intend to vote on the item, and not on any individual. I never heard of Colonel Owen before; and the only question which I ask myself is whether it is necessary for us to create an office of the kind. If I can satisfy myself that such an appointment will tend to economy, I shall vote for the item ; on the other hand, if I could be convinced that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> view is the correct one, I should support him. I do not suppose, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> monopolizes the desire in this Senate for economy, but rather that all senators wish to see the Commonwealth works carried out as economically as possible. I do not care whether or not Colonel Owen is fitted for this office. The responsibility for his appointment must rest on the Government, and all we have to do is to pass the item if we think it is necessary' in the interests of the Common wealth. If the Government appoint Colonel Owen, and he proves not to possess all the qualifications which were painted in such glowing colours by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, it will be for Parliament to bring the Government to book. </para>

                    <para>- There is some little misunderstanding with regard to this matter. Lt. -Col. Owen occupies the position of Assistant Adjutant-General of the Engineer Services and his duties cover the construction, maintenance and repair of fortifications, barracks, and store buildings ; preparations of designs of all military works ; military telegraphs ; custody of plans of works ; custody of lands in occupation of troops ; questions of engineer and submarine mining stores and equipment . personnel and stores ; technical instruction of engineers, submarine miners, &amp;c. I am informed on the best authority that Lt. -Col. Owen has carried out his duties in an exceedingly able manner, and by his splendid supervision has saved thousands of pounds to the Government. It has been said that we are asked to vote £1,000, but I do not think that that is the case. I understand that there is a proposal to amalgamate the office of Assistant Adjutant-General with that of the Inspector-General of Works. </para>

                        <para>- I never get up to speak unless I have something new to tell honorable senators. Lt.Col. Owen at present receives £650 per annum, so that if the offices be amalgamated - and I believe they will, because both the Defence Department and the Public Works Department want his services - the increased expenditure will be only £350. Lt.-Col. Owen has knowledge of the erection of fortifications and buildings, and the suggested amalgamation would result in a saving. The Commonwealth has transferred services and buildings to the value of about £12,000,000, and if we are going to spend £180,000 per annum on new buildings, it would be foolish and false economy not to have some qualified person to supervise the work. A commission of 6 per cent, on £180,000 means £10,S00 per annum. </para>

                    (Victoria).- Is it intended to establish a Department to design and carry out all works without the assistance of the officers of any of the States, or is it intended to continue paying the commission of 6 per cent, in addition to the proposed expenditure? If Colonel Owen, of whom I should not have known anything but for the remarks of the Attorney-General, has been trained in one particular line, he cannot be a "jack of all trades."

                        <para>- I do not find fault with Colonel Owen, except that I am told that he is a military engineer. "What I want to know is whether the 6 per cent, which has been paid to the States is to continue after the Public Works Department is called into existence, or whether the Department itself is to do all the work? If the States officers are to do the work, and we are at the same time to have a Department of our own, it seems to me that matters are being duplicated. We had better constitute a proper Department, and not have a half and half thing like this. We already have a Department with several officers, costing several thousand pounds a year. </para>

                        <para>- The men who designed the public buildings before Federation can continue to do it, and can do it better than a man who has had no experience of this kind of work. I object to the reflections cast upon States officers. I do not believe that an officer holding a high position in a State would, merely for the sake of spending money, become extravagant. It does not matter to the officers whether the States or the Commonwealth pay their salaries. These arguments did not hold good when the High Court Bill was before us. We were then told that we required to have our own Judges to do Commonwealth work, and that we could not trust the States Judges because they would be influenced by the States which paid them.

                        <para>- The answer which the honorable senator will get is such as my knowledge will enable me to give. The Commonwealth Public Works Department is already in existence. It is not a new creation. Over £4,000 was voted for its purposes last year. The Department having been in existence, it is now found to be highly necessary that it should have a proper head. A sum of £750 was voted last year to pay the salary of a head for the Department, but there has been some delay in making the appointment. The gentleman whose name has been so frequently mentioned is an officer whom the Defence authorities do not care to give up if they can help it. The Department of Home Affairs wishes to secure his services, and has had some trouble in obtaining them. The chances are that he will be able to work for both Departments, and by that means save a considerable sum. </para>

                        <para>- That is rather an evasive answer. It is obvious, from what the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said, that, when this officer is transferred from the Defence Department to the Public Works staff, a vacancy will be created that will have to be filled at some expense to the Commonwealth. While I have been anxious to assist the Government, I cannot recognise in this appointment any economy whatever. It may be a good appointment so far as the officer is concerned, but the plea of economy has disappeared. I do not suppose that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will any longer maintain that this is an appointment by way of amalgamation. Practically, he now admits that it is not. </para>

Should the Minister for Defence require his services as an adviser, and should his services at the same time be required by the Minister for Home Affairs, which Minister is Colonel Owen to serve ? Are public works in the States to remain in abeyance while Colonel Owen is serving the Minister for Defence ? Instead of this appointment leading to economy, as we were led to believe -would be the case, it will lead to greater expense and to less expedition. I trust that the Senate will support the motion, because it seems to me that we are going to create a very costly Department, and to bring about a great deal of duplication work. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator states that States officers will be anxious to erect buildings of a magnificent character so that they may say, "Look what fine buildings we. have designed." What nonsense that is if it is .analyzed. When a post-office is required the Deputy Postmaster-General will know what services it is wanted for. He will know how many rooms are required, and will pass judgment upon the design. He will be able to say whether it is too expensive, and whether it fulfils requirements. To suppose that a States officer is going to put up a building with twelve rooms when only five are necessary, is to endeavour, to put the case in a way that the Committee will not accept. We are asked to authorize an unnecessary expenditure. The State officials are prepared to do this work, and I am quite sure from the reports I have read that it has been done very economically in the past. Considering that the Commonwealth would be called upon to provide a special plant for making a few repairs here or there, a charge of 6 per cent, for the loan of a plant and the supervision of the repairs by a State official is, I think, very low. I am sure that the work could not be done so cheaply under the proposed system. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>
                    (Tasmania). - I wish to point out to the Committee that the Estimates condemn the policy of the Government. If honorable senators will refer to page 24, they will see that a sum of £8,000 a year is paid to States officials for their services in connexion with the erection of Federal works, and to that sum we are asked to add £6,685, making a total of 14,685. As we construct new buildings to the value of about £180,000 a year, a charge of 5 per cent, on that sum would amount to £9,000. If we decided to employ the services of the best professional man in a State, and had no Public Works Department, we could get the construction of £1 80,000 worth of public buildings supervised by architects for an annual charge of £9,000. I was startled by the statement of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    that it is the intention of the Government to continue the policy of paying States officials. They have not indicated, that the' annual expenditure of £8,000 for this purpose can be reduced in any way, and they intend to have the construction of £8,000 worth of work supervised by States officials, and the construction of £6,000 worth superintended by Federal officials. In my opinion the Government have taken an utterly wrong view of this matter. I do not believe in paying the .States 6 per cent, for the services of their officials. I think that an arrangement could be made with the. States to pay a fair proportion of the salaries of their officials. lj would be very easy for the Auditor-General of each State to ascertain how many days in the year, a State officer had been working for his State and the Commonwealth respectively. We may disabuse our mind of the idea which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline>
                    enunciated ; namely, that Colonel Owen, or any man, is capable of doing all the work which he mentioned for the Defence Department, and supervising the construction of Federal buildings. It is quite clear that the policy of the Government is not to put Colonel Owen in that position, hut to create a- new office, which, in my opinion, could very safely be done without. It is my intention, by-and-by, to move a request for a reduction of the number of superintendents of works by two.

                    <para>- I do not think that very much new light has been thrown on this question since the discussion began. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has stated in very emphatic terms, that this proposal means economy and efficiency, but he did not show us how a redaction of the expenditure is to be effected. Indeed, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> pressed him very hard, he had, unwillingly, to admit that side by side with this new arrangement, the old 6 per cent, system would be continued. The question of creating a Public Works Department was debated very fully last session. On the one hand the late Minister for Home Affairs claimed that he ought to have direct control in these matters, while, on the other hand, it appeared to honorable senators that the Department would lend itself largely to administration by the States. I do not think it is possible for the Commonwealth to organize a Public Works Department on the scale which some honorable senators have indicated their desire to see. If that were done, what would be the result of this huge system of centralization ? The wheels of administration would be slowed down until complaints of delay and inefficiency would pour in from every corner of the Commonwealth. The wisest method to follow is to place the construction of our public buildings in the hands of the Public Works Departments of the States. That appears to me to be the only workable arrangement which could be made. The charge for supervision might very well be ' reduced from 6 to 5 per cent. Any architect would undertake to do this work for a fee of 5 per cent. Originally the States asked for 10 per cent., and it was only after some trouble that they consented to charge 6 per cent., which I think might very well be reduced to 5 per cent. With regard to. the appointment of Colonel Owen, I desire to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> whether it is intended to fortify all our post-offices, Customs Houses, and public buildings generally, seeing that that gentleman evidently knows more about fortifications than anything else. The only conclusion' which I can come to, after listening' very carefully to the debate, and trying , to read between the lines, is that this is a little job on the part of the Government to find a snug billet for  Colonel Owen.  I never heard of the gentleman before this evening. I do not know anything about him, except what we have all heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> But I gather that he is a military engineer. Who ever heard of a military engineer being placed in the position of inspector of works? What qualification can he have for the position ? However intelligent or skilful Colonel Owen may be in his own profession - and I suppose he is a skilful and intelligent man - I cannot see bow he can be competent to undertake the duties of this office. The longer I' listened to the debate the more convinced I became that there was an attempt on the part of the Government to foist an official, whom they do not know very well how to provide for, into a position at £1,000 a year. From the very nature of his profession, he cannot be competent to act as an inspector of works. To properly fill that position, a man requires to possess certain qualifications. He requires to have a special knowledge of one trade, and a general knowledge of many trades. For instance, carpentering and plumbing have to be done in connexion with public buildings. Does any one imagine that a handy military engineer is a proper person to put in a' position of that kind ? I do not think so. We ought to be provided with more information about Colonel Owen before we are asked to vote this money. </para>
