                        <para>- I feel somewhat in a difficulty in rising to speak after the very able and exhaustive address we heard from my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> on Friday last. But being one of those honorable senators who have recently devoted attention, somewhat too assiduously, to the portion of his duties which consists in remaining amongst his constituents, I feel bound to say something when I am in the Senate chamber. So far as I have been able to understand, from the many speeches which have been made upon this Bill, no one appears to deny that we ought to have a High Court ultimately. The objection seems to be that we ought not to have it just now ; that it is premature ; that there is no work for it to do ; and that we can very well get on, as we have been doing for some time, by clothing the States Courts with Federal jurisdiction, or in the alternative by establishing a court of some sort, of three Chief Justices taken from the States. With reference to the first argument, that there is no work for a High Court to do, I must, at the outset, join issue upon that. It is true that not many constitutional questions have so far forced themselves upon the attention of the public, but there . are some, and there would be many more if there was a court at hand ready to deal with them. It is absurd to suppose that where we have two jurisdictions like those of the Commonwealth and of the States, which overlie and underlie one another, which are intimately interwoven, and which permeate one the other, there will not be many points of collision, which will increase in far greater ratio the longer the Commonwealth is in existence. Take again the question of appeals. I know that in my own State there are six or seven cases now held in abeyance pending the establishment of this, High Court. I am sure that lawyers from other States have the same thing to say, and I think, therefore, that if the High Court were established, it would have, even at the outset, a very respectable cause list to deal with. Here, </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">I ought to point out that nothing can be more erroneous than to measure the amount of work that this High Court will have to do by the Australian records of the Privy Council. In the first place, there are many appeals lodged that never reach the Privy Council. In the second place, there are scores projected that are abandoned when the parties have learned of the cost, of the delay, and of their inability to have their own local solicitor or lawyer present to explain to the English barristers the rninutite of their cases. Some may remark that if the only good of a High Court is to increase litigation - is to multiply appeals - then the longer we postpone its establishment the better. There would be some force in that argument if the difficulties that interpose between the litigant in Australia and the final determination of his rights in London were difficulties that curtail appeals all round. But what is the fact <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> These same difficulties that act as a deterrent to the poor man really act as a stimulant to the rich man, and it has been <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> experience that there never was a wealthy individual or institution that desired to go to the Privy Council that did not go there, while there have been scores of persons less fortunate in purse who have been reluctantly obliged to abandon their lawsuits. I go further, and say that it has come within my own observation that poor persons who, after a hard fight in the court of first instance, and in the Full Court, have obtained a decision in their favour, have been obliged to make a miserable settlement because a notice of appeal has been given, and a delay of two or three years and much expense have thereby been interposed between them and the fruits of their victory. But while, therefore, I, as a lawyer, having an opportunity of observing these things (certainly in my own State) am, quite satisfied that there would be ample work for the High Court to do, I do not think that that, though an answer in fact, is the real or the most unassailable of the answers that may be given to the argument that inasmuch as there is little work for such a court to do at present that we should wait until it arises. I say the true answer is one founded on principle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> if we can judge by his running commentary during the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> would say that I am now about to indulge in theory, and that what he desires is something practical. Well, it is theory ; but, after all, when we are discussing our constitutional position, we must to a large extent enter the region of theory. I say that the High . Court is necessary for the completion of our Constitution. I think every one will admit that we already possess judicial functions ; that we possessed them from the beginning. We required no Act of this Parliament to give them to us. The very moment the Queen attached her signature to the document which is now in the Queen's-hall, the judicial functions under this Constitution arose. That must be obvious. We cannot conceive a Parliament for the making of laws, and an Executive for carrying them into effect, without a judicial body to enforce, to explain, and to guard them. The three are interdependent ; they are mutually co-existent ; they are the tripod of the Constitution. And the Constitution itself, which is the basis of our rights, recognises that. Section 71, Chapter III., of the Constitution does not purport to give judicial functions to this Commonwealth. It assumes that the judicial functions are there; but it provides for the way in which they are to be exercised. Chapter III. deals with the Judicature, and the first section of that chapter provides that- </para>
                    <para>The judicial power of the Commonwealth - </para>
                    <para>It does not give it ; it assumes that the Commonwealth has it- shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court. </para>
                    <para class="block">The very Bill we are now discussing does not purport to create judicial functions ; its very title is - </para>
                    <para>A Bill for an Act to make provision for the exercise of the- what already exists - . judicial power of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">Why, then, is it necessary for us to pass an Act of Parliament at all? For this reason : Because, although the three functions of this Constitution- the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judicature are all coterminous, all co-ordinate, all exist from the first moment, the bodies to exercise these functions have to be called into being one by one. First, our Constitution is passed ; then our Governor-General summons the Parliament, then he appoints the Executive, then the Parliament aided by the administrative work of the Executive calls into being the body for the exercise of the third function, the Judicature. I wonder that it should be necessary to argue the matter at all, having regard to the Constitution. We have Chapter I. - The Parliament - and the first section provides that the legislative power of the Commonwealth " shall be vested " in a Federal Parliament. Chapter II. deals with the Executive Government, and provides that the executive power of the Commonwealth " shall be vested " in Executive officers not exceeding seven. Chapter III. provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth " shall be vested " in a High Court, and the rest of the Constitution is taken up in pointing out what these three joint powers can do. Now Chapter III., which says how the judicial functions are to be exercised, ' really goes out of its way. It says that they shall be exercised - how ? In one way, and in one way only - by a High Court. What sort of High Court? A body consisting of a Chief Justice and at least two Judges. It does not give us any option. The framers of the Act knew that judicial functions were inherent to the Constitution, and all that they were called upon to do was to point out the mouthpiece for these judicial functions. They described that mouthpiece in as clear language as' </para>

                        draftsman could put it - -
                    </para>
                    <para>The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia, and in such other Federal- Courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with Federal jurisdiction. The High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice, and so many other Justices, not less than two, as the Parliament prescribes. </para>
                    <para class="block">Now, in the face of that, I wish to know what authority we have- our whole authority is derived from this Constitution - to make any provision for the exercise of our judicial powers other than that provision, which the framers of the Constitution said we must make ? They need not have said «o, but they have said so, and we have accepted it. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> tells us that no time was prescribed in the Constitution. Of course, no time was prescribed, and why <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Because the time was forthwith, in other words, as soon as we could do it. Was any time prescribed for the appointment of the Executive, and could the &lt;3overnor-General have refrained from making the- appointment, and have said - " True, it was my bounden duty under the Constitution to appoint the Executive, but really </para>
                    <para class="block">I have been able to get along very well without it. Could' he have done that? The positions are perfectly analogous. What is the difference in the words? Here is a Constitution which directs the different powers how to act. It says to the Governor-General - "You shall appoint an Executive," but it mentions no time. It says to the Parliament - "You shall appoint a High Court," but it mentions "no time. If we be at liberty to say that because no period is specified it is left to our own sweet will, it must similarly be open to the Governor-General to Say that it is left to his will to say when he will appoint an Executive? "Wait until next year," said <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> But if we proceeded upon those lines, we might as well wait for ever. " We have got on very well for two and a half years ; " but ought that not to be a stimulus to us to make haste now rather than a justification for further delay ? We ca!n . excuse our dilatoriness for two and a half years, because we have had so much else to do ; but now when we have the time, and when we are here discussing the question, is it any excuse for the nonfulfilment of a duty to say that we have been unable to carry it out for two and a half years ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> reminded us that under section 88 a time was specified within which we must have uniform customs duties. But mv honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> although he is a lawyer, entirely ignores this fact, that the making uniform oi Inter-State customs duties is an act of the Constitution, of the tripartite powers ' I have mentioned, whilst the formation of the High Court is not the doing of anything by the Constitution, but is the completing of the Constitution itself. </para>

                            <para>- One is the act of the completed machinery, and the other is the completion of the machinery. It must be evident that in some form Or another we are bound to establish this High Court to carry out our judicial functions. But it is said - "Let us carry it out by constituting a court of three Chief Justices taken from the other States." It appeared to me, as I sat here listening to the speeches, that nearly every honorable senator who advanced that argument was suffering from a confusion of thought, arising from the fact that the Federal Constitution, so to speak, covers ground already parcelled out and dealt with by subordinate State Constitutions. Somehow or other, honorable senators have mixed these, two facts together, and, to make matters clear, let us assume, for argument's sake, that the Commonwealth Government does not cover the same people or the same geographical area as the States Governments, but a virgin, political soil, lying contiguous to the Australian States. On that .hypothesis let us examine the position. The Commonwealth Parliament is elected and the Executive is appointed, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council rises and moves the establishment of the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> then gets up, and says - "We ought not to have a High Court at all; we have been getting, on very well during the past twelve or eighteen months by borrowing Judges, or rather, getting Judges in the Australian States that are nearest, to do the work." And <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> gets up and -improves the matter by saying - "Why do we want a regular and very expensive High Court at all, when there are lots of Judges in Australia, who have very little to do, and would be quite willing to act for us ?" Assuming that these arguments are made under the circumstances I have suggested - and they are identically the same as I have heard made in reference to the Bill - what would the answer be, not from one, but from every member of this Chamber <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Would there not be a wave of indignation, and would it not be said-" What ! Are we too poor to pay our own Judges, or, are we so lost to every sense of dignity, of propriety, of prestige, and of the traditions of a nation, that we are willing to jeopardise the administration of justice itself, and for the sake of a few niggardly pounds to commit our property, our security, and the guardianship of our Constitution to a few hireling Judges from the neighbouring States." </para>

                            <para>- As against the interests of Victoria. New South Wales Judges administering Victorian law will never have to be affected by the interests of New South Wales, bub the Commonwealth Judge coming from New South Wales, will have to administer Victorian law as well, though indirectly. What is the difference ? If we take a Chief Justice from New South Wales and tell him to try a Victorian question, that does not affect his New South Wales interests. If we take a New South Wales Judge and say, " Sit on the Commonwealth Bench," will he not have to deal with Victorian concerns just as much, with this further consideration, that when the Judge is not sitting on the Commonwealth Bench he can never have to adjudicate on differences between the States. * But when a Judge is sitting on the Commonwealth Bench, he will scarcely have to adjudicate on anything else - that is what he is sitting there for. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> in face of this, point out to me how his interjection draws any distinction? If there is any distinction, the argument applies <inline font-style="italic">a fortiori</inline> in the case I am putting. If we, at once, repudiate as absurd, and contrary to the dignity of nationhood, the idea that a country should have its judicial work done by Judges from another country, show me why it is not equally derogatory to the dignity, without going further, of the </para>

There is the additional argument, in regard to Judges coming to the Commonwealth to do the States work, that they may have to deal adversely with the interests of the country they themselves represent. That leads me to the unpleasant question of bias. J do not for a moment suggest intentional bias. I have sufficient faith in British Judges to believe that such a thing as intentional bias has no place on a British Bench. I am referring, however, to what has been very happily called unconscious bias. </para>

' If we have States Judges sitting on the Commonwealth Bench a question may arise which perhaps involves an increase of taxation in his State; an increase in railway rates; or- an encroachment, perhaps, on his own judicial privileges. It may be a question on which the whole community holds a very strong view ; that community including the Judges, own associates, companions and friends. It may be a question of the greatest doubt and difficulty, because most questions - as every lawyer knows - which reach the higher Appeal Courts are difficult of determination. We may have a Judge coming from a State to deal with a question which intimately affects, not only his own interests in a minor way, but the interests of the whole of the community to which he belongs, and do honorable senators mean to tell me that there is anything unreasonable or that it is derogatory ' to the Judge to say that he may be drawn instinctively from the region of doubt towards the side with which is associated his home, his family, his friends, his patriotic sentiments and those to whom he is responsible, and from whom his remuneration comes ? </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth Judge will be a person who has been weaned from a State, and owes his duty to the Commonwealth. I have been speaking of a Judge whose duties still lie to the State, and who can be looked at askance by the people of the States as one of themselves if he has injuriously affected their interests. That is where the difference comes in. It would be unfair to the Judge himself to expect that, under the circumstances, his judgment would not be unintentionally warped in the direction of his friends and his own sentiments. </para>

                            <para>- As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> interjection, I would point out that we are speaking of intangible and imperceptible promptings of the mind. The Judges are above doing any conscious wrong, but in spite of themselves they are affected by preconceptions and predilections in the same way as are other members of the community. Judges are very excellent, but they have not wings ; as was well said by Edmund Burke - " He censures God who quarrels with the imperfections of man." But there is another and a higher and a stronger reason which makes me maintain that all Federal Judges should be thoroughly independent, and unconnected with any other body- entirely devoted to the duty of looking after the Commonwealth judicial affairs. We need Federal judicial experts. All honorable senators are perhaps not aware, but I am sure that all lawyers will agree with me, that the Constitution is essentially different from any other statute. In an ordinary statute legislators seel-, to express with the greatest precision of language what they wish to convey, and they carefully limit every proposition to the requirements of the moment. That is done because they are aware that, as times and circumstances alter, so the statute may be altered. But with the Federal Constitution, the framers knew that the powers of amendment were very limited - that for all practical purposes the Constitution was to be unalterable. They knew that the Constitution was made for permanence, and that, therefore, they must avoid that very precision of expression and limitation of proposition which are the characteristics of the ordinary Act of Parliament. Therefore, the Constitution is not formed rigidly in steel, but moulded in elastic, so that with the times it may expand and adjust itself to the ever varying and ever multiplying exigencies of an inscrutable future. An Act of this kind requires, if it is to fulfil its end, specially trained men as its exponents. </para>

                            <para>- The Constitution is the foundation of our rights, and it was deliberately drafted upon principles which are opposed to those which run through the the ordinary Acts of Parliament. Can we find in any other statute the broad, far reaching, loosely-termed, abstract political conceptions which run all through it ? We cannot, and why? Because the Constitution is intended to be the foundation of a growing tree of rights without any alteration in itself. If, therefore, we apply to its construction the narrow and technical rules which obtain in an ordinary court of justice, we shall defeat its end. If the Constitution is to fulfil its purpose, we want men who can construe it - men whose minds are entuned to its high purposes. How are we to find them ? Perhaps to an extent they are born, but to a larger extent they are made. We can get them only by first selecting our ablest and most experienced lawyers, and devoting them exclusively to the class of work that the interpretation of the Constitution requires. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say so. I think that a " dash " of those who framed the Constitution would be a very good thing on the High Court Bench ; but I do not say by any means that the States Judges are not good enough to interpret the Constitution . What I say is that those whose business it is to interpret the Constitution must devote their whole attention to the work, which must be conducted on lines different from those followed in the ordinary States Courts. We therefore want a permanent Judiciary, whose duties shall be confined to this particular class of work. That is the way in which the American Constitution has been developed - and I deliberately use the word -into the present comprehensive, broad, and liberal Constitution. I noticed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett,</inline> by interjection, objected to the word "developed" in this connexion. It is for the Parliament and not the Judges, he thinks, to develop the Constitution. I entirely disagree with him. It shows that he has not grasped the fundamental principle underlying written Constitutions, which is that in proportion as the action of Parliament in the way of amendment is impeded or excluded, in like proportion the assistance of the jurist in the way of an. enlarging construction must be invoked. We cannot remain stationary ; times change. The Bible is unalterable, but theologians have done for that work what the Judges have to do for the Constitution. While retaining its principles, they have given them an application in conformity with the multiplying complexities of our increasing civilization. </para>

We have had many eloquent quotations from American authors in which the speakers dwelt with great fervour oil the wonderful growth of the American Constitution. We have heard that during the 100-odd years of its existence the work of the Legislature is represented by seventeen amendments, while the work of its. Judiciary is to be found in the monumental records of huge libraries. We have heard that the names of Marshall and other celebrated persons are immortal in America, because of the part they played in bringing the Constitution to its present perfection. Is it a good augury for us that at the outset of our career we should constitute a court, which is to be the means of expanding and enlarging the Constitution, with a . scratch team, of "illustrious casuals?"Is it a good augury for us that, in the hope to find a Marshall among ourselves, we should be obliged to look for him in those chance, fortuitous gatherings of the leisured supernumerary Judges of other States, and subordinate States, too? </para>

                            <para>- What different conditions? In America the population was about the same, and' the Constitution was somewhat similar, but they lost no time. We do not read in their debates about the saving of £10,000, £15,000, or £20,000. They carried out the provisions of their Constitution ; they appointed five Judges, although there were only eight or ten cases before the court in its first year. The Judges have grown in number, and the result of their work is such that there is nothing of which the Americans are so proud as they are of their Supreme Court. </para>

                            <para>- Do not most of us live in delusion ? Is not this Parliament to a certain extent a delusion? Are not most religions a delusion?There is no institution in the world which gains such practical effect from the idea of dignity as does the administration of justice. I have seen - and I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> will indorse my statement - many men, and just as many women, too, who would lie like Trojans before a respectable, bald-headed, ordinarily clothed gentleman sitting at a deal table, but who would shiver, shrink, and blurt out the truth in the. presence of the full-bottomed wigs, the ermine, the tipstaffs, and all the awe-inspiring accessories of a court of justice. It is for that very reason that I so strongly advocate that the High Court of Australia should not be in any way mean or paltry, that it should contain nothing to suggest that it was a makeshift, but that whatever it might cost, it should stand apart in Australia as something grand - winning respect and confidence from all of us. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. The honorable senator must know that we shall not get a court of that character if we are to have the uncertain, shaky, tottering shanty it is suggested we should set up and call the Commonwealth Temple of Justice. However just may be the decrees of a court, if it is not so circumstanced that it inspires respect and confidence, half its force is lost. I think it is of greater importance to the community, and contributes more to its peace, happiness, and stability, that there should be a court which, though faulty, was thought faultless, than a court which, though without flaw, was, on account of its surroundings, looked at askance, and with a sort of sceptical regard. </para>

He held up his hand with holy horror at such a proposal.. Let me ask him or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> who supports his view, what he would think of a carefully-considered judgment of the Supreme Court of New South Wales or Victoria being reviewed by a Bench of three Judges gathered from the neighbouring States, brought up in different conditions, having no concern in the Commonwealth, meeting to-day and separating to-morrow, getting their remuneration from elsewhere, and having no attribute in common but their idleness in their own States ? </para>

                            <para>- Now, apart from these general observations, the two suggestions which have been made are absolutely impracticable, and I venture to think also illegal. The first suggestion is to clothe the States J Judges with Federal jurisdiction. It may be possible by a Commonwealth Act to enable a State to sue the Commonwealth, as at present, or the Commonwealth to sue a State, but no Commonwealth Act can enable one State to sue another ; can give jurisdiction, beyond its borders. See what this system would lead to. We should have one decision in Western Australia and another decision in South Australia, with absolutely no uniformity Nor could we correct that want of uniformity by an appeal, because, according to the Constitution, there can be no appeal to the Privy Council unless with the sanction or at the request of the High Court, and, of course, there would be no High Court in existence to give that sanction. Now, take the proposition to compose the High Court of three Chief Justices from the States. That seems to me to be altogether <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Is it the idea that the three Chief Justices are to be brought together occasionally to determine such cases as may have" arisen in the interval? If so, they must be given jurisdiction of some kind. How can it be given ? It can only be given under the terms of the Constitution. What does it say ? We can give j judicial power to a High Court or to other Federal Courts, and we can vest Federal jurisdiction in the States Courts. But if we give power to anybody to do general Federal work, such as the High Court should do, it must be given within the terms of the Constitution, and it says that the Justices of the High Court and of any other courts shall be appointed permanently, shall only be dismissed for misbehaviour and incapacity, and shall receive their remuneration from the Parliament, so that from the moment we get the Chief Justices together and say to them "Administer Federal jurisdiction," their positions become permanent. </para>

Before you go you must write out your resignation .and give it to me, so that it may be placed in my pocket, to be used the moment I want to get rid of you." </para>

The honorable senator suggests the only way out of the difficulty. If we take a Chief Justice from a State and clothe him with the necessary jurisdiction, we appoint him a High Court Judge, and must pay him. So what is gained <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If we wish to get out of the position by saying to him - "We shall not appoint you unless you write out your resignation and hand it in," does any one think that he would be such an imbecile as to relinquish a certain position carrying just as high a salary in order to be called the Chief Justice of Australia, with a precarious tenure <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                            <para>- That is the man who looks after Canada. But they are very old men, they have been brought up in very close conditions of thought, and they are the last men in the world who are likely to assimilate quickly the, to them, entirely novel condition of things which prevails in Australia. Every one of us who has a thorough knowledge of the subject with which we are dealing has a great advantage over a superior mind that does not know so much. In the first place, there is no intellectual waste in trying to grasp facts, when drawing an inference. If a person comes before me with a set of facts with which I am entirely unfamiliar, a great deal of my mental muscle, so to speak, Ls exhausted in the effort to grip the facts before I can reason from them. This is very largely the case with the Privy Council when dealing with Australian affairs. </para>

                            <para>- I really did not intend to speak at such length, and I do not know that there is anything more of importance that I can say. I am satisfied that it was the idea of the framers of the Constitution, that as soon as possible a High Court of the character which they have described,. and which should consist of a Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges at least, with certain jurisdiction, should straightway be established as the mouthpiece of the judicial power of the Commonwealth ? They recognised that judicial powers existed without a court, and that they had only to concern themselves with the exercise of those judicial powers. Honorable senators have endeavoured to explain away the effect of that, and they propose to set up a makeshift tribunal, or, as my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> has called it, a sort of shandygaff tribunal instead of the High Court. I say that we ought to do our plain duty under the Constitution, and at once establish a High Court, not in a' niggardly way, but one of which we may be proud, and which will commence its career of interpreting this Constitution in such a way as to secure as high a name for itself as did the High Court of America. I am very sorry that the Bill has reached us in so shorn and dilapidated a state. I know that the picture of a High Court which I conjured up when I first read the Federal Constitution was very different to that which is presented by this Bill as it reaches us. </para>

I should like to see a court that would be a crown and caj} for all the judicial systems of the States, a court, to use the graceful simile of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that would form the trunk of the sheltering tree of justice to which the honorable and learned senator referred, from which all would derive their support, and to which they would all look for their ultimate guidance - a court that would overarch them all, protecting, guiding, and controlling them. That is the kind of High Court I desire to see - a court that would be worthy, not merely of all the subsidiary Governments, but of Australia as a nation. </para>

They should first have read the Constitution before they voted for Federation, or asked others to vote for it, and they would have there seen that a High Court of at least three Judges was an essential part of it. They should then have measured the cost of that, and if they did not succeed in convincing the people of their State that this was an insurmountable objection to their joining the Federation, they should have accepted the verdict of the people, and should not afterwards have grumbled about the cost. </para>

                            <para>- My opinion is that the cost will not be more than 20,000 or £25,000, but if the cost were to be £50,000, £60,000 or £70,000, 1 would vote for it, be-' cause I consider that I am bound to do so. It is not a question of cost, but a question of carrying out a duty cast upon us by the Constitution, and of keeping faith with the people who voted for that Constitution. The only ground upon which I vote for the second reading of this Bill, pitiably dilapidated as the High Court proposed under it is, is that I am confident that further inquiry and an appeal to the country will send into both Houses of . the Federal Parliament bodies of the representatives of the people, who will have no choice, but by amendment of this law, to increase the jurisdiction of this court, to enlarge the Bench, and to make the court of the character intended by those who framed the Constitution. </para>

Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> will cudgel his brains over this and come to a conclusion. Here is an Act of Parliament laying down a Constitution, and it says that the legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Parliament; that the executive power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in at least seven Ministers and a Governor-General; and that the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a High Court, consisting of a Chief Justice, and at least two other Judges ; that that court shall have certain jurisdiction, but may be given other jurisdiction. Will the honorable senator, having read all that, tell me what option we have left ? </para>

                            <para>- I sincerely hope that the fostering care of this Parliament, and the more generous treatment of amending Acts in another- Parliament, will ultimately enlarge the jurisdiction, and so strengthen the Bench of this High Court that it will prove worthy of what such an institution ought to be for the Commonwealth of Australia. It is only on these grounds that I vote for the second reading of this Bill, being quite convinced that time for consideration and an appeal to the electors will bring those who are now dissentients round to the same way of thinking as myself. I vote for the second reading of the Bill trusting to a growth of the power and dignity of the High Court as the result of generous treatment by the people. </para>

                        <para>- We .have had in both Houses a most able and instructive debate on this Bill, and most of the arguments that could be urged on the subject have certainly been submitted. Nevertheless, as one who has been actively engaged in the cause of Federation since 1883, and in every important movement in connexion with it, I have thought it to be my duty, if not to the Senate, at all events to those who have sent me here, to state my views on this subject. Incidentally also, when I find my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> who I am sorry to see is not now present, taking a view antagonistic to that which I take, and I know that a few days ago he expressed to the Senate the highest opinion of me as a constitutional lawyer - of course, I happened to be with the honorable senator at that particular moment - T thought that possibly, by listening to me, the excellence of my constitutional law might induce the honorable senator to see the. error of the way which he has been following lately. I look upon' the Judiciary as the very basement of the Constitution. Without it the Constitution simply cannot work ; without it the Constitution would never have been proposed, and without it the Constitution would never have been accepted by the people. We were all agreed in the Convention of 1891 that the time was ripe for a Federation of Australia if it could be arranged on satisfactory terms. The question was what those terms were to be. We had practically before us only two systems which we had seriously to consider - the one, the American system, which is a Federation pure and simple ; the other, the Canadian, which is altogether an impure Federation, and which is more in the nature of a unification. In the "one we had before us a Parliament or a Congress, with the powers which the States had conferred upon it ; the States preserving their own sovereignty throughout, and reserving to themselves the residuum of power. In the Canadian system we had the converse. We had the power of the States defined by the Constitution, and all other power given to the Dominion. We had the Judges in America appointed by the States ; we had the Judges in Canada appointed by the Central Government. We had each State in America supreme and sovereign within its jurisdiction ; and we had every State in </para>

                    <para class="block">Canada subject to the Dominion Government, and liable to have its Acts of Parliament vetoed by the central Executive. There could be no more complete contrast between two Governments ; and the question before us was whether we should federate under the American system or under the Canadian system. The Convention of 1891 followed the American system, and yet not quite so completely,' so far as the words used were concerned, as did the later Convention. The Convention agreed to follow the American system, and resolved on two Houses such as we now have-- one, the Senate, in which the smallest State was to have as large a representation as the largest State, and the other a House of Representatives, which was to be based on a population vote. The one House was to represent the people as a whole, and the other was to be purely and simply a States' House; and that was the protection which the States insisted on in order to insure their sovereignty. But what is a law without a power of vindication ? ' As some honorable members have said elsewhere, and honorable senators have said here, what is the good of "a law of imperfect obligation?" I am pretty sick and tired of that phrase. Is it that we are not to fulfil our bounden duty because we cannot be made to'do so ? Is it that we need not tell the truth because we cannot be punished for a lie <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is it, as an honorable member said elsewhere, that we are to abstain from the whole decalogue of offences because there is no sanction or vindicatory power at hand to punish ? A man is a rogue and a scoundrel who- will assent to such a view ; and a sovereign Legislature should take a higher position. What is the meaning of " a law of imperfect obligation <inline font-style="italic">t "</inline> It means that we cannot be mandamused - that there is such dignity in Parliament that the courts cannot interfere with it. And why not1? Because our honour is so high that we are superior to the necessity of interference by courts of justice in order to make us fulfil our obligations. To retire from that high position which, constitutionally, we must assume - however much, incidentally, we may fail - would be to associate Federation with a bad system of morality and a poor recognition of our obligations. The Americans have done their best to preserve the power of the people. They recognised that it was well to preserve the sovereign power of the States, and asked that a vindicatory power should be created. </para>
                    <para class="block">They felt that they must have a tribunal, practically raised above the Commonwealth and the States - a tribunal which would be the defender and protector of the smaller States against the aggression of the more populous States. That was the view taken in the establishment of the American Constitution; and. it is admitted that that Constitution has worked in the most exemplary way and is, practically, unalterable. No doubt, there are great difficulties in the way of altering the American Constitution, as there, are in the way of altering the Australian Constitution, and it- is most necessary, in order to secure permanency, that there should be those difficulties. But if there were a crying injustice or a strong public feeling in America against the whole system of Government, do honorable senators think that a remedy would not be found, or that the safeguards against too hasty action would be sufficient to prevent right and justice being done. The Supreme Court in the United States has been called " the living voice of the Constitution." Those were the words used by the great writer, Hamilton, and they have been used by great Judges and great jurors ever since. <inline font-style="italic">Bryce</inline> thus speaks of the United States Supreme Court - </para>

It is, therefore, as some -one has said, the conscience of the people who have resolved to restrain themselves from hasty and unjust action, by placing their representatives under the restriction of a permanent law. It is the guarantee <inline font-style="italic">qf the minority</inline> who, when threatened by the impatient vehemence of a majority, can appeal to this permanent law, finding the interpreter and enforcer thereof in a court set high above the assault of faction.

                    <para>These are the words of a great writer of later days, but they merely embody in a few sentences arguments which Hamilton and all great constitutionalists have used as to the absolute necessity of a High Court, and of raising it far above all factions of the people. In the Convention we had before us the comparative failure of the Canadian system. And in both the Convention of 1891 and the Convention of 1897 it was determined to follow the American precedent. </para>

                            <para>- I think it was determined in 1891 to -follow the American precedent, but I shall refer further to that matter in a moment. I think the difference made was accidental, be- cause, in 1891, we practically intended to do the same as we did more effectively in 1897. The intention undoubtedly in 1891 was to have two Houses established as in America, with an Executive and a High Court. The only difference made was in the wording, which, by the subsequent alteration, was made to emphasize immensely what we wanted. Even supposing the words used in the Constitution passed by the Convention of 1891 would have diminished the similarity to the American Constitution, the second Convention removed all dissimilarity, emphasizing what we had in our minds as to the divergence between the American and the Canadian Constitutions. We had this divergence clearly before us, and it was clearly before the people when, the Constitution was submitted to them. </para>

                            <para>- The Privy Council consists of a number of eminent men and a number of men of loss eminence. It is a tribunal very varied in its assortment, and a magnificent tribunal if the Bench which is called together happens to be composed of the best. It is not such a good tribunal, however, if the best of the members do not happen to attend ; at all events, it is a tribunal which, from its constitution, requires none of the most excellent to attend, but which is composed of stray gentlemen sometimes more and sometimes less able. The arguments are submitted to them without our knowing anything about the proceedings until they .are all over ; and on this point I lay great emphasis. The Privy Council decide on our intentions and our circumstances, with which we ourselves ought to be best acquainted, and have to be guided by the evidence of experts when we here would require no such assistance. In .'the end, as was evidenced in the New Zealand case the other day, whether the decision happens to be right or wrong, a most lamentable bungle may be made as to the circumstances on which a judgment is founded. The Privy Council cannot be blamed because the New Zealand case was not properly brought before them. That may have been the fault of the solicitors or of counsel ; and J Judges cannot act except on that which they know'. As a matter of fact, in the New Zealand case the Privy Council acted on a false assumption of the law of New Zealand, and of the circumstances under which the case arose. </para>

                            <para>- Quite impossible. If the Privy Council judgment happened to be right in that case, it was more by good luck than by good management ; the grounds on which they decided may have been right, but the material was certainly all wrong. The people of New Zealand first knew of the decision when they saw the severe strictures passed on the Judges. If the trial had been held in a High Court of Australia sitting in one of the States, the proceedings would have been published from day to day, and such a lamentable mistake as was then made could not possibly have happened. With a High Court in Australia we should have justice administered in the broad light of day instead of practically in a back room 13,000 miles away, and realty inaccessible to persons acquainted with all the circumstances of the cases. It may be said that the public and lawyers may listen to the proceedings in Privy Council appeals; but the public and the lawyers who would attend cannot do so owing to the immense distance. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply saying that the public may listen to th appeals if they choose - that is their proud prerogative under the British Constitution. This is one of the most important objections to Privy Council appeals, along with the other objection to which I have referred, namely, that nothing is known of -the proceedings until judgment is delivered. The Convention proposed to take away the right of Privy Council appeal ; but strong resistance was offered by an exceedingly active minority from the States, in the absence of which I have not the slightest doubt that the Secretary of State for the Colonies would not have taken up the position he did. That minority did not represent the general public of Australia, but it prevented the mission which went to England from being as successful as it otherwise would have been ; and the result was the Constitution as we have it now. It is contended that the cardinal features1 of the Constitution have been so altered that the same obliga-tion does not rest on the Legislature to establish u High Court as would have rested on it had the Constitution been passed as originally proposed. I have read the arguments which have been used here and elsewhere to show that the establishment of "the High Court is not mandatory, but that there is merely conferred an authority which we may or may not exercise as we like. I cannot honestly think that any lawyer seriously entertains that. view. I put it strongly to honorable senators that the High Court is not the creation of Parliament, but is established by the Constitution. Other Federal Courts, or courts vested with Federal jurisdiction, may <inline font-style="italic">or may not</inline> be established by Parliament ; that is within our control. But the High Court is the very basis of the Constitution. It is provided for by the Constitution Act, and the Legislature have only a Ministerial power in respect of it. This power is legislative in one particular, but Ministerial in the bulk. It is a Ministerial power to define the manner in which the court shall carry out its jurisdiction, and to prescribe the number of Judges : although, in that particular, there is a limitation upon the Legislature that the number of Judges shall not be less than three I notice that it has been said in another place, and also in the Senate, that Parliament has discretion on this subject. I say " certainly not." This is a part of the Constitution as much as Executive control is a part of the Constitution. The Constitution does all the work itself so far as it can, and' it gives to Parliament a mere Ministerial duty to carry out. It lets Parliament settle whether there shall be more than three J Judges Except for that one thing, the duties of Parliament in respect of this matter are merely Ministerial. It is said that as we have postponed appointing the High Court for so long we can postpone it for a little longer. That argument means that if one does a wrong often enough, or long enough, it becomes all right. In my opinion, as I said by interjection when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> was speaking, the constitutional machine will not be complete until the Judiciary is appointed. We ought not to have legislated except in matters of immediate moment - by passing temporary Supply Bills, and measures of that description - until the. Judiciary was established. Above all things, we had no business to give Federal jurisdiction to any courts until the High Court was established. The other courts were ancillary to the High Court. They were in the nature of agents for the High Court. How is it possible to have that which is ancillary or an agentship established before the principal thing is established ? I agree with what was very well said in another place by an eminent leader of the Bar in Victoria, that the sooner we pass this High Court Bill the better, if only to meet the difficulties that may arise through some of our legislation proving ultimately to be a little beyond our jurisdiction. Let us cure this defect as soon as possible. If we have been improvident, let us cure our improvidence as soon as we can. But to use this neglect and improvidence as an argument against carrying out the mandate of the Constitution is unworthy of the honorable gentlemen who defend such a course. I say unhesitatingly that without this High Court provision, Federation would not have been accepted. It certainly would not have been accepted in South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon, .Senator Playford,</inline> and I, in our campaigns, pointed to the High Court as being the protection we should have against the aggressiveness of numbers. We certainly should never have persuaded the people of South Australia to accept Federation except for it. They said that the result of Federation would be that they would be merged in New South Wales and Victoria - most likely Victoria - and they were not prepared to make this sacrifice. We explained to them, as we were justified in doing - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> who is voting the other way, heard me explain this matter several times when we were on our campaign together - in unmistakable language that this High Court was to be above Parliament, inasmuch as it was the protector and defender of the Constitution, and especially the defender of the rights of the smaller States. We pointed out that it was from that point of view that the High Court was established in the United States, and that we had followed the American precedent. What do my Victorian friends mean by the stand which they are taking now ? What has happened to justify their position ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has said that the objections to the High Court were stated during the time the Convention proposals were being considered. </para>

                            <para>- If he pointed out objections and was beaten, he ought to take his defeat in a proper and constitutional way, and not try to resist the law because he has not been able to mould it at his own sweet will. But if at the time of the Convention he made no objection when the subject was being publicly discussed, he failed in his duty all the more by remaining absolutely silent. Such difficulties as we had in the Convention of 1891, and such as we had - although at that time they were smaller difficulties - in the later Convention, came generally from the Victorian members.. Singularly enough, they never came from the New South Wales members who, though they had just as large an interest in the subject, seemed to take a broader view. The Victorian members had a strong disposition against the principle of equality of representation in the Senate, and against provisions of the Bill which would give the smaller States such powers as they ought to have in comparison with the larger ones. But the Bill was submitted to the people at the referendum, and the people said " yes " to it. Thereupon, with the full consent of the people of Victoria, as well as of the other States, the Constitution was adopted. I say that those whose duty it is to preserve the Constitution, and! stand by it, are false to their trust in endeavouring to enfeeble it in the smallest iota. It has been proved to demonstration that the High Court was created by the Constitution. The next point to consider is - What was the jurisdiction conferred upon it ? There were some items of original jurisdiction which the Legislature could not interfere with, and very important those were. Some were absolute, some were conditional on the Legislature bestowing this jurisdiction. The principal power was the right to entertain appeals. I do not think that honorable senators have quite realized what authority this general right to entertain appeals gives. It was said in America, soon after the Constitution of the United States was adopted, that the right to entertain appeals gave the right to remove causes before judgment from the courts in which the proceedings had originated ; that incidental to the power of appeal, the court had the right to remove cases before judgment had been given. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Story decided, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Martin</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Hunter,</inline> that the United States Supreme Court - and the American power is substantially the same as ours - asa court of appeal, had increased jurisdiction to remove cases which might be subjects of appeal.

                        <para>This power of removal is not to be found in any part of the Constitution - if it be given, it is only given by implication as a power necessary and proper to carry into effect some express power. The power of removal is certainly not, in strictness of language, a grant of original jurisdiction - it presupposes an exercise of original jurisdiction to have attached elsewhere. The existence qf this power of removal is. familiar in courts acting according to the course of the common law in criminal as well as civil cases, and it is exercised before as well as after judgment. But this is always deemed in both, cases an exercise of appellate and not of original jurisdiction. </para>

                    <para class="block">Observe what an immense jurisdiction that power gives to the High Court. In a casein which they have an appellate jurisdiction they need not wait until judgment is given. They can remove a case from the court below into the High Court for the purpose of trying it before judgment has. been delivered ; and that the American Judges laid down was not an origination of proceedings in the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Story- said that it is always an implied power. If, under our Constitution, that power exists, whether by express enactment or by necessary implication, it cannot be taken away by Parliament in any shape or form. For we can no more, by legislation, take away powers which are .implied than we can take away powers which are expressly conferred upon the High Court. "There are appeals from all the States Courts to the High Court. There are appeals from all Federal Courts to the High Court. There are appeals from every State Court in Australia - where an appeal at the time of the passing of the Constitution lay - <inline font-style="italic">'-to</inline> the Privy Council. That is the one limitation. Observe what a huge jurisdiction that gives to the High Court. It has not, of necessity, to wait until the appeal comes to it, but it may anticipate judgment in the court below by removing the case and trying it ; and it can do that in all jurisdictions of the States Courts, whether those relating to Federal matters or relating to other matters. There may not be many cases just now for the High Court to try. We are only feeling our way. We, ourselves, do not properly understand our Constitution as yet. We, who are supposed to be experts, are merely children seeking the light. But what about the people outside <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> They know nothing in the world about it. </para>

We should have tried the question of the disputed boundary long ago had there been means of trying it. One Victorian Government agreed to a case being stated to the Privy Council, but that Government went out of office and the succeeding Government would not permit the case to go on. Consequently there is no remedy. We did appeal to the Crown, but the Crown said in effect - " You must settle these questions amongst yourselves." There was no remedy for us unless by means of an army. The result is that South Australia with respect to that disputed territory is simply remedyless, and cannot even get the question tried. Is not that a sufficient reason why we should have the High Court established 1 These were some of the questions actually mentioned as instances in the Convention debates. Similarly, is not the River Murray question one upon which it is absolutely necessary that there should be a settlement ? </para>

                            <para>- Victoria has t he disputed territory also. But is it not imperative that there should be some tribunal to try such cases? Under the Constitution the High Court has jurisdiction to try questions arising between the inhabitants of one State and the inhabitants of another. First of all, under sections 73 and 74, there is the appellate power of the High Court. Then, under section 75, the High Court has original jurisdiction in all matters - in which the Commonwealth or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth is a party ; and all matters - between States or between residents of different States or between a State and a resident of another State. </para>

                    <para class="block">Cannot honorable senators see, therefore, the immense ambit of the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, and the necessity for its being a strong court to carry out the work thrown upon it ? Under the American decisions, the High Court has the power of appeal absolutely in words, and we use the American words so as to make applicable to our circumstances the American decisions, that include that power of removal before judgment. This will mean an immense addition to the work of the court. I will also say this with regard to the American decisions. First of all, the opponents of this Bill say - " Why do you want to establish a High Court, when you have the American decisions to govern you " ; and then they say - " We will not follow the American decisions, because you have not got a High Court"; so that they have us both ways. If their argument that they are willing to follow the American decisions is carried out, then, undoubtedly, a High Court must be established. .For that was the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Story in a case that was tried iri the United States, and that was also the view expressed by Chancellor Kent in his great <inline font-style="italic">Commentaries,</inline> which have been quoted and which I do not wish to repeat. Story said that there was no discretion in the Legislature - that the word " shall " was imperative, and that the court had to be established as soon as possible. Kent took the same view. It was acted upon, and has always been taken as law. If the American authority is conclusive, there is the authority for what the Ministry are -contending for now - that this court ought to be at once established, and when established, its jurisdiction, as I have said, will be immense. It will have not merely the jurisdiction in appeal immediately conferred, but it will also have an implied jurisdiction in causes removed. It will not have quite all the jurisdiction which we desire, because we should like the Privy Council to be excluded altogether. I would ask honorable senators to notice that an appeal from the High Court will never be as of right; it will always be as of favour. In granting these appeals, the King in Council would probably go on somewhat the same lines, only more strongly so, as are adopted in the case of Canada, and never allow an appeal unless some very large question were involved. In Canada there is an alternative appeal. The Privy Council does not allow an appeal from Canada as a matter of course in the slightest degree. The general principle on which it acts is to say to a litigant - "Before you come to us, you must first exhaust all local remedies. If it is the decision of a Judge, although it is a final decision, you must go to the Pull Court." </para>

                            <para>- That is ari exception, but it arises under special legislation. The Privy Council says : - "If it is a decision by the Full Court, and there is a court of appeal, you must go to that body." The genera] principle, which they have always followed, and which they are emphasizing in the case of Canada, and will emphasize still more in our case* is not to allow an appeal to them unless the litigant has exhausted all local remedies ; and when all local remedies have been exhausted, then he has to show some very good reason why an appeal should be allowed. We have another power. We have a power by legislation to limit the cases in which an appeal to the Privy Council by favour can be granted from the High Court, only that it has to be assented to by the King. So that first of all we have the power of drawing nearly all the cases into the High Court. I do not say that the power will be exercised, because, of course, it would only be used in cases involving Federal jurisdiction. When the cases get to the High Court, in some instances there is no' appeal at all except by its leave, and in other instances there is an appeal by favour to the Privy Council, which, again, is subject to limitation by subsequent enactment, which may reduce that power to nothing at all, subject, of course, to the King's assenting to the Bill. If we wish to carry out our original desire - to have a great court which shall be sufficient for our own needs, in which justice shall be administered within our hearing, and under our eye, in which every argument shall be submitted, and to which every assistance shall be given to bring about a just conclusion, with the possibility before us, without any alteration of the Constitution Act, of our practically doing away by legislation with this right of' appeal, subject to the King's assent ; if we have that inherent power under the Constitution, is not that a reason for our endeavouring to establish, a court of such strength and dignity that its decisions shall be so respected that, when we ask for further diminution of this right of appeal, it will be conceded to us ? We asked to have the judicial power placed in our hands absolutely, and at once. The Imperial Parliament desires us to go through an educational course. It says - "Your court will have huge powers. You have the power of limiting our right to grant special leave to appeal, subject to our dissent. Show us that your court is as capable as it ought to be to do the great work which you have thrust upon it, and fear not that our assent will be withheld." All these appear to me to be reasons why we ought to provide for a very powerful court. It is to be regretted that the Bill was altered in another place, that it does not still provide for a court of five Judges. I look upon the question of the expense, which has been made so much of, as being simply beneath contempt. That a Commonwealth, whose Customs revenue is £10,000,000, which is going in for large defence and other expenditure, absolutely out of proportion to its requirements, should hesitate about voting £30,000 to establish the High Court, which is the very foundation of the Commonwealth and of the rights of the States thereunder, is simply beneath contempt. The Constitution cannot work without the High Court. .The </para>

                    <para class="block">Constitution cannot work satisfactorily unless the High Court is competent, and undoubtedly it needs not merely the weight of intellect, but the weight of numbers as well, in order to prevent the ill-feeling which, comes from appealing from a larger number of Judges to a smaller number. It does seem an extraordinary thing to me that we should have this question of saving the salaries of two Judges raised when at the very initiation of our Constitution we are establishing a body on which the States rely for the correct exposition of its meaning, and the settlement of all disputes between the Commonwealth and themselves, between the inhabitants of their States and themselves, and in which the whole people of the Commonwealth are concerned. That we should quibble over what, as against the revenue, are a few shillings, on the very foundation of our Constitution, indicates either a lamentably small way of approaching the subject, or else a determined attempt to destroy or weaken the Federation by establishing a court which would bring the Federation into contempt.

                            <para>- It is one or the other. We all know, that everybody was not in favour of Federation, and some persons would now be very glad to see the Commonwealth done away with and the Constitution Act repealed. Possibly it may have occurred that weakening the High Court, or weakening any part of the Constitution so as to make it less effective might be a strong. argument in favour of not continuing the system as it is at present. At all events the line of attack in opposing the completion of the machinery, the making of the Constitution a workable instead of an unworkable thing, the question whether the expenditure should be £20,000 or £30,000, appears to me to be quite unworthy of the great people whom wo profess to be, of the great Commonwealth which we wish- to. see safely established. As regards the question of composing the High Court of States Judges, it has been sufficiently dealt with, and it is unnecessary that I should elaborate it. We have to appoint the Judges, and we have no business to take a Judge of anybody else's appointment. If a Judge who is appointed has to resign his office and become a Judge under the Commonwealth, it can be done now; there will be no trouble at all on that point. If a Judge is to retain both offices, the position will be inconsistent and ridiculous. The States Judges do not of necessity hold office on the same tenure as the Judges to be appointed under the Commonwealth. The States Judges hold their positions under the local Constitution Acts, which may or may not be the same as the Commonwealth Constitution in that respect, but which, whether they are the same or not, may be' altered by the same power that created them. We might, therefore, have the anomaly of having a State Judge employed as a Commonwealth Judge, whose tenure of office was altogether different from that which is prescribed by the Constitution Act. The impossibility of a Judge serving two masters is self-evident, and although I quite agree that, in Australia, we have on our Benches high-minded, honest, just, able men, still I do not wish to take them away from their sphere of capability to new fields, with which they are not acquainted, with a possibility of their doing less justice to the work which lies before them. <inline font-style="italic">Bryce,</inline> speaking of Judges taken from their ordinary fields and called upon to administer a jurisdiction like this, says - </para>

"Trade and commerce" is an exceedingly extensive term. The words are rigid enough, their meaning is elastic enough in all conscience, and they have been treated by the great Chief Justice Marshall and others in a manner which has considerably expanded them in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, and in a way which has proved beneficial entirely to the community.

                            <para>- I agree entirely with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> so eloquently expressed on that subject. The development of the American Republic is a marvellous justification of the use of terse language, but at the same time we must have competent exponents of it, and, further it must be interpreted according to the spirit of the times, and for that purpose we must have people who are sympathetic with the spirit of the time, who know what is' going on, and who will accurately interpret the law so as -to meet the demands which an altered set of circumstances require. I see that in another place it has been said that the Judges are not to make the law. We are not appointing these Judges for the purpose of making a Constitution for us, but for the purpose of interpreting what we have done ; interpreting it strictly, undoubtedly, but in its interpretation they must have immense latitude. The elasticity comes in there, and it was on the sympathetic and wise interpretation of the American Constitution that the good working of the institutions of government and the good results to the public depended. It is not as important with us, perhaps, as it was with them, because we have all their illustrious precedents to guide and assist us. There is no doubt that when adopting all these terms from the American Constitution, we acted advisedly, so that all the 120 years of experience and the immensity of volumes that have resulted from it should- be available to us in deciding what these words mean. ' But it does not follow that these are exhaustive, and that no more is to be done. There is still much in the future to be determined, and for the work there ought to be a High Court raised above all questions of State concern, not only the arbiter between the Commonwealth and the States, the States themselves, the citizens of one State and those of another, but also the arbiter of the extent of the interpretation of these hugely broad terms of jurisdiction which the Constitution bestows upon the Commonwealth, and of which the High Court must ultimately be the interpreter. I do not think there is anything more that I wish to say. The subject is so expansive that it would not be very difficult to talk at much greater length ; but the whole question has been very fully considered and thrashed out, and is, I think, practically determined by the Senate. I wish only once more to express my regret that a pecuniary consideration of some £10,000 should have led another place to agree that this High Court should be reduced in numbers, and therefore reduced in dignity, when at the outset of our Commonwealth it was essential that we should surround it with every dignity and give it every importance. </para>

                        <para>- After the very able and eloquent addresses we have heard from legal representatives in the Senate, it' might be advisable that the situation should be placed before the public from a layman's point of view, and from the point of view of the largest class in the community - I refer to the working or industrial class. I should like also to deal very shortly with the question from the constitutional point of view. I should like all those honorable senators who have at different times declared that we have no command from the people ; that there is no mandatory statement in the Constitution that this court should be brought into existence straight away that we may dilly-dally over the matter as long as we please if, in the opinion of some small section of the population of Victoria, we can save -a paltry pound or two - I should like those honorable senators to look at the Constitution. They will find that in the very first section of the first chapter of the Constitution dealing with the legislative power, we are told that the legislative power of the Constitution shall be vested in a "Federal </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives," called the Parliament of the Commonwealth. It does not say that we are to dally over that. It does not say it is to be done to-morrow or the next day. In exactly the same position, we find the provision with respect to the executive power of the Commonwealth. In Chapter II. of the Constitution, we are told that the executive power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the Queen and so many Ministers. It provides for their appointment, but it does not say that this is to be done to-morrow or the next day. There is is no definite time fixed in connection with the executive power of the Commonwealth. There is Chapter I., dealing with the legislative power of the Commonwealth ; Chapter II., dealing with the executive power; and Chapter III., dealing with the judicial power in exactly the same terms. There is no question as to the date when these powers are to be brought into existence. If it has been necessary to bring into existence the Parliament and the Executive, seeing that the High Court is the complement of these, is it not just as necessary that it should be brought into existence as speedily as possible ? I agree with certain honorable senators who have already spoken, that this Parliament had no right to pass a single Act having reference to the concerns of the people one with another before it created this High Court. If honorable senators will only read the Constitution fairly and with an unbiased mind, they will see that the creation of the High Court runs concurrently with the creation of the Parliament and Executive. . The one is the complement of the others, and any honorable senator who now says that we can delay the establishment of any of these powers for an indefinite term is not true to the Constitution. I have been still more surprised that certain honorable senators, and certain honorable members in another place, who assisted in framing the Constitution, should have turned about in the way they have done. Some of them actually went through the country inviting the people to approve of this Constitution on the ground that one of the greatest blessings it would give to the Commonwealth was a High Court, which would protect the smaller States as well as individuals against injustice. Now because in some quarters of the Commonwealth a cry for economy has arisen they have been frightened to such an extent that they are actually prepared to go back upon the work they did five or six years ago. But there are others who honestly oppose the creation of a High Court -who, indeed, opposed Federation. I should like to point out to those who take that attitude that he would be an unworthy member of any community who, when by a large or a small majority a Constitution had been agreed on, exercised all the eloquence he possessed in an endeavour to mould that Constitution to his own particular view. Honorable senators have no right to now raise doubts and difficulties in the way of carrying out the clear meaning of the Federal Constitution ; they should use every effort, in the interests of the people, to carry out every provision of the Constitution which they themselves helped to frame. It is said that there is no work for a High Court - that we ought to wait until work is provided. But if that argument be a valid one, it might be applied with equal force to the Defence Bill. It might be pointed out that there being no war, or danger of war, there is no necessity to make any provision for defence ; but I hope honorable senators will see the absurdity of arguments of that character. Senators Stewart and Higgs have referred' to the naval subsidy proposal ; and here, again, the argument to which I have just referred would apply. It might be said that it is quite time enough to assist in providing a navy for the protection of Australia when there is any danger of war, and that because there is no probability of war for years it is useless to spend a f farthing on naval defence. If the argument applies to one case it applies to all. In my opinion it is just as necessary to establish a High Court to interpret the laws passed by the Commonwealth as it is to pass legislation providing for our defence. The general public, and a great many working people, are misled by newspapers, and by public men who endeavour to show that a large amount of money might be saved by delaying the establishment of the High Court. I should like to refer to one gross misrepresentation in one of the daily newspapers in South Australia - a misrepresentation which shows how absolutely necessary it is for members of this Parliament to visit their own States as often as possible, in order to correct statements which might have very injurious effects. The misrepresentation to which I particularly refer was in the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of the 29th July - a newspaper which is owned by one of the representatives of South Australia in the Federal Parliament. If the misrepresentation had appeared in only one part of the newspaper, it might have been regarded as a printer's error, but when it is found repeated in two or three places, and in two or three other newspapers, we must come to the conclusion that there is something wrong - that it must be done for the purpose of misleading the people, or that journalism is of such a character that no reliance can be placed on it for truth. The mis-statement was' that on the Estimates for this year £45,000 is provided to meet the cost of the establishment of a High Court. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt that people believed the statement, because dozens came to me in South Australia in reference to it. When I made inquiries I found, as will be seen on page 19 of the Estimates, that the amount provided i? not £45,000, but £4,500 ; so that a ten-fold lie has been told for the purpose of sustaining a certain position on this question. In the face of such misrepresentation we, who represent the people, cannot be expected to be treated fairly. I should like to ask members of the industrial classes - and even business people - by whom they would like to have the Commonwealth laws administered and interpreted? We have passed an Immigration Restriction Act, a Pacific Island Labourers Act, and a Post and Telegraph Act ; and in the last-mentioned there are sections which are supposed to be in the interests of the great masses of the people. Are these laws to be interpreted by J Judges of the States Courts, who, notwithstanding anything that may be said, are bound to have bias, either conscious or unconscious ? Such measures as the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill or the Navigation Bill have a more definite relation to the great masses of the people than any others we have passed or are likely to pass. I should like to ask the working classes of "Victoria, or Senators Barrett and Styles, whether they would like any of the Acts I have mentioned to be administered and interpreted by a court under the domination or influence of the present Victorian Govern-' ment, or whether they would not prefer to have it heard by Judges appointed and paid by the Commonwealth? From which court would the working classes be more likely to get a fair and unbiased interpretation of the law ? Is it from the State Courts of Queensland that we would get the most unbiased interpretation of the Immigration Restriction Act ? Those who advocate delay until there is a great accumulation of work for. a High Court, are making a great mistake. Such a court was not absolutely necessary two years ago, because we had then passed very little legislation. Now, however, we have passed a great many Acts - indeed I may say that the Federal Parliament has passed as much important legislation as has any other legislative body in Australia in the same time. And this legislation is of a character which affects the whole of the people.' Seeing that within the next two or three years there will be a good deal more similar legislation, it is the duty of the Federal Parliament to create a High Court. The working classes are those which have been the most misled in the past, and are the most likely to be misled by the cry for economy. The working classes know what it is to economise - they know what it is to ma,Ke one shilling go as far as two shillings ; and' they are more likely than other people to be misled by the cry for economy. But I ask the working classes - Who is preaching economy now? Economy is being preached, in reference to the High Court, by the very sections of the community who protest against such measures as the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. They are the very sections of the community who, for the past twenty years, in Victoria and the other States, have been doing all they possibly can to keep the working classes in a degraded position. I should like the working men of Australia to look at the matter from that point of view. These are the very classes who led the way in the Federation movement. The Chambers of Manufacture and the Chambers of Commerce, with the selfish instincts which have ever actuated them, loudly advocated Federation ; and, I dare Say, those selfish instincts will continue their influence until Federation smothers them. Victoria's fiscal policy had developed industries, and with them Chambers of Manufactures and Chambers of Commerce ; and, imagining that, with manufactures already established, Victoria would be able to supply the other </para>

                    <para class="block">States, and thus reap great benefit, those organizations strenuously advocated Federation. Had they had any idea that com-' petition would be induced, they would not have urged the people of Victoria to adopt Federation ; but competition has arisen, and the attitude of these gentlemen has changed. Then we have the Victorian stock brokers - those great walking gentlemen. Did the stock brokers ever do anything in their ves to assist the working classes ? Have not all the resolutions passed at their meetings been opposed to the interests of the working classes ? These are the people who are crying out against the expense of the High Court. "We have them all over the country passing resolutions. Probably, the meetings consist of the chairman of some district council, and a couple of individuals who pretend that they represent the people. They send the resolutions which they pass down to the newspapers, and have them published. Two or three people meeting together in this way try to get the world to believe that they are expressing the public opinion of a country like this. The thing is so monstrous that I am surprised that men having the astuteness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> are led away by it. </para>

                            <para>- It is a peculiar thing to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> talking about, being sold. If ever there was a representative of any portion of Australia who has changed about in connexion with almost every question, he is the man. He has actually surprised . himself by his own changes. There is not an honorable senator who is so fickle. I speak as a member of the labour party, and, as far as they are concerned, when they come to Parliament they have made up their minds on certain questions. They come here not to be moved by the eloquence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,,</inline> but to try to give effect to legislation affecting questions which they have thrashed out years ago. </para>

                            <para>-All this has very little r.o do with the establishment of the High Court, and I shall not deal with it any further. But I intend to warn the working classes of Australia to beware of those advisers who recommended them to adopt the Constitution. Those same advisers to-day are going about Victoria declaring that if they had to vote again, they would vote against the Constitution. They are trying to make the people believe that it would have been better for them not to take the advice they gave four or five years ago. Is it a safe thing for the lambs to keep company with the wolves? When the wolves say that they are advising them for their own good, I tell the lambs to beware, and rather go in the opposite direction than in the direction in which their advisers wish to take them. With respect to the expenses of the High Court, a paper has been circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal,</inline> showing the cost of the Judicatures of the different States. New South Wales spends in that direction over £255,000 a year ; Victoria, over £135,000 ; Queensland, over £75,000 ; Western Australia, over £57,000 ; and the model State of South Australia, where one can get just as much law, and I dare say just as much justice as anywhere else, spends £27,000 a year. When the question of Federation was being discussed in the States, some of us told the people that we objected to it on account of the enormous expense which was bound to be incurred. I was opposed to the Constitution originally, and pointed out to the people what I thought it was  going to cost. But people said to me - " You are wrong ; we believe these others, who tell us that we are going to save more by the cutting down of expenses in the States than we shall lose by bringing into existence the machinery of the Commonwealth." The common cry was - " "We are going to save in State administration more than will pay for Commonwealth administration." </para>

                            <para>- Is it not time that this saving began in the States? What is the meaning of the figures which 1 have quoted ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer, Senator Symon,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> know that in South Australia there has been a cry for economy in respect to the Judicature for some time past. That State could do with only two Judges. If South Australia is spending £27,000 a year, and could do with a Judge less - including all the machinery in connexion with a Judge - the expenditure could be brought down to at least £20,000, without the people suffering anything by it. But because New South Wales and Victoria have been extravagant in the past, and are not prepared to economize now, is it reasonable to expect that the Commonwealth shall not bring into existence the machinery necessary for the interpretation and administration of the law? </para>

                            <para>- Victoria will need to reduce her expenditure considerably before she attains reasonable limits of economy. South Australia has about one-third of the population of Victoria or New South Wales. If honorable senators multiply £27,000 by 3, the result is £8,000. Divide that into the cost of the Judicature in New South Wales, and it will be found that that State is paying three times as much for the interpretation of the law as South Australia is paying. On the same basis, it will be found that Victoria is paying nearly twice as much. I am proud of the State that can do efficiently and effectively, for one-third of the cost that is incurred in another State, what that other State is only doing in a very slipshod manner. Suppose that economies were effected in South Australia to the extent of £7,000, and that Victoria and New South Wales were to bring their expenditure down to the same margin of economy and efficiency, South Australia would then be paying £20,000 a year for her Judiciary ; Victoria would be paying £60,000 a year ; and New South Wales about £80,000 a year. Yet all we are asked to pay for the officers and Judges of the High Court of Australia is £20,000 a year. And yet, in the face of this fact, there are people who are crying out against bringing this machinery of the Commonwealth Constitution into existence. I say to Victoria and New South Wales - " Before you cry out against the representatives in the Federal Parliament of your own or any other States, do your own work as it ought to be done ; bring about the economies you promised before Federation was commenced. Then there will be no burden in creating a High Court, and the many other institutions that are contemplated by our Constitution. But until such time as you do that, you have no right to complain of the action of the Federal Parliament, which is by no means extravagant in its demands in connexion with the High Court." Each one of the States can bring about economies in their own Judiciaries that would represent a larger sum than it would cost to establish the Federal High Court. It is, therefore, the duty of the States Parliaments to bring about these economies before complaining of our action. There are many other directions in which the States ought to economize, and have promised to economize. They may now very well begin to do so. I trust that honorable senators will not be frightened by what they have read in the press, or by what they may hear from different platforms, but will treat this question in a straightforward and honest manner. Those who turn to the history of this measure in another place will find that, principally in consequence of the action of the Victorian representatives, the more comprehensive character of the High Court was destroyed. It was destroyed, not on the merits of the Judiciary itself, but because the "Victorian representatives had been instructed - or rather, as Senator Pulsford would say, commanded - by the press to have only three Judges instead of five. Honorable senators who bring matters down to that level are legislating by excuse, not by the merits of the measures brought before them. I hope that the representatives of the different States will take a far higher view of their responsibilities than to do anything of that description, and will, if they possibly can, confer the fullest jurisdiction and so make the High Court one of which the people of Australia ought to be proud, and which, by its just interpretation of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Constitution and Federal laws, will give such satisfaction that the Privy Council will almost refuse to hear an appeal from Australia. I think that enough time has been given to the discussion of the measure. I have no desire to weary honorable senators by endeavouring to conjure up arguments or to clothe arguments in a form different from that in which they have been presented. I hope that the second reading will be carried, and that the Bill will be improved rather than otherwise when it leaves the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I am one of those who feel it is necessary, even in dealing with this very great question, to study the requirements of the people and the financial position in which we find ourselves. I am not afraid to say that I am largely influenced by what has been said of the need for economy in the States, and especially in the State which I have the honour to represent. The arguments which have been advanced by several honorable senators have certainly been of a very high order, and must be of very deep interest to those who read the report of the debate. I have read most of the speeches delivered in the other House, and I have heard all the speeches delivered in the Senate, but I still think that, at least for a time, we could give such jurisdiction to the Supreme Courts of the States as would enable us to proceed satisfactorily with the work of the Federation. </para>

During our. existence of two and a-half years we have passed a Tariff which has caused a great deal of friction. We have had appeals to the States Courts, but has the Commonwealth had any reason to complain about the decisions? </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth has had no reason to complain about the decisions by the States . Courts. Since we urged the people to accept the Constitution Bill, and started this great Commonwealth, what has been our fate ? We have had a drought of such a character as to destroy millions of sheep and hundreds of thousands of cattle, and our crops have failed to such an extent that to-day we are in financial difficulties. Within the next few months Victoria will have to raise a loan of five and a half millions to pay her debts, and even South Australia will soon have to raise a loan to redeem some of her debentures. It behoves us therefore to be very careful not to incur any more expense than is absolutely necessary. Take the Supreme Courts of the States. In many cases the Judges cannot be got rid of unless they retire. I do not care whether it is called the Kyabram cry or any other cry, we are under the necessity of studying economy, especially when we know that we have able Judges on the States Benches ; that the South Australian Bench includes a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ; that we have J Judges like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Darley. Surely these men, who are possessed of high attainments and have had a large experience, are as deeply imbued with the Federal spirit as any men who may sit on the Bench of the High Court <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> When we know that the services of such great jurists are available to us we ought, at least for a time, to invest them with the jurisdiction which is necessary to enable us to get on with our Federal work. </para>

                            <para>- We are asked to create a High Court because we are told it is necessary to have men who will interpret the Constitution in a purely Federal spirit. The Constitution preserves ' to the States their rights, and we are not justified in having a Federal Court so strongly in favour of the Commonwealth as opposed to the States. What we are anxious to do is to preserve to the States the powers which the Constitution gives to them, and not to have Federal Judges who, by their decisions, would really take away those powers from the States. If we turn to the early history of the United States, what do we find ? We find that the decisions of its Supreme Court were influenced largely by the party in power. When Marshall was Chief Justice, he interpreted every provision of the American Constitution according to the broad Federal idea, and he was influenced largely by the opinions of such men as Alexander Hamilton. But when he passed away, and the other party came into power which represented the States rather than the Federation, the Judges gave their decisions more in favour of the States. We do not desire that spirit to be exhibited in the High Court of Australia. When we have at our disposal men who are familiar with every step which was taken to establish the Commonwealth, who are- familiar with every line in the Constitution, who have held judicial positions for years, and command the highest respect of every citizen, I contend that they should be asked to come to our aid and interpret the Constitution, and I submit that they are able to interpret it according to the desires of the people. It has been urged, and urged very boldly, that there is a mandate in the Constitution to the Parliament to establish a High Court. I shall not argue that point at all, because it has ray sympathy. Those of us who will vote against the second reading of this Bill have no desire to say that there shall not be a High Court.- I believe that almost every member of the Legislative Council and of the House of Assembly of South Australia has petitioned the Senate to delay the establishment of the High Court which the Bill provides for. Are not these men federalists ? </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The times were not sufficiently good ; the financial position was not such as to justify the appointment of five Judges ; and the Government yielded to the pressure to such an extent that even the friends of the Bill are almost ashamed to support its second reading in the form in which it is now presented to them. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. The Members of the Parliament of South Australia and the members of the Chamber" of Co'mmerce, the Chamber of Manufactures, and various other bodies who have petitioned the Senate on this subject, have not been -influenced by the newspapers. They knew very well the financial position of the States, and they could see that we are not in a position just now to incur further expense. We have Judges capable of interpreting the Constitution as it should be interpreted, not in favour of the Commonwealth as against the States, but in such a way as to do justice to both, because they will be citizens of both. </para>

                        <para>- I look upon the establishment of a High Court as a great and solemn duty, the fulfilment of which has been too long delayed, and which ought to be proceeded with at once. If the Constitution itself did not require us to do what we are proceeding to do, it seems to me that common sense and the ordinary usages of civilized nations would lead us to take this course. I have, as I suppose we all have, a great deal of sympathy with the cry for economy. But economy must be properly directed, and if there is anything on the face of the earth that is not economical, it is bad law, or law improperly directed and insufficiently administered. The truest and best economy for Australia is a High Court, established on a broad and liberal basis, and clothed with such honour and dignity as we can give it. I do not propose to detain the Senate any longer. I should like to say that I am proud of the position which has been taken up by a majority of honorable senators. I think that most honorable senators have spoken from a high sense of the importance of the question, and of the greatness of the Commonwealth ; and they have seen how much depends upon the character of the High Court which we are to establish. I hope that when we get into Committee we shall take some steps which will tend to improve the Bill, and that we shall send it out of this Chamber a better Bill than it is at the present moment. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not take up more than a few moments in reply. I have always followed the rule in the Senate never to take up time unless there is some necessity for it. The arguments that have been used in support of this measure have been put with the utmost strength and the greatest possible eloquence. The arguments on the other side have been answered completely. There is, therefore, really no advantage to be gained by my taking up the time of the Senate in repeating what has already been said. Some few amendments will require to be made in Committee, dealing, for the most part, with questions of drafting, while some will be of a little more importance. These will be explained as they come up for consideration. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to express my regret that the court has been limited to three Justices, which I regard as altogether an insufficient Bench. The Commonwealth High Court should not be inferior in a numerical sense to the States Courts. I do not propose any alteration, but I am sorry the number of Judges was reduced in another place. I hope, however, that ere many years have passed, the number will be increased to at least five. </para>

                            ought to see at a glance how ridiculous his proposal is. No economy could result, because the States would simply fill up the vacancies under the powers given to them by their present Acts. There is nothing in the proposal to indicate from which States the J Judges are to be taken, and it would be much better to pass the clause as it stands.

                    <para>- I suggest that Senator Charleston withdraw his amendment. His object is a laudable one, but it is impossible to attain it in the way he proposes. No economy could be effected, because if the States did not want to get rid of the Judges, the vacancies would be simply filled up. On the other hand, the choice of the Government would be restricted to one class. </para>

                        <para>- That is my public and private opinion on this particular occasion. It seems to me that honorable senators are trying to disregard economy ; but I am quite sure that after the High Court has been established for some little- time, the estimated expenditure of £23,000perannum will be found to be utterly inadequate. I have shown on a previous occasion that the salaries of the officials, without including police, tip-staffs, court orderlies, and the like, will amount to £23,000 or £24,000 per annum ; so that the total cost must ultimately he nearly double that amount. The suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> is not one to be lightly disregarded, if he will use the word " may." </para>

We should then have men of experience - nien who have adorned the Benches in the various States, and who would ascend the High Court Bench with a prestige which would justify the confidence the public ought to feel in such a tribunal. I submit the amendment not with a view of embarrassing the Government, but in order to give them the choice of the very best men. That was my sole object in moving this amendment. </para>

In New South Wales,. . for instance, the District Courts have no jurisdiction in questions involving titles to land. Their jurisdiction is limited to £200' in amount. The result is that the class of cases which the Judges of these courts have-, to try do not embrace anything like the area of law which a Supreme Court Judge's daily work brings him in contact with.

                    <para>- I am very sorry that the Vice-President of the Executive Council does not see his way to accept the amendment. I speak with some diffidence after the observations which he has made, but I know of two cases in Queensland in which District Court Judges were promoted to the Supreme Court Bench. I refer to the late Judge Pring and the late Judge Shepherd of Queensland, both of whom were District Court Judges before being elevated to the Supreme Court Bench. It was considered in those days that the experience gained as District Court Judges did a good deal to qualify men for the higher positions. It is a pity to restrict our choice. In New South Wales District Court Judges are frequently appointed acting Judges of the Supreme Court. Have they not even greater experience than some of the Supreme Court Judges have? I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I have no desire to restrict the choice of the Government unnecessarily in the appointment of High Court Judges. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has given a fair reply to the objections he himself raised as to the power of appointing District or County Court Judges when he said that we must trust the Government in making these appointments. The Government have power to appoint a practising barrister or solicitor of five years' standing. That is to say, they have power to appoint a man who, perhaps, has not appeared in court a dozen times in his life. We know that no Government would be so foolish as to appoint a man of such limited experience. It is not likely that any man would be appointed to. the High Court Bench unless he had been practising for a longer period than is necessary to qualify him to be a Judge of the Supreme Court or of a District Court. It is not a wise thing to place a bar upon the appointment of any member of the profession who has been qualified sufficiently long to take the position of a Supreme Court Judge. I admit that the work, of a District or a County Court Judge is, to a great extent, upon a different line from the work of a Supreme Court Judge. There is a difference in practice or procedure. But I do not place much reliance upon that. If we are going to say to barristers - " If you take the position of a District Court or County Court Judge, it will be a bar to your promotion," the States would have to look to an inferior class of men to be appointed to District and County Court judgeships. As these are the courts which deal with the affairs of the masses of the people, it is important that the States should be able to find good men for the positions. They should be men who have a good grip of the law, and of all the circumstances affecting a case. For these reasons we should not impose a bar. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has stated, in New South Wales, Judges of the District Court are frequently appointed temporarily to be Judges of the Supreme Court. To one part of New South Wales, Broken Hill, it is the practice to send a District Court Judge to take the circuit work of the Supreme Court. I admit that he has not to deal with nice questions of pleadings, and do the Chamber work which Judges of the Supreme Court have to. On the ground that it is not wise to restrict the choice of the Government, it will be well to accept the amendment. After all is said and done, if the Government do not consider that a man is suitable, he will not be appointed. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that a man happened to be placed on the District Court Bench for a week, he would be barred from the prospect of getting a position on the Federal Supreme Court unless he had resigned his judicial position and practised at the bar for a few years. The Bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales includes a gentleman who was a good Judge of the District Court for a number of years and afterwards returned to the Bar. Another gentleman who is looked upon as eminently qualified for the position of Supreme Court Judge, and who by the' sheer accident of ill health missed the opportunity of getting an appointment, is a District Court Judge in New South "Wales. His varied experience was of such a character as would have enabled him to fill a position on the Bench of the Supreme Court with the same dignity, honour, and ability as any of its number. He acts as a Judge of the Supreme Court every now and then. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is in a position to verify my statements. Do not let us do anything which will give the idea that we desire to bar any particular members of the profession. Let us make the field of choice as wide as possible and trust to the Government, who, if they are ordinarily prudent, will take care not to make any ludicrous appointment. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> After all, it lies with the Executive Government to say whom they shall appoint, and if we were to give full effect to the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> we should have no limitation whatever. Why is this provision put in the Bill ? It is inserted to keep the Government from doing anything which is very foolish. When the Legislature says that the Government shall not appoint a practising barrister of less than five years' standing, all it means is that, however excellent a man may be, he is not to be regarded as having had the requisite experience until he has had five years' practice. And if we say that a member of the County Court Bench may be appointed, it will simply be left open to the Executive to say whether such a person ought to be chosen. But it will bring about this anomalous position : that a man may be eligible for appointment to the Federal Supreme Court who is not eligible for appointment to the State Supreme Court. When 'we restrict the choice to practising barristers of at least five years' standing, it is left open to the Government to choose a man who has distinguished himself in his profession. When a man is appointed to the County Court Bench he is removed from active practice and may be removed from it for many years, and his experience in that position is entirely different from that which would prove of assistance to him on the Bench of the Federal Supreme Court. Therefore, it is quite right to deter a man who is ambitious enough to think that he is fit to occupy a seat on the High Court from taking a position on the Bench of the County Court. We should do nothing which would lead the public to think that the Federal Supreme Court is a less important body than a State Supreme Court. I do not think it will be found that in Western Australia a person who has held a position on the County Court Bench can obtain a position on the Supreme Court Bench. We ought not to make it possible for such a man to obtain a position on the Bench of the Federal Supreme Court. </para>

                    <para>- There is a practical difficulty which, I think, may well be taken into consideration. The amendment would do a very grave injustice to South Australia. It would not cover our case. We have neither County Courts nor District Courts strictly so called. We have a system of what are called Local Courts, and the effect of the amendment if carried would be to exclude - suppose that they were otherwise eligible - those who in our State have a very much larger and more important jurisdiction than that of many County or District Court J Judges elsewhere. </para>

If South Australia is included within the scope of the amendment by putting in the words "Local Courts," it would qualify for the position of High Court Judge a large number of most excellent laymen who have no professional qualification. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that either we should wipe out the qualification and leave the choice to the Government, who certainly would not- appoint an unqualified man, or else we should leave the clause as it is. It is also to be borne in mind that while we have most excellent men on the Benches of the County and Local Courts, the natural field of ambition for them is the Bench of the Supreme Court. At any rate, unless we enlarge very greatly the qualification, it would be much better to leave the clause as it is. It provides for the usual qualification with regard to an Appellate Court. </para>

                    <para>- As one who is a great believer in economy of time, it is left for mo to draw attention to the great waste of time that has taken place during this debate. I ask honorable senators to come down to bed-rock, and bedrock in this matter is that all this talk of extending the choice of the Government is so much nonsense. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposes to extend the choice of the Government by including County Court and District Court Judges. Do not politicians of the most ordinary brand of common sense know that it is the intention of the Government to appoint to the High Court Bench members of the present Federal Parliament? Honorable senators will recollect that when I moved a motion in this Chamber, providing that no member of the Federal Parliament should accept a position in the civil service, until he had been twelve months out of Parliament, a majority of two to one cast the motion out. Some honorable senators, who have a great gift of flattery at their command, at once commenced to butter up other honorable senators, and to ask whether I desired that they should not have a chance of appointment to the High Court Bench. We had references to " my honorable and learned friend of so many years' standing " and so forth. Since it is decided that only members of the Federal Parliament should be eligible for these positions, why should honorable senators raise false hopes in the minds of some poor Judges outside when they know that they have no possible chance of appointment ? The sooner this Bill becomes law, and the High Court J Judges are appointed, and the sooner we remove from the political atmosphere, so far as we can, any temptation to members of this Parliament to regulate their course with regard to certain possible future events, the better. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> should make such a reflection _ upon Judges at present occupying seats on County Court and District Court Benches. The past history of these courts will show that their Benches have been very creditably filled. Many of these men have had a reasonable hope that in due time they would be elevated to the Supreme Court Bench in their State, and if a vacancy on the Supreme Court Bench existed at the time of their appointment to the County Court, they might have been appointed to fill that vacancy. I hope the Vice-President of the Executive Council will not tie the hands of the present or any future Executive in this matter. I hope that no restriction will be placed upon the selection of men to fill the High Court Bench, but that every man of legal attainments, no matter what his position, will be considered eligible for appointment if he has the necessary qualifications. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> suggested that an anomalous condition of things would arise if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment were agreed to in the form in which it is put, because certain local courts in South Australia are presided over in all but one instance by laymen. The honorable and learned senator suggested that the amendment should be so framed as to include the local court, because amongst the local court Judges in South Australia there is one who possesses the necessary professional qualifications. </para>

                    <para>- I was very much surprised to hear the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who led the Committee to believe that eminent laymen are performing the duties of Judges in inferior courts in South Australia in quite as capable a manner as could qualified men. Does that not strike at the root of the whole discussion <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Does it not show that the qualifications of Judges for the .High Court have altogether been over-estimated, and that laymen, with their common sense, may make suggestions worthy of attention ? If democracy has any claims whatever, the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is one which the Committee should unanimously accept. It is within the recollection of representatives of Victoria that some time ago a County Court Judge for many years occupied an important position as Supreme Court Judge ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has told us that in New South Wales a Judge of a District or County Court has, with advantage to the State, discharged similar duties. The Government are not bound to select any man ; and if they can get a competent Judge from either the County or the District Court, surely they ought to take advantage of his services. The Government will not select an inferior man, and there should be no bar to the promotion of any one qualified to become a Judge. The late Lord Armstrong was a lawyer to begin with, but he proved to be one of the best engineers of the age ; and I. can tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that there is one man, if not more than one, on the County Court Bench who would fill the office of Judge with as much distinction as would any practising barrister in the Commonwealth. </para>

I am about to make a proposal which I think will remove all difficulty.

No Government would dare to appoint a person whom they did not believe to be suitable, or who had not by. his conduct and career shown himself to be fully qualified. That being so, I do not see that there is much necessity for preserving the restriction. </para>

If he be on the County or District Court Bench, or the Bench of any other court, and before he assumed that position had practised as a barrister, he will be eligible.

                <para class="block">A Justice of the High Court ought not to be open to appointment to any judicial office other than that conferred on him by the Commonwealth. I particularly take that view because I wish to exclude the possibility of any Judge of the High Court being appointed to the Privy Council. With the best of objects, no doubt, we have had experience of such appointments, and I think it must have come home to every one of us as an entire anomaly that a person actively occupying the position of a Judge in one country should also hold the nominally active position of a Judge in another country. I feel that it is the desire, as expressed in this Senate, that when the Federal High Court is organized and in working order it shall be a truly Australian Court ; and it would be anomalous for any one having a seat on the Bench to hold another office, the duties of which it would be impossible for him to perform. There are instances in connexion with Admiralty jurisdiction which do not involve appointment to any judicial office, but simply involve the conferring of jurisdiction. That is done by means of Imperial Acts, which formerly conferred Admiralty jurisdiction on an Admiralty Judge ; but, so far as my recollection goes at this moment, that jurisdiction is now exercisable by the Judge of any Supreme Court. That is so, at any rate, in South Australia under the recent Admiralty Act. As to ".matters of prize," that is an old-fashioned phrase which found a place in the United States Judiciary Act of 17'89, but which has no application, so far as I am aware, to modern conditions. </para>

                    <para>- I was about to move this amendment on very much the same grounds as the honorable and learned senator has put. Such an amendment would really be consequential upon the amendments made in the Bill in the other House. The reason why these words are in the clause is that when the Bill was originally introduced in the House of Representatives it conferred Admiralty jurisdiction. It ls quite true that in all the States except New South Wales and Victoria, the Admiralty jurisdiction is exercised by the Supreme Court under an Admiralty Act, called the Imperial Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890. But when that Act was passed it was provided that it should apply to all colonies or possessions in regard to which a proclamation was made. No proclamation was made in regard to Victoria and New South Wales. Therefore, in both those States Admiralty jurisdiction is' exercised by what are called Vice-Admiralty Courts, presided over by Judges appointed by the Imperial Government. These Courts have no jurisdiction in matters of prize, and it was largely on account of New South Wales and Victoria that these words were inserted. But the High Court will have no jurisdiction unless it is given by proclamation, and as that jurisdiction is not given by this Bill the words are inapplicable. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council has assumed a great responsibility in allowing this amendment to be made without due consideration.

                        <para>- The amendment will not affect the substantial meaning of the clause in any way. The clause itself prevents the appointment of the Chief Justice of the High Court to the position of Lieutenant Governor-General. I accept in all friendliness the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> not to consent to the amendment without due consideration. But the Bill as introduced provided that it was impossible for the Chief Justice to act as Lieutenant Governor - General, and this amendment does not affect that question. I hold a strong opinion that the two positions are inconsistent. We, however, are not considering the best way of appointing a Lieutenant Governor-General, but the best way of keeping a High Court Judge or the Chief Justice from being touched with the suspicion of political inclinations. In the States, Chief Justices who have been Lieutenant-Governors have often had to occupy public positions in times of crisis when men's passions have been strongly roused, under circumstances that placed them in situations in which they should not have been. </para>

Although no one in the world could say a. word against the integrity and high honorable conduct of the gentleman who has held the office of Chief Justice of that State for so many years, yet he must often have been put into the position of Lieutenant Governor which was inconsistent with that absolute detachment from all public affairs which a Chief Justice ought to occupy. </para>

                    <para>- At the end of this clause there is a form of oath, and also a form of affirmation. I do not think that it is customary to have at the end of a form of affirmation the words " so help me God." I suggest that the affirmation clause should be inserted <inline font-style="italic">intoto.</inline> A great many people have strong views on this point.

                    (Queensland).Subclause (3) provides that the Governor-General may establish district registries on the recommendation of the Justices of the High Court, or a majority of them, of whom the Chief Justice is one. We might very well omit the words " of whom the Chief Justice is one." As the clause stands at present, the consent of the Chief Justice is absolutely necessary before an additional registry can be established. There is really no difference between the three Judges, except that one of them by courtesy is called Chief Justice. I do not see why, if two are in favour of an additional registry being established, even though one of the two is not the Chief Justice, their opinion should not have weight. Therefore, I move -

                        <para>- There is a very good reason for retaining the words. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is in error in saying that the Puisne Judges have the same functions, and stand in the same position, as the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice is the head of the Administrative Department of the High Court, which is particularly concerned in the appointment of registries. He is the person who officially stands for the High Court. The writs are attested in his name; he has the control of all the officials who carry out the work of the High Court in the different offices, and it certainly would be an extraordinary thing if in a Court of three Judges a majority were to carry a recommendation against the Chief Justice, who really is responsible for the control and management of the registries. There is not likely to be such a difference that it will be necessary to use the power which is given in these words, but certainly it ought to be there to be used, and the Chief Justice, who is responsible for the proper administration of the Judicial Departments, certainly ought not to have a recommendation made with regard to the establishment of a new Department without his consent. I think that honorable senators will see that if we are to have the administration carried on in an efficient way it is necessary that the man who is at its head should not have recommendations made which will add new offices or local areas of jurisdiction to the High Court without his consent. </para>

                        <para>- The original jurisdiction of the High Court has been greatly cut away. We should use the word " may" rather than the word " shall," so that it should not be obligatory to take this course. So far as appeals are concerned, a district registry will not be necessary. It is only required in the case of original jurisdiction. It would be very much better to give power to the Judges to establish a district registry if necessary. If the provision is imperative, we may be burdened with -the trouble of organizing a district registry, or entering into a compact with the State to have the work done in a particular way. </para>

                    <para>- I take a different view on this point. I think it is very desirable that no State should feel that it is neglected in regard to the High Court. Even if there were a very small quantity of business to be transacted, the expense of a district registry would not be very great. In the absence of a district registry, a State would feel that it was being neglected by the High Court. For that reason I think that we should adhere to the sub-clause. </para>

Because Federal jurisdiction is also conferred in later clauses, for instance, in clause 40. Wherever Federal jurisdiction is exercised it is well that the Judge should have power to state a case or reserve a question. </para>

                        <para>- This clause is authorized by section 76 of the Constitution. As honorable senators are aware, original jurisdiction is conferred on the High Court expressly under section 75 of the Constitution in regard to certain matters, and under section 76 power is given to confer original jurisdiction. The Government, in introducing the Bill in the first instance, thought it right to give all the original jurisdiction which could be given under section 76. That is now limited in the Bill to matters referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause. It appears to me that the same object will really be better carried out if the very words of sub-section (1) of section 76 of the Constitution are used, "arising under this Constitution or involving its interpretation." By the use of these words we shall include all the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause, and we shall insure that in all cases where an interpretation of the Constitution is involved, or where a party goes to the High Court to claim any right which is given by the Constitution, even although the interpretation of the Constitution is not involved, the High Court should have original jurisdiction, as it certainly would appear it ought to have.

A writ of mandamus is issued to command the performance of a public duty, and it may be the discharge of a public duty by an officer of a State, or some person in a State, or by some officer charged with the administration ' of public companies. It seems to me it would be largely restricting the usefulness of the Court if it had not the power to issue writs of mandamus generally. To give an illustration. A citizen of a State may bring an action against a citizen of another State ; that can only be cognisable in the High Court. The proceedings there might necessitate the issue of a writ of mandamus to an officer of the second State, and that is not provided for under the clause as it stands. I think the power of mandamus generally ought to be conferred, and it can only be exercised where there is Federal jurisdiction. I move - </para>

These are the only two circumstances under which we wish to deal with the Supreme Court of a State. In sub-clause (c) of clause 36 we deal with the judgment of a Supreme Court of a State exercised by a single Judge sitting in Chambers, and then in clause 40 we deal with general appeals from any Supreme Court exercising Federal jurisdiction, while in clause 35 we deal with appeals from a Justice of the High Court exercising original jurisdiction of the High Court.

I understand that the intention of clause 35 is that there shall be a general appellate power from a Justice or Justices of the High Court itself, and I would suggest, in order to make 'it clearer, that after the word " Justices " the words "of the High Court" be inserted, and the remainder of the clause omitted as unnecessary.

We want to make it clear that it is with the original jurisdiction of the High Court we are dealing, and it ought to be unmistakable that it applies whether the jurisdiction be exercised in Court or in Chambers. There is a very strong body of decisions which turn on the difference between a Judge in Chambers exercising their jurisdiction of a Judge of the Supreme Court, in which case there is not appeal except under certain circumstances, and a Judge exercising jurisdiction only as a delegate, or branch of the Supreme Court, in which case there may be an appeal. I desire to leave in the words which provide that appeals may be heard' from cases whether heard in Court or in Chambers. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that. But clause 40 says that one can go to the High Court by way of appeal from a State Court exercising Federal jurisdiction. Clause 35 says that the High Court shall only have power to hear certain appeals, and amongst them is not the appeal given by clause 40- I fancy that the draftsman had that difficulty in his mind, when he used the words " or Judge of the Supreme Court of a State exercising," &amp;c. Here we have jurisdiction conferred in two ways. First of all, jurisdiction is given to the High Court to hear certain appeals. That is contained in clause 35. If clause 35 is read as a mandate, we find that it only gives power to hear appeals in respect of matters decided by the Justices of the Supreme Court of a State. It gives no power to hear appeals in reference to matters that have been decided by States Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. But we find in clause 40 that States Judges exercising Federal jurisdiction have their decisions appealable to the High Court. Therefore, would not that lead to great difficulties of construction ? The Judge who would be trying to construe these two clauses, would say to counsel - " Do you contend that an appeal lies to the High Court under clause 40?" ' Counsel would say- " Yes." Then the Judge would say - "Look at clause 35, which is the clause dealing with appeals, and which says that the High Court has no right to hear them." Therefore, the draftsman found it necessary, in order to give a complementary effect to clause 40, to insert the words in clause 35, which it is proposed to strike out. I think the whole matter will require to be looked </para>

                    .SYMON (South Australia). - It would, I think, be very much simpler if clauses 35 and 40 were considered together. They could then be very much simplified. I am inclined to think that by leaving clause 35 as it stands, we could state the whole Federal jurisdiction given under it in two or three words. But still some of the provisions of clause 40 may be wanted. With a view of simplifying the matter some such procedure as that might be considered. Certainly it would be better than putting in a provision like clause 35, giving an appellate jurisdiction in respect of orders made by a single Judge of the High Court, whether in court or in chambers ; then another provision, clause 36, dealing with appeals under an ordinary concurrent jurisdiction; another in clause 40 having a rather more complicated system of appeals from Courts of a State exercising Federal jurisdiction.

                        <para>- The matter which has been referred to has been very carefully considered. Of course, it would strike any draftsman that the clearer and better way to proceed would be, if possible, to put the appellate power in one clause. But, in dealing with the matter practically, it has been found impossible to do that in any clear way. The appellate jurisdiction , in regard to the High Court is perfectly simple. We have power to introduce the Federal jurisdiction without any conditions whatever. But that is not done, for very good reasons, as I shall point out when necessary. We invest with Federal jurisdiction the Supreme Courts of the States subject to certain conditions, one of which is that there shall be an appeal from their decisions to the High Court. That is under clause 40. Therefore, we must, in clause 40, state the conditions under which this Federal jurisdiction is given. </para>

As to a portion of it, we may say in clause 39 that it shall be exclusively in the High Court. As to the rest of it, we say that it shall be exclusive except that a portion of it is given to the States Courts' subject to the conditions enumerated. The conditions are that - </para>

                        <para>- Wo give it in this way : We invest a Court with Federal jurisdiction subject to these conditions. One condition is that whenever an appeal lies from the decision of any Judge or Court of a State to the Supreme Court of a State, an appeal from the decision may be brought to the High Court. However, the matter requires careful study. It has been already carefully considered by the Government, and there are very good reasons for the clauses being drafted as they are. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I may be altogether wrong, but I suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that this is the difficulty that presents itself to me. We arc dealing with Part V.. of the Bill. It deals with appeals. It says specifically that the High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear certain appeals. Except in so far as provided by the Bill, it cuts down the jurisdiction given in clause 35. That is a conferring of appellate jurisdiction. What is the appellate jurisdiction conferred ? It is the power to hear and determine appeals from all judgments - whatever of any Justice or Justices. That is the only appellate jurisdiction conferred. But when we come to clause 40, we see that there is no appeal whatever given by it. All that, clause 40 says is that the jurisdiction of the High Court, except in certain matters, shall he exclusive. The several courts of a State are to have jurisdiction, except as to the following conditions. What are those conditions f Paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline>
                    gives no right of appeal from a State Court exercising Federal jurisdiction. Paragraph (6) gives no right of appeal to the High Court. Suppose that a State Court gives a decision while exercising Federal jurisdiction, and there is an appeal to the Supreme Court. Counsel is asked - " What right have you to come hero

                    He says - " Look at paragraph (6) of clause 40." But that paragraph gives no right of the kind. Suppose that the appeal is taken to the High Court. The Judge says - ' What right have you to come here to appeal from the decision of a State Court exercising Federal jurisdiction ? " Counsel says - " I come here under paragraph (6)." The Judge says - "Paragraph (6) gives you an appeal in respect to all matters where you could appeal from tho Supremo Court of a State ; but this is not such a matter." Counsel then says - "You have jurisdiction under clause 35." But ob looking at that it will be found that there is no jurisdiction.
