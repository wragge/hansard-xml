                    <para>That the Senate do now resolve itself into a committee of the whole for the purpose of considering and adopting the standing orders re- ported to the Senate by the Standing Orders Committee on the 9th of October, 1901, with amendments recommended by the Standing Orders Committee in special report presented to the Senate 4th June, 1003. </para>

                <para>It will be remembered that previous to the first meeting of the Senate, a code of standing orders was framed for temporary adoption, and that it .was afterwards slightly amended, and laid upon the table in the amended form on the 23rd May, 1901. A motion was made for" its temporary adoption on the 5th June - that is soon after the appointment of the Standing </para>
                <para class="block">Orders Committee. The matter was discussed then, but the Senate was not prepared to discuss the standing orders at length, and was not disposed to adopt them without discussion. It, therefore, referred the whole matter to a small committee, who were asked to consider the standing orders used in the States Parliaments, and to bring up on the following day a report recommending the adoption of one set of standing orders. It was pointed out that it would be almost impossible for any committee to perform the task in that short time. But, however, on the next day, the Committee brought up a report recommending the temporary adoption of the standing orders of the House of Assembly of South Australia, and, with a few exceptions, they were adopted. The Standing Orders Committee afterwards held a number of meetings extending from Juno to nearly the end of December, and, in October, the draft standing orders, as amended and recommended by that body, were laid upon the table of the Senate. It was proposed that they should be adopted by the Senate as a temporary expedient. But that course did not find favour with the Senate, and, consequently, we have been acting since June last under the standing orders of the House of Assembly of South Australia. In one respect, perhaps, that course may not have been a disadvantage, because we have become during that time thoroughly well acquainted with the standing orders under which we have been working, and can regard them now as a point of departure in adopting new standing orders. It will be noticed in considering the standing orders now before the Senate, that the side-note says that the)7 are, to a large extent, taken from the standing orders of the House of Assembly of South Australia. But it does not follow that these particular standing orders have been adopted by the Committee without reference to the standing orders of other States. In a great many States "the standing orders of the various Legislatures are almost identical. But where a standing order is practically the same as that which we have been working under since June, 1901, reference is made in the draft to the standing, order of the House of Assembly of South Australia, and not to the standing order of any other State, though it may be actually identical. I hope that we shall be able, as the result of our efforts now, to evolve a code of standing orders that will allow the fullest possible freedom of debate to all members of the Senate, and at the same time not leave any opening for unnecessary discussion, or for what may perhaps be called a waste of time. Up till now I think it will be agreed by all that our debates have been well conducted. We have dealt fully with every subject that has been brought forward, and at the same time we have been able to keep our debates within reasonable limits. I think that that will happen also under the new standing orders. I propose to glance, briefly only, at the new standing orders, and to point out what appear to be amendments of the standing orders under which we have been working for so long. I cannot tell the Senate the reasons which have actuated the Standing Orders Committee in their recommendations, as I was not a member of that body. But I have no doubt that the members of. the Committee and you yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> - whom I notice as having been asked to take charge of the report in committee-- </para>

                        <para>- In the report of the proceedings of the Committee on page 16. The reference there I take to mean that you, sir, as the Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee, will, in the course of the debate, explain to us, where necessary, the reasons that actuated the Committee in the alterations they made.' I am glad, also, to see from their report that the Committee communicated with the Standing Orders Committee appointed by the House of Representatives with a view to secure uniformity, as far as possible, in the standing orders of the two Houses, and that that result has been arrived at in most cases. It would put us in a somewhat stronger position if the Committee were able to inform us that they and the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives had been able to come to an agreement in all cases. I have had occasion, in my cursory glance at this report, to refer to particular orders in which the other House is particularly interested ; and I think it would have been a great advantage if the Standing Orders Committees of the two Houses could have come to an agreement upon those matters. The greater number of our standing orders have to do with the internal work of this Chamber only, and in regard to them we should, perhaps, be justified in resenting any assistance that might be offered from outside. But in regard to standing orders which, by their nature, necessarily bring us into contact with the other Chamber, it would have been an advantage if we could have had agreement. Without it we may by our standing orders practically compel ourselves to take a certain line of action which may bring us into conflict with the other Chamber. In those matters it seems to me that it would be a wiser, and, perhaps, almost a more courteous thing to delay coming to a decision until such time as the subject could be discussed thoroughly with the corresponding body appointed by the House of Representatives. I shall refer now only to the alterations which have come particularly under' my notice, and make such observation as may . appear to me to be pertinent to the subject as I go along. The first chapter, honorable senators will notice, deals with the proceedings at the opening of Parliament. That is merely an embodiment of the practice that has been adopted in the past, and which, probably, we shall follow, as we naturally follow a precedent wherever we can even if we have no standing orders on the subject. When we come to discuss that, I may have to refer to one or two matters which at the present time are not quite clear to me, but there appears to be nothing calling for serious objection. When we come to chapter 2, I shall ask honorable senators to direct their attention io Standing Order 25, in which, I think, there is an innovation. I am not prepared to say - and in this matter and others I am not in the counsels of the Committee - that it is not perfectly right; but it appears to me, from my knowledge of the proceedings in the particular State from which I come, that this provision is an innovation. I refer to the provision that the President, in presenting the address in reply to the Governor-General shall claim in the name of the Senate "the right of free and direct access and communication with His Excellency." It may be merely a trifling matter of form, but under the practice to which I have been accustomed the Speaker and, I think, the President, ask that the most favorable construction shall be put upon the actions of the Chambers they represent. The proposed form is somewhat new to me, but I have no doubt that the members of the Committee will be able to tell us why . it has been adopted. Standing Order 26 will raise the question whether our sittings constitute a continuous Parliament, or whether at each election of the House of Representatives, and of half the Senate, a new Parliament commences. In' the State with which I have had the most acquaintance, the proceedings of the Legislature are divided into separate Parliaments. After every general election there is held to be a new Parliament. If that be so in our case, this session is the second session of the first Parliament, and the next session will be the first session of the second Parliament. The question will arise whether we can take power in our standing orders to bind by an act of ours a future Parliament. That is a matter upon which I invite discussion. There is nothing to which I have to call attention in chapter 4. In chapter 5, Standing Order 36, the Standing Orders Committee deal with the Printing Committee. At the end of that standing order power should be given to confer with the similar committee of the House of Representatives. In the matter of printing more than anything else, it is desirable that the Committees of the two Chambers should confer and act together. I will give one instance of the desirability of so doing. In the laying of papers <inline font-style="italic">upon</inline> the tables of the two Houses, and . in getting them printed, we are in this difficulty. . Though we have made an arrangement that papers, wherever possible, shall be laid simultaneously upon the tables of both Houses, we may have each House giving a separate order that papers shall be printed ; in which case technically duplicate prints of a paper will have to be issued. For instance, to-day I have laid some paj)ers on the table of the Senate. Those papers have already been laid upon the table in the" House of Representatives. Seeing that the House of Representatives got them before we did, they probably have ordered that those papers shall be printed. I did not ask for any such order to-day in the belief that a similar order had been made in the other House, but in case it should not have been made, we might be wanting a paper and find that it had not been printed and circulated because no order to print had been obtained from either House. It is desirable that in these matters the two Printing Committees should confer, and that there should be a close understanding between them in order to insure that, whenever a paper was required to be printed, it should be printed by order of one House and circulated amongst the members of both. That would prevent the possibility ' of papers which were not required being printed at all, or the other possibility of papers which were required not being printed, although they were laid before both Houses simultaneously. </para>

                        <para>- There is power to confer. under that standing order, and also under Standing Order 34, but not under Standing Order 36. I presume that that is only an inadvertent omission. An alteration will have to be made in Standing Order 38 in consequence of the passage of the Electoral Act, which provides for a different method of dealing with disputed returns. Honorable senators will see that an Elections and Qualifications Committee will still be necessary in order to deal with matters respecting the qualifications of senators, or vacancies in the Senate, or the case of any senator who has been appointed but not elected. So that the proposed standing order will require to be somewhat amended. </para>

                        <para>- But in framing standing orders we endeavour to avoid the necessity of suspending them. We require that our proceedings shall always be governed by the standing orders, and, to that end, in such a task as that in which we are now engaged, we try to avoid leaving any ground for suspension. Chapter 9 deals with the sitting and adjournment of the Senate, and Standing Order 59 deals with motions for adjournment, in which I am inclined to think is a very fair and proper way, so as to provide for occasions when a senator desires to debate any specially urgent matter. In suc*h case the senator has to state that the subject which he desires to debate is a definite matter of urgent public importance ; and four senators have to rise in their places to support . him. The senator then has the floor of the House, and by the next standing order the duration of the speeches is limited. These standing orders - deal with a matter which may be considered, because it brings into operation certain regulations with regard to the right of moving the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing grievances. In chapter 10, which deals with the routine of business, a little alteration will have to be made in regard to Ministers fixing the order of Government business. As the standing order under this head reads, it applies only to days when the Government business takes precedence, but, of course, exactly the same reason exists on ordinary as on special days for the Government putting their own business on the notice-paper in the order they desire. For instance, on Fridays, when private business finishes at one o'clock and Government business comes on after the luncheon hour, it is just as important that the Government should be able to fix the order of their own business as it is on any other day. Chapter 16 deals with the "previous question," which, I think, could have been moved in this Chamber before under the rules of the House of Commons, though it was not specially provided for in our standing orders. It is now provided for in accordance with the practice that obtains in most Parliaments. Chapter 18, which deals with divisions, provides that the President or Chairman may vote wherever they may be sitting ; and this clears up a little difficulty which arose last session. </para>

                        <para>- On my reading of the standing order it will prevent any difficulty arising in the future. There is an important alteration in chapter 19 with regard to public Bills. In this chapter it is provided that a public Bill may be brought in if necessary on an order of the Senate. I presume that to mean that -where a resolution has been carried in. favour of the introduction of a Bill, with a second resolution, practically instructing the Government to bring in the Bill, that shall be considered sufficient without further formality. It means, I take it, that such a Bill can " be brought in by the Government at any time, the resolution being regarded as the order of the Senate. Standing Orders 1S1 and 1S2, which deal with first readings, contain an innovation which seems to have become necessary in consequence of the constitution of these two Houses. We have been accustomed to have the Estimates laid on the table, and an opportunity has generally been taken for discussing those Estimates on the second reading of a Supply Bill, though strictly speaking, according to the standing orders, a second reading discussion should be relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. The two standing orders to which I have referred provide that on the first reading of a Money Bill there may be a debate, which need .not be relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. I presume that that is intended to be exactly the counterpart of the debate which takes place in the other Chamber on going into Committee of Supply, when there is a general discussion of grievances, according to an old practice handed down from time immemorial. Standing Orders 235 and 23G deal with lapsed Bills, and there again, I think, will arise the question as to whether the sessions of Senate are to be regarded as those of one continuous Parliament or of separate Parliaments - that is, when there has been no dissolution. I take it that though these standing orders will enable a Bill not passed in one session to be revived in another, they will not admit of a' measure which has failed in one Parliament being revived in another Parliament without going through the necessary preliminaries. However, that is a matter which no doubt will receive attention when it arises in committee. Standing Orders 242 to 249 are amended by the special report, and to these I desire to direct particular attention. These standing orders deal with the action of the Senate in connexion with Bills which we may not amend. The whole question was debated last session, and it will be remembered that the Senate then pressed a request a second time ; and another place, in order that the Bill might be passed, and to avoid the possibility of a dead-lock, agreed to deal with those requests, though under some sort of protest. What is proposed now is to fix our practice, to say that we may make such requests three times, and that if they are not assented to we may then demand a free conference. I think I am right in saying that the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives have not agreed to that course, and are probably not likely to agree to it ; and I ask the Senate to consider very carefully, in dealing with this matter, whether we are justified in taking the step now proposed, and, if justified, whether it is policy to do so. If we have regard to the past we may be pretty well sure that if we follow the practice proposed we shall bring ourselves into conflict with the other House. Honorable senators may say that we must do what seems to be right and take the chance of conflict. But is it necessary for. us, when there may be a possibility of coming to an arrangement with the other Chamber, to lay down our practice beforehand <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> To fix our standing orders in this way is to practically lay down a binding rule compelling ourselves to take a certain course of action which we know will bring us into conflict with another place. Why cannot we leave the matter as it was last session <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Why not wait until the time comes, and then deal with it according to our best lights ? </para>

What is proposed now, before there is any question actually at issue between the Chambers, is that we shall decide the matter for ourselves without any reference to the other House. Is that likely to promote peace between the Chambers? It will place the other Chamber in the position that, unless they submit or agree to whatever rule we lay down, they must adopt some other practice which will bring them into conflict with us. Is the other Chamber more likely to meet us fairly if we take advantage of this opportunity to lay down a hard - and - fast rule for ourselves ? </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; it was a concession " without prejudice," in order that the Bill might be passed. It seems to me desirable that, if possible, this matter should be arranged on a consultation or conference of the Standing Orders Committees of the two Houses. It does not tend to peace, but exactly the reverse, to take this occasion to assert that in future, when any question arises, the Senate will take a certain step. It is shutting the door to any peaceful negotiations between the two Houses, when we put our foot down and declare - "We are going to do this, and the other House will have to follow us and make their standing orders fit with ours." I am sure the Committee will consider this matter very carefully. Chapter 22 deals with select committees; and Standing Order 303 provides that no protest shall be recorded. That, I presume, will do away altogether with the practice of adding riders. I do not know what is the objection to riders, because very often a select committee brings in a majority report and a minority report. </para>

All the sections of chapter 23 as originally drafted come out, and other sections 316 to 319 are substituted. These are alterations which have been made necessary in consequence of the passing of the Electoral Act. In chapter 26, dealing with conferences, I notice that Standing Order No. 340 provides that - </para>

When there is a dispute between the two Houses we shall all desire to come into accord somehow or other, and if, one conference having failed, a second might succeed, I do not know what objection can be urged against it. Chapter 34 deals with the conduct of senators and rules of debate. The standing order I desire particularly to refer to in this chapter is No. 393, and I am afraid that I have myself been offending against that standing order several times this afternoon. It is the one which provides that a senator shall not turn his back upon the Chair. I am afraid that I offend more often against that standing order than against any other. The President understands, I am sure that I do so out of no disrespect to the Chair. The offence against the standing order arises really from the formation of the chamber, and the place in it which I occupy when introducing or speaking upon a measure. </para>

                        <para>- I do not rely upon that, but it is certainly exceedingly difficult, especially if interjections come from my right, to reply to them without to a great extent turning my back upon the Chair. I desire merely to draw attention to the standing order. The important amendments in this chapter appear to me to be those dealing with motions, and providing that there shall be no debates upon certain questions. They embody, I think, to a great extent the practice which we have already adopted in debate. For instance, no debate is allowed upon the motion "That the Senate do now divide." That is a standing order which we have adopted before, and most of these standing orders in this chapter appear either to accord with the practice we have been following up to the present time, or are taken from the practice of the House of Commons. This chapter also deals with infringements of order and privilege, and provides punishments which appear to me to be rather stringent, but I suppose that in certain circumstances they would be justifiable. In matters of this sort we have to rely greatly upon the officer presiding over the Senate, or over committees of the whole, and, of course, on the good sense of the Senate itself. I do not pretend that the remarks I have made are anything like exhaustive, but I think 1 have touched slightly upon the principal cases in which alterations have been made from the practice which we have been following up to the present time. I hope that when we have thoroughly discussed these matters, we shall turn out a code of standing orders under which we shall be able to transact the business in this Chamber satisfactorily, and keep the debates up to the high level which has so far been established. </para>

                    <para>- I do not intend to follow the lead of the Post1 master-General, and indulge in a detailed criticism of the standing orders we are now considering, because it seems to me that such a criticism and consideration ought properly to take place in committee. It has been the custom in the Senate to debate Bills on their second reading, because all Bills are supposed to contain some principles. The details of these standing orders we shall, I suppose, discuss in committee. But when I read the orders of the day, and note that this matter is set down as . Government business, and then when I am referred by the Postmaster-General to the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee that the President be requested to take charge of the proposed standing orders in committee of the Senate, I can, I think, see some reason why the Postmaster-General has gone into a lengthy and detailed criticism. It is a novel thing to me to find a Government in the first place setting down in the orders of the day certain business as being Government business, and then immediately abdicating their position and allowing the President or any one else in the Senate to take charge of the proceedings when we get into committee. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear it. That is just the assurance I desired to get from the honorable and learned senator. I am glad that the Government, having placed this matter amongst the orders of the day as Government business, intend to take charge of it in committee as well as before the Senate. Perhaps the chief reason for my rising to speak upon this motion is to remind honorable senators that no member of the Senate is more closely interested in the standing orders than our Chairman of Committees. He will be called upon to administer them, and, owing to the fact that he occupied the Chair as Chairman of Committees during the whole of last session, the honorable and learned senator will probably be conversant not only with the standing orders under which we were then working, but also with the standing orders now submitted to us, because he has been a member of the Standing Orders Committee. But when we get into committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Best,</inline> as our  Chairman  of Committees, will be debarred from discussing the standing orders now submitted to us. I think it is a very great pity that the honorable and learned senator should be under that disability. I therefore venture to make the suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> should obtain leave from the Committee to speak when he thinks fit on any standing order. I think honorable senators will all agree that it is desirable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> should have that opportunity. I fail to see under what other circumstances, except by entering now upon a detailed criticism, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will be able to give honorable senators the benefit of the knowledge which he peculiarly must possess as to the desirability or otherwise of our adopting these standing orders. I hope the suggestion I have made will be adopted. I have said that I do not intend to examine the standing orders in detail now, because, as I have indicated, I think this is not the proper time to do so. I Can, however, assure the Postmaster-General that in committee I shall be prepared to give them as lengthy consideration as he has given them in the Senate, and to criticise them in detail quite as minutely as the honorable and learned senator has done. Having made that statement, it would not be fitting for me to proceed now with any criticism of the standing orders - and for that reason, and not because I have not many comments to make upon them, I refrain at present from further remarks. </para>

                    The Committee certainly do not adopt the standing orders, which are only put before them for consideration. The adoption is by the Senate afterwards, The words in this motion are surplusage, and it will be a great deal better to omit them.

                    <para>- Whether the word "adopting" or "agreeing" is used, it is much the same thing. The committee can only adopt standing orders so far as it is concerned. The Senate may throw the standing orders so adopted into the waste-paper basket if it likes. It seems to me nothing unusual to use the words " and reporting." All the clauses of a Bill have to be agreed to by a committee before it can report to the Senate, and therefore" it really adopts them. </para>

                    <para>- - The Committee will agree to the standing orders - which is equivalent to adopting them - and the Senate will adopt the report of the Committee. If a difference is made between " adopting " and " agreeing to " at the committee stage, then it will be necessary in the Senate to move first to adopt the report of the Committee, and then to adopt the standing orders, whereas, if the motion is left as it is, the Senate- will adopt the report of the Committee, and the whole business will be finished. I think it will be seen upon reflection that the motion is quite correct in form. </para>

                    <para>- I think it is quite obvious that it is not competent for the adoption of standing orders to finally rest with the Committee. No matter what word is made use of the intention of the motion is that the Committee shall consider the standing orders and come to a decision. The word "adopt" really means that the Committee shall come to a decision on the draft standing orders. Will any honorable senator suggest for a moment that if the standing orders were allowed to remain at that stage they would be the rules of the Senate? When the Committee makes its report it will be for the Senate* to adopt the standing orders, and it is only then that they will have any validity. I have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> for mentioning a matter which is more or less of a personal character. Necessarily, I take the keenest interest in the proposed standing orders. It is quite true that I was a member of the Standing Orders Committee for a portion of the time, and that we were not unanimous in the adoption of many of the standing orders. The general understanding was that we should reserve any discussion of details until the standing orders came to be considered in committee or in the Senate, as the case might be. There are certain standing orders to which I take exception, and on which I should be glad to be allowed the privilege of saying a few words, while there are certain others which I should be glad to see included. I realize at once that the consideration of these rules does not involve a party question, otherwise it would be most improper for the Chairman to take any part in the deliberations of the Committee. If, by reason of any little experience I can make any remarks which may be of value to the Committee - and the Senate accepts the view which has been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> - I shall occasionally, if there is no objection, exercise the privilege of speaking on the standing order that is before the Chamber. </para>

                    thinks that perhaps by a verv strained construction the use, of the words " and adopting " may mean that the standing orders will become law when agreed to in committee. Every committee is delegated certain authority by the Senate to consider the details of a measure or . proposal and to bring up a report: In this case each standing order must be agreed to. When the Committee shall have agreed to all the standing orders, then it will have adopted them as far as it could adopt anything. Its resolutions will be reported, and if they are agreed to the standing orders will be adopted by the Senate. I cannot see that any objection can be taken to the form of motion.

                    I may point out that this chapter of the standing orders mixes up two things - the proceedings of a new Parliament and those of a current Parliament. From my point of view, those two things ought to be divided. I know what is at the bottom of all this. What is in view is that ours is a continuous Parliament, and never ends. I hold that that view is not entirely correct, and, in any case, it is inconvenient. I wish to make Chapter I. deal with two separate things - (1) the proceedings of a new Parliament, and (2) the proceedings of any session of a current Parliament.

                        <para>- That takes place under the Constitution itself. The standing orders provide for it because in the case of a penal dissolution there would be an election for the House of Representatives. It is provided for, consequently, in Standing Order 1. This question was thrashed out by the Standing Orders Committee with great thoroughness. I also call attention to the additional fact that the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives thrashed it out, and adopted this standing order altered to meet their different position. So that we have the standing orders of both Houses adopting this course of procedure. It will be a great mistake if we use a word which we find in the Constitution in a different sense from that in which it is there used, and if we use it in a sense which will, imply that the Senate is not so much a constituent part of the Parliament as is the House of Representatives. I hope that the standing order will stand as drafted. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that the question in dispute hinges on the use of the word " new " - whether there is a new Parliament after the House of Representatives and half the Senate have gone before the country, and a general election has taken place. In South Australia we were in exactly the same position as are the Senate and the House of Representatives. For years our Legislative Council was practically a continuous body, so many of its members retiring at a certain- time and so many remaining, just as is the case here. But, for convenience, whenever there was a general election for the lower House we spoke of a new Parliament having been elected. We have numbered our Parliaments. If honorable senators turn to the records of South Australia they will see that reference is made to the first Parliament, the second Parliament, the third Parliament, and so on. I' believe that the Governor in his opening speech alludes to the number of the Parliaments. The newspapers do, at any rate, in their accounts of the opening. Common usage has "prescribed that a new Parliament comes into existence after a general election. In South Australia, in our standing orders, we have separate clauses describing first the opening -of a new Parliament, in which there is probably a little more form and ceremony than on an ordinary occasion ; and, secondly, the opening of an ordinary session. I do not know that there is much in the point. It will not make a bit of difference. Of. course Parliament is a continuous body. There is no doubt of that. That is to say, it is supposed to be continuous, but it is not so in actual fact, because there ave intervals in which there is only a part of Parliament in existence. The lower House is occasionally dissolved, and an election takes place, and in the meantime there is really no Parliament in existence. In . our case, as the whole of the House of Representatives and half the Senate will go to the country, I think we may fairly speak of a new Parliament coming into existence after the elections. I do not know that there is any special reason why we should adopt a new style of procedure. In all the States the Parliaments are called new. Parliaments after general elections. It would have been better if the Standing Orders Committee had adopted the usual practice, instead of a new one, from which no- particular good can result, although I cannot see at present that it will do any particular harm. </para>

                    BAKER (South Australia). - I have thought that we sometimes too slavishly follow a body that is to some extent analogous to ours, but which is certainly not so altogether. We are not on the same footing as the British Houses of Parliament. We are a new body. We are a Federal Senate.- We have a certain analogy with the British Parliament, but only to a small extent ; and it is about time that we struck out and thought for ourselves, and adopted a phraseology suited to our own circumstances and conditions. I will admit that in most of the standing orders of the States the words " new Parliament " are used, because they have adopted the phraseology of the British Houses .of Parliament. But, as I have pointed out, that Parliament is differently constituted from our own. The House of Lords is different from this Senate. It must be remembered that the Scotch elective peers are elected for the Parliament - for the same period of time as the House of Commons. The Irish peers are, it is true, elected for life. But although the words " new Parliament " have been handed down in Great Britain for a long time, the time has arrived in our history when we may adopt a phraseology more suited to our circumstances, especially when the old phraseology implies a certain amount of subserviency on the part of the Senate to the House of Representatives.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline>
                    is not the only man in this committee who recognises to the full and desires to see carried out the powers and privileges of the Senate. For that reason I, to some extent, resent the remarks which he has just made. I have risen, not because I do not understand or feel the importance of maintaining our privileges and rights, but to point out that this is simply an instance of confusion of thought, and, if I may use the word, of blundering. No distinction is drawn in this standing order between an ordinary session and a new Parliament. I shall adopt the term " new Parliament," with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker's</inline>
                    permission, to indicate that sort of Parliament which meets practically at the expiration of every three years from the time when we first met. That explains pretty well what I mean by a " new Parliament." According to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker's</inline>
                    position, that is not a new Parliament at all. But I would point out that between a Parliament which meets directly after a general election and a Parliament sitting in a session like the present one there is a considerable difference. This standing order mixes up the two hopelessly, and draws no distinction between an ordinary session like this and the meeting of a new Parliament. It is for that reason, and not because I am blind to the privileges of the Senate, or want to diminish its powers, that I have moved the amendment before the committee. I move it in the interests of lucidity and to avoid confusion of thought.

                    A periodical election, which under ordinary circumstances takes place every three years, is provided for in . the Constitution, and it appears to me that there is no necessity for the words " or after a general election for the House of Representatives." At an ordinary election about half of the members of the Senate go to the country at exactly or about the same time as the whole of the members of the House of Representatives, and therefore it may be argued that both Houses are then before the electors. Then there is a penal dissolution in which all the members of both Houses go to the country at the same time ; but some provision should be made for that contingency.

                    BAKER (South Australia). - What is provided for here is the meeting of Parliament after a periodical election for the Senate, or after a general election for the House of Representatives. If there is a penal dissolution there will be a general election for both Houses, and that also is provided for. If there is some additional election that does not alter the sense of the standing order, which seems to me to be quite clear.

                    <para>- A little further on I was going to call attention to one or two matters in this chapter which are not quite clear to me. At present I only wish to say that the chapter appears to deal with every possible case of the meeting of Parliament, either after a general election, or after a periodical election of the Senate. We are now, it seems, dealing with the question as to whether Parliament is or 'is not a continuous body ; but that question, I fancy has been evaded. It has not been settled, I take it, whether we are to divide our proceedings into different Parliaments. </para>

                    (Western Australia).. - It would be better to postpone the standing order and re-draft it. We ought to strike out the word " general," and conclude the paragraph with the words, " or after a general election for the Senate and House of Representatives." That would meet the case of a penal dissolution.

                    (South Australia). - Looking into the matter a little more closely, I see strong reasons why the Parliaments should be divided as suggested. There is an immense difference between the opening of a new Parliament and the opening of an ordinary session. In the former case there are no sworn members and no President, and Commissioners have to be brought in. Members have to be sworn and a President elected before the Governor-General comes to open Parliament. Although we should not follow slavishly everything done by either the mother of Parliaments or her daughters, we may see that there is a great deal of reason for this difference in the two forms of opening Parliament. At present we should confine ourselves to settling the form which the first part of the standing order should take. If we use the words " periodical election," and afterwards provide for a general election of the Senate and House of Representatives, the case of a penal dissolution will be met.

                    <para>- There is a certain vagueness about the standing order, and I fully realize the difficulty to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has called attention. If the standing order be altered' it should provide for an ordinary meeting of Parliament, and for a meeting after a penal dissolution. But the standing order is altogether silent as to the latter, and I suggest that it should provide for the meeting after | a periodical election for the Senate, and a general election for the House of Representatives, " or after a general election for both Houses of Parliament." That would meet the case of a penal dissolution or of an ordinary general election for the House of Representatives, with a partial election for . the Senate. We do not stand in exactly the same position as the House of Representatives, seeing that our existence as a body is practically continuous, and, therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between the two Houses. I suggest that which seems to me to meet the difficulty, and to explain the difference between the two dissolutions. </para>

                    <para>- I am afraid that if we adopt the standing order as now proposed it will lead us into a dilemma in the future. If we assume the position that there is no end of Parliament, unless we have a double dissolution, and if the President is successful when he goes before the country next time, we shall, so far as he is concerned, be saved the trouble of electing a President. We shall have a continuous President. That may be an advantage. I agree with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> has said upon the necessity  of having a clearer definition. We should have a definition of what is a new Parliament. If not, we shall find ourselves in some such fix as I have  indicated.  I hope the matter will be left over for further consideration. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline>
                    Largie, if honorable senators will look at the Constitution, they will find that the  President  can only hold office so long as he is a senator. When his term as a senator ceases  he ceases to be  President.  Then, although at present we hope that the elections for the House of Representatives and for the Senate may take place at the same time, that they may not happen always. There may be a penal dissolution of the House of Representatives without a penal dissolution of the Senate ; the time also may come when the elections for the two Houses may not occur at the same time, and all that is provided for in this standing order.

                        <para>- Yes, a double dissolution is provided for. I may tell honorable senators that when the standing order was first drawn, it contained the words " after an election following on the penal dissolution of both Houses," but those words were struck out as being surplusage. They are not necessary, because if there is an election for both Houses there must necessarily be an election for one. A general election for the House of Representatives must take place periodically, even although there is not a general election for the Senate at the same time. I think that the more honorable senators study the standing orders, the more they will see that every possible case is provided for. I shall say no more about it, because I have already stated my views once or twice. I think it is perfectly clear, and if any attempt is made to alter it without careful consideration, we shall only get into difficulties. If it is to be re-drafted, let the work be done by the Standing Orders Committee. I think it is very possible that if any attempt is made to re-draft it by this committee in a hurry, it will not be made nearly so clear as it is now. </para>

                    had to go to the country in the month of November of this year, and were elected, he would still be a senator, and even if he were defeated, he would remain a senator until the end of December. I would ask the honorable and learned senator to look at section 17 of the Constitution. The second part of the section provides that the President shall cease to hold office if he ceases to be a senator. Consequently, if the honorable and learned senator is elected when he goes to the country, and if that is before the end of his term, he will still be a senator, and consequently, under this standing order, he will still be President of the Senate.

                    (South Australia.) - This standing order incidentally touches upon the question as to the term for which the President of the Senate is elected - whether for three years or for six years. From the first part of the standing order it may be argued that if a President is elected he shall sit as President so long as he is a member of the Senate. If he is amongst the number of senators who have polled a higher number of votes it mav be argued that he is entitled to retain the office of President for six years, and if he has to go for election with the first batch because he happens to be amongst the number of senators who obtain a lower number of votes, it may be argued in the same way that he has been elected President only for three years. I do not know whether it was intended when we elected the President that he should be elected for three or six years ; but this standing order pretty well fixes his election for sixyears.

                        <para>- The amendment immediately before the committee is to strike out the word " general " with a view to insert the word "periodical." Although I must confess that I cannot see that the standing order as at present drafted covers the contingency of a periodical election, the amendment proposed will hardly cover what is intended or desired by honorable senators. It is quite clear that the contingency may arise of a dissolution of the other House and the continuance of the. Senate. Another contingency may arise in which there may be an election of half of the members of the Senate at the same time as a general election for members of the House of Representatives. It seems to me desirable that the confusion which appears to exist in the minds of honorable senators should be cleared up by some in6isive language. </para>

                        <para>- If this standing order is to be reconsidered it had better be referred back to the Standing Orders Committee, and if it is to be postponed it would be as well, I think, to postpone the whole chapter. I should like, however, before moving the postponement, to draw the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> and other honorable senators to a matter which I cannot quite understand at the present time. I understand that this chapter is designed to meet every possible case, to provide for cases where there is a President at the commencement of a session and for cases where there is no President. After the words " if there be a President," the procedure which shall take place during the opening of the session is set forth, and that procedure is the procedure which was followed at the opening of the present session, there being a President. But when we come to Standing Order 3 it states, " The Senate will then adjourn," and at that stage this session we did not adjourn. We did business after that, and probably should again desire to do business. Standing Order 3 seems to be correct in case there is no President. Honorable senators will see that reading. But the Senate does not adjourn when there is a President. This session we appointed a committee to prepare the address in reply after that, and we might possibly have gone on to consider the address in reply. That is frequently done, and it was done during this session in the other Chamber. But according to these standing orders, under circumstances exactly the same as those existing at the beginning of this session, we should have had to adjourn as soon as the senator who had been elected had taken the oath. We could. not have gone on with the address in reply. The practice here in cases where there is a President does not seem to be the same as the practice hitherto adopted. If the chapter is postponed for reconsideration I hope that matter will be taken into consideration. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - Before the chapter is postponed, there is a question arising out of the first paragraph, which, I think, should also have the serious attention of the committee. Under paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline>
                    "if there be a  President"  it is provided that he shall take the chair, and "we are told that this standing order is intended to deal with the condition of things which arises after an election following a penal dissolution, and after an ordinary periodical election. We must contemplate, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline>
                    Largie pointed out, that upon a penal dissolution every member of the Senate will cease to be a senator, and then this paragraph- (it) could not apply in the case of a senator elected after a penal dissolution, because there would be no President. The only case in which it would apply, if it applied at all, is in the case of a periodical election. I should like to know whether we assume here that the President is elected for the full term for which he is elected to be a senator. It would be as well for the Standing Orders Committee to take that point into consideration. According to my reading of the Constitution, his term of office as President is not there laid down. What is laid down is that if he ceases' to be a senator he shall cease to hold office as President. He may cease to be a senator by resigning before the term for which he has been elected has passed. By ceasing to be a senator he would cease to be a President. By adopting paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline>
                    in its present form, it seems to me that we shall be admitting that our present  President,  who is one of the six-year senators I  under existing circumstances, is to be  President  when the new Parliament meets after the coming periodical election. If that is the wish of the Senate, well and good. But it should be remembered that we are laying down the principle that a senator elected to be  President  is to remain  President  for the full term of six years. The contingency to which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline>
                    Largie referred must then be taken into consideration, and as each senator holds office until the 31st December, if he is elected at the periodical election he will not have ceased to be a senator at any time, and if the present occupant of the office is re-elected, the contention may be very well brought forward that he is the President. We ought to seriously consider whether the Constitution contemplated that the Senate had the power to bind its successor in the election of the President. It seems to me that, under these circumstances, the only occasion upon which the Senate could possibly elect a President would be after a penal dissolution.

                    of the standing order provides for a contingency of that character. Supposing that after a general election of the House of Representatives, and perhaps a partial election of the Senate, the other House should meet and then be sent to the country, the Senate is still in existence with a President at its head, and when the new Parliament is called together he will be in the chair. It seems to me that all necessary provision has been made to conduct the business of Parliament. The meaning of the standing order might be made a little plainer by the addition of the words " after a dissolution of both Houses " ; but even without those words I contend that provision has been made to meet every case which is likely to arise.

Surely the Convention never contemplated taking away from the Senate the right to elect its officers, or to say that after a Senate had elected a President no future Senate, no matter how differently constituted, should have the right to interfere with that election ; that the only way in which it might be interfered with was by death, resignation, defeat at the poll, or a vote of no confidence.

I do not feel that I should be justified in voting to elect a President for a Senate in which I might not have a seat. Since one-half of the Senate has to go to the country every three years, it is not fair that the President should hold his office for longer than that term. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know of any understanding of the kind. My idea is that in common fairness, both the President and the Chairman of Committees ought to be elected for the same term, and that is for the life of a Parliament. We can imagine a case in which we may be looking round for a President under certain conditions. We may say " If we elect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator So-and-so</inline> he will be in office for six years : but if we elect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Somebody</inline> Else he will be in the Chair for only three years," and the chance is that the latter may get the position simply because it will afford an opportunity to elect another President at the end of three years. Under the circumstances, as one-half of the members of the Senate will retire every three years, I think it would be far better to elect the President for a term of three years. Then let us treat our Chairman of Committees somewhat differently from what we do now. Up to the present he has only been elected for the session. He should be elected for the same term as the President. </para>

A new Parliament may have been in existence" only about a year, and we may have elected our President. Suppose there is then a dissolution of the other House. Then, of course, there would be a new Parliament, and we should be called together by the Governor-General. Would

                        <para>- This is not a question of parliamentary procedure. What the honorable senator wants is to graft on to our procedure the interpretation of a section of the Constitution concerning which there may be some doubt. Under one interpretation it may be held that the term stated in our standing order is not according to the Constitution, and then our standing order would be absolutely nugatory. It is not necessary at this stage to discuss the question. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to call the attention of the Post- I master-General to the fact that standing order 17 is closely intertwined in its object with chapter 1, which is to be re-drafted so that we may get a definition of the term "new Parliament." When we get that definition, we shall be able to put into this standing order what will meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> wishes. I agree that this question is not one that can be settled by a standing order. It arises under the terms of the Constitution, which will have to be interpreted by the High Court. It might be convenient therefore to postpone this standing order until we get the definition to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>- Before we leave this chapter, I point out that so far I have been unable to find any standing order which provides for filling a vacancy in the Presidency, occurring either during a session or during a recess. I am not prepared to submit any standing orders for the purpose, but I think there should be some such standing order. The standing orders of South Australia, under which we have been working, have been held up to us as a model, but in this matter it is not proposed to adopt them. Standing Order 23, of the South Australian standing orders, provides for filling a vacancy in the Speakership occurring during either a session or recess. </para>

                    <para>- The old words were departed from because they are a survival of the procedure which has come down to us from the time of the Tudors and Stuarts, when the Speaker of the House of Commons claimed from the Crown certain rights and privileges. These included the right of being exempt , from the common law of. libel - the right of freedom of speech - the right of being exempt from arrest, and the right of free and direct communication with the Crown, and the prayer that the most favourable construction should be placed upon its proceedings. The use of the words has been continued bv. all Parliaments down to the present time, though they now involve the ridiculous absurdity of the President or the Speaker claiming from the Crown rights which the Crown cannot grant, and the Crown solemnly granting those rights. Is it not time we stopped that? What right has the Crown to abrogate the common lair! Under section 49 of the Constitution we have all the powers, immunities and privileges of the British House of Commons, and it is under that section of our Constitution that we are exempt from the law of libel and from arrest while attending Parliament. It seems to me that we should adapt our procedure to existing circumstances, and we should not ask His Excellency to grant us that which he cannot grant, and leave him to pretend' to do that which we know he cannot do. The question received a great deal of consideration in Canada, and a pamphlet written by a clerk of one of the Dominion Houses exposed the whole absurdity. I think it is as well that we should ask the Governor-General for something which we know he can grant, and not for something which we know he cannot grant. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I was not under the impression that I was in any way altering my views. It was with the object of maintaining the rights and privileges of the Senate that I moved the amendment. It seemed to me that if there was any choice between the two expressions, to ask " the right of free and direct access and communication with His Excellency " was placing ourselves in a more and undignified position than if our President were to go to the Governor-General, and inform him that we claimed "our undoubted rights and privileges." Personally I feel that there is bo necessity for the President doing anything more than acquainting His Excellency with the fact that he has been appointed President of the Senate. But if we are to have any form of words put into the President's mouth I think the old form is better than the one now proposed. If at any time any Governor-General were so injudicious as to refuse to receive our President there would probably be trouble, and I have no doubt we shall be in a position to meet such a contingency if it should ever arise. There is in the old expression a reminder of a tradition which I think we should do well to uphold ; the tradition that the Parliament of the people is above all its officers, whether King or Governor-General. The form I suggest is to be preferred to a request that the Governor-General will be pleased to receive our President any time it may be necessary for him to call.

                    <para>- If we go back to the origin of this form, we shall see that it is a perfect farce even to ask from the Governor-General what it is proposed to ask from him here. The form originated at a time when the King had some power in the House of Commons, and when it was necessary that the election of the Speaker of the House of Commons should be confirmed by the King. The Speaker was then practically the King's President in the House of Commons, and the King had a right to veto his appointment. We have now come to a state of things in which we do not require the consent of the King or his Vice-Regent, and the whole thing has become a useless form from beginning to end. In my opinion there is no necessity for this or the preceding standing order. However, it seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> is right in proposing that, if we should claim anything, it should be something that sounds well, like our " undoubted rights and privileges," rather than that we should go crawling to the Governor-General and claim the right of free and direct access and communication, which every gentleman would give us under any circumstances, without asking for it. If we must do this kind of thing, let it be done in the old style, and let it be understood that it  is a relic of the past, and has only this significance, that it  shows how far  we  have advanced.  It will perhaps attract the attention of our children, and when they ask the reasons for it we shall be able to say - " Read up history and you will find how wonderfully we have advanced in democracy." The proposed form is exceedingly childish, and I should like to know the honorable senator who suggested it. I think he ought to be ashamed to argue the matter. We might very well go to the Governor-General and present our  President  to him, saying - " This is the gentleman whom we have elected to preside over our deliberations." but we should ask ' him for nothing. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will withdraw his amendment, I shall move the omission of the last four lines. </para>

                    BAKER (South Australia). - The phrase has been used that we are to go "crawling" to His Excellency to demand a certain thing. Is it not better to go crawling to His Excellency to demand something which he can grant, than to demand something which he cannot grant? I do not mind if all the words are omitted. I do not think that there is very much in them. I never thought that there was, but the reason for demanding the right of free access to His Excellency is that we have had Ministers of the Crown gradually usurping all power, and claiming rights and positions as against Parliament. In some instances I have known them to want to lay down the rule that communications to His Excellency from Parliament should pass through them.

                    <para>- Although I am quite at one with the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> I would point out again that if the committee use the words " new Parliament," and have the phrases " new Parliament " and " old Parliament," we shall be subordinating ourselves and our position to the House of Representatives. I object to that. The Parliament does not consist of the House of Representatives alone; it consists of the King, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. I think it will be far better to use the words "so long as he is a senator." I am sure that we shall get into difficulties about the meaning of the phrase " a new Parliament." In South Australia there was once nearly a conflict between the Houses concerning the meaning of the words " new Parliament." A great difficulty arose, and different opinions were expressed. I believe that the committee will make a great mistake if it uses the words. I hope that the amendment will not be pressed, and I suggest that the standing order should read in this form - </para>

                    But I think it reasonable to suppose a state of affairs when a Chairman of Committees may not be needed. Suppose something happens to induce a Chairman to resign before the end of a session, when there is little or no business to be done. It would be unreasonable then to put the Senate in the position of having to appoint a Chairman. The word " may " is preferable to the word " shall " until we are quite sure that we shall always require a Chairman ; and if we need a Chairman, the word " may " will not prevent his election.

They propose that the words "after a periodical or general election " shall be inserted, in order that we may define the term of office of the Chairman of Committees. If honorable senators do not alter the word " may " to " shall," it will be quite possible for any Senate in the future to refrain from electing a fresh Chairman.

I suppose that the numbers will be similar to- those on corresponding committees of the House of Representatives. It is here provided that the Standing Orders Committee shall consist of nine senators, the Library Committee of seven, the House Committee of seven, and the Printing Committee of six. I do not know whether there is any reason for fixing various numbers for the various committees, or whether it has been provided that there, shall be equality of numbers between the Senate and the House of Representatives. </para>

There is no particular charm in any particular number, but we consider that we ought to follow the practice laid down by the Senate itself. </para>

                    <para>- I am glad to have heard that expression of opinion. The whole value of this word " practice" lies in the one fact that in the first session of the first Parliament the Ministry made certain appointments to committees. That is all the practice ; and it is easy to deduce the value of it. The Postmaster-General has asked a very pertinent question, which should be answered by the senator in charge of the business of the committee ; and we understand that these are Government proposals. In reply to that question, we have heard that there is no reason why the number of senators on these committees should not be different, except that they have been so appointed in the first session of this Parliament. I hope the Postmaster-General will take steps to have the numbers made uniform. </para>

I do not object to that argument, but in regard to the Library Committee, the House Committee, and the Printing Committee no claim can be made for differentiation. On the Library and House committees we have the President and six senators, but the Printing Committee for some reason is bereft of the services of the President. I should like to make all the committees alike, and I frankly confess I do not care whether that is done by eliminating the President from the House Committee and the Library Committee, or by adding him to the Printing Committee. If the honorable senator in charge of . the proposals before the Senate would give some indication of his views, that might cause me to move or refrain from moving an. amendment. </para>

I do not know whether it is at his own desire that the President is not on the Printing Committee, but if it is not, I think he should be asked to serve. That is a very important committee, to which I shall draw attention at the proper time. </para>

When an application is made for leave of absence on behalf of a senator some reason must be given, and it seems to me that honorable senators should be allowed, if they choose, to challenge that reason. </para>

If that is not done the President will very often be brought into the Chamber quite unnecessarily, and before he takes the Chair a quorum will have been formed. </para>

                        <para>- In its special report the Standing Orders Committee has recommended that this standing order should be amended so as to provide that in the case of a petition being presented against a return it shall be referred at once to the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications. It is necessary to make a further amendment. Any petition against the return of a senator is now to' be referred to the new tribunal. Consequently the words referring to the matter in this standing order will have to come out. </para>

                    <para>- ! must confess that this is something new to me. I certainly understood when we dealt with the question of disputed returns under the Electoral Act that all questions of that nature, whether involving election, or choice on the part of a State Legislature, or appointment by a Governor in Council in the event of the Legislature not being in session, were to be referred directly to the court. I think that above all other bodies in the world a committee of Parliament is the least fitting to decide an electoral matter concerning which a considerable amount of heat may have been engendered. I regret very much that all petitions of the kind are not to be dealt with by the court. </para>

But if this standing order remains as we have it now, a petition may be sent to us against a return. It may be a petition which ought to be brought before the .new tribunal, but we shall have a standing order saying that such a petition shall be received here and referred at once to the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications ; whereas only certain petitions are properly receivable by the Senate. No doubt, the President will decide which petitions are not properly receivable. </para>

                        <para>- The standing order means that a petition is not to be printed unless a senator intends to take action upon it. But a senator who wants to get a petition printed will probably state that he is going to take action. I do not say that he will after that deliberately neglect to take action, but I am rather inclined to think that, to salve his conscience, he may table a motion, and even talk upon it; and that consequently the time of the Senate will be wasted. </para>

                    BAKER (South. Australia). - There is a question as to whether we ought not ' to put at the end of this standing order the words " unless by leave of the Senate." A practice has grown up of leave being given to senators to give notice after business has been called on. I cannot say that it is a good practice, and I am not at all sure that the standing orders ought not to be suspended to enable it . to be done. But considering that the standing orders under which we have been acting are merely temporary and provisional, I have not raised an objection to the practice. Unless the words I have mentioned are added, however, I shall in future feel it to be my duty not to allow any one to give notice after business has been called on unless the standing orders are suspended.

                <para>SenatorSir RICHARD BAKER (South Australia). - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has overlooked the fact, that when leave is asked for, it is for something which as a rule is contrary to the standing orders. We make standing orders in order that the public business may be properly regulated, and leave to do something which is not in accordance with the standing orders ought to be unanimously given, or otherwise we shall get into difficulties. How should we find out whether one-third of those present objected without taking a division every time? The granting of leave in the manner proposed in the standing orders is the rule in the British House of Parliament, and in every legislative body witli which I have acquaintance. </para>

                    <para>- I urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> not to persist with an amendment in the direction he indicates, because it will be a very dangerous course to adopt. The word "leave" has almost a traditional meaning in Parliament, and is recognised by authority to mean unanimous leave. Moreover, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will only create greater difficulty for himself if he insists on this two-thirds majority. By Standing Order 438 it is provided that the standing or sessional orders may be suspended on motion without notice, provided that the motion is carried by an absolute majority of the whole number of senators. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has properly pointed out, leave is generally asked for something which is contrary to the standing orders, and if it is desired to bring forward a matter of great importance, and one or two or half-a-dozen objections are raised, the standing orders may be suspended by nineteen senators. </para>

As a matter of fact, whilst there is any amendment before the Senate, I do not think it is competent for the previous question to be moved at all. I shall be glad to hear the views of the President upon the matter, but assuming what I have said to be, as I believe it is, the undoubted parliamentary practice, we should amend Standing Order 146 in order to make it conform to the general parliamentary practice set forth in Standing Order 148. </para>

                    <para>- It does not appear tome that we must necessarily conform to the general parliamentary practice. What we should do is to make our standing orders conform to the convenience of the Senate ; but I do not think the Chairman is right in his contention. I see no inconsistency between Standing Order 146 and Standing Order 148. Standing Order 1 6 simply affirms that the previous question may be moved whether there is an amendment before. the Chair or not. For instance, some honorable senator moves a motion, arid another moves an amendment upon it ; the previous question may then be moved to dispose of both, and, if carried, it sweeps away the whole question. "Whatever the procedure may be in other places, that Seems to me to be convenient. Standing Order 148 deals with another matter altogether - the previous question cannot be moved -to an amendment. That is not the point. We cannot move the previous question to an amendment, but we can move it to the original motion, and, if carried, it sweeps away both the original motion and the amendment. There are three propositions in Standing Order 148 : that the previous question cannot be moved to an amendment, that it cannot be moved in committee, and that an amendment cannot be moved thereto, and while they are consistent with each other, I think none of them are inconsistent with Standing Order 146. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to hear the opinion of honorable senators on the subject. It is not an important one, but I cannot see that any disadvantage results from the practice of allowing the President to remain in the Chair, and signify that he desires to vote upon one side or the other. The instance quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> does not "seem to me to be quite conclusive. That might be the practice . in some Chambers which are differently constructed, and where it might be more convenient. </para>

On one occasion during a division I was not satisfied as to how the President was voting, and I said to the teller - "Have you asked the President how he is voting ? " The teller was simply angry with me. That is the only time I have ever had any unpleasantness in this Chamber. I think that the President should be asked to sit either on one side or the other of the Chamber during a division, if he is not in the Chair. </para>

                    <para>- The matter is one which can be decided without any reference to what has happened in the past. It is undoubtedly an inconvenience to a teller when . an honorable senator sits with the " Ayes " and votes with the "Noes." The teller may or may not hear the "aye" or the "no " of the President when the question is put, and when the seats on either side are of equal comfort I do not see why the President, when voting, should not sit upon one side or the other. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that honorable senators are far too straight-laced in keeping up old customs and old forms. The standing order provides merely for a courtesy, which might very well be extended to the President and the Chairman of Committees. If the President is sitting in the seat which he finds most convenient, it is surely no hardship upon a teller to require him to say - "Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> on which side do you propose to vote." We ought not to be bound by an old custom which I dare say has operated very well in the past. Occasionally we must depart from old customs. I am rather surprised to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> who is generally in favour of preserving old forms, agreeing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> in this matter. I thought last session that this courtesy should be extended to the President and to the Chairman of Committees, and if a division is called for I shall vote in that direction. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> ought to be"1 consistent in framing our standing orders. When we are devising a system of voting, I do not see why a particular senator should be given a privilege which is denied to others. In a committee of the whole it is no more undignified for the President to cross the floor than for any other senator to do so. If it is not thought worth while to adopt a general rule, let every senator have the right to remain in his seat and vote as he chooses. Of course it will give additional work to the tellers, and, if any confusion should result, it can only be ascribed to our desire to uphold the dignity of senators. </para>

                    <para>- It amused me to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> as a good old conservative, should follow the good old plan when he is actually following it. In the only other Parliament of which I have- had any knowledge, the rule was for the Speaker or the President when the House was in committee to pass to the side of the "Ayes " or the side of the " Noes," and thus indicate on which side he was voting. Another practice has sprung up in the Senate - we hardly know how. It caused a considerable amount of trouble last -session. From the place iri which the President was sitting we did not know which way he was voting, and now it is proposed to extend the privilege to the Chairman of Committees. .If the President and the Chairman are to be allowed to sit on the side of the "Ayes" and to vote on the side of the " Noes," we shall not know where we are. It will put them to no trouble or annoyance to vote exactly in the same way as other honorable senators do. Of course when either of them is sitting in the Chair it is only right that he should be allowed to indicate which way he desires to vote. </para>
