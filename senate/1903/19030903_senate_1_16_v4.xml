Of course, it is impossible for me to strictly comply with the standing order, because the new Standing Orders only came into force yesterday; but I propose to do so as far as possible, and therefore I lay upon the table a warrant appointing seven senators to be that committee. </para>

          <para>- Be fore the business of the day is called on I ask the indulgence of the Senate, in accordance with Standing Order 394, to explain a matter which is not only of a personal, but also of a public nature. It will be recollected that on the 16th July last I presented a petition similar in nature and purport to others which had been presented on that day. It was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards,</inline> the member for Oxley in the House of Representatives, who was asked to hand it to a senator from Queensland. He endeavoured to find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson,</inline> and in his absence he asked me if I would be good enough to present the petition to the Senate. It was from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce. I was bound, as a matter of duty, to comply with the request. I did present the petition, which prayed for the repeal of section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act, relating to the exclusion of coloured seamen from steamers under contract to the Commonwealth Government. It will be recollected that I made it distinctly known to you, sir, and the Senate generally, that, while presenting the petition as a matter of duty to my constituents, I totally disagreed with its prayer. On page 2181 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the mere presentation of the petition is recorded, but, unfortunately, there is no report of my remarks. I deeply regret that fact for a variety of reasons. It has led to very considerable trouble, and has given me considerable annoyance, which might have been avoided if the remarks had been reported. During the many years I have been in Parliament I have purposely refrained from reflecting in any way on the reporting staff ; nor do I wish to make any reflection now. So far as my experience of the reporting staff in the Senate goes, nothing can be complained of, but I cannot understand the omission of my remarks on that occasion. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- For many years I have been a member of the branch of the Federated Seamen&#39;s Union in Brisbane, and I am one of its trustees. Many years ago, in the Parliament of Queensland, I took the initiative in an endeavour to induce the Government to exclude coloured seamen from ships hired or under contract to carry the mails of that State. I am glad to say that that policy was adopted some years ago. I need scarcely remind you, sir, and the Senate generally, that when we were debating the Post and Telegraph Bill, I submitted an amendment empowering and enjoining the Postmaster-General, when entering into contracts with steam-ship companies for the carriage of the mails of the Commonwealth, to insert a provision that the steamers should be manned by white men. I think it will be obvious to you, sir, and most honorable senators, that I, at any rate, am not likely to go back on a policy which I have advocated for so many years. Yet the mere omission of my remarks when presenting the petition from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce praying for the continuance of coloured labour on ships has led to a very considerable amount of trouble. Perhaps I may be allowed briefly to state the facts as they appear in the public prints of my own State. From the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Observer,</inline> of the 22nd August, I shall quote an article which appears under this very startling heading - </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline>has just been asked by the secretary of the Federated Seamen&#39;s Union ( Queensland branch) to resign the post of trustee, which he has held for many years. The circumstances are peculiar, and may be said to afford their own most appropriate comment. It appears that the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> recently published an attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glassey,</inline> accusing him of working in the interests of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to secure a refund of excise, and of Brisbane merchants, who were likewise seeking rebates on articles affected by the Tariff. But the latest, and apparently most heinous, of all his offences is that of having presented a petition to the Senate for the repeal of the provision in the Postal Act prohibiting the employment of coloured labour on the mail boats subsidized by the Commonwealth. We are told that in the face of all that has been done by the Seamen&#39;s Union for years past in fighting against the employment of coloured men on shipboard, &#34;a responsible officer of the Seamen&#39;s Union comes along, and has the amazing front to present a petition to the Senate, praying that honorable House to stick to coloured labour, and put up a notice on our mail boats that No white man need apply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is a very obliging politician, but when becomes before the white men and women of Queensland for their votes, and they ask him what he means by playing the game of the anti-white party, he may find it none too easy to &#39; oblige &#39; them with an answer that will satisfy.&#34; </para>
          <para>The article from which we have quoted was forwarded to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glassey</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henderson,</inline> secretary of the F.S.U., asking him for an explanation. </para>

        <para class="block">The enclosures were from the newspaper which commented most unfairly upon my action - and I wish to say, in reply, that it is perfectly true that I presented a petition from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce to the Senate, and such petition sought the repeal of the provision in the Post and Telegraph Act, of which I am the original author, for excluding coloured seamen from all mail steamers under contract to the Commonwealth Government for the carriage of mails. Doubtless you are aware that it is the duty of Members of Parliament to present petitions from their constituents to Parliament, irrespective of the political opinions of the petitioners. But the presentation of any such petition in no way binds the member who presents it to the principle of such petition, nor does it pledge him to support its prayer. When presenting the petition I took the precaution, however, to state to the Senate (although contrary to the Standing Orders), that I presented the petition as a matter of duty to my constituents, but that I totally disagreed with its prayer. Of course the <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> which usually suppresses the truth where I am concerned, failed, and wilfully and wickedly failed, to state these facts. This and many other misstatements and suppressions I will deal with in due course. Trusting this explanation will be satisfactory to you and your members, </para>

        <para>I regret very much that I am compelled to take this opportunity of putting myself right before my constituents by stating the true facts of the case to them. Before sitting down I desire to ask you, as President of this Senate, whether you recollect the circumstances to which I have referred - as I think you will do - and if you will be good enough to state them? I also desire to ask whether you are in any way responsible for the suppression of the report of my speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to which </para>

If you are not responsible I should be glad to know why a report of this matter was not forthcoming*, and does not find a place in the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Mansard,</inline> where it should be. Perhaps I may also be allowed to express my thanks to the Senate for having permitted me to make this personal statement. I trust that the explanation given by you so far as the report is concerned, and also with reference to your recollection of the circumstances to which I have alluded, will be satisfactory. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has asked me two questions. I have no hesitation in saying that I distinctly recollect the circumstances to which he has alluded. It is the universal rule in all Parliaments that I have ever heard of that any member is bound to present a petition, no matter what the contents of it may be, so long as it conforms to the Standing Orders. &#34;When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> made the statement that he did not agree with the prayer of the petition he was presenting I called him to order, because it is contrary to the Standing Orders to make any statement concerning petitions, except such statements as are specifically laid down in the Standing Orders themselves. So far as the second question is concerned I may say that I know nothing at all about it. I did not know what <inline font-style="italic">H Handsard</inline> had done with reference to the incident. &#39; I did not read it. I gave no instruction with reference to the matter. </para>

        <para>That the Senate approves of the proposed distribution of the State of Tasmania into five divisions, named Darwin, Denison, Northcote, Franklin, and Wilmot, as shown on the map laid upon the table of the Senate on the 25th August, 1903. . </para>
        <para>The map referred to in the motion, together with the report of the Commissioner, was laid upon the table of the Senate in accordance with section 20 of the Electoral Act. That section is as follows : - </para>
        <para>The report and map shall be laid before both Houses or Parliament within seven days after its receipt if the Parliament is in session, and if not, then within seven days after the commencement of the next session. </para>
        <para>That has been carried out. The next section provides - </para>
        <para>If .both Houses of Parliament pass a resolution approving of any proposed distribution, the Governor-General may by proclamation declare the names and boundaries of the divisions, and such divisions shall, until altered, be the electoral divisions for the State in which they are situated. </para>
        <para>We are acting in accordance with the pro- visions of the Act in those respects. I need hardly say that I am not in a position to speak as to the merits of the divisions foi: the State of Tasmania, but I have no doubt that the representatives of Tasmania in the Senate will be able to express an opinion upon the subject, if one is needed. Therefore, I content myself with moving the resolution. </para>

          <para>- I do not think that any senator from Tasmania, or any other honorable senator, could find, fault with regard .to the merits of the divisions, but I should not like to see the motion passed in the form in which it has been moved. My only objection is as to the nomenclature. One of the proposed electoral divisions has been named Northcote. When the Tasmanian Commissioner sent in his report, he named that particular electorate Flinders. But when the subject came up for consideration in another place, it was pointed out that there was already an electorate named Flinders in the State of Victoria ; and as a compliment to the new Governors-General, Lord Northcote, it was resolved to give his name to the electoral division in question. But with all due &#39; respect to that gentleman, we know, at present, very little about his attainments for fulfilling the duties of Governor-General of Australia, and I think that it would be much more appropriate if the substituted name were more in conformity with the objects kept in view by the originator of the scheme of subdivision, who named the electorate Flinders.. I therefore intend to propose that the word &#34; Northcote&#34; be omitted, with a view to substituting the word &#34; Bass.&#34; Obviously the intention was to perpetuate the memory of some of the early navigators who were responsible for the discovery of certain coastal portions of Australasia. The fact that Tasmania is separated from the mainland was first discovered by Bass. . It was <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bass</inline> who first sailed through Bass Straits in an open boat. He was the first navigator who sailed along the Ninety-Mile Beach, and right up as far as Corner Inlet in Victoria. He, in conjunction with Flinders, &#39;afterwards charted practically the whole of the north coast of Tasmania. He was responsible for a good deal of the early geographical investigation of the coast of Australia. Under the circumstances, I think we should much more appropriately name this electorate Bass than Northcote, It is also a singular circumstance that the electorate in question is almost exactly opposite to Flinders on this side of the Straits. I am aware, of course, that the word Bass has another signification which will occur at once to the minds of honorable senators. But we do well, I think, to pay some tribute of respect to the early navigators to whom we owe so much. It is all very well to pay a tribute of respect to our coming Governors-General. But it has to be remembered that he has yet his career to run in Australia&#39;. It is possible that he may not give that satisfaction that we should like all our Governors-General to give. If that should be the case it may be said hereafter that it was an unfortunate thing that an electorate should have been named after a man at a time when he was not known, and when his attainments for his particular work were not apparent. </para>

            <para>- In naming this constituency after Bass we are evidently naming it after some one, the standard of whose work is permanently fixed. Nothing can be done by Bass hereafter that will in any way detract from the work which we know that he did, or which will cause us to regret having endeavoured to perpetuate his memory. Honorable senators might well take it for granted that if the name of Bass be inserted in the place of Northcote there&#39; will be very little difficulty in another place. The name of Northcote was inserted there very hurriedly. It had not been contemplated that there would be any difficulty about the adoption of the name of Flinders, and it was only in the course of the debate that it was pointed out that there was already an electorate named Flinders in Victoria. In consequence of that the word Northcote was substituted, but there should be no difficulty in inducing the House of Representatives to substitute the name of Bass. I move - </para>

          <para>- I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment. It gives me an opportunity to say something about the claims which the pioneers of Australia have to our remembrance and recognition. Certain <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> eloquent people have told us that all we have in Australia is due to certain fixed battles which were fought in the sixteenth or seventeenth century; but Bass was one. of the early explorers&#39;, the results of whose work are shown to-day. If at any time Lord Northcote proves to Australia that he is deserving of their recognition, we may find some other opportunity to perpetuate his name. It is probable that some of the islands near New Guinea may yet be named after Lord Northcote, and other distinguished visitors. I would personally prefer the name of Dobson to that of Northcote in this instance, but George Bass has, I think, the first claim. He was, as honorable senators may recollect, a medical practitioner who&#62; came out to Australia on board the Reliance when Governor Hunter arrived. He explored Botany Bay and the Illawarra district of New South Wales, at a time when it required some courage and endurance to explore such places.&#39; Afterwards, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed out, he sailed through the passage that is now known as Bass&#39; Straits in a whaleboat with half-a-dozen men, and the year following explored the island of Tasmania and investigated all its harbors. His work is entitled to the small recognition which we are able to give it by calling an electoral division after his name. </para>

            <para>- I understand there is a very general feeling on the part of honorable senators in favour of making the alteration -proposed in the name of one of these divisions. It at first appeared to me that it would be desirable to make the alteration suggested by means of an addition to the motion recommending to the House of Representatives that one name should be substituted for the other. But I &#39;find that the name &#34;Northcote&#34; is not on the map, nor in the report of the Commissioner. As a matter of fact the name in the report and on the map is &#34; Flinders,&#34; so that the other House passed a motion approving of divisions bearing names, one of which does not correspond with the name used in either the report or &#34;the map. We shall be doing the same thing here in substituting the name of &#34;Bass&#34; for that of &#34;Northcote,&#34; but I presume this will be considered a substantial compliance with the Electoral Act. I make no objection to the amendment. </para>

        <para class="block">Owing to the intense compression represented in the draftsmanship of this Bill, totally dissimilar matters are grouped together under one heading in a manner for which there is no precedent. We have here a proposal to deal in respect of recruiting, and in respect of military service, in exactly the same way with the professional soldier, the militiaman, and the volunteer. Under the British law the terms of service of these three very different classes of men are wholly distinct. Under the Bill it is proposed that the period of service shall not be less than three years, and may be any longer term. , It will be admitted that five &#39; years is a fair term of service for a professional soldier. He requires a couple of years in which to learn his business, as do Members of Parliament, though some of them do not learn the business in two years. But, while five years may be considered a proper term of service for the professional soldier, and also for the partially-paid man - the man who gets 2s. an hour for his drill - it is altogether opposed to the volunteer system, which is peculiarly a British institution. According to another clause of the Bill all the existing members of the force are to be deemed members of the force unless they give notice and leave ; otherwise they will come under the operation of the regulations which may be issued under the clause. A man who innocently remains in the force may, under this clause, find himself compelled to serve for many years. According to clause 39 a man, though he receives no payment - not even towards his expenses out of pocket - may be compelled to remain in the force, although his health, or the necessity for his earning a living, or any of the casualties of a man&#39;s life, may call upon him to retire. Though such a man has never received a shilling in payment, he may be subject to a fine of &#163;2, because he is compelled to resign ; and it is too much to ask the unpaid man to assume a responsibility which has no limit except that which may be eventually provided by regulations under this clause. There ought to be a distinction between the paid and unpaid man, and the term of service in the case of a volunteer ought to be to some extent reduced. I am in entire agreement with the Minister and the framers of the Bill in the belief that a fixed term is desirable, though I admit that a fixed term is contrary to English law. I have here the British Volunteer Act, under which there is no obligation to serve for any fixed term, but the volunteer can, on giving fourteen days&#39; notice, leave without incurring a liability of any kind. </para>

            <para>.- No, the volunteer may leave at any time. There are no rules by which a member of a volunteer force can be made responsible for the payment of any part of the capitation grant, because, under the law, the capitation is not the property of any individual but the property of the corps. The words referring to the payment of moneys due simply relate to any subscriptions which the volunteer may have undertaken to pay in connexion with rifle clubs, sergeants mess, or any of the many organizations to be found in the military service. There are a number of expenses which are not provided for by law and for which the Government do not provide the money. It is unfair to ask a man who receives no pay to undertake three years&#39; certain service, with the possibility of a much longer period being demanded from him under regulation. </para>

No doubt a uniform might, under such circumstances, be cleaned and pressed for another volunteer who might not know that it had been worn ; but I have no doubt that a man would object to wear those second-hand clothes, and in that I should not blame him. My proposal is that the term of service for volunteers shall be one year. </para>

            <para>- My honorable and learned friend does not know. He has not done as much recruiting as I have done. I have recruited over 2,000 men, and I know the difficulties to be encountered in getting good men and keeping them. I do not wish by fixing the period at two years to create a new difficulty. I accepted the insertion of the word &#34;prescribed &#34; in my amendment, which would give the Government the right, by regulation, to fix as long a period as they pleased. But I think that two years would be too long as an absolute minimum. Any honorable senator must . know- the difficulty of getting men to bind themselves to voluntary service with, no remuneration for a definite period of two years. I do not desire the Minister to have to come down next session with an amending Bill. It will be far better to fix the period by regulation, because the term could be altered from time to time as the necessity might arise. Suppose that the period were fixed by regulation at two years, and that men could not be got to join, the Government would only need to issue another regulation to reduce the period of service to one year. If, however, the Bill were passed in its present form, the period could not be altered without fresh legislation. I move - </para>

I know that not a few volunteers come out from Great Britain to Australia on business engagements for two or. three years, sometimes for a shorter period. Naturally they would like to join our forces. Why should we not have an opportunity of engaging their services? They might not be disposed to offer their services if they had to join for two years certain, although they might be very glad to join for one 3Tear. A shorter term would give the opportunity of getting the service of men who had had experience elsewhere. </para>

Although I am not a professional soldier like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> still I think- that a year&#39;s service would not be of any use. I contend that the minimum should be fixed at two years. The Defence Force would be far better off without recruits who were willing to serve for one year only, because we should be put to the expense of providing them with arms and uniforms. If men are not prepared to serve for two years their services should not be accepted. </para>

            <para>- The Minister is anxious to get his Bill passed, as it came from the other House. We have to remember this great central fact : that we must hold out inducements to our young nien to join our volunteer force. We have a roving population. A man may be in Victoria today, and perhaps in Queensland or New South Wales or Western Australia next week. In these circumstances, how can we bind a man down to a period of two years ? Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett,</inline> I hold that a great deal could be done with a man in a year. If hard-and-fast lines were imposed, the result would be to keep our young men out of the volunteer force. Every encouragement ought to be given to young men to join. Six months&#39; drill would be an advantage to any man. Suppose that a man got six months&#39; <inline font-style="italic">drill in</inline> one State, and went to another State ; he could join the force there. The more easy we make the conditions, the better it will be for the service. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia). - I cannot see my way clear to support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> In my opinion, a short term would have the effect of breaking up the <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps.</inline> It is the length of time which men serve together which creates that spirit. If men were to join a corps for a few months, and then give up their arms it must tend to its disintegration. What is the worst thing that could happen ? If a man found that his business required him to go to another part of the Commonwealth he would give in his three months&#39; notice and resign on paying for his uniform. The object of this portion of the Bill is to provide for a trained force. If we are to have ft trained force let it be one which will be worthy of the name ; do not let us be playing at soldiers. If it is thought by honorable senators that a man should only be required to be able to shoot, let us do away with the militia and volunteers, and merely have rifle clubs. But if we are to have a militia, let us see that the men are to undergo some training. Considering that only a portion of the time of these men would be given up to training, two years would be little enough for them to serve. I hope that the Committee will not make the minimum less than two years. It must be remembered that the provision also applies to rifle clubs. Although I have always been friendly to rifle clubs, still I have recognised the danger of making them pot-hunting clubs. The spirit which ought to animate men when they join rifle clubs is to make themselves efficient shots for the defence of the country. We should have a chance of securing efficient shots if the period of service were made reasonably long. The clause is very liberal as it is, and we shall err -on the side of over-generosity if . the period is reduced to less than two years. </para>

He wants to have power to make the term as long as possible. I concede that. Now I desire to fix a minimum of twelve months. In the British volunteer service a man can clear out at any time by giving fourteen days&#39; notice. They do leave when necessity arises. And how is it that we have men in the ranks who are wearing the medal that represents twenty years&#39; service? It is one of the heart-breaks of an old volunteer to have to leave his service through old age. I know of a company that was formed in a Sydney regiment not so long ago, in which every one of the sergeants carries upon his breast two or more medals. One man wears no less than eight medals. This is in my regiment, and I am proud of such a man. </para>

            <para>- What clause allows a member of the reserve or of a rifle club to resign ? Under clause 31 the reserve forces consist of members of rifle clubs and former members of the active forces who have enrolled as members of the reserve forces. Therefore, this clause only refers to the militia and the permanent forces. There should be some power to enable a member of the reserve forces to resign. </para>

          <para>- The point mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> arises from the alteration made in clause 35. The Bill proposes that only members of the active forces - that is, the militia and the volunteers - shall be enlisted for a term. But by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> amendment, which I accepted, we have declared that the reserve forces also shall have to enlist for a certain time. It was intended originally that they should not enlist for any period, and could consequently retire when they liked. But now it will be necessary to make provision for them to retire if they desire to do so. I will have a clause drafted for the purpose. </para>

It has been the law in New South Wales ever since we have had a citizen force. Under this Bill it is proposed to limit the exemption from jury service to members of the permanent forces. I am not aware that the existing practice has caused any inconvenience, and the exemption allowed is looked upon as a small concession. A man who is serving his country in one capacity may be considered entitled to some little relief from a citizen&#39;s duties in another. </para>

          <para>- I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in this matter. The members of the militia and volunteer forces generally may be looked upon peculiarly as citizens, and they should be called upon to discharge the duties and obligations of citizens. Their time is not greatly occupied in the performance of military duties ; and, in the case of volunteers, their drills are ordinarily held in the evenings, and sometimes on the Saturday afternoon. I do not think that service upon a jury should be looked upon as a sort of punishment, and a duty from which one should desire to be relieved, but rather as a duty that a citizen should be proud to perform. I do not see why a man should be exempt from the duty of serving upon a jury simply because he has undertaken to enrol himself on the volunteer force for the defence of his country. </para>

There are provisions in this Bill under which members of the forces are liable to serve in the work of putting down riots, or any internal disorder, and I submit that it is contrary to all public policy, and to the due administration of law and justice, that men should occupy the dual position of peace officer and member of a jury. I do not for a moment suppose that a man engaged in such service as I refer to would be accepted as a juror in a case arising out of that service. He would no doubt be challenged at once, but the next man in the same corps might, under this clause, be called upon to serve on a jury in a case in which his own regiment was concerned. Do policemen serve on juries? I think not. Men who may be engaged as peace officers are not the men who should be selected to serve upon juries. </para>

They do not object to serve upon juries, and, indeed, the notice to a man who has been some time out of work that he is required to serve upon a jury is usually a very welcome notice. These men are citizens in every sense of the term, and they only devote occasional evenings and Saturday afternoons to their military duties, whilst it is very seldom that a jury is called upon to sit on a Saturday afternoon. There is no analogy between militia and volunteers and the police force, because the police force is a permanent force. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>NEILD (New South Wales). - As these unusual views are being expressed, it is necessary that I should carry the argument a little further, even if it be only in self-defence. What I am asking for has been the law in New South Wales for forty years. I find this provision referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Military Law : -</inline></para>
        <para>Every officer, non-commissioned officer, and volunteer, after having served as an efficient volunteer for the period of two years, and every officer and non-commissioned officer of the permanent staff of the volunteer force, shall hereafter be exempt from serving as a juror so long us he continues to be in the volunteer force. </para>
        <para>Then follows a provision under which a certificate is granted. That is the British law and the law in New South Wales. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> tells me that the volunteers will not thank me for trying to secure their exemption from jury service, I can only say that that is the most <inline font-style="italic">adcaptandum vulgus</inline> tomfoolery that ever was uttered. I desire in this matter merely to bring the law of the Commonwealth into line with the law : in England, the law which has hitherto been in force in New South Wales. </para>

          <para>- The words referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> are intended to deal only with exceptional cases, such as that of an adjutant who is employed in some branch of. the service which is not included in the permanent forces. For instance, the permanent forces do not comprise any field artillery, but there may be a paid adjutant connected with that branch of the service. Such a man is in the pay of the Government, and devoting the whole of his time to his duties, is practically a professional soldier, although he is technically not a member of the permanent forces. The principle is that all persons who are continuously employed - who are professional soldiers - shall be required to go on active service at any time. </para>

There are ordinary officers of the citizen forces, who, as adjutants, receive the splendid pay of 5s. per day, out of which they have to provide their own horses ; and the Minister appears to take the clause to mean that these men, who are got &#34; on the cheap,&#34; are liable for active service anywhere. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator used the word &#34; deliberately.&#34; As a matter of fact, however, the words are an inheritance from a previous Defence Bill as introduced in another place; and they were quite in order in that measure, because they imposed a restriction on the permanent forces. There can be no doubt that the necessity for striking out these words was overlooked in another place. If this clause be left in the Bill, it will be possible for the Government to provide, in a part of the Estimates where the items would not be noticed, for a payment to men who are really members of the permanent forces, and the cost of the latter will appear smaller than it actually is. For&#34; that reason I strongly urge the Committee to adopt the amendment, which will oblige the Government to provide for the whole of the permanent forces in one part of the Estimates, and enable us to see exactly what the expenditure is. </para>

If they do not come within the definition of any of these branches of the service there will be a danger, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has pointed out, of the Government spending more money in this direction than can be readily traced on the Estimates. </para>

            <para>- Surely that means the Executive Government. Apparently in this clause we are not giving&#39; to the States the exact protection which is conferred upon them by section 119 of the Constitution Act. If it were altered as I suggested, it would throw upon the Governor of. a State the onus of saying whether domestic violence existed therein or not. The clause requires the Governor of the State to declare that domestic violence exists therein. And then it says that the Governor-General may proclaim the same fact - as to which he knows nothing - and call out the permanent forces. I think that the Governor of the State should be charged with the responsibility of proclaiming that domestic violence exists therein, and then on an application from the Executive Government of the State, I take it that the Commonwealth would be bound to call out the forces and protect the State. </para>

        <para class="block">If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> will take the trouble to study <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he will find that there was a distinct stipulation that only such members should be employed as were necessary for instructional purposes. In clause 49, however, we find a provision that in case domestic violence exists in a State, the Governor-General is to call out the administrative and instructional staffs for the purpose of reducing the outbreak, and only in the event of their numbers being insufficient can he call out the militia and volunteers. I submit that the clause was perfectly practicable as drafted, but that it is absolutely ridiculous in its present form. I do not suggest an amendment, because I do not feel called upon to draft amendments for this Government. The clause is reminiscent of passages which one may find in an opera of Gilbert and Sullivan. </para>

            <para>- Certainly, because, in my opinion, they were at the bottom of the whole affair. The Lord Mayor and Professors from the University were swearing in special constables, and vigilance committees were being formed; I dare say that the people were in great danger of domestic violence at that time. A clause framed in accordance with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> suggestion would have come in very useful at that time. If the honorable senator will embody his suggestion in an amendment I shall support bini. </para>

          <para>- In connexion with this clause I refer the Committee to clause 8. They will there find two terms used. One is &#34;the King&#39;s Regular Forces, &#34;applying to the King&#39;s Army in Great Britain; and the other is &#34;the King&#39;s Regular Naval Forces.&#34; These terms have been used at intervals throughout the Bill, and it is necessary to retain the same phraseology. But in this clause the term &#34; Royal Navy &#34; is used. I suggest that those words should be struck out with a view of inserting the phraseology used in clause 8 - &#34; the King&#39;s Regular Naval Forces.&#34; In any case, the ships of the navy employed by Australia would be just as much a portion of the Royal Navy as those employed by the people of Great Britain; and it is most desirable that no confusion of thought even should arise on a question of this sort.

          <para>- This is a very important clause, inasmuch as it gives the Governor-General the power to put portions of our citizen naval forces on board ships of the Royal Navy, but there is nothing to show that they will be accompanied by their own officers. If we expect men to enlist in our citizen forces, we must make it absolutely clear that they will serve under their own officers. I cannot suggest the necessary alteration, because it would entail redrafting the whole clause; nor can I. move that the clause be struck out, because in itself it is a desirable one. I should like to know what the Minister for Defence suggests with a view of meeting the difficulty. I think the Committee will be practically of one mind in thinking that the men should be accompanied by their officers. There would be no possibility of getting officers to join the citizen naval forces if, immediately the forces went into action, or into training, the officers did not accompany them.Ileave that point to be dealt with by the Minister, and will propose one or two minor amendments to bring the clause into keeping with the amendments made in clause 51. </para>

          <para>- Some provision of this kind is absolutely necessary, and I do not see why we should anticipate that in case any of the forces are placed on board one of His Majesty&#39;s ships the officers would not be taken. It rests with the Governor-General to say what forces shall be placed on board the ships and under the command of the officers commanding the ships. It would be within the power of the Governor-General to say whether any forces should be so disposed. I do not see why we should anticipate that the Governor-General will consent to the men going on board the ships, and not the officers under whom the men have been accustomed to serve. It is more probable that in case of the men being sent for training or during war on board the ships their officers would be sent also. There would be neither economy nor good sense in separating the men from the officers who have been accustomed to drill them. </para>

        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MATHESON</inline>(Western Australia). - The explanation given by the Minister for Defence shows his want of appreciation of the relative positions of the Admiral on the station and the Governor-General. I must say that this clause in itself fosters any misapprehensions that may exist. As a matter of fact, the Governor-General has no power to place a single sailor on board one of&#39; His Majesty&#39;s ships except with the consent of the Admiral. The Governor-General would have to get the Admiral&#39;s consent before he could move a single seaman on to one of the ships of the so-called Australian Squadron. We therefore have to consider, not what the Governor-General would like to do, but what the Admiral in command on the station would do. Those who have studied the question know that the position of the officers of our citizen forces is the great stumbling-block in making arrangements for the employment of the men. I have gone into that question to some extent, and I know that that is the fact. The difficulties which arise in connexion with officers when they are put on board His Majesty&#39;s ships of the permanent British Navy are almost insuperable. I can easily understand the Admiral pointing that out to the Governor-General, and the Governor-General being unable to take that action which he would like to take. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator will no doubt remember that the agreement expressly states that the squadron being contracted for, if I may use that expression, is not to be understood as constituting the whole of the naval strength that may be maintained by Great Britain in Australian waters. We anticipate that in addition to that squadron there will be other vessels provided, and possibly more powerful vessels than those included in the squadron arranged for by the Naval Agreement. If the honorable senator&#39;s amendment be carried the intention is that we shall not be able to supply officers or men to any British vessel that may be here unless it forms part of the Australian Squadron or is an Australian vessel. I think that is wrong. If the honorable senator means that, I think there is no reason for his amendment, and if he means that these men are not to be placed on board any but a vessel in Australian waters it is useless to insert such a provision, because unless the vessel is here the men will not be put on board of it. There may be British vessels here unconnected with the squadron to be provided under the agreement, and they may be here for the purpose of the defence of Australian interests, and if we think that Australian officers and seamen should be placed on board British ships for the purpose of training in time of war, I do not see how we can make a distinction between such vessels as I have alluded to and vessels included in the Naval Agreement. </para>

          <para>- I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that it is quite possible that owing to a hostile encounter, a shipwreck, or any casualty of the sea, a vessel in which there were members of the Australian Naval Reserve might become unseaworthy, and it might be absolutely necessary to transfer the crew to another vessel that did not belong to the force on the Australian station, but to a vessel from some other station which might be cruising about, and which might come to the relief of the disabled ship. We might imagine a combination of the forces on the Australian and China stations, and that in the course of a general naval engagement a number of the Australian ships might be sunk. What would become of the crews if they could not be transferred to vessels belonging to the other squadrons? Surely vessels of war might meet with casualties which would render it necessary to transfer their crews to other vessels. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MATHESON</inline>(Western Australia). - I point out that this is a more serious question than some honorable senators appear to think. The words &#34; naval forces &#34; include all the naval forces of the Commonwealth, and therefore include naval volunteers. Volunteers of the military force cannot be moved out of the Commonwealth unless they volunteer &#39; for service abroad. But these naval volunteers may, under this clause, be ordered, without any possibility of refusing, to go on board a transport, and they may then be used for manning one of His Majesty&#39;s ships, at Esquimalt, at Capetown, or at Portsmouth. </para>

            <para>- It is of little use for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to ask me what I think the Governor-General would agree to. It is not the Governor-General with whom we have to deal, but those lunatics who get blown out with Imperialistic ideas. I could always trust the Governor-General to be sensible, because he has no party views. But when we have to deal with a person who goes home feasting and becomes inflated with Imperial bombast, we do not know what he may do. These terms are, of course, impersonal, and I do&#39; not apply them in any but a strictly parliamentary sense. The fact remains that any one at the head of the Naval Department here might, under this clause, do what I have described ; and I therefore think that the limitation proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is not unreasonable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> suggests that what he would do himself any other Minister would be bound to do ; but that is not a necessary <inline font-style="italic">sequitur.</inline> We could always trust the honorable senator to exercise common sense, but we could not trust every one else to do the same.

We have then the Minister for Defence, who will have the first say in this matter, quite prepared to contemplate the possibility of putting Australian seamen on board vessels that will not belong to the Australian Squadron. We might have the whole of the Australian Naval Reserve ordered on board a transport, and transferred to a vessel belonging to the - Cape Squadron, and sent here to rent. </para>

            <para>- There is nothing in the amendment I propose which would in any way interfere with the assistance which we might care to give to the British Navy. The Admiralty authorities can take British sailors from British ships on the Australian station and transport them to any part of the world, and they can fill their places on the Australian station with Australian seamen. That is what we wish to provide for. The Australian seamen will be trained at our expense for the defence of Australia, and they ought to be kept here. It must be remembered that these men will volunteer to defend Australia, and&#39; not to defend Cape Colony or Hong Kong. Why, then, should they be liable to be defrauded by being taken elsewhere ? I feel sure that the Committee will admit the reasonableness of the amendment, notwithstanding the hypothetical case suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> Such a ridiculous case as the honorable senator imagined could only occur to a mind capable of conceiving something extremely ridiculous upon every occasion. The honorable senator has suggested that if a vessel were sinking, the commander would say that the men could not be put on board of another vessel because of a clause in this Bill. Such a situation could only be conceived by a mind capable of conceiving the military <inline font-style="italic">fiasco</inline> we read of in the military annals of New South Wales - I refer to the battle of Chowder Bay. </para>

            <para>- There is harm to the extent that the amendment limits the clause to certain ships. We know that the Australian Squadron is to be supplemented by other of His Majesty&#39;s ships, and that the latter are likely to be of greater tonnage and better fighting capacity than our own. The ships of His Majesty will be placed on the Australian station, and it might happen in time of war that they required men whom we were prepared to furnish. The amendment, however, would block the way, and cause a great deal of trouble. No doubt, the difficulty might be got over by transferring a lot of our men from our own -squadron to His Majesty&#39;s ships and replacing them with other men ; but it would be more convenient and better for all parties if, instead of taking that roundabout course, men could be placed directly on board the Imperial vessels. It must be remembered that although these Imperial vessels are not part of our squadron,, they would, equally with the latter, be here for the protection of the Commonwealth and the States. I see no necessity for the amendment. In the naval and military forces there must be unity of action and a system of management more strict than is necessary in ordinary civil life. &#34; Obedience&#34; is a great word amongst soldiers and sailors. There must be one head, and in time of stress and trouble power must be given to act as is deemed necessary in the interests of the community. It is absurd to tie the hands of a Ministry in time of war, and to make it necessary to resort to any roundabout methods must result in the loss of valuable time. </para>

            <para>- The whole discussion is based on the presumption that the Australian Fleet may be and will be called to serve anywhere out of Australian waters. &#60; Why do we require a Defence Force, if not to defend our own shores ? We do not require a fleet to fight Great Britain&#39;s battles in China, Japan, or anywhere else, but to defend Australia. If this clause be allowed to pass as drafted, it will prejudice our chance of getting volunteers. Young fellows may object to join because they will never know when they may be drafted into the British Navy, and, while willing to serve Australia, they would object to such a transfer. From an Australian point of view, the amendment is not only desirable, but absolutely necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> asks, in a very doubting fashion, whether it is likely any Government would be so foolish us to do that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> fears. But we have known Governments to do very foolish things in the past, and it is not at all likely that the Governments of the future will be any wiser, or less under the malign influence of certain individuals whom I shall not name. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> remarks are the strongest possible argument in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment. To <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> the fear felt by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> seems so outrageous that he cannot conceive the possibility of its being realized. But we desire to prevent its realization, and to make it clear that our fleet is a purely Australian Fleet, raised to defend the shores of Australia. </para>

            <para>- We know that a Government can always be turned out, but my experience of Parliament shows me that, however much the action of a Government of which one is a follower is disapproved, members prefer to condone the offence rather than dismiss the Administration. Except on the very rarest occasions, the Prime Minister is the master of the situation, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, Parliament feels itself bound to support&#34; his action. I trust that honorable senators will show their patriotism by voting for the amendment. We want a naval force and a land force which will be of some service to us, and we ought to give every encouragement to our young men to join both. But&#39; if there be the continual fear of being drafted without any notice or chance of* remonstrance into the British Navy, the number of volunteers will be limited. </para>

It does not say that if for the purpose of the defence of Australia the Australian Squadron should require to go to the north of New Guinea the Australian seamen must be unshipped. It says that wherever the Australian Squadron may go the Australian seamen shall go, too. We contend that our seamen should be put on the vessels of the Australian Squadron, and not into any vessels which might come here, perhaps, for the purpose of refitting, and which might not be intended for the defence of Australia at all. </para>

But if the Houses of Parliament of the State are not in session at the time when the vacancy is notified, the Governor of the State, with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, may appoint a person to hold the place until the expiration of fourteen days after the beginning of the next session of the Parliament of the State, or until the election of a successor whichever first happens. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> is not re-sworn, I venture to say that we may find that those Acts with regard to which he has voted may be challenged.

            <para>- I would suggest that under the circumstances the Senate would be much indebted to the President of the Senate if he would make a statement in regard to the facts of the case. It appears to me, from the information which I have at the present time, that the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> is unimpeachable. Under section 15 of the Constitution he was chosen by the Western Australian Parliament as a senator on the- 29th July. Previously to that he had been appointed by the Governor of the State, and his appointment lasted .until July 30th. But he never ceased to be a senator.  His  election by the Parliament of Western Australia took place one day before the term for which he was appointed by the Governor of the State expired. It is perfectly clear to me that under section 15 of the Constitution <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> is. a senator by the fact that he has been chosen ; and the circumstances of the notification to the Senate have nothing at all to do. with the matter. It is true that the notification was not made until the 5th August, but the actual choice by the Western Australia Parliament took place on the 29th July. </para>

            <para>- That was what I felt to be the difficulty. I suppose that in &#34;the days, which some honorable senators may look back to with regret, when very refined pleading was the rule and justice the Exception, an argument of that kind would be considered quite effective and conclusive; and it is only in later days when we try to take somewhat broader views upon these subjects that not the words only but the substance is considered to be important. As a matter of .fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was elected by the Western Australia Parliament, and therefore his nomination by the State Governor was con&#34;tinued. Those who wish to go to the substance rather than to the form might say that the continuance was the substance and not the method in which it was insured. But I take even a broader view than that; and that view I -wish to submit to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> The only oath that has to be taken is the oath of allegiance to the King. </para>

            <para>- I know that the honorable senator dreads the idea of meeting the King, because he says himself that he would get under His Majesty&#39;s influence so completely that he would never be able to call his soul his own afterwards. But the point I wish to submit to the Chairman is this. There is no doubt that under our Constitution and under all the Constitution Acts of the States, there is a provision requiring Members of Parliament to be sworn. They have to take the oath of allegiance. We have a new Constitution to interpret. We look to it, and see whether it requires us to take the oath of allegiance constantly. There is nothing clearer than this - that once a man is a British subject he is always a British subject. He never can escape his British citizenship. He may be subject to the laws of another country ; he may, as we may say, be hanged in England and executed somewhere else, under different laws; but he never ceases his responsibility to the Throne of England, and his liability for treason that comes from the fact of his being a British subject. We have to interpret our Constitution in a reasonable way. First of all there are qualifications affecting persons who can be Members of Parliament ; and those persons, if elected, before they take their seats, have to take the oath of allegiance. What I submit to you, sir, is that the oath is taken once for all, and that once a person has taken it he never need in his life-time take it again. He cannot escape from all the responsibilities attaching to taking it. He is a British subject and liable to the laws of Great Britain. He can never avoid the situation hereafter by anything that may occur. </para>

            <para>- What is the use of making a man take the oath again after he has sworn once? Having sworn he is bound so long as his life lasts. In my opinion the Constitution should be read so that&#39; the provision that a senator must take the oath before he takes his seat should be construed to mean &#34;If he has not already taken the oath of allegiance.&#34; He has to take the oath once. </para>

            <para>- That is because we are in the habit of doing it. It is a fashion of Parliament ; a usage we have been following. But my submission to the Chairman is that when once a man has taken the oath, he has taken it for all time, and that the section means that a person who has not previously taken the oath of allegiance has to do so. On those grounds - though I express more doubt about the first point - I speak with confidence in roy own opinion, when I say that one is bound when once he takes the oath of allegiance, and that taking it over again is merely going through a form. I know that it may be said that there have been cases in England in the House of Lords, in which the same difficulty has arisen ; and the British Parliament .has actually passed legislation for the purpose of curing defects of this description. I submit, however, that we can create precedents for ourselves, particularly with respect to questions of this description. At all events, I submit gravely to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> need not be sworn again. He has taken the oath of allegiance. He is a British subject, and that carries with it all the responsibilities of a British subject from which only death can release him. To insist upon the honorable senator going through the same oath of allegiance again is to insist upon his going through an empty form, and we ought to be ashamed to do that. </para>

            <para>- I am not referring to that at the present time. I cannot see the force of the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> and I am sorry to have to differ from the honorable and learned senator. I have taken the oath of allegiance several times, and will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#39;Downer</inline> tell me that it was but a farce for me to take it more than once ? I took the oath when I went into the Legislative Council of South Australia; again when I was sworn in as a J.P., and also when I came here. I do not see how the I repetition of the oath of allegiance can be called a farce. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> haspointed out, a difficulty has arisen owing to a set of circumstances to which it is right we should pay some little attention in connexion with the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders^</inline> and the administration of the oath to that honorable senator. Honorable senators will acknowledge that no member of the Senate has any personal grievance against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders.</inline> The intention is that the validity of no legislation passed here, in which the honorable senator has taken apart, shall be disputed in future. I hope that a decision will be given upon the point of order by the Chairman, and, if necessary, by the President, that will set the question at rest for ever. </para>

            <para>- I submit that the question raised involves a great deal more than the swearing of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders.</inline> It is a question which will be raised again possibly at the commencement of next session, when half the members of the Senate will be new, though a large number of the present senators may be re-elected. I presume that they will be declared elected before the 3 1st December, and consequently their continuance of office will be exactly identical with the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders,</inline> the first appointment extending beyond the starting point of the second. I submitthat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer&#39;s</inline> arguments are largely beside the question. If the honorable and learned senator holds the views which he has submitted to influence the decision upon this point of order, he should have properly enunciated them not now, but before the Heir Apparent to the Throne, when in his presence the honorable and learned senator took the oath which he describes now as a farce. We need only look at the honorable and learned senator to know that he is a British subject, and I am sure he must have been sworn many times. </para>

            <para>- Never. Before a vacancy had been created it was filled np, and by the same person. The honorable senator has continuously held the position -of a senator from the time he took his seat and took the oath of allegiance until today. To ask him to take another oath of allegiance, when he has never ceased to be a senator, would be something like a farce. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> in imagining that once a man has taken the auth of allegiance he is bound for ever. I expect that should I stand again, and be re-elected to the Senate three years hence, I shall have to take the oath of allegiance again, and others will have to do the same, because it is the law of the land. However, in the present case it appears to be quite plain that the common-sense view of the position is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders,</inline> having taken the oath of allegiance and having continued to be a senator all the time without a break, there is now not the slightest reason why he should take another oath of allegiance. </para>

            <para>- I should like to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> upon having, for once in- his life, cut himself away from precedent and legal forms and ceremonies, and taken what I believe to be a commonsense view of this question. I quite agree with what the honorable and learned -senator has said. I think that this continuous taking of the oath of allegiance is neither more nor less than a farce. Is the loyalty of honorable senators to the Throne of England of such a feeble character that it requires to be continually refreshed by the conning of the oath of allegiance over and over again ? If that is how some honorable senators feel, it is not how I feel. Having once taken the oath of allegiance to the King or Queen, I am bound by that oath, and I cannot, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> has very properly pointed out, escape from its consequences while I remain a British subject. What, then, is the use of taking it time after time ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has told us that he took the oath when he was elected a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, and again when he was appointed a J.P. Why should the honorable senator have taken it then? Had there been a change of Sovereign ? I think, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> that we ought to be guided by common sense in these matters ? </para>

            <para>- What earthly virtue is there in taking this oath of allegiance % Does it bind a man any more than he would otherwise be bound? He is just as much bound to be loyal to his country and King if he does not take the oath as if he does take it. A witness coming before a court may be prosecuted for perjury whether he takes the oath or does not take it. It may strengthen some people who feel that their allegiance is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> little shaky to take this oath of allegiance over and over again, just as I believe the practice of kissing the book has an effect upon some ignorant witnesses when they, appear before a court of justice. Superstition has a certain hold upon the minds of some men, but I am thankful to say that it has very little hold upon mine. These forms and ceremonies are absolutely meaningless so far as I am concerned. With regard to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders,</inline> I really do not know what prompted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> to bring this matter up. Is it that the honorable senator has become suddenly very much concerned about the Constitution <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It appears to me that the honorable senator&#39;s purpose was more than anything else to waste valuable time that might otherwise be very well used in passing a law to provide for the defence of our Constitution and country Does the honorable senator desire to dispossess <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> of his seat ? That honorable senator has been duly elected, according to form, and lias taken the oath . of allegiance, and whether he has or not I am prepared to vote that he should continue to sit here as an honorable senator. </para>

The writs would be returned before the next sitting of Parliament, and, consequently, such a senator as I have described would come to the Chamber as one who was continuously a senator.

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> contends that the words &#34;after his election and,&#34; should be read after the word &#34;sholl,&#34; in section 42, it is quite competent for others to contend that there should also be read in the words &#34; at the commencement of every session,&#34; or &#34;at the commencement of every sitting.&#34; According to the statement of facts made by the Minster there has been no break in the occupancy of the seat by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders.</inline></para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline>was appointed by the Governor of Western Australia to hold the position vacated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> until the expiration of fourteen days after the beginning of the next session of its Parliament. The point might be taken that the State Parliament had no right to elect a successor to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> until the expiration of fourteen days after its next meeting; but thirteen days after its next meeting the Houses proceeded to make a selection. I do not attach so much import- *ance to that point as to this one : that the certificate of the Governor-General was, to all intents and purposes, a writ, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> could not take his place until it had been received by the President. Suppose that the Houses .of the State Parliament, sitting and voting together, had decided that another gentleman should fill the place of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing,</inline> would he have been able to come to the Senate and take his place upon the receipt of the telegram which was sent to the President? T venture to say that it would not have been permitted. The  President  refused - and quite rightly, too - to take the telegram as a sufficient certificate for the return&#39; of a senator, because otherwise, any person might send along a telegram. If we imagine a case of the kind 1 have suggested, we get a clearer idea of the point which has been taken in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders.</inline> Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson</inline> had been selected by the State Parliament in place of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders.</inline> On what date would he have been entitled to take his place <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Would, he have been entitled to take his place on the 30th July ? Undoubtedly he could not have taken his seat until the 5th August - the day on which the President received the certificate from the Governor-General. Between the 29th July, when he was selected by the State Parliament, and the 5 th August, when the President received the certificate from the Governor-General, there was an interval during which we could not officially accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> as a member of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> contrary to all our experience of him, has declared that all this kind of thing is a mere form and technicality which should be brushed aside. Most of us who sit in this corner might be expected to agree with him, but I do not take the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who finds himself in perfect accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> on this question. I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> experience in a lawyer&#39;s office has made him tired of legal forms and technicalities.

            <para>- It is a strange thing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> should wish to set aside the provisions of the Constitution which are clear. I am sure that if we come to mere words he will recognise that section 15 states that the Governor in Council of the State shall appoint a person to fill the place vacated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was appointed in the first place and elected in the second place. Section &#39; 42 of the Constitution says that after his election each senator shall take the oath of allegiance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> has urged that once a senator has subscribed the oath of allegiance it will do for all time. But he knows very well that such a contention would not hold water for an instant in a court of law. </para>

            <para>- What I should have said was that that opinion would not hold water. Several of us who sit in this corner took the oath of allegiance when we were elected to the Parliament of Queensland, and again when we were appointed to the commission of the peace. While, to all intents and purposes, the one oath might do it was easier for me to take the oath of allegiance in the magistrate&#39;s office than to put him to the trouble of finding out whether I had taken the oath of allegiance in the Legislative Assembly. </para>

            <para>- Does not the honorable and learned senator see that there was an interval between the 29th July, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was elected by the State Parliament, and the 5th August, when the President read to the Senate a certificate of his election from the Governor-General ? To show that matters of this kind are not considered to be mere frivolity elsewhere, I shall quote from the 10th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May&#39;s Parliamentary Practice,</inline> page 164, the following passage : - </para>
          </talk.start>
        </interjection>
        <para> By the 30 Chas. II., stat. 2, 13 Will, III., c.. 6, and 1, Geo. I., Stat. 2, c. 13, severe penalties and disabilities were inflicted upon any member of either House who sat or voted without having taken the oaths. By the 29 and 30 Vict. , c. 1 9, any peer voting by himself or his proxy or sitting in the House of Peers without having taken the oath is subject for every such offence to a penalty of &#163;500 ; and any member of the House of Commons who votes as such or sits during any debate after the Speaker has been chosen without having taken the oath, is subject to the same penalty, and his seat is also vacated in the same manner as if he were dead. When members have neglected to take the oath from haste, accident, or inadvertence, it has been usual to pass Acts of indemnity to relieve them from the consequences of their neglect. In the Commons, however, it is necessary to move a new writ immediately the omission is discovered, as the member&#39;s seat is vacated. </para>
        <para class="block">There is an easy way out of this difficulty, and that is to allow the honorable senator to be re-sworn. It would not take five minutes to administer the oath, and the provisions of the Constitution would be upheld. </para>

            <para>- I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> recognises that this question is being discussed without any personal reference to himself. It is important, sir, that you should give a ruling which will stand the test of time, because this is not the only occasion on which the point is likely to arise. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> has not been properly sworn, and he has voted on any measure which has been passed, it may be possible to take the point that the law is not valid. If it can be taken, the matter is not quite so simple as it has been put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline></para>

            <para>- On the occasion when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was elected by the Parliament of Western Australia he was not sworn in as provided by section 42 of the Constitution. The question to be decided is whether there was not a technical vacancy between the two dates. There is no doubt that there would have been a technical vacancy had some one else been elected instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders.</inline> Everybody will agree to that. Suppose that some other gentleman had been elected by the State Parliament. There would then have been a vacancy. If that be the case, there was a technical vacancy, although the same person happened to be elected by the State Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the lapsing of the appointment made by the State Governor. The State Governor appointed him to fill the seat until fourteen days after the sitting of the State Parliament. At the expiration of the fourteen days there was a vacancy, which had to be filled. It was filled. It so happens that, in this case, the gentleman appointed by the State Governor was elected by the Parliament. But we can easily suppose a case in which the State Parliament would not confirm the appointment of the State Governor. In that case there would be a technical vacancy. If that be so, is it not plain that section 42, which says that before any senator takes his seat he shall subscribe the path, applies to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> after his election by the State Parliament ? </para>

            <para>- Those who contend that a senator does not need to take the oath when he is re-elected are perfectly logical in arguing that he need not take the oath after election by a State Parliament subsequent to his nomination by the State Governor. But there is no logic in the contention of those honorable senators who urge that it was unnecessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> to take the oath on the second occasion, though it will be necessary for him to take the oath if he is re-elected in November next. That is the way in which the question appeals to me. With reference to what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I may point out that we are not discussing the value of the oath. The oath is provided for by the Constitution. The question for us to determine is when it shall be taken, and whether it should be taken again by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders.</inline></para>

            <para>- I wish to commence by stating that I do not know much about the fine legal subtleties which to a large extent are involved in the question under discussion. But at the same time I cannot help remarking upon the easy and graceful way in which a number of the legal senators have brushed away the difficulties that confront them, and how easy they find it to say that we must not take a strict legal reading of the Constitution, but the &#34; broad common-sense view.&#34; I like that term - &#34; the broad common-sense view.&#34; But I always find it difficult to understand who is to say which is the &#34;broad commonsense view.&#34; We often find one &#34;broad common-sense view&#34; coming into conflict with another &#34;broad common-sense view.&#34; To my mind the whole question that has to be determined by the Chairman is this : Was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> properly elected to the Senate; and, if he was properly elected, is he properly holding his place in the Senate ; and is he authorized by what has transpired to take part in the proceedings on exactly the same footing as other honorable senators? In the strict legal interpretation of the Constitution, apart altogether from the &#34; broad common-sense view,&#34; I want to know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> is entitled to speak and vote here until he has conformed to all the formalities to which other senators have had to conform? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> endeavoured to lay it down that a senator if elected at one particular time and re-elected before his term of office expired was therefore continuously a senator, and that there was no need for his being re-sworn. That is to say, he argues that there has never been a vacancy. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> the bush lawyer of this Chamber, says that that is not so, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who is one of the legal lights of Tasmania, agrees that that is what he has been arguing : that if there is no necessity for an out-going senator, who is reelected, to be re-sworn, there is no necessity for a senator to be re-sworn on his election after having been nominated by a State Government. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> were retained in a court of law, he would argue that it was not what Parliament meant, but what Parliament has expressely said, that the Bench should take notice of. I should like to remark here, that laymen in Parliament ought to be particularly careful about taking, without question, a legal opinion that is given by a legal gentleman on the floor of the Senate. It is necessary to take such opinions with a very large grain of salt. My experience amongst some of the most eminent of the members of the legal profession has been that their legal opinions given gratis on the floor of a House of Parliament are not worth anything. In fact, it is dangerous to accept them. I do not exempt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> from that general rule. In fact, I have a recollection that the honorable and learned senator, on an occasion during the sittings of this Senate, has given a legal opinion on the floor of this Chamber which he was not prepared to sustain outside. </para>

I warn laymen that they should take very carefully any legal opinion, as a legal opinion, that is given free on the floor of the Chamber, as being unreliable ; and I do not exempt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> from that rule by any manner of means. These legal opinions are not worth the paper they are printed on. As a matter of simple fact, though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says that he cannot find anything in the Constitution making it an obligation on the part of senators who are retiring at the end of this session to take the oath if re-elected, we have expressly provided in our Standing Orders that they shall be re-sworn ; and it is not until they are re-sworn that we can proceed to the election of a President of the Senate. I direct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> attention to Standing Order 2, where we have expressly made that provision. And is it not an abrogation of parliamentary practice throughout the whole of the British Dominions to say that the re-election of a Parliament, or of a member of a Parliament, does not involve being re-sworn ? </para>

Those Standing Orders make special provision that a reelected senator shall be re-sworn. </para>

            <para>- Before these Standing Orders caine into operation on Tuesday last we had adopted temporarily the Standing Orders of the South Australian House of Assembly, and I would ask whether it is not the rule in that House that a man shall be resworn upon re-election before he is entitled to speak and vote ? There is no Parliament in the British Dominions in which a re-election does not involve a re-subscribing of the oath before the member re-elected is allowed to speak or cast a vote. The Standing Orders which we adopted, and which came into force on the 1st September, are more explicit and clear on this point than are the Standing Orders we temporarily adopted, but there is no mistaking the terms of the Standing Orders under which we conducted our business up to last Tuesday. I refer honorable members to Standing Order 6 of the South Australian House of Assembly. </para>

            <para>- I should like to know whether it was eliminated for the purpose of avoiding the re-swearing of an honorable senator who has been re-elected ? When the Chairman gives his ruling I shall be glad to learn whether he knows of the existence of any Parliament throughout the British Dominions in which, upon re-election, a member is not called upon to re-subscribe the oath ? There is another point to which I should like to direct attention. What is an election? Surely it presupposes a vacancy ? If there be no vacancy how can there be an election ? The Minister for Defence, I believe, first pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was continuously a member of the Senate from the time he wm appointed by the Governor of Western Australia, and beyond the date upon which he was elected, the 29th July. If the honorable senator was appointed and continued to be a senator up to the 30th July, and there was no vacancy, how could he be elected to fill a vacancy on the 29th July ? </para>

I do not think that from a common-sense point of view, let alone a legal point of view, it can be said that there was no break between the 30th July and the 5th August. </para>

            <para>- That was the first time on which we had a notification from the Governor of Western Australia that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> had been elected by the Parliament of Western Australia to represent that State in this Chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was appointed, and his appointment held good until the 30th July. On that date his appointment ceased ; and the next notification we have is that the vacancy created by the expiration of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> has been filled by the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders.</inline> But there is a break between the 30th July and the 5th August, when the latter announcement was made. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> pointed out, supposing, after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders&#34;</inline> appointment had ceased to have legal effect, the Parliament of Western Australia had chosen a man named Jones ; will it be contended for a single instant that the election of Jones could have been held to be a continuous election to the Senate to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing,</inline> and that the subscribing of the oath by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saundersupon</inline> his appointment, carried with it the subscribing of the oath by the person named Jones, upon his election <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely not <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> who came into this Chamber as the senator chosen by the Parliament of Western Australia, he would have had te take the oath of allegiance before he would have been entitled to take any part in our proceedings. These matters require very careful consideration. I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> thinks about this discussion, but I wish before I resume my seat to assure the honorable senator that there is no personal antagonism towards him. But the question is a rather important &#39;one, and while raised at this particular juncture it happens to affect Senator Saunders, it might hereafter affect other members of the Senate. It is therefore as well that the subject should be thoroughly thrashed out, and that, a definite understanding should be come to. </para>

            <para>- I can hardly conceive that it is light that this discussion should be raised in the middle of a debate upon a Bill. It appears to me to be out of place and incongruous as a part of the proceedings upon the Defence Bill. But I let that go by. I am surprised that my friends in the Labour corner should be so very punctilious over little matters of this kind. They make a mountain of difficulty out of the finest and most delicate points of order. This question is simple enough. Senator Saunders took his seat and took the oath of allegiance ; but, before the time when his right to continue a member of the Senate under his appointment expired, he was spliced to himself by being elected. There was no interregnum at all. It consequently appears to me to be very frivolous indeed, to waste words upon a matter like this. We have surely very little to do. There can be no wonder if honorable senators vacate their seats when they may well become tired of sitting here listening while these miserable distinctions are drawn. I hope the matter will be dealt with once and for all and that we shall get to business again. </para>

            <para>- Nearly every honorable senator who has addressed himself to the point of order has made it absolutely clear that no personal feeling animates this, discussion. So far as I am concerned,. </para>

        <para class="block">I look at the question which has been raised from a legal stand-point only. I feel that I am justified in saying that every honorable senator desires that it shall be discussed in that way. I was anxious, if it were possible, to avoid being called on, in accordance with decisions of Speakers of the House of Commons, to construe an Act of Parliament, but as the point of order has raised incidentally a question as to the validity of a vote upon division, I am now called upon to give a decision. The question involved is a difficult one. I shall first of all shortly state the facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing&#39;s</inline> term of office would have expired in the ordinary course on the 31st December next.. Pursuant to the terms of the Constitution, the honorable* senator resigned his seat, and his place, adopting the words of the Act, became vacant &#34; before the expiration of his term of service.&#34; Upon the resignation taking place, as I understand, the President duly notified the Governor of the State of Western Australia of the vacancy, and on the 20th May, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was appointed by the Governor-in-Council of that State. The Western Australian Parliament met on the 16th July, and on the 29th July chose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders.</inline> On the 5th August the President notified the Senate of the fact by reading the following letter addressed to him by the Governor-General, and &#39;dated 3rd August, 1903 : - </para>

          <para>I have the honour to inform you that I am in receipt of advice by telegram from His Excellency the Governor of Western Australia that Henry John Saunders has been chosen by a joint sitting of both Houses of the Western Australian Parliament to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Norman Kirkwood Ewing. The Governor of Western Australia also intimates that the selection of Henry John Saunders will be confirmed by letter. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I assume for present purposes that the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was July certified by the Governor of the State to the Governor-General. I have no official information of that, but it is not doubted, and for present purposes we may assume. that the certificate duly caine to hand, although we have not been formally notified of the fact. I think that under these circumstances I should look at the Constitution to see whether, in my judgment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was capable of recording his vote. Section &#93; 5 of the Constitution says : - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>If the place of a senator becomes vacant before the expiration of his term of service, the Houses Of Parliament for the State for which he was chosen shall, sitting and voting together, choose a person to hold the place until the expiration of the term, or until the election of a successor as hereinafter provided, whichever first happens. But if the Houses of Parliament of the State are not in session at the time when the vacancy is notified, the Governor of the State, with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, may appoint a person to hold the place until the expiration of fourteen days after the beginning of the next session of the Parliament of the State, or until the election of a successor whichever first happens. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I think that the second portion of the section beginning with the words, &#34; But if the Houses of Parliament of the State are not in session &#34; - where it is determined that, under those circumstances, the Governor in Council shall appoint - means a mere temporary expedient or stop-gap, so that the State shall not, if the Federal Parliament is sitting, be deprived of complete representation. I regard that appointment as completely subsidiary to the all-important appointment referred to in the first portion of the section, which is the governing portion, and declares that, in order that the representation shall continue until the end of the term, the State Parliament shall appoint. Although the section says that the appointment by the State Governor shall have validity until the expiration of fourteen days after the beginning of the next session of the State Parliament I am disposed to the view that immediately the State Parliament makes the choice in the terms of the section the term of the first appointment comes to an end. This period of fourteen days had, it appears, as a matter of fact, not expired at the time the State Parliament made the choice. But suppose that the period had expired - that two, three, or a dozen days had elapsed in the meantime - the question then is - would it have been necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> to have taken the oath, or can any distinction be drawn by reason of the fact that the choice of the State Parliament took place before the expiration of the fourteen . days ? With a vacancy existing, I am of opinion that as soon as the State Parliament chose somebody to take the place of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing,</inline> that was a new election by a different constituent, which had to be recognised by this Senate. In my opinion there is a complete analogy between this matter and the ordinary machinery of the statute, which provides that senators shall hold office until the 31st December prior to which the new senators shall be elected. I have no hesitation whatever in coming to the conclusion that a vacancy does occur on the 31st December, 1903. That is declared by the Constitution itself, and I am now arguing by way of analogy. Section 13 of &#39;the Constitution clearly declares - ....... and the places of the senators of the first class shall become vacant at the expiration of the third year. </para>
        <para>Subsequently the section .goes on to say - </para>

          <para>For the purposes q&#163; this section the term of service of a senator shall be taken to begin on the 1st day of January following the day of his election. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>In my opinion, therefore, it is absolutely clear that in the terms of the Constitution, a vacancy does occur on the 31st December, and, consequently under section 42 of the Constitution, it is necessary for each senator who is re-elected to take the oath. The section is as follows - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Every senator and every member of the House of Representatives shall, before taking his seat, make and subscribe before the Governor-General or some other person authorised by him, an oath or affirmation of allegiance in the form set forth in the schedule to this Constitution. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Consequently I think that it is necessary under the circumstances for every senator, after his re-election, a vacancy having been created, to take the oath in&#39; the same way as when he was first elected to the Senate. It has been stated that apparently no interregnum takes place- - that there is no interval of time - but the Constitution declares that a vacancy does occur in the meanwhile ; and, in my opinion, that is the fact in this case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders,</inline> did, 1 believe, take the oath when appointed by the Governor in Council, and he was, at most, able to retain his seat for fourteen days after the assembling of the State Parliament, viz. : during the currency of that appointment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> or anybody else might have been subsequently appointed by the State Parliament : and &#91; do not regard the temporary expedient or stop-gap as a choice which we are to recognise after the 30th July. When we were notified by the State Parliament of the election it was, in my opinion, necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> to again take the oath. The Standing Orders with which I have fully prepared myself are most conclusive as to what it is necessary to do after a periodical or general election. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> of standing order 2 is as follows : - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The writ of election of each senator elected since the last sitting of the Senate, with the return indorsed thereon, having been previously&#34; delivered to the Clerk, shall by him be laid upon, the Table, and each senator may then make and subscribe the oath or affirmation of allegiance in the form set forth in the schedule to the Constitution. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Consequently, I feel myself forced <inline font-style="italic">to theconclusion</inline> that it was necessary for Senator Saunders to take the oath after he had been duly elected by the State Parliament ; and under those circumstances I think that the honorable senator&#39;s vote in this particular- division should be disallowed. </para>

            <para>- I shall make . my remarks exceedingly brief. I agree with a great deal of what the Chairman has said. There is no doubt that the appointment by the State Governor is merely an interim appointment, in order to preserve the continuity of the senatorship, and secure that the State shall always be represented. The substantial and ultimate act - although it- has effect only until the next general elections - is the act of the Legislature. But when that act is performed - and this is what I suggested to the Chairman himself - the person appointed remains a senator. </para>

            <para>- That remark shows the hyper-criticism of special pleaders who are not lawyers. The point is that the person selected is made a senator, and it does not matter how he is elected. He is made a senator and he continues a senator until Parliament exercises its discretion. He retains his position truly enough by another election, but he never ceases to be a senator. There never was a moment during the. period of his senatorship that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> could not have exercised his vote. Can one conceive a more hyper-technical view than that because the method of election has been altered the fact of the election has changed? The point I take is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was elected a senator and remains a senator up to the present time. We have bo right to inquire as to how he was elected ; he has never ceased to be a senator, and he has taken .an oath which continues. I also add in my written reasons the point which I raised previously, but which, perhaps, it will not be necessary to decide. </para>

          <para>- This is a matter in which I have to express an opinion as to whether the ruling of the Chairman of Committees is right, and I approach the task with the gravest sense of the responsibility of the situation. I have to differ from the ruling of the Chairman of Committees, and I do so with regret, because I fully recognise that the honorable senator brings a great deal of ability to his duties, and that, if he has been incorrect in his ruling, the matter was undoubtedly one of the gravest difficulty. I do not intend to travel beyond the immediate question under consideration, and that is : Ought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> to have taken the oath of allegiance twice or once ? Our Constitution is fundamentally different in a great many points from any of the Constitutions with which we have been acquainted. One of the fundamental differences is that no State shall be at any time unrepresented or partially represented in the Senate. The proposition is laid down that elections for senators shall take place before there are any vacancies,, so that there shall always be a continuity, as far as possible, of six senators to represent each State. If that fundamental difference exists between our Constitution and those to which we have been accustomed, it cannot be wondered at that different results may accrue. There is no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> has not ceased&#39; to be a senator from the time when he was nominated by the Government of Western Australia until the present moment. There is equally no doubt that he took his seat some time after the nomination by the State Government, and before being chosen by the State Parliament, and that he has continued to occupy that seat. Not having ceased to sit, where is the necessity for him to take the oath of allegiance again ? Section 42 of the Constitution Act provides-, that no senator shall take his seat until at fter he has taken the oath of allegiance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> took the oath of allegiance before he took his seat, and he has continued&#39; to occupy that seat ever since. Could he have been stopped at any time from speaking on the ground that his seat had become vacant ? He has continued to occupy his seat ; it has never become vacant. </para>

            <para>- No ; but the conclusion at which I arrive from that consideration is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> did take* the oath of allegiance before he took his seat, and that there has been no break of continuity in the occupation of the seat. I must ask honorable senators to draw a distinction between two things which may be mixed up, and that is between the election of a senator and the taking of a seat in the Senate. A man becomes a senator, not because he has taken an oath, not because the Governor-General has sent a certificate of his election, but because he has been elected. It may be that there are some preliminary requirements to be observed before he can take his seat and vote ; but still he&#39; is a senator for the term of&#34; his election, and the prohibition in section 42 of the Constitution Act is against his taking his seat until after he has taken the oath of allegiance. What would be the result if a senator were to take his seat before he had gone through those necessary preliminaries <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> He would simply be liable to pecuniary penalties ; it would not invalidate any of our proceedings. It is; expressly set out in section 46 of the Constitution Act that if a senator takes his seat, and votes and acts as a senator, without undergoing and conforming with the necessary preliminaries, he shall become liable to pecuniary penalties. In considering this question we must put aside any consideration as to any grave consequences which may follow. The only consequences which can follow, if I am wrong in my interpretation of the Constitution, is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> will be liable to pecuniary penalties. That analogy is borne out in the British Parliament, where the possibility is contemplated of members taking their seats and voting before they take the oath of allegiance. They are, in such cases, subject to pecuniary penalties. It does not invalidate their votes or the proceedings of the House. It may be that there would be a distinction after a periodical election. If honorable senators will look ar section 13 of the Constitution Act they will see that possibly I do not express any opinion about that - &#34;there may be an interregnum - a vacancy when half the Senate retires. But that certainly has not happened and cannot happen here. There are two possible methods of interpreting the Constitution. First, there is the merely technical construction of the words. If we apply that method, there is absolutely nothing in the words of the Constitution which provide that a senator need take the oath of allegiance more than once. Having once taken the oath of allegiance, then, according to the strict wording of the Constitution, he can take his seat at any time; there is absolutely no prohibition to the contrary. But the proper method of interpretation is to consider the spirit and the intention of the Constitution. Looking at sections 15, 42, and 46, I cannot arrive at the conclusion that it was ever intended that a senator should be obliged to take the oath of allegiance twice over in the circumstances under consideration. In the circumstances of this particular case it is perhaps very difficult to interpret section 15, and we can only arrive by implication at the power of a State Parliament to choose a senator after he has been nominated by the Governor of the State. No express power is given, and it is only a necessary implication from the wording of the Act. If we must resort to necessary implication on so important a question as that,, it is undoubted that we can resort to necessary implication in deciding whether or not a senator should be obliged to take the oath of allegiance twice. </para>

            <para>- Yes, in anticipation. All the periodical elections are held in anticipation of vacancies to occur. The spirit of the Constitution, so far as senators is concerned, is that no State shall be unrepresented by six senators, and, therefore the elections take place in anticipation of the vacancies to occur. The fact that the certificate of the Governor-General did not reach the Senate until the 5th August does not appear to me to have any bearing on the question, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> had taken the oath of allegiance and continued to be a senator, and if His Excellency, in consequence of the necessary course of post, and the distance from Western Australia, had not given that certificate for some considerable time after the election had taken place, I do not see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> can be prejudiced, or that, in consequence of the difficulty arising from distance, he was obliged to take the oath of allegiance again. . The matter we have to decide is : Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> vote ? Suppose that he had not taken the oath of allegiance, and that he did not vote, what would be the result? He would be liable to pecuniary penalties. But can we say that being a senator, and sitting here illegally - under the supposition which I am now arguing - we can deprive him of his vote <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The oath of allegiance which he has taken is not abrogated, or dissipated, or invalidated by any lapse of time ; and therefore I think he is entitled to vote. </para>

Under the Bill, as introduced in another place, the military forces were at all times and on any service subject to the Army Act. I believe it is found in all the States that the existing Defence Act3 do not go far enough, and it was thought necessary to supplement them by the British Army Act, quite apart from the King&#39;s regulations.. The Bill in this respect has been materially amended, and the clause as it now stands only brings the military forces under the operation of the Army Act while they are on active service. A gap has been created, and no attempt has been made to fill it. If the Army Act was necessary for the control of the forces during peacetime, when the Bill was introduced, and if that control has been knocked out, something ought to be provided to fill the space- </para>

          <para>- The honorable senator is perfectly right in saying that when the Bill was introduced into another place the Army Act was made applicable to our Defence Forces. Very strong objection was taken to that, and it was ultimately decided that the Army Act should apply to our Defence Forces only when they were on active service. It is believed that the regulations will be sufficient, for the management of the troops when not. on active service. </para>

          <para>- I have two amendments to propose in this clause. Provision is made as to the families of those who are killed on active service, or who become incapacitated from earning their living from wounds or diseases contracted on active service, but the clause will be incomplete unless after the word &#34; service &#34; we add the words &#34; or on duty.&#34; If the family of a man who is killed on duty receive a pension, then the family of a man who while on duty becomes incapacitated from earning his living should have provision made for them. If it is a proper thing to provide for the family of a man who is killed on duty, it is equally proper to provide for the family of a man who is incapacitated by an accident that happens while he is on duty. The effect upon the family is identically the same whether the man is killed or so injured as to render him incapable of maintaining his family. I know of cases that have occurred. There was, for instance, the deplorable accident that happened in Port Jackson some years ago in connexion with the annual training, when a whole boatload of men was blown up, some of them being blown to eternity. The New South Wales Government is now paying pensions on account of those injuries. Of course active service means service in time of war. But an accident may happen in time of peace to a man who is on military duty. In the manning of forts, or during the periodical practices of batteries, men may be so injured as to be rendered incapable of earning their living and supporting their families. Therefore I think the words &#34;or on duty &#34; ought to be inserted. </para>

            <para>- It is impossible to fix the starting-point of consumption. Who knows when it commences? But I know of cases where men were incapacitated through what occurred while they were on duty. On one occasion during the annual training in New South Wales a few years ago, certain men were ordered out to do certain night duty. Not to put too fine a point upon it, three members of my own regiment died in consequence, and the Government recognised its liability in respect of a colour-sergeant by paying the sum of &#163;23 to his widow for funeral expenses. That man was killed by what I regarded as an improper demand upon him. He was compelled, after a long day&#39;s work, to go without food, and without an overcoat, to do duty in what was practically a swamp on the banks of a creek, in the midst of ti-tree scrub. I buried three members of my regiment over that transaction, and I got into hot water for defending them. I am able to speak of the matter here because it has nothing whatever to do with the Commonwealth or with my present position, and I can mention it without any breach of propriety. </para>

          <para>- This form is, of course, better than the form of the amendment as originally proposed by the honorable senator, but I still think there is some danger that it is too wide. It ought to be made clear that the injuries have resulted from the performance of duty. The clause provides that a certain course shall be taken if a man is killed while on duty, and it is there presumed that it is his duty which takes him into the position of danger. A man might be disabled by injuries which he would have received whether he had been on duty or not. </para>

            <para>- There is. much to bc said in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> contention, and the honorable senator will recognise that while the children will every day be growing older and better able to keep themselves, the unfortunate man who is incapacitated from earning his living will every day be growing more feeble. This provision may be looked upon in the light of an old-age pension. The Senate agreed as to the desirability of making a general provision of that sort only yesterday ; and if it is right that such provision should be made of general application, there is surely greater force in contending that it should apply in the case of a man who has bled for his country, and who in the performance of his duty has been injured in such a way as to become a cripple and helpless for life ? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Col. NEILD.-</inline>I thank the honorable senator for the suggestion. If a soldier who happens to be married is injured the Commonwealth is prepared to make provision for his family ; but if he is a single man he may die in the gutter. He cannot hope to secure the benefit of an old-age pension, because his service in the military forces ceases absolutely when he is sixty years of age, and sixty-five years is the starting point for old-age pensions in the States in which they are paid. I appeal to the Minister for Defence to admit that a man who has bled for his country and has become incapacitated from earning his living, ought not to be left as a human, derelict at the mercy of the world. If the principle of giving anything at all in these cases is admitted, surely the man who has done service to the country, and who has suffered injury, is as much entitled to be assisted as is his family.

          <para>- The contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in favour of some payment being made to a person who may be disabled under the circumstances described is deserving of every consideration.. Whether the man receives injuries while on active service or while qualifying himself for active service, some payment should be made to him. We have had too many well-founded complaints from men who have served the best years of their life in the British Army, who have become incapacitated from earning a living, and who, though they may be given a paltry miserable pension, have been left to die in the workhouses. We do not desire a repetition of that kind of thing in the Commonwealth of Australia. We expect that humane treatment shall be accorded to those who render service to the country. I happen to have a military friend in the gallery who has had large experience in connexion with these matters, and he has reminded me of the fact that upon one occasion two men were shot dead at a rifle butts whilst qualifying for their duty as soldiers. If those men had an aged father or mother, or other relatives entirely dependent upon them for support, would not those people have a claim upon the State ? There is no provision of the kind made in this. clause, or in the amendment, which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline></para>

            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that a man who has received injuries which incapacitate him from earning his living should be supported by the State. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> of the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker,</inline> in Queensland, who was an artillery man, and who lost both his arms whilst engaged in firing a salute. That man was disabled for life, and he managed to get some consideration for a time. After securing artificial arms, he thought he could earn a better livelihood by working for himself, but a time of stress and trouble came when he could no longer work, and with others, I have again and again urged the Government of the day in the Queensland Legislative Assembly to consider his case and give him something substantial. That is a case in point, and I ask whether such men, who have received injuries whilst doing good service to the &#34;State, should be allowed to suffer penury -and misery? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> says that a man must run some risks ; but that is no reason why a man who has received injuries in the way described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> should be left in a condition of destitution and misery in the State which he has served. As a representative in this Chamber, and as a representative in other Chambers previously, I never have been, and I never shall be, a consenting party to such a course. The amendment will undoubtedly have - my support, and it is entitled to the support of every honorable senator who has given any consideration to the subject. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> regards it as undesirable to impose any more charges on the revenue of the country, but it would be paltry to avail ourselves of the services of men, and, when they are disabled, send them to die in the workhouse, or to depend on their relations, cr on the miserable doles served out by the Government. I hope that we shall take a . higher and more humane ground. </para>

          <para>- I question whether it is desirable to leave the exemptions entirely in the hands of Governor-General. In the first Defence Bill which was introduced there was a very ample list of exemptions, and though it might not be desirable to include the whole of these, I think Parliament is in a position to deal with such a matter. It is contemplated that Parliament shall meet within ten days after the proclamation which calls upon persons to enlist in the militia, and, under the circumstances, I am of opinion that Members of Parliament ought to be exempt. </para>

          <para>- This matter has been very carefully considered, and I think it may be left very safely to the Governor-General by proclamation to declare, according to the circumstances of the time, what class of persons should be exempted. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> is proposing now would not be a fair test at all. If the question is put that Members of Parliament shall be exempt, a good many honorable senators will feel that if they vote in the negative it will be to affirm that Members of Parliament should not be exempt from military service. I think it is&#39; much better to leave the clause as it is. The matter has been fully considered and thrashed out. It may be desirable in the proclamation to make the exemptions a great deal wider in some cases than in others. </para>

            <para>- When we come to deal with the exemption of the police, what is likely to be the feeling of the Committee ? I should think that the opinion of the Committee will be that just as in certain circumstances it might be quite right to exe*mpt the police, in other circumstances it might not be desirable to do so. I submit that it is far better to deal with the question by means of a clause of this description. With regard to the conditions which have been referred to, I understand that the intention is that where a man objects, on religious grounds, to fighting, other kinds of work might be prescribed which he would be willing to do. Suppose that a man on religious grounds were to say, &#34; I cannot do any fighting,&#34; and we required every fighting man to be at the front, it would be very reasonable to ask that man to help in attending to the sick and wounded. These are the conditions which would be prescribed. I do not know that any good can result from going through a list of exemptions, especially at this hour, and I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. </para>

          <para>- I would also ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> to withdraw his amendment. If we begin to insert a list of exemptions in the Bill we shall have to start with Members of Parliament and wind up with lunatics. The clause specifies that all men of certain ages are to serve, and if we begin to put in exceptions we shall have to except lunatics. According to the legal aphorism <inline font-style="italic">expressio unius est exclusion alterius</inline> if we expressly exclude certain classes, all other persons must be included, and the Bill provides for the service of all men of certain ages. We must trust to the Ministry of the day to issue a list of exemptions in a regulation which it would be in the power of either House of the Parliament to veto. </para>

            <para>.- On referring to the clause again I find that the honorable senator is quite right. If the word &#34; regulation &#34; were substituted for the word &#34; proclamation,&#34; any regulation would have to come before each House of the Parliament and its opinion could be expressed. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> will withdraw his amendment I shall submit a proposal to that effect. </para>

He merely chose that word as a finishing touch to an interesting speech. The Minister based the whole of his argument on- the idea that the police were proposed to be exempted,, when the words 1 used were &#34; police and. stipendiary magistrate.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I really fail to see why it is better that the Governor-General should, by proclamation, say what persons shall be exempt than that we should frame a list of exemptions, lt seems to me that in all these Bills we are deliberately going out of our way to shirk our responsibility. This is undoubtedly a responsibility which the Parliament should accept, and should not leave to the Governor-General. However, as the feeling of the Committee seems to bo against me, I am perfectly prepared to fall in with the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> because the power of revision would be in our hands. </para>

          <para>- I should like to have the opinion of the Minister for Defence on the question of inserting the words &#34; including members of the Society of Friends&#34; after the word &#34; persons.&#34; There is a very strong feeling in Great Britain, as well as here, that the Society of Friends have shown for hundreds of years the strength of their conviction that it is wrong to take part in a war. It would involve considerable trouble if each person who desired to be exempted had to make a declaration that he was a member of the Society of Friends. If the words I have suggested were inserted, unofficial list of the members of the Society of Friends in each town or city could easily be obtained. </para>

            <para>- I wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that the second part of the clause provides that the burden of proving exemption from service in the Defence Force shall rest on the claimant. It will be just as easy for a person to make a declaration that the doctrines of his religion forbid him to bear arms, as to prove that he is a member of the Society of Friends. My honorable friend will see that it really comes to exactly the same thing, theugh I sympathize with the view which he has expressed. </para>
