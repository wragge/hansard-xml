                            <para>A letter was received from the General Council of Chambers of Commerce of Australia, calling attention to the fact that details of Customs entries, which are deemed an unnecessary revelation of the business of traders, are to be found in journals such as the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Australasian Shipping News</inline> published in Melbourne, and that it has been made possible for those seeking information to obtain at the Customs-house particulars of entries which are usually regarded as the secrets of traders, and asking the Minister to be good enough to promptly take such steps as he might deem necessary to safeguard the interests of traders in respect to the matters referred to. To which the Minister replied that there appears to be considerable difference of opinion on the subject of the advantage or disadvantage of the publications referred to, but that it is recognised by him that there should be no unnecessary disclosure to the public of private papers, unless it is desired by the parties represented. He proposed, therefore, to direct that the details which are objected to, shall not in the Customs-house be made available for publication, unless on the written request of the persons interested, and instructions were issued accordingly. 2. (a) The instructions were issued by direction of the Minister. </para>

If it has been the practice in your State to permit the publication of details of Customs entries, the practice is to be altered in accordance with the above direction as from the 1st September, 1903." </para>

The primary object of passing entries is to secure the payment of revenue, and not to afford information to the public of the business transactions of merchants. The Melbourne Chamber of Commerce recently addressed the Minister especially on this subject, and desired him to refuse such publication even when made at the request of the importer or merchant ; but as above stated, the Minister considered that when the merchant desired it publication might be permitted, but not otherwise. </para>

                <para class="block">My object in moving an amendment in that standing order on a previous occasion was to get the Committee to determine the term of office ; but it deals with two questions, namely, the term of office and the mode of election. It occurred to me that it is desirable to deal with each question in a separate rule. If honorable senators will refer to the list of proposed standing orders which has been circulated, they will see how I propose to carry out that idea. On a previous occasion there was such a large majority in favour of the term for which it was thought that the President should hold office that I ought not to be expected to go into that question again. We had a full-dress debate, and the term which is fixed in Standing Order 17 was decided by a majority of sixteen to six. </para>

If the framers of the section intended that the President should hold office for as long as he was a senator, why was not that idea expressed in clear and unmistakable language? </para>

If we say that the President shall hold his office until the election, it might be said that he should retire when the writs are issued, or when the poll takes place, or when the writs are returned. There is nothing definite about it. I do not propose to go into the constitutional aspect. I shall wait for other honorable senators to raise that point if they desire to do so. </para>

                    <para>- The proposal of the honorable senator raises the whole question of the expediency of fixing the term of the President's occupancy of office at three years instead of the whole term during which he occupies a seat in the Senate, whether it be three years or six. I was not present when the subject was previously discussed, but I have carefully read the whole debate which led to this momentous change being made, and the report of which occupies only some three pages in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I do not intend to discuss whether it is desirable that the term of the President's occupancy of office should be three years or six. My opinion is that it ought to be six years. Although there is a good deal to be said on the other side, the balance of reasons is in favour of the longer term. But I desire particularly to call the attention of the Senate to a question which does not appear to have been alluded to in the previous debate, and which must have escaped the notice of honorable senators. That is as to how this matter affects the present occupant of the chair. Something has been said about the Constitution. It is not easy to say whether the Constitution really deals with the .particular question of whether the President must have a term of office extending during the whole period of his occupancy of a seat in the Senate. Personally, I do not think that the provision of the Constitution is sufficiently definite to bind the Senate one way or the other. But assuming that the Senate is at liberty to elect a President either for six years or for three, it appears to me to be perfectly clear that our present President was elected for six years. The motion which was carried when the President was elected was in these words - </para>

                <para class="block">There is not a word of limitation of any kind, It would have been open for the Senate to phrase the appointment - " That he do take the chair of the Senate until the next periodical election"; or "That he do take the chair foi- one year " ; or " That he do take the chair for this session." It will be remembered that when we elected our Chairman of Committees - although many of us thought that 'he ought to be elected for the whole term of the Parliament, and the first motion for election of the Chairman was framed in that way, it seemed fit to the Senate to give a different tenure. The tenure of office of the Chairman of Committees is expressly limited for a session and a fortnight afterwards. Under these circumstances, even if it is open for the Senate to elect either for the whole term during which the President is a member of the Senate oi' for a lesser term, when we look at the resolution and see that there was no limitation of any kind, but that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> was simply elected  President  of the Senate, how are we now to impose any limitation ? What right has any one to say that, although he was elected  President  of the Senate in that general way, his term of office should cease at the end of three years ? We have no more right to say that than we have to say that the President's term of office shall cease at the end of the session, or at the end of twelve months, or shall be limited to any arbitrary time that may be fixed. </para>

                        <para>- Of course he would have to be re-elected President. When he comes back he is a new senator, and has to be re-sworn. Therefore, I say that, when we elected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> to be  President  of the Senate, that meant, under the Constitution,  President  so long as he remained a senator - that' is, during his term of office as a senator. Therefore, it appears to me that the position is this : We have elected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> for six years, and when that period is half-way through we suddenly pass a standing order which cuts the term down to three years. That is altogether apart from the question whether it is right to give the President a three years' or a six years' term in the chair. What we have done would make it impossible for us, consistently with the preservation of good faith on the part of the Senate, without any notice or any justification whatever, suddenly to cut short the term which we have already given to the present President. </para>

                        <para>- That strengthens my argument. If it was intended that he should hold office for three years, why was no limit placed upon the term?' Why did not we provide that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> should remain President until the- periodical elections ? But that was not done. The fact of the matter is that at that time no one thought of a limitation of the term. No one thought of a periodical election bringing one senator within and placing another without the six years' limit. That is the view which I take of the matter, and, under the circumstances, I see no way by which, legally, the President's term of office could be brought to an end except, under the Constitution, by his ceasing to be a senator, or by means of some special motion removing him from his office. Holding that view strongly, I had determined to test the opinion of the Senate as to whether or not it should reconsider the question, and retrace its steps so far, at least, as the occupancy of the chair by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> was concerned. But naturally I spoke to the  President  about it, and, at his urgent request, I have decided not to take any action. He has told me that even if a considerable minority of the Senate - much more a majority - expressed the view that, in the interests of the Senate, the term of office should be three years, he would not feel disposed to put any personal grounds or reasons of his own in the way of that wish being carried out. Therefore, he has declined to allow me to take any action. </para>

                        <para>- It is a perfectly right and honorable course to take ; but I did not feel relieved from the necessity of stating the real position to the Senate. I was the leader of the Senate when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> was elected to the chair, and in my own mind I felt that the election was for six years, although nothing was said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> about it. Indeed, I do not think it was mentioned publicly to any one. But as I believed that the feeling of the Senate at that time was that the election was for six years - certainly that was my feeling - it appeared to me that this matter ought not to be finally concluded without some reference being made to it. However, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has taken the course which I have mentioned, and which, I must admit, is one that is very creditable indeed to him, I cannot go any further. I approve of the alteration which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> suggests, with a modification. It is quite clear that the standing order as it is would not do. It is too vague. But it would not do to substitute <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> proposal without any alteration. He proposes that the office of President shall become vacant on the 31st December following a periodical election, or at the date of any proclamation dissolving the Senate. As honorable senators are aware, if the general election is held, as will most probably be the case, on the same day as the Senate elections, Parliament will have to be called together within a month after the return of the writs. So that it is probable that there will be a lapse of, it may be, a fortnight after the 31st December before the Senate meets. During that time there is administrative work connected with the office of President which must go on. The affairs of the Department must be attended to. The arrangements for the opening of Parliament must be in the hands of somebody. There are arrangements to be made for the accommodation of persons who are invited, and other matters connected with the ceremonial which may seem small in themselves, but which must be arranged, and which make all the difference between things working smoothly and otherwise. There must be a President to supervise. It appears to me that the proposal ought to be amended by making it read, " Shall become vacant on the day before the first meeting of Parliament after the election." </para>

                        <para>- After a periodical election ; or we might put it " The day before the meeting of Parliament after a periodical or general election." Parliament must meet within a month after the return of the writs. If there has not been a dissolution of both Houses, it may be a shorter period ; but it is very likely in the future that elections for the Senate and for a new Parliament will run together. Of course that cannot be guaranteed, but it will involve such an enormous saving of expense to the country to have the elections on the same day that the probabilities are it will be done. At any rate I am not binding myself to any form of words. I am suggesting to the honorable senator, who I know simply wants to carry out his view in a convenient manner, that it would be well to provide that the President's term of office should continue until the day before the meeting of the new Parliament.

                        <para>- That is the proposal of the Government, and it is in accordance with the practice of the Parliaments of all the States. It must be remembered that these Houses of Parliament are in themselves a very important department of government, which must be administered, and of which there must be an administrative head with authority to decide, and to arrange matters, particularly before the opening of a new Parliament. The amount of money which will be saved by extending the term of office for the period between the 31st December and the time of the meeting of the new Parliament is very small. I do not intend to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on the main principle of his proposal, but I suggest that an amendment should be made currying out the view I have indicated - that is to say, that the President should remain in office until the day before the new Parliament meets. Of course, I am now speaking of a President who continues a senator, and I should have no objection to the rule being limited in that way. But where we have a President who remains a senator, and who is drawing his salary as a senator, there is no reason why he should not be placed in the same position in this respect as the Speaker in another place, and receive his salary until the day before the meeting of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It is. As I have said, I am dealing with the case of a senator who has a six years' term of office. There would be a little difference in the case of a senator whose term expired on the 31st December, and I should be perfectly willing to limit the application of my suggestion in the way indicated. </para>

                    has laid this matter before us. I am sure that the Senate will acquit me of any personal feelings. I have had this matter in my mind almost since the first meeting of the Senate, but I have always been told that the proper time to deal with it was when the standing orders were under consideration. We ought to remember that when the present President was elected to the position, he was not a senator elected for a term of six years, and, that being so, what becomes of all the talk about a breach of understanding? It was a month or six weeks after the election of the President that we determined which senators should retire at the end of three years, and there could not have been any understanding that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline>
                    was elected as  President  for six years. Has this Senate a double entity ? Have honorable senators had a secret meeting, and come to a conclusion as to who shall preside over us hereafter? The only determination that I know of in this respect is that which was come to on the floor of the Senate Chamber.

The further <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> went on with his explanation, the deeper he got into the bog ; and I was hoping that he would go on for another quarter of an hour, when he would have shown clearly how impossible his suggestion is. A dissolution of one House does not affect the election of President; but the dissolution of both Houses gives rise to different conditions. The Senate has to meet within 30 days, and only for that time would the office be vacant. Is there any possibility of trouble arising owing to the absence of a President for 30 days ? The administration of the Department could be carried on by the Government or the existing staff of clerks. </para>

                        <para>- If there was any necessity for the step proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> it would be a different matter ; but where an official is not absolutely necessary, I do not see why he should be voted a month's salary. Indeed, in some cases it might mean six months' salary; and, further, Parliament might not have been sitting for three or four months, or, perhaps, six months, before the election. The President ought to hold his office until the 31st December, or until the proclamation dissolving Parliament. Surely that is sufficient if generosity has to be called into the question ; but I object to the question of generosity being raised, because it is an unfair way of putting the matter. The question is, what is the proper date when the office should be vacated ? </para>

                        <para>- But under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> suggestion, we should be paying a President when there was in existence a new Senate which had had no hand in his election. If I may use an illustration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> was elected by 21 votes, and at the end of . the year nineteen senators have to face the electors, eighteen retiring in the ordinary course. Those eighteen senators may have been amongst those who voted for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> but they may be replaced by eighteen new men. Thus, in the new Senate, there would be only three senators who had voted for the President, with fifteen old senators who had voted against him, and eighteen new senators who had had no voice in the election. I think the standing order had better be allowed to remain as it is. I regard it as a perfectly fair rule, which can inflict no hardship on any person. The idea that there was any understanding has been blown to the four corners of the earth, and if we amend the standing order in the direction indicated, we shall make it meaningless. </para>

                    <para>-I intend to oppose the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> referred to the great amount of work which has to be done between the end of one Parliament and the beginning of another ; and said that, on that account, it is necessary that the President should hold office during that time. He admitted that where the President's term of office as a senator expired at the end of the year there must, of necessity, be an interval during which there would be no President. If, as he said, we should have to do without any one to look after affairs here then, why should we not do without an official in the other case? For other reasons, I think it is extremely undesirable that the President should continue to hold office right up to the meeting of a new Parliament. I was not here on a previous occasion when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> submitted his proposal ; but I think his reason for moving that the  President  should be elected at the beginning of a new Parliament must be clear to every honorable senator. Notwithstanding the exhaustive argument into which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> entered, I think that the Senate ought always to keep in its own hands the election of its President. At the end of every third year we might have practically a new Senate. Suppose for the sake of argument, that eighteen new senators were elected at the next election, they would find in the chair a President in whose election they had had no voice. It is extremely desirable that, at the beginning of every new Parliament, honorable senators should have an entirely free hand in the choice of their. <inline font-weight="bold">President. Senator O'Connor</inline> has told us about the necessity of having some person to look after the building, and to see that the Parliament is opened properly, and that the Governor-General is received in due state. We have permanent officials whose duty it is to see that the building is kept clean. Surely it does not require the  President  of the Senate to do that work ? Again, we have a clerk, a permanent officer, who can at tend to all matters of ceremonial just as well as the  President,  and probably very much better. We shall gain nothing practically by keeping the  President  in office right up to the beginning of the new Parliament, but we should lose a great deal. We should lose money, and I hope this argument will appeal to the advocates of economy. The  President  is paid at the rate of £1,500, while a senator is paid at the rate of £400 a year. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> an economist, to help us to save £100 to the taxpayers. </para>

                    <para>- I had no opportunity of taking part in the previous discussion on this question, and I was no party to the conclusion which was then arrived at. Speaking without reference to the occupant of the chair, but simply with reference to the Constitution, what position I ask did its framers intend the President of the Senate to hold ? We took section 17 of the Constitution, absolutely word for word, from a State Constitution. We found that under all the States Constitutions the President of the Legislative Council held office for the period for which he was elected a member ; there was no exception to that rule. The words of this section are identical with the words in the corresponding section of nearly every State Constitution Act, and no Legislative Council that I am aware of has ever thought of any other theory than that its President, as a matter of course, should hold office for the term of his election. </para>

                        <para>- That strengthens ray argument a little. When we are considering the words of the provision in our Constitution it is not unwise to ascertain where we got them from, and to assume that we were proceeding on old lines, except where we expressly declared that we were proceeding on different lines. No words can be clearer than the words of the section. I believe that if its interpretation were referred to the Supreme Courts of Australia, there would not be a difference of opinion expressed. They have always been construed as I have stated. The only doubt, coming from the words themselves, is whether it was not intended to follow what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> suggested when he referred to the cases of Queensland and New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- There, I admit, a doubt comes in. On the words it might be, as in the cases which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has mentioned - for life ; that is, for as long as he remained a senator ; but at all events, no more limited construction can be put upon them than that they mean during his term of office as a senator, whether it happens to be three or six years. As a question of strict law, following the lines of the old Constitutions, and presumably using the same words, so that the same construction might be brought about, the section, I venture to say, so far as the language is concerned, is capable of no other construction I appreciate the position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> takes. He is esteemed so much that I am perfectly sure that to him this is an abstract question from every point of view. But I decline to allow the delicacy which he may feel to interfere with the expression of my view on what I think is the proper constitutional position. I am talking about the President in the abstract, although I feel that after what has taken place this matter may be regarded as settled, I thought it only fair to put on record my view of the subject, which is that we intended the President of the Senate to occupy his position during the time for which be was elected as a senator. The Senate is not like the House of Representatives. The very essence of the Senate- is its continuity, while the very essence of the other House is its want of continuity. </para>

                    <para>- I thought that King Charles' Head would come up again. Under the circumstances it has come up in the right place, because a constitutional point is involved. I was very much surprised, however, to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> alluding in such affectionate terms to the good old ways, and the good old precedents. When we were dealing with the standing orders yesterday, he wanted to vote against the good old ways and the good old practices. If we think it is right and proper in any case to make a change, we should depart from the good old ways and the good old practices. If it can be done in one ease surely it can bc done in another. I was not aware until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> spoke, that in this respect the framers of our Constitution had followed the lines of the States Constitutions. If my memory serves me rightly the South Australian Constitution imposes no limitation. It is left to the Legislative Council to decide for how long a .term it shall elect its President. A great deal has been said to the effect that when honorable senators voted for the election of the present President they did so on the understanding that he was to remain in office as long as he continued to be a senator. I worked to get <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> placed in his present position, but I had no such intention. I did not know whether he  would remain a senator for three or six years. It was a moot point. 8 rr </para>

                        <para>- That was my understanding ; and I think that that was the proper thing to do. It would be mon-' strous for us who happen to be here for six years to be able, at the opening of Parliament, to elect a President to continue in a new Senate after half of the previous members had retired. It is true that the former senators- may be re-elected, but there may be a great many changes. The new Senate should be able to say who should preside over it. Of course, if a retiring President has so conducted himself that honorable senators have ' confidence in him, he will, as a rule, if he offers himself as a candidate for reelection, be unanimously elected. The instances to the contrary are very few. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has been exceedingly wise in saying that he prefers that the matter should remain as we 4eft it when it was previously debated. I spoke strongly on the subject then, and need not say an}' thing more now, except that, in my belief, the practice we are adopting is the correct one. It has been admitted, even by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> that he is willing that it should apply in the future, but he wants to make an exception in favour of the present President in consequence of what he believes to have been the opinion of the Senate at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> was elected. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to refer to the credit given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> for having acted very generously in stating" in public that he thought that the six years' senators should be those who were highest on the poll. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has explained to me that the probable reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> adopted that view was that the three senators at the top of the poll in New South Wales were free-traders, whereas one of the three lowest on the poll was a protectionist. From our past experience we have every reason to be careful about accepting suggestions from the Vice-President of the Executive Council. We never know what the honorable and learned senator is about, even when he gives notice of a proposition ; but when he comes forward without notice, anil suggests something in his usual gentlemanly and unassuming way, we need to be doubly careful. If the Senate is prepared to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> amendment, let us understand exactly what we are about to do. He states that he desires to amend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> proposal, in order to provide that the President shall hold Office until the day next before the first meeting of the new Parliament. I look up the Constitution, and I find that section 5 provides that- </para>

                <para>The Parliament of a State may make laws for determining the times and places of elections for senators of a State ; of course subject to the Constitution, or to any laws that Parliament may provide. There is nothing in the Constitution or in our Electoral laws providing that the Governor of a State or the Governor-General shall fix any particular date for the return of the writs. He may make the term 60 days or 120 days. Therefore the Committee should understand that it is not a question of a month's salary. The election must take place before the 31st December; and the writs for the Senate may not be returnable till the end of May. I am not troubling about the month's salary, but I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> because, when the candidates for the Presidency - if there is more than one - appear for election, they should appear as ordinary senators, and should not have any advantage by coming before us in all the majesty of the President's wig and gown. </para>

                    <para>- At the present stage of the debate the constitutional aspect of the matter appears to me to be quite beside the question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> amendment practically insures what the Senate very strongly desired when this subject was last under discussion. What was desired was that the new President should be elected by the senators in office after a general election. We do not wish to see the President holding office by virtue of having been elected by men who might not be members of the Senate over which he was presiding. That was the point of the whole discussion. Seeing that that point is not touched by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> amendment, we might very well adopt it. It is clear that the next Senate will elect the next  President.  If we can be bound by a case in point, I would remark that in the other branch of the Legislature the  Speaker  will retain his seat until a new  Speaker  is elected. A similar arrangement should be made in the case of the Senate. We may very well make the position of our  President  conform in this respect to the position of the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. As the House of Representatives has framed its standing orders on lines similar to those laid down in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> amendment we should agree to it. </para>

Why should we inaugurate a different practice in the Senate? The question of the six years' term has been decided. The amendment of the Vice-President of the Executive Council does not involve that question. The whole point at issue is whether the President shall hold office until the day before a new Parliament meets. He would not be President on the day upon which Parliament met ; and, consequently, would not appear for election in a wig and gown. Certainly, therefore, there would be no undue influence brought to bear on honorable senators in electing a new President. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is any doubt about it. My proposal makes it absolutely clear. There seems to be some misunderstanding as to the position I am taking up, although I thought I made it perfectly clear. I am submitting the view that the office of President should have a tenure of three years, but I say that instead of cutting the tenure short on the 31st December, the President shall remain in office until the day next before meeting of Parliament, which takes place after a periodical election. It may be - probably will be - a matter of not more than two or three weeks. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> pointed out, there may be cases in which it will be longer than that ; but the probabilities are that the elections for both Houses will take place together, and, consequently, that the Senate will meet within the next few weeks after the election. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DeLargie</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> have argued, we ought not to put our President in a worse position than that in which the presiding officer in another place is put. We should recognise the necessity of having in office an officer to administer the Department ; and the small amount of salary involved is not important. </para>

                    <para>- I do not rise to discuss the matter generally, but merely to emphasize something said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> who, I think, was perfectly .justified in looking, if I may say so, with suspicion on the amendment proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> was evidently in 'doubt as to the additional term of office that would be given to the President after the 31st December, and he quoted the Electoral Act' and the Constitution, accurately as I think, in support of his view. But I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> omitted, or did not notice, section 89 . of the Electoral Act, which settles the whole question. If we this year hold the elections for both Houses, as I think we may take it for granted we shall simultaneously, it will never be possible, under the Electoral .Act and the Constitution, for the  President  to retain his office for more than 30 days after the 31st December. The date fixed for the return of the writs must not be more than 60 days after the issue of the writs ; and if the writs for both Houses are issued at the same time this year, they will have to be practically simultaneously issued every succeeding three years at the same time. This year the writs will have to be returned at the end of the year, so that the full additional term which can be given to the present  President  is 30 days. I welcome the opportunity we have been afforded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> of coming to a unanimous agreement on a question on which we ought to be unanimous, not only for the sake of the present President, but for our own sakes ; and I hope the amendment will be carried without a division. </para>

                    <para>- The question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> is rather important if we study our own convenience. There may be two or more honorable senators with a very strong desire to move the adjournment of the House in order to debate a matter of supreme importance ; but, under the standing orders as at present framed, only the senator first called on can exercise the privilege. Can we not improve on that state of things? I believe it has occurred more than once that the senator first called on has disposed of his motion for adjournment in a few minutes, by withdrawing it, but the standing orders precluded any other honorable senator from submitting a similar motion, although his business may have been of great public importance. I have before thought that this was a flaw in our standing orders. I do not want to see the time of the Senate occupied any longer than is necessary with motions for adjournment ; but it does not seem right that the mere accident of being first called on, should give an honorable senator an opportunity which is not open to others. I recognise that without such a standing order opportunities would be afforded for stone-walling ; but I think the rule might be made a little more elastic. </para>

A petition dealing with the question may then be presented and read, and there will be no opportunity of referring to the petition. It will be seen that under the amendment it will be possible for petitioners really to intervene in the middle of the debate and shut the mouths of honorable senators who have already spoken on the subject of the allegations contained in their petitions. That does not seem to be quite fair. </para>

Petitions may be presented as soon as the Senate meets, and every good purpose is served by this provision. </para>

                <para class="block">This does seem to me to be a most involved course of procedure. In one case the President, or Chairman, puts the question that the words proposed to be left out stand part of the question, and immediately afterwards we provide in the standing orders that where it is proposed to insert words the question put is " that the words be inserted or. added." It will be admitted that what I suggest will greatly simplify our procedure and render it more easily understood by persons who read the proceedings of Parliament. It must be clear that many who read the proceedings of Parliament are frequently confused in looking at the reports of divisions by the form in which the question is stated. I have no doubt that this standing order is a very old one. </para>

                        <para>- Still, I ask honorable senators to consider this aspect of the question. We have, for instance, a clause before us for consideration, and some honorable senator, desiring that certain words which it contains should be left out, moves that they be left out. It would be reasonable to suppose that in subsequently voting in a division in pursuance of his motion that honorable senator would vote with the " Ayes," but under this standing order he has to vote with the " Noes." If immediately afterwards he desires to move the insertion of words in a clause in voting in&gt; pursuance of that motion he votes with the "Ayes." The difficulty is one which cropped up repeatedly when " Mister Negative "' was much in evidence in connexion with the divisions upon the Tariff. I put it to honorable senators to say whether it would not be better, as well as simpler, to have the question stated as I propose. It seems to me that I am following only the procedure adopted in Standing Order 135. Though this may be a somewhat grave departure from long-established precedent, I trust that the simplicity secured by the amendment will commend it to honorable senators. We have heard several times during the discussion on the standing orders, that we are wont to be too .anxious to adhere to established precedents, and to "lean up against a post," as Senator McGregor has put it. We have, however, departed from long-established precedent in connexion with other standing orders, and what I propose is but another departure. </para>

                    <para>- The question now being raised is entitled to very grave consideration in view of the terms of the Constitution. There is a senator always, at hand, <inline font-weight="bold">"Senator Negative,"</inline> who has a great deal to say in connexion with many of our divisions. What has happened here has been this : The question is put - "That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question," and the voting is equal. The consequence is- that they do not stand, and we have a blank. The next question may be that certain words proposed to be inserted be so inserted ; the voting is again equal, the blank remains, and we are in a fix. This has occurred on more than one occasion. I really think that the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> in view of the terms of the Constitution, is entitled to very full consideration by honorable senators. I draw attention to the matter because there is now no party feeling present, and only an anxiety to lay down fair and just principles guiding' our procedure, and it is desirable that we should consider and determine the question which has been raised. At present, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> has suggested the best form in which the question can be stated by the amendment he proposes. </para>

I am glad to hear the Chairman of Committees say that he is in favour of the alteration proposed. I think we should accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- This will cover not only Bills, but motions, and almost every question which may come before the Senate. Under the amendment, the mover of a motion, it seems to me, will have an advantage. I do not see how we can get over that, because some one must have the advantage in a tie under our Constitution. The question is, who ought to have the advantage, the person who brings forward a proposition or' those who oppose it? I cannot see why either should have an advantage. </para>

                        <para>- There is a very substantial consideration governing the question as to who should have the advantage of a tie. There is a recognised parliamentary principle that unless there is a majority in favour of an alteration in an existing law it should stand. The general parliamentary practice is that before an alteration of an existing law can be made there must be a majority in favour of the alteration. That political principle is also embodied in our Constitution, which provides that if the votes are equal on a particular question the question passes in the negative. The amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> seems to me to carry out exactly the principle of the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> is to be complimented upon discovering the necessity for this amendment, which would never have occurred to honorable senators who have been long in Parliament, because they are so used to having the question put in the way provided in the standing order that for them it has acquired a sort of sanctity. When we come to look into the matter it is perfectly clear that there are a great many objections to the present practice. Whilst the principal objections are those which arise out of the section of the Constitution which has been referred to, I think it is important also that wherever we can do so we should say exactly what we mean in the standing orders. The question put before the Senate in this case is that certain words be left out. "Why should not that question be put directly? Then everybody would understand what was being done. An honorable senator moves that certain words be left out, and if the amendment is agreed to, those who believe that they should be left out will vote "Aye," and those who think that they should not be left out will vote "No." It appears to me that not only those who are versed in parliamentary law, but everybody, should understand what is done, and that a question should be put exactly in the way in which we intend it to be decided. There is the other reason in support of the amendment, which has been very forcibly put by the Chairman of Committees. The principle underlying section 23 of the Constitution is that every one who brings forward a proposition must establish it by a majority, and if he cannot do so, he fails. Surely that is a right proposition </para>

The position in which we find ourselves in the Senate generally is that the Government introduce certain measures for our consideration, and expect them to be carried.. If the Government are in a position to say to the Opposition " You cannot beat us," they can carry every clause of their Bill under this amendment, whereas the ordinary notion of parliamentary government is. that a Ministry should only exist for so long as it can command a majority, and no longer. Under this amendment it would be no longer necessary in any case for the Government to have a majority at its back to carry every proposal which they desired to be passed. So long as the Government were equal, in number to the Opposition in division, every clause or measure which they submitted would be carried. That is a position which I do not think is either sound or constitutional. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- I did not anticipate when I moved this harmless amendment that it would arouse, any party feeling. It was moved for the purpose of insuring simplicity and continuity of procedure. Whenever a senator moves to insert any words, the President or the Chairman is compelled by Standing Order 135 to put this question : " That the words proposed to be inserted be so inserted." Why, then, when he wishes to leave out certain words, should not the question be: "That the words proposed to be left out be so left out"; so that every honorable senator might know exactly what he was voting for or against ?

                    was in error in assuming that I was paying special attention to the views of the outside public as regards the forms of procedure here. What I said was that those persons who were interested in the proceedings of the Senate should be enabled to understand clearly what they were reading in the newspapers, and what a division was about when it was taken Unless a person is versed in parliamentary procedure, he must be considerably confused when he is reading his newspaper. The manner in which the questions are reported in the press is considerably involved and puzzling to such persons. . It is quite right, I think, to consider the convenience of all persons who wish to understand from the press what the Senate is doing. We shall establish a very simple and intelligible practice if my amendment is carried. I am sure that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    will accept my assurance that it was not moved in the interests of the Government. .

                    <para>- Evidently there is very good reason for making this amendment, whatever its effect on parties might be. I am given to understand that the representatives of the great daily newspapers of New South Wales al ways follow the rule which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> wishes to establish. Whenever a question is put from the Chair - " That the words proposed to be struck out stand part of the clause," and the division shows seventeen "Ayes" and fifteen "Noes," the reporters, in order that the readers may see clearly what was done, publish the "Noes" as "Ayes," and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> and state that the amendment was negatived by seventeen votes to fifteen. It is quite evident' that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> understands the great difficulty which the reading public have in understanding our methods of procedure. I shall support his amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I could have sympathized with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> a year or two ago, before I got accustomed to the way in which questions are put from the Chair. I can assure my honorable friend that he will very soon get accustomed to the procedure. If the amendment is carried it may lead to greater clarity in the minds of honorable senators as to what question is proposed ; but it will give an advantage to the Government - who, of course, will submit the majority of proposals ; and it will, I think, destroy the principle of majority rule. I do not think that any measure should pass into law until it has been indorsed by a majority in the Senate and in the other House. If an honorable senator has a question to submit, and he cannot obtain a majority of one, it ought not to be carried. The amendment arises out of a proposal which was made that the President should have an extra vote when the numbers were equal. With six senators coming from each State, that would give the State which he represented an extra representative. Referring to this subject, Quick and Garran, in their <inline font-style="italic">Annotated Constitution,</inline> say - </para>

                    <para>The object of providing that the President, unlike the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall be entitled to a vote in all cases, is that the State which he represents may not be deprived of the benefit, of the constitutional privilege of equal representation. He is not given a casting vote as well, because that would give his State more than equal representation. Some other provision had to be made for the case of an equality of votes, so the Constitution declares that in that event the question shall be resolved in the negative. This is based upon the universally recognised principle, that affirmative action in any legislative body must be supported by a majority. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator may bring down a Bill containing a clause, to three parts of which the Senate may be willing to agree, whilst it may disagree with the fourth part. He argues that we can negative the whole clause. But we may not wish to do so. We may desire to negative only part of it. Because we do not desire to negative three parts of the clause, we have to accept the whole, being unable to carry a motion that a certain portion of the clause be omitted. Our motion that certain words be left out is lost, because we cannot get a majority. Some of us in the Senate have often taken up strong positions on certain proposals with regard to kanaka legislation, alien restriction legislation, and so forth. I hold that if we could not command a majority of one- third of the people of Australia, it might not be wise to put such laws into effect. I believe, however, that we can command a one-third majority of the whole population. When we ask that the Government shall have to command a majority of one, we are standing by the principle of the Constitution, and the very basis upon which the Senate is established. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> did not give us notice of this proposal, under which, when voting upon certain questions, we might find that representatives of the States were* arrayed in such a fashion that the gravest injustice would be done in consequence of the negative being in favour of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> knows very well that the negative means that we stand as we are . until those who wish to make a change are able to alter the opinions of the majority. The negative has been of great service in the Senate on many occasions. In fact, " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negative,"</inline> as it has been described, has made his appearance very often. It is only common sense and logic to require that anybody who submits a proposition should at least secure a majority of one in its favour before it is carried. The proposal, that certain words be omitted, does not mean affirmative action. The Government, or the senator who brings forward a motion, proposes affirmative action. There are plenty of cases in which honorable senators move that certain words be struck out with the view of allowing existing circumstances to remain as they are. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that those of us who oppose this proposal can quite understand the readiness with which the leader of the Government fell in with the proposition. It gives him another vote. </para>

                        <para>- No ; it is cast upon the Senate to have a majority before we can pass a law. My honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> has said that some of us regard the present way of putting the question - "That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question " as a superstition. But is it not probable that the framers of the Constitution had in their minds the idea that that is the way in which questions would be put? Is it likely that they had any idea of altering the method in which questions have been put for centuries ? The framers of the Constitution gave a vote to the President so as to preserve equality of voting to the State represented by him, and they safeguarded the practice by providing that, unless a majority was obtained, a question must pass in the negative. I have no doubt whatever that the framers of the Constitution had it in their minds that questions would be put in accordance with precedent. They could not have thought otherwise. They knew that questions were always put in the one way, and they did not dream that they would ever be put in another way. Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> like to see a tax of £40,000 or £50,000 imposed upon the people of the Commonwealth,, without having a majority of one in its favour ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator may say that it is impossible, because a tax would have to be imposed by a Bill which the Senate could not amend. But I am using the illustration to test the value of the argument. Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> like to see a clause involving an expenditure of £40,000 or £50,000 a year pass by no majority at all, simply because it was put in such a way that the question was resolved in the negative ? I am supposing that some important principle might be engrafted upon Commonwealth legislation when there was not a majority of the Senate in its favour. </para>

                    <para>- This subject ought not to be discussed from the point of view of the Government or the Opposition, but with the object of simplifying the procedure of the Senate. I do not think it should be argued that in connexion with a Bill the Government would secure an advantage from having amendments put in the manner proposed. It might just as well be said that the Opposition would secure an advantage. If there is any advantage to be gained, there is no more reason why the Government 'should not obtain it, than why the Opposition should have it. But I do not put the question in. that way. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The honorable and learned senator said that he wanted all legislation to be carried by a majority. He does not seem to recognise the altered condition of affairs in the Senate, as compared with the condition of things existing in any Parliament in which the existing custom has grown up. Take a simple case. Say that a Bill provides that the Governor-General "shall call Parliament together." and that some honorable senator desires to alter the word " shall " to " may." Under our practice the first proposal that he would submit would be " That the word ' shall ' be struck out, with a view of inserting the. word 'may.' " The question would be put "That the word 'shall' stand part of the clause." Suppose the votes are equal, and that the Government and the Opposition attach very great importance to the question. The result would be that the word would be struck out, because the question would pass in the negative. Then the question would be - "That the word 'may' be inserted." The same anxiety for supremacy might exist, and the voting might be the same. Both sides would be equal. Consequently the word " may " would not be inserted, and the Senate would be in a difficulty. But take the course of procedure proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe.</inline> Under his proposal, the proposition would first be - "That the word proposed to be left out be so left out." If the voting was equal, the question would pass in the negative, and the word would not be struck out. The clause would remain as it was, and no difficulty could arise in consequence of the equal voting. </para>

                        <para>- I contend that the Government has as much right as the Opposition to the benefit of the negative. If the question were so vital that the Opposition thought the salvation of the country depended on it, the Opposition could punish the Government. The next question is "That the clause as amended stand part of the Bill"; and then, if the voting be not equal, the clause does not stand part of the Bill. There is no difficulty in this connexion which an Opposition of strength and substance cannot get over. I do not think there is much in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs'</inline> argument that there might be three parts of the clause of which the Opposition might approve, because that would only show that the matter was not of sufficient importance to cause a difficulty. If it be a case of simply striking out words without inserting any in their place, there must be a majority. Why should we be able to strike out words if we have not a majority? The amendment will, in my opinion, prevent our getting into the difficulty which would be caused by what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> and other legal gentlemen would call a hiatus in a clause. When we become accustomed to the working of the standing order as amended, we shall find it prove quite simple to both the general public and ourselves. </para>

                        <para>- In ordinary parliamentary practice the Government deliberately undertake the responsibility of setting the parliamentary machine in motion, and take charge of the business - the Government must initiate everything and move everything. It is no part of the duty of the Opposition to take charge ; and the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> amendment must necessarily be that a Government may go on with the initiation and management of business simply because they are equal in numbers with the Opposition. That is flying in the face of the parliamentary axiom that a Government must govern by majority. I admit that the proposed amendment would work both ways; and it would stand self-condemned if it did not. There are opportunities for initiation by the Opposition, and in their case, too, they should have a majority in order to carry any proposal they make. In, ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the onus of initiation is rightly on the Government, and we ought to have respect for the parliamentary axiom I have already quoted. The Opposition has not equal power with the Government to bring down Bills and submit proposals, and inasmuch as the onus is on the Government, they ought to have a majority or fall. </para>

                    knows very well that we do not make and unmake Governments in this Chamber. That is done in the House of Representatives, where the greater portion of the legislation is initiated. The question we are now discussing does not arise in the other House, and the reason, which has already been explained, is that each State represented in the Senate has to have equal power. That is the reason why we have deprived the President, when in the chair, of a casting vote. Under the circumstances, the Government have the right to any advantage there may be under the amendment, though, in my opinion, I do not think there will be any great advantage in the long run. Seeing that we have no power to affect the existence of the Government, we should make our standing orders as simple as we possibly can, in order to avoid difficulty.

                        <para>- I should like honorable senators, who are being misled by generalities, just to follow me in a few words on the practical side. It is only by talking generalities that honorable senators can confuse themselves, and be led to vote against the amendment. The principle followed in the amendment is the principle of the Constitution, namely, that nothing can be carried except the person affirming the proposition has a majority of votes ; and, surely, that is a right principle. First of all, take the case of the Government : a Bill is introduced, and they must have a majority of votes at each stage before the measure can be carried. With regard to every clause in Committee the Government must have a majority. </para>

                        <para>- I beg the honorable and learned senator's pardon. The question put in Committee will be that the clause as read stand part of the Bill, and that question will have to be carried in the affirmative. If the votes are equal the clause will not be carried. Every motion submitted by the Government must be affirmed by a majority before it can succeed. Where an amendment is to insert words it is quite clear that either the Government or the person who moves the amendment must have a majority. Where the amendment is to insert words only, that is the only form in which the question can be put ; and, as I say, the amendment must be carried by a majority. But where the amendment is to leave out words with a view to insert others, the procedure consists of two steps. According to our present practice in regard to the first step of leaving out the words, the onus is placed not on the person who is moving the amendment, but on the person who is maintaining that the original clause is good. Surely that is ridiculous. But at the other stage, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> the onus is shifted to the other side, and it is the person who wants to insert the words who has to prove the affirmative. Is not that perfectly absurd <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It seems to me that only those who have lived in the old atmosphere of parliamentary practice for many years could fail to see the absurdity of it at a glance? </para>

                <para class="block">This is the standing order which lays down the practice governing the moving of the previous question. We provide here, that not only can the previous question be moved to the original question, but that it can also be moved to the original question when an amendment has been moved to the original question. According to May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> I think the previous question cannot be moved in the House of Commons to the original question when an amendment has been moved upon that question. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> says, at page 269 - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In the Commons the words of this motion are - "That that question be not now put," and if it be resolved in the affirmative, the Speaker is prevented from putting the main question, as the House have thus refused to allow it to be put. The motion may, however, be brought forward again on another day, as the decision of the House merely binds the Speaker not to put the main question thereon at that time. If the previous question be resolved in the negative, the original question on which it was moved must be put forthwith, no amendment, nor debate, or motion for adjournment being allowed, because as the House have negatived the proposal - "That the question be not now put," the question must accordingly be put at once to the vote. The previous question has been 'moved upon the various stages of a Bill, but it cannot be moved upon an amendment ; though after an amendment has been agreed to, the previous question can be put on the main question as amended. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That seems to me clearly to indicate that in the House of Commons the previous question cannot be moved when an amendment has been moved on the original question. </para>

I think there is a good reason for that ; because if we put the previous question when there is an amendment and an original question before the Senate, we shall be voting on three questions at the one time. We shall vote as to what we wish to do with the original question, what we wish to do with the amendment, and what we wish to do with the proposal that the question be not now put. Surely it was never contemplated that the Senate should be asked to give a vote which will decide three questions at one time ? </para>

                        <para>- I admit that it is quite a legitimate argument. I propose to deal with the matter altogether outside of that. As the standing order is before the Senate it means the original question, and any amendment of it. Because it will be clear that if an amendment has been carried on the original question, and the previous question is moved and carried, both the amendment and original question will be disposed of. It also provides that if an amendment has been moved to the original question, but has not been put we may intervene with the previous question, and if it is carried then the original question and the proposed amendment are disposed of. Why should not that be so? Why should not any proposed amendment be treated in the same way as the original question, when we know that the principle of the previous question is the intention to avoid committing the Senate to an expression of opinion upon the original question at all <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> And that will certainly apply equally to any amendment of the original question. If the standing order were not as here proposed, what would follow <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> An amendment would be proposed, and so long as it remained undisposed of, the previous question could not be moved, though the amendment might involve only the alteration of a single word without in , any way altering the sense of the main question. The very object of moving the previous question is to prevent honorable senators being forced to an expression of opinion upon the original question. If they are required to vote on an amendment of the original question, they must express an opinion on the original question ; so that the very object of the previous question would be defeated. The previous question is not very often used, but it is sometimes used. </para>

                        <para>- No ; it is not a system of gag. There may be a proposition put before the Senate which, in the abstract, is perfectly true, and which under other circumstances would be acceptable; but at the particular time it may not be convenient or right, or for some other reason the Senate may not desire to express an opinion upon it ; and it is a proper and convenient parliamentary way out of the difficulty to move the previous question. That is to nullify it, and to say that we shall not express any opinion about it at all. It is a useful rule, and a proper power for the Senate to possess. We should, however, be deprived altogether of this power if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment is carried. Because if any honorable senator moves an amendment upon the original question, however slight, the Senate will be forced to pronounce an opinion upon that amendment, which means an opinion upon the main question, before the previous question can be applied. Honorable senators will see that there is a series of rules here dealing with the previous question. Take Standing Order 150- </para>

                    <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has entirely overlooked one point, and that is that, in framing these rules, the Standing Orders Committee entirely departed from the principle laid down in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> as to the previous question. They acted deliberately after having discussed the subject two or three times. In the House of Commons the previous question is moved, and treated as an amendment, but in this code it is proposed that it should be treated as an original question which supersedes the main question. That is the fundamental difference. The committee were induced to arrive at that conclusion because it seemed to them that it would be proper and convenient that the Senate should have the opportunity of declining to vote, or to express an opinion on any question brought forward, or on any amendment thereto. I was exceedingly astonished to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> quote the standing orders of the House of Commons as binding on us when we are proposing to make new standing orders, which may or may not follow its rules. The question is, not what its rules are, but what rules will be convenient to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- It referred the honorable senator to the practice of the House of Commons, but it did not say that the rule was identical with that practice. If it has misled the honorable senator, I am sorry. Marginal notes are very often left as they stand after the clauses to which they relate have been amended. I am not quite sure, but I think that this standing order was amended. It seems to me that these standing orders are complete as a whole. If the honorable senator will refer to No. 150, he will see that the previous question temporarily supersedes the original question and an amendment. It is put, not as an amendment, but as an original motion, which supersedes both the original question and the amendment. I do not regard it as of very much importance. I do not think that the previous question has been moved once in the Senate during a period of over two years. In my experience it is very seldom resorted to, but when it is resorted to it certainly ought to be in a form which would enable the Senate to say that it declined to discuss the original question any more. This rule is intended to be an improvement on the practice of the House of Commons, and I hope that it will be adopted. </para>

                <para class="block">This rule involves a question of some importance to private senators. The Government are always in a position to have their Bills in print when they are presented. It is necessary for a Bill to be in print before it can be read a first time. A private senator has no authority to get a Bill printed before he gets leave to introduce it, and unless the Government arranged to have the Bill printed for him it would have to be done at his expense. It would be just as well to lay it down in the standing orders. A Government may be bitterly hostile to a Bill introduced by a private senator, and may refuse to print it. </para>

It was said that Bills would always be in print, and that it was of no use providing for what was always done. Now the opposite view seems to be taken.

                    might be taken to be merely an instruction to a private senator that he must get his Bill printed before it could be read a first time. What I propose would be an instruction to the officers of. the Senate that on leave being given to introduce a Bill, it should be printed.

It ought to be provided that before a Bill is read a first time it should be in print. But there need not be the slightest fear that any honorable senator would not be able to get a Bill printed.

                    that it is the universal practice in all Parliaments that I ever heard of, that if any member wants to introduce a Bill, and obtains leave, it is printed as a matter of course.

                    <para>- I urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> not to proceed with this amendment. It will be found, generally speaking, that it is wise to allow an interval to elapse before we deal with a message. I have often had to take objection to proceeding with Bills in Committee immediately after the second reading. It is always advisable to let an interval elapse. We are not in such a violent hurry that we cannot spare time for honorable senators who may be away to learn- that a message has been received by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the clause, as it stands, is even more comprehensive than that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> A short pithy clause, such as that which appears in the Bill, will include almost any one who in any way falsely represents an article as being patented ; and, whatever form of words may be used, it will be necessary to sheet home the offence to some one. The more ample a provision is made the more chance there is of leaving loop-holes. If we set out every variation which shall constitute an offence, it will be held that an act which does not come strictly within one of the definitions is not an offence. I am inclined to think that the penalty is not sufficient, and on that I shall be glad to have the views of the Committee. </para>

                    <para>- We ought to be very careful with this clause, under which it is quite possible for a man to be very hardly treated. A person may innocently buy goods marked as patented, and innocently sell them, or he may sell goods which are so marked, but in regard to which the patent has expired. Under this clause such a person would be liable to a fine, and there are many degrees of guilt possible under this clause. An offence might be committed which would be very insufficiently punished by a fine of £5, though I think a fine of £20 is rather too high. I suggest that the penalty be made £10, and I shall move accordingly. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that under this clause it will be most difficult, no matter how it is worded, to get a conviction. In order to make the clause more precise, I should like to see the words which have been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made the first part of the clause, the latter being attached thereto. The clause as drawn is more comprehensive than that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> but with the addition of those words it would be more comprehensive still. I think that would meet the case. </para>

                    <para>- I think that considerable discretion should be allowed. There are many articles of food which are said to be patented articles. There is, for instance, "patent groats," which I believe is a sort of oatmeal. If a man sells a packet of oatmeal with the word " patent " on it, there is no reason why he should be subjected to a heavy fine. If a man injures the property of another by describing an article as a patented article to the detriment of the man who has patented a similar article, he should be punished. But when we are dealing with articles of food, it is absurd to suggest that a man should be fined for using the word "patented " without authority. </para>

                    <para>- I am prepared to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment that the penalty should be £20. I believe that under this clause there will be considerable difficulty in imposing any penalty. That will be found where the patentee is a foreigner in Europe or America. The difficulty will also occur where the article has been patented and the patent has lapsed. In such a case it will be necessary to prove that the article was manufactured prior to the lapsing of the patent before a conviction could be secured. I think it is necessary to provide for a substantial penalty. I have heard of cases where people deliberately mark small pieces of machinery "patent," or " patented," and if these become broken and the purchaser goes to a blacksmith to have them mended, the blacksmith may refuse to repair the machine on the ground that he would be infringing a patent. It may be subsequently discovered that the article is not patented at all, and it has been marked " patented " to secure an exclusive sale. Honorable senators must remember that the penalty stated throughout the Bill is the maximum. Where there is a flagrant case, it is well that the magistrates should be given discretion to impose a severe penalty. In this case, I think the maximum penalty should be £20, and it would then be left to the discretion of the magistrate to impose a fine of only 10s. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I still think that £10 as a maximum would be a sufficient penalty to provide. Magistrates are sometimes apt to judge of the heinousness of a crime by the amount of the penalty attached to it ; and, in cases in which very little moral wrong had been done, fines might be imposed which honorable senators would not approve of. A correspondent writes to me that under this clause villainous wrong may be done to a dealer in various goods, and he may be led into a great deal of trouble and financial loss by its operation.

                    <para>- The question is whether there are not two kinds of patents, a mechanical patent and a chemical patent. The production of a new dye, for instance, is a very different thing from the production of a mechanical patent, and its infringement may involve the loss of thousands of pounds. My correspondent, who is an ex-examiner of chemical patents in New South Wales, thinks that there should be a separation of mechanical, chemical, and other patents. </para>

                        <para>- It is no answer to say that clause 124 will give him a good defence, because he will still be subject to the operation of clause 122, and will be liable to prosecution, though, after he is prosecuted, he may resort to another provision of the Bill to extricate him from his difficulty. I do not object to the obvious policy of clause 122, but I think it should be more specifically set forth in that clause that it applies to Australian patents. </para>

The words "patented" and " patent " are used throughout the Bill. . If one clause were made to refer to an article which had been patented in Australia, it might be argued by implication that a clause in which that variation had not been made meant an article which had been patented outside Australia. The proper course is to define in the interpretation clause exactly what is meant by a " patent," and then to use the word all through the Bill without any limitation or qualification. If that course is taken it will give a meaning to the word wherever it is used. If in one clause we limit or qualify the meaning of the word " patent "we ought, in order to guard against any ambiguity, to alter the meaning of the word "patent" wherever it occurs in the Bill. </para>

                    that, in order to avoid diversity of interpretation, it is desirable not to limit, in a particular clause, a word which is of frequent occurrence in the measure. If in the interpretation clause the word "patent" were defined to mean letters patent issued under the authority of the Act, or within the Commonwealth, and the. words " patented article " were clearly defined to mean an article in respect to which letters patent had been issued in the Commonwealth, under the provisions of this Act there could be no ambiguity in regard to clause 122.

                    can see, I am sure, that a man who palmed off an article on to an individual, or the public, on the representation that it had been patented in Australia when it had been patented in other countries, might endeavour through his counsel to claim the benefit of some ambiguity in this clause because a patent was not defined to be a patent granted in Australia, and even if it were, because a patented article was not expressly defined to be an article patented in Australia. . If the two terms are to be defined in the interpretation clause as referring to Australia only, there is no necessity to alter this clause.

It is only right that we should not attempt to raise more than the mere working expenses of the Department. It would liberalize this schedule very much if the fees were reduced in these two cases. I admit that the scale of fees generally is less than that which has prevailed in most of the States, but it should be remembered that in the United States the finances have been largely augmented by the imposition of low fees. I do not anticipate any loss of revenue from a reduction of these fees. </para>

                    <para>- I am also in favour of charging low fees for patents. It is admitted that the scale of fees in this schedule is very much less than that which has been charged hitherto in the States. We have reduced the fees very much - nearly to the lowest figure which has been charged in any State - and the patent is to apply to the whole Commonwealth. We propose to charge a fee of £5 for a patent which will last for seven years, and will confer on the holder the advantage of getting a royalty on the manufacture and sale of his article throughout the Commonwealth. It is rather unreasonable for the honorable senator to ask that it should be reduced to £3. There was a time when the desire was to raise a revenue for the Crown from this source. The Government are not animated by any desire of that kind. The cost of administering the law is considerable, and to some extent it should be defrayed by the inventors. Five pounds is a very reasonable fee to charge for the preparation of a patent for sealing. In Canada the fee is 20 dols., in addition to which the renewal fee, before the end of the sixth year, is 20 dols, and the renewal fee before the end of the twelfth year, is another 20 dols., making 60 dols. in all. In Newfoundland the fee is 25 dols. ; in New South Wales, £5 ; in Queensland, £18 ; in South Australia, £8 ; in Victoria, £9 ; in Western Australia, £18 ; in New Zealand, £18 ; in Tasmania, £38 ; in Cape Calony, £35 ; and in Natal, £19 18s. I think that the amount in Great Britain is about £50 altogether. These are enormously high fees, as compared with what we are proposing to charge. Having regard to the fees charged in other countries and in other States of the Commonwealth, the fee of £5, which we propose to charge for the period of seven years, is not excessive. </para>

That means a considerable increase in the work to be done. We must avoid establishing a Patents-office which will cost a large sura of money to the Commonwealth.

                    <para>- This fee has to be paid by the patentee to the Treasury, but we have no means of ascertaining what he has to pay to his patent attorney. The higher we make the fee the more justification the patent attorney will have for making high charges. The policy of this Bill is the centralization of patents work. Most of the work will have to be done in Melbourne, and patentees in other parts of Australia will be practically at the mercy of the patent attorneys. Therefore, £12 will not be the total amount which the patentee will have to pay in fees. Probably he will have to pay more than twice that amount before he is finished. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to call attention to the definition of " Supreme Court," which is " the Supreme Court of the State in which the Patent-office is situated, or a Judge thereof." We have the Supreme Court mentioned in reference to four matters of some importance. Under clause 73, the Supreme Court, where the Patents-office is situated, has the right of hearing appeals from the Commissioner ; under clause 82, the Supreme Court of a State has power to revoke a patent ; under clause 85, the question of granting compulsory licenses may be referred by the Commissioner to the Supreme Courts and under clause 86, the Supreme Court may deal with infringements of patents. Why should the Supreme Court of a State be mentioned in clause 82, which deals with the revocation of a patent ? It appears to me that the revocation of a patent is a most important matter, both to the patentee and to the public. In clause 9, I had an amendment made, providing that the Governor may appoint one or more Deputy Commissioners, in order, as far as practicable, to do away with too much centralization. If we have Deputy Commissioners, and if in the future the Commissioner finds he can safely delegate his authority to those deputies, why should not the Supreme Court of a State, or all the States, have power to deal with all matters under the Bill ? Why should we give the Supreme Court of a State the right to hear an application for the revocation of a patent, while the Supreme Court in the State where the Patents-otfice is situated is the only court which can deal with the infringement of a patent? The provisions appear a little inconsistent, and, if the Minister will not consent to an absolute amendment, will he, in order to carry out the object of the amendment in clause 9, insert some clause providing that jurisdiction may be conferred by the Governor-General in Council on the Supreme Court of a State ? </para>

                        <para>- I endeavoured to explain this matter the other night, but, perhaps, did not make myself quite clear. Clause 82 gives a power that has always been exercised by the Supreme Court of a State in its equity jurisdiction. We are doing away here with the old proceeding by way of <inline font-style="italic">scire facias,</inline> which was originally the method of revoking letters patent; but the power resides in the Supreme Court of a State to hear and adjudicate on petitions in regard to letters patent. </para>

The reason I gave the other day - and it is a good one - is that if any legal proceedings are taken in connexion with the issue of a patent, it is right that they should be taken at one centre, which probably will be most convenient for the parties concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it would be advisable to make the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I felt that it was a mistake to make the amendment in clause 35, requiring the Commissioner to decide on the question of novelty, and the probability is that that amendment will not have much effect. I understand, that in the Victorian case, which was quoted so frequently, it appeared that a similar provision was, as a matter of fact, a dead letter. The examiner is bound to examine as to novelty, but the decision has no weight whatever, and may be misleading. The law really becomes a dead-letter, though the specifications are passed, and the parties who may be interested are allowed to challenge the decision on the question of novelty. </para>

                <para class="block">I can very well see that the Government, having been defeated on clause 35, do not want to amend clause 38 in order to carry out the will of the Committee. I suppose that the Government will point out that clause 35 is inoperative without an amendment in clause 38, and ask the Committee to reconsider its determination in regard to clause 35. What do clauses 42 and 43 deal with ? Clause 42 provides that if the Commissioner is satisfied that no objection exists, he may grant the patent; but, according to clause 43, if he is not satisfied, he shall, unless the objection be removed by amending the specification, determine whether a reference ought to be made, or refuse the application. But those two clauses have reference to clause 37, which deals with inventions already patented in the Commonwealth or a State. There is no clause in the Bill giving the Commissioner power to reject an application, if the examiner reports to him that the invention is not novel. If, as the Minister says, the provision will be a dead-letter, the objection he has raised to it on innumerable occasions will not apply. If the examiner never reports that an invention is not novel, the Commissioner will never have to refuse an application on that ground. </para>

                    <para>- I have considered this and the following clauses very carefully since they were previously under discussion, and I have reliable advice that they are in perfect order, and in accordance with the English Act. The object of these clauses is simply to put patents for munitions of war on a different footing from others, in order that they may be assigned to the Government, and that certain conditions of secrecy in connexion with them may be observed. Honorable senators will see at once the reason for that. The reference to " valuable consideration " is in order that any patent of this kind may be assigned to the Government, and may hold good, even if it is not under seal. There is no intention in this Bill to give the Government the right to take advantage of a patent without paying for it. It is only provided that under the conditions set forth the inventor may, if he chooses, assign his invention to the Government, and I presume he will expect to be paid for it. The agreement made will hold good even though it may not be under seal. It is a misapprehension to suppose that there is any intention to give the Government a preemptive right to take advantage of a man's invention without paying him for it. </para>

The intention is to simplify the law, but the effect of the amendment, if carried, would be that we should at once lose all the advantages we have in the decisions which have been given on the subject, and we should have to start on an untried sea. This can only result in a considerable increase of litigation, for the reason that no one will be able to advise an inventor, or a man opposing the granting of a patent for an invention, as to what his rights may be, because we shall have swept away all precedents. It is most desirable that those interested in patents should have a means of knowing the ground on which they stand, but if this amendment were carried even the best legal authorities could give no advice or assistance as to what would probably be the decision of the Court in regard to any particular invention. I hope the honorable senator will not press the amendment. </para>

                <para>That the report from the Printing Committee (Sitting in conference with the Printing Committee of the House of Representatives) Brought up on 3rd September, 1902, be considered this day three weeks. </para>
                <para>The Chairman of the Printing Committee a few days ago asked me to bring the report with which we have now to deal before the Senate, in order that honorable senators may express their approval or disapproval of some recommendations contained in it. The Printing Committee desire to have the guidance of honorable senators upon these matters. The report <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> dated nearly a year ago, on 27th August, 1902. It was brought up by the Printing Committee last year, and laid upon the table of the Senate, but it was not dealt with. It was drawn up at a time when we were just beginning to feel our way in the matter of the business of printing connected with Parliamentary Departments. It contains, no doubt, all the information that was obtainable at that time; but in connexion with almost every matter of inquiry dealt with in the report there have been alterations made in the methods of carrying out the business of the Departments. There have been great savings effected owing to the adoption, of economical methods, which have altogether revolutionized the system in force when the committee made their inquiries. Therefore, as a statement of the facts upon which the committee based their recommendations, the report in its present condition is of no value whatever. It contains certain recommendations upon which the committee desire an expression of the opinion of the Senate. The recommendations are to be found at the end of the report, as follow : - </para>

                </list>
                <para class="block">The reduction which has been made is considerably more than twice that number. In all these respects the recommendations of the Printing Committee have either been carried out or are in course of being carried out. The other recommendations reallY bring the matters referred to up to only the 27 th August, 1902. If the report were adopted in its present state it would certainly give the public a very misleading idea of the cost of our printing bill and our methods. I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> who is the  Chairman,  that it would be very desirable, before taking any action on the report, to have a meeting of the Printing Committee, and to bring the facts up to date in another report. It could very easily be done, because all the facts are within the knowledge of the  Speaker  and  President.  As the heads of their respective Departments, they have had control of the distribution of the greater part of these papers ; they are in a position to give information as to . the cost of printing the papers, the method of distributing them, and other matters. I would suggest- to my honorable friend that the Printing Committee should take the evidence of the  Speaker  find the  President  on these questions, get such other information as may be necessary, and bring up a supplementary report, which can be considered with the other one. If that course is taken the Senate will be in a position to consider these recommendations with a full knowledge of all the facts, and to to approve of a report which states the real position. To adopt the report of last session as representing the present condition of affairs would be very unfair to the Parliamentary Departments, would be misleading to the public, and would not represent the views of the present Printing Committee. If the motion is agreed to, the  Chairman  of the Printing Committee will be able to take such action as he deems necessary, and I think that by the time fixed he should be in a position to present a supplementary report. </para>

                        <para>- All the statements which have been made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council are correct, excepting one, for which perhaps I am responsible ; and that is that the number of notices of motion has been reduced by 600. I am not quite sure whether that is correct or not, but, generally speaking, the report is out of date. The circumstances have entirely altered since it was presented. For instance, the circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has been enormously decreased, not by reason of any action taken by the  Speaker  or myself, but because an enormous number of persons, who received the official reports lost session, have not applied for them this session. The heads of some Commonwealth and States Departments, who applied for five or six copies last session, have written to say that they do not require more than one copy ; so that the expense of distributing the publication has. been very largely decreased. Other decreases have been made in the expenditure. I think it will be wise to postpone the consideration of the report until the information has been brought up to date; because a great many of the recommendations have been complied with, and other economies have been made, which are not mentioned by the Printing Committee. For instance, the Government have adopted the policy - I think a wise one - that each Department should show its expenditure. Under that policy the Departments of the Senate and of the House of Representatives have to pay postage on the circulation of these documents. Nominally that increases the expenditure, but it is only a bookkeeping entry. On the other hand, the   Speaker  and myself have said that, in carrying out that policy, it is only fair that the Commonwealth Departments which require papers from either House, or from both Houses, should pay for them. Of course, that is only a book-keeping entry ; but it shows the cost of parliamentary printing more correctly than was formerly done. All the circumstances have altered very considerably since the report was brought up ; and I think it is advisable for the Printing Committee to obtain further information before it is considered by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- I have no objection to fall in with the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> Thu report was the result of a considerable expenditure of time last session by the Printing Committees of the two Houses. It was printed at considerable cost, and a motion for its consideration stood on the notice-paper of the Senate during a great portion of lost session. It seemed to me that after we had been deputed to do this work at would have been discourteous on our part not to present a report. It was our intention to ask the Senate to consider the report last session, but, owing to the great stress of business, it was impossible for the Government to allow any time for its consideration. At the last meeting of the Printing Committee it was decided to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> to give the Senate an opportunity to deal with the report this session. Practically all the recommendations which it contains have been adopted, except the fourth, which reads - : </para>

                <para class="block">That no despatch, report, or paper presented either to the Senate or the House be printed except (a) on a motion proposed by some responsible Minister for the Crown for special reasons duly stated ; or (b) on the recommendation of the Printing Committee of either Chamber duly confirmed. </para>
                <para class="block">Our object in wishing the report to be considered this session was to draw attention to that recommendation, which, we think, the Senate ought to adopt. In the past many documents have been tabled and ordered to be printed. The person who has presented a paper has moved, almost as a matter of form, that it should be printed, although it might be very voluminous, and the result has been that some papers, which I do not believe any members have read, have been printed at very great expense. With the view of insuring economy the Committee think that all papers which a responsible Minister considers ought not to be printed should bc merely laid on the table ; that at our weekly meeting we should look through the documents, perhaps obtain expert advice as to the cost of printing them, and decide whether dr not we should recommend that they should be printed. That rule is in force in the other House. I believe that is the only recommendation of last session which has not yet been adopted. The President has suggested that there are other matters which might be considered before the report of the Printing Committee is dealt with. I am anxious- to make its report as useful as possible, and I gladly acquiesce in the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> I believe that a postponement for three weeks will give the Printing Committee ample time to bring its report up to date by means of a supplementary report. </para>
