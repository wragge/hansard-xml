                    <para>During the past two years we have not been permitted by the temporary standing orders to debate the final motion for adjournment. In the majority of British Legislatures the rule is to permit a member, on that motion, to mention matters which require redress. At the present time we can only mention a matter which appears to be of urgency, by going through the undesirable process of moving the adjournment of the Senate, interrupting the whole business, and perhaps provoking a debate which may last hours on a question which might fairly be dealt with in a few moments at the end of the sitting. It must be patent to honorable senators that it is an undesirable thing to be continually upsetting the whole course of business by formally moving the adjournment of the Senate at the commencement of the sitting. I believe that it would make for the saving of time if we had, as the members of other Legislatures have, the opportunity of dealing with matters of grievance and urgency on the final motion for adjournment. </para>

                        <para>. - I presume that the members of the Standing Orders Committee had some good reason for putting this provision in the rule, and I can hardly understand its being struck out without a word from some member of that body. It appears to me that if the other two motions are. to be put without argument or opinion offered, it is necessary to impose that limitation also in the case of the motion for the adjournment of the Senate. The right to debate the motion should not be given unless it is carefully safeguarded, and then it might, on special occasions, be of advantage in enabling honorable senators to ask questions, as they do sometimes. If it could be moved at any time and debated we might as well give up all attempts to regulate business. 1 should like to hear some opinions offered before the question is put. </para>

                        <para>- I have stated once or twice, and I think that the statement is incontrovertible, . that all these standing orders are designed to introduce the most convenient practice for getting on with the business of the country. For over two years this rule has been in force. Has it led to any inconvenience ? Has it not worked well ? If that is so, why not leave it as it is ? I do not for a moment suggest that it involves any great principle. The majority of the standing orders are regulations for the conduct of our own business. I have lived under this rule for 35 years, and have never known it to work inconvenience. I do not think that any one can say that it has worked inconvenience in the Senate. Before the business of the day is called on, honorable senators have an opportunity of bringing forward any question which they think ought to be submitted at once. Is not that sufficient? They will also have the opportunity of ventilating any grievance which they may have whenever a Bill which the Senate may not amend comes from the other House. Is not that sufficient? I ask the Committee to consider this matter simply from the business point of view. Shall we get on better with the rule or without it? If the motion is to be debated, it certainly will be very inconvenient to some senators, especially on a Friday. I think that we should consider not only the convenience of the Senate, but the convenience of its members generally. There is no doubt that every senator must put aside his own convenience if the business of the Senate demands it. But will it not give unnecessary opportunities for debate if the paragraph is omitted? I hope that the rule will stand as printed. </para>

                        <para>- Although I am a member of the Standing Orders Committee, still I am unfortunately in conflict with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> on this question. When I found that under the temporary rules it was impossible to debate a matter on the final motion of adjournment I was quite astounded, for I had no idea that the Parliament of any State had such a rule in its code. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has said that he has lived under the rule for a great many years. Those of us who come from New South Wales, and I believe those who represent Victoria and Queensland, have lived under an entirely different rule. That fact might be regarded as a very strong reason why the amendment should be carried. It is perfectly true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has said, that if an important matter arises which requires debate and consideration, a senator may move the adjournment of the Senate at the beginning of the sitting. But it should be borne in mind that only one such motion can be moved on the same day, and that it must relate to one subject matter. In the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, where the adjournment was very frequently moved at the beginning of the sitting, the standing order had to be altered so as to provide that it could only be moved - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>For the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, the subject of which shall be first stated to the Speaker in writing. </para>
                    <para class="block">A small box resembling a ballot-box was provided by the Speaker for the reception of these notices, and on some occasions as many as eight or ten notices would be placed in the box by honorable members who desired to debate certain questions. He had to take by chance one of these motions out of the box. The number of matters of urgency which members wanted to have discussed was large. It is true that they had an opportunity of discussing them at the close of the business of the day, but they thought it better to take an earlier opportunity. Unless a matter is of very great importance it is not wise to bring it forward in the early part of a. sitting, when there are great inducements to talk which do not exist later in the day. A member who has a question which he wants to have discussed often says - " I do not like to waste three hours of the time of the House in debating this subject and delaying matters of importance ; I shall have an opportunity at the close of the sitting at 10 or 1 1 o'clock to make known my opinions." At that time the Government may be able to give the member the satisfaction he requires. It also lias to be remembered that at a late period of the evening an honorable member will probably condense his remarks and speak only for five or ten minutes, whereas earlier in the day he would be inclined to take his full half-hour. The question will not be debated by others at such great length as would be the case earlier in the day. In this way the practice which I advocate conserves time and gives half-a-dozen members an opportunity to speak briefly upon subjects in which they are interested before the adjournment. Of course there are other opportunities of . dealing with subjects of importance, but the bringing of them under the notice of the House on the motion for the adjournment has the effect of saving time. Take the case of a member who .makes himself a bore and a nuisance by frequently moving the adjournment. At the close of a sitting it is possible to count him out. He will then have had his opportunity, and the subject will be closed. In New South Wales a subject that had been once discussed on the motion for the adjournment could not be discussed again in the same session. I presume that we shall" adopt that rule also. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has mentioned the inconvenience of the sittings being prolonged on Friday afternoons, when many honorable senators wish to get away by train to South Australia and New South Wales. I should have no objection, speaking personally, to amending the standing orders in such a way as to provide that on Friday afternoons there should be no debate on the motion for the adjournment. We should thus conserve the interests of honorable senators who wish to get away earlier in the day on Friday, and should not unduly restrict the opportunities of others to discuss matters of importance. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment with the modification that it shall not apply on Fridays. </para>

                        <para>- If only upon the score of convenience, I have no hesitation in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> amendment. It is very convenient to be able, upon the motion for the adjournment, to lay before the Senate matters of importance. It may not be as convenient to do so earlier in the day. There are occasions when matters of urgency arise during the day, and there is no opportunity of discussing them, unless latitude is given in the v.r?.y suggested. I was very much surprised when we commenced business in the Senate to find that no latitude of this character was given to honorable senators. The rule which prevailed in the Victorian Legislative Assembly was a good one - that motions for the adjournment at the commencement of a sitting must be supported by at least twelve members rising in their places. But it was always permissible upon the motion for the adjournment at the close of a sitting to discuss grievances or questions of importance in connexion with "the business of the country. I think that is a good rule. I agree with all that has been said by Senators Neild and Gould. I believe that the proposed practice will save time, because at the end of the day honorable senators will not be inclined to go as fully into matters as they would do if there were more time at their disposal. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>NEILD (New South Wales). - I wish to make a remark in reply to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has said with reference to the opportunities we have of discussing questions on Money Bills. It will be within the recollection of honorable senators - certainly it is within my recollection - that the President has pulled up honorable senators in attempting to discuss public questions on such Bills. He pulled me up when I was discussing a matter of public interest in connexion with the Customs administration for instance. On one occasion I had to argue that the Bill before us was one for raising money, and that I was justified in discussing the expenditure of the money so raised. I refer to that simply to show that we have not any great amount of latitude to discuss questions of a general character upon Money Bills. With all respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> I would point out that we are not bound to slavishly follow the practice of the South Australian Legislature, merely because we have been using South Australian standing orders for two t years. Why are we passing new standing orders at all if we are not to improve or alter the past practice?We are are only wasting time. Let us tear the document up, scatter the work of the Standing Orders Committee to the four winds, and proceed with something else. We also might as well copy the South Australian statutes and make none of our own. I protest against the idea that because we have done something in the past we must never Alter it. At that rate we should never have had the Federation ; we should have been content with the old system. We have already, in the standing orders which we have adopted, made an immense innovation upon the old practice in allowing three speeches to be made by the mover of a motion ; at any rate, the new standing order seems to me capable of being read in that way. Hitherto the mover of a motion has had the right to reply, but not to speak to an amendment. Therefore we have gone back on our former practice, and on this fetish of the South Australian standing orders. It is a perfect fetish to some honorable senators. No doubt the South Australian standing orders are in many respects admirable, as is shown by the fact that we are taking extracts from them wholesale. But if we worship the sun, surely we may also recognise that the sun has some spots upon it ; and when we have an opportunity of removing the spots from the brilliant orb of the South Australian standing orders, we ought to do so. I have moved this amendment with a view of removing one of those sun spots, and of conserving the time of the Senate. I am quite willing, however, if it be the general desire, to alter my amendment in the direction indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> so as to meet the convenience of those who desire to leave Melbourne on Friday afternoons. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is anything very serious to argue about. The sense of the Committee is in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> amendment. A great number of us have a large amount of admiration for the South Australian standing orders, but we are not so keen about them as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> may imagine. I, for one, have no fear of any serious abuse in connexion with a suggestion which, to my mind, is an improvement ; because I believe that no senator would have the hardihood to take advantage of a provision like this to provoke a discussion at a late hour of the evening. If the Government perceived any danger of a senator embracing such an opportunity to " slate " them, all they would have to do would be to keep the business going until the last train was about to start, and then everybody would be anxious to get away. It would be almost impossible if, at half-past eleven, a senator got up to discuss a serious grievance, to keep a quorum. There would be a count-out very soon. In that way there would be a means of checking any abuse. If a senator wishes to bring forward a grievance which . is worthy of being debated, he ought to have an opportunity, and the most convenient time would be on the motion for the adjournment. I do not think that any alteration should be made in the case of Friday afternoons. The amendment should apply all round. If a senator wishes to bring forward a grievance on a Friday afternoon he has as much right to do so then as on a Thursday evening. The amendment can do no harm and should be allowed to be carried as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to ask the Committee to amend this standing order by the omission of the words," either explain same to the satisfaction of the President, or withdraw such words and apologize for their use," with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the words " withdraw such words." My object is to allow an honorable senator who has been named, to offer an explanation or apology in all cases. It will be seen that under the standing order an honorable senator is only given an opportunity of offering an apology and explanation under paragraph (c), and I think he should have that opportunity under all the paragraphs. I must ask the Committee to recollect that when these standing orders were reported, the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives had not reported their standing orders. They have since reported them, and it will be found that they have altered the practice. The practice they recommend is that when a member of the House has been named, he shall in all cases be entitled to stand up in his place and explain or apologize. I think that it is advisable for several reasons that we should follow the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives in, this matter. In the first place what they propose is not so drastic as what is here proposed, and in the next place it is advisable that the standing orders of both Houses should be similar upon a question like this.. In the third place I think that it is possible we may save a long debate if we permit latitude in these cases to any honorable senator who is named to explain his conduct. It is quite true that the conduct objected to has been in the view and hearing of honorable senators, and it may therefore, perhaps, be considered superfluous from one point of view to ask for an explanation. But I think it cannot do very much harm to permit an honorable senator who is named to make an explanation. I confess that I have altered my personal opinion upon this standing order since the Standing Orders Committee reported. Speaking for myself, and not for the Standing Orders Committee, I perhaps did not allow sufficient weight to the consideration that we have only 36 members of the Senate as against 678 members in the House of Commons. This is. the House of Commons rule, but what might be wise and even necessary for a House of 678 members might be objectionable in a House of 36. There is another consideration, that judging by the past, these standing orders are not required at all, because the conduct of honorable senators has been such that there has never been even a suspicion that any honorable senator on either side could have been named. It is however, advisable to have such a standing order as this for the future. But I think we might make it a little milder than it is at present. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>- I remind honorable senators that it is a very serious thing indeed for the President to name an honorable senator, and it will not be done except under the very greatest provocation, because if the President named an honorable senator, and a motion for his suspension were not carried by the Senate, he would be placed in a very difficult position. During the time I occupied the position of President of the Legislative Council in South Australia - eleven years - I only named a member of the Council once, and Senators Charleston and McGregor can certify that there was immense provocation, and that the legislative councillor concerned was not named without good reason. Here we have the certainty that no honorable senator will be named without the greatest provocation, and he should not be named unless he has wilfully and persistently disobeyed the orders of the Chair, and infringed the standing orders. But if he persists in such conduct for a third time he certainly should be punished Business would be impossible if some punishment were not meted out. We provide that for the first offence an honorable senator shall be suspended for the remainder of the sitting. </para>

                            <para>- It may be; but if an honorable senator habitually misconducts himself, surely he ought to be punished. I do not know whether there is any great magic in the provision for one month's suspension for a third offence, but that is the period prescribed in the proposed standing orders of the House of Representatives. It is advisable to have the standing orders of both Houses identical if possible in regard to this question. </para>

                        <para>- It is extremely undesirable that this standing order should pass as it stands. I hold that view, because we are placed in a rather peculiar position. If an honorable senator were suspended for a month, the State which he represented would be deprived of its full measure of representation for that period, and that is a consideration which ought to weigh with us. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter which the State concerned would be best fitted to judge. I think that the ends of justice would be served if an honorable senator were suspended for each offence for the remainder of the sitting. I do not think that we should go further. If an honorable senator were guilty of habitual misbehaviour, his constituents would be the proper judges to determine what should be done with him. If we have the right to deprive any State of its full measure of representation for any considerable period, we ought not to exercise it. I trust that the Committee will take these considerations into account, and amend the standing order accordingly. </para>

Honorable senators, with the exception, perhaps, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> cannot think that an honorable senator who has the confidence of the people of the State which sent him here, with a considerable backing of votes, is likely to offend in such a way that he ought to be sentenced to a month's suspension, or to what would be practically a month's imprisonment. I do not entertain such a poor opinion of the elect of the Commonwealth. The standing order should not be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- This standing order is supposed to work automatically, and the period of suspension should be stated definitely, instead of being left to the Senate for determination when a case occurs. If the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> and approved, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> that the Senate "may " suspend an offending member for a month or a fortnight, were made, the matter would necessarily involve a debate which would probably be very acrimonious, and extend over a considerable period, to the detriment of our general business. It would be much better to have some specific punishment fixed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> proposal, that a man should be suspended only for the remainder of the sitting, would not act satisfactorily. If an honorable senator were suspended to-night, for example, he would attend to-morrow, and might be prepared to create another scene. He would be again suspended, and that state of affairs might go on from day to day. </para>

                            <para>- Because we desire to conserve the time of the Senate.. If an honorable senator became so objectionable he would not be of much service to his constituents, and probably, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has said, those constituents would be much better served by his absence from the Senate. The Senate has power to expel an honorable senator for misconduct, but is it not better that we should have certain specific rules which will lead to no debate when a matter of this kind is being dealt with, than to have a provision which would necessarily involve debate, and might end in a representative of the Government having to propose the expulsion of the honorable senator ? </para>

                            <para>- I adhere to that provision, because it is similar to one contained in the standing orders of the House of Representatives, and because it is generally adopted. Take the case of an honorable senator who happened to offend to-day. He would be suspended for the remainder of the sitting. If he were a sensible man he would realize that he should not have behaved in the way which led up to his punishment ; but if he misbehaved again, that misbehaviour would be deliberate, and under the standing order he would be subject to further punishment. I think it is necessary to superadd the punishment to be inflicted in a case in which an honorable senator constantly offends. Whether the punishment for the third offence should be a month or a fortnight might be left to the discretion of the Senate. I am inclined to leave the standing order as it is, but if it is altered as suggested I shall not complain. </para>

                            <para>- Then I do not think we need trouble about providing for frequent misconduct on the part of an honorable senator. If an honorable senator were punished for misbehaviour twice, it would be right to expel him - if two lessons were not sufficient for him, it would be about time for him to go. I would not pile up penalties under the impression that any honorable senator is likely to be continually disorderly. I take it that there will never lie a case of disorder except when an honorable senator is under the influence of some special excitement. We know that men sometimes give way to temper, and create scenes. It happens all over the world, and the Senate is not likely to be any more immaculate than is any other legislative body. But it is impossible to imagine that there will be any persistent misconduct on the part of an honorable senator sent here by the whole body of electors of a State. We ought not to burden our standing orders with regulations imposing penalties under the impression that honorable senators will misconduct themselves intentionally and persistently. I protest against loading the standing orders with any proposal of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be well to allow the standing order to remain as it is. If an honorable senator is guilty of misbehaviour, he deserves to be suspended for the day for the first offence. As the President has said, such a punishment is by no means severe. The standing order provides that for a second offence an honorable senator shall be suspended for a week. No doubt an honorable senator so punished would recognise the true import of that suspension, but if he offended a third time, one month's suspension would not be too great a penalty. The knowledge that he was liable to a month's suspension for misbehavior would prevent any honorable senator from behaving in a disorderly manner. We have to provide standing orders which will stand for all time, for it is highly undesirable that we should be continually tinkering with them. It is our duty to look at the matter from every point of view, and to endeavour to make standing orders which will not require amendment. In these circumstances, I think it would be far better to agree to the standing order as submitted. </para>

                            <para>- Let each offence be dealt with on its merits. I wish to leave the fixing of the punishment to the Senate. Only yesterday an honorable senator actually suggested that the members of the labour party ought to be both gagged and flogged. If those words are not objectionable, I do not know what words can be objectionable. We ought to approach the consideration of this question, in a broad spirit. We . must look beyond the senator to the people whom he represents. In suspending a senator for a sitting, or a week, or a month, we are not only punishing him, but doing an act which is of very much more consequence - depriving the people who sent him here of their proper share of representation for the period of his punishment. We ought to give the advantage to the people who send a senator here. If a senator commits an offence of this kind, to suspend him for the remainder of the sitting ought to be quite sufficient punishment. If on the second day he offends again, repeat the punishment. If on the third day he offends again, repeat the punishment. Probably on the fourth day he may come here clothed in his right mind. It is exceedingly improper, under any circumstances except the most extreme, to deprive a State of its share of representation. It seems to be the height of folly to say that for a first offence a senator shall be punished by suspension for the remainder of the sitting ; for a second offence by suspension for a week ; for a third or any subsequent offence by suspension for a month, while the offences may be altogether different in their heinousness. The first offence might be the worst of all, and the last offence might, be a most trivial one. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that I cannot see my way clear to support the amendment. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> like myself, has great faith in the leniency and fairness of his fellow senators ; but I can conceive that, in a period of great excitement, even the Senate may resort to extreme measures, and perhaps exclude a senator who was considered objectionable for a considerable period. I am not anxious to see the standing order passed without the term of punishment being specified. I have gone through periods of excitement in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. I remember times when it has got into such a condition of mind that if the occasion had arisen I believe it would have excluded a member for the session. In many instances it was grossly unjust in its treatment of certain members who were considered objectionable. We are only framing this standing order for times of extreme excitement ; and, if the period of punishment is not specified, gross injustice may be done, not only to a senator, but also to the State which he represents. If a senator by his conduct makes himself thoroughly objectionable, undoubtedly he ought to be punished, because every legislative body must have some rules for maintaining order and good conduct. If a senator grossly offends those who may be endeavouring to do the work of the country in the best way, he ought to be suspended for a day, and if on another occasion he makes himself grossly obnoxious to his fellow senators, surely additional punishment ought to be inflicted. I do not think that he should be suspended for a month. It will be reasonable and fair if he is suspended for fourteen days. I do not wish to go to the extreme limit in the matter of punishment, nor do I desire to leave the rule in such a loose form that under certain circumstances the majority might not only act unfairly in a period of excitement, but on many occasions might act unfairly with the deliberate object of excluding a senator. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> can imagine that some circumstances may arise which may put the Senate into a condition of mind like that which he witnessed in the Queensland Assembly ten years ago. I hope he will recognise that it is unwise to leave the rule in a loose form. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the amendment has been withdrawn. I am inclined to think that suspension for a month is rather too severe punishment. I think that, without detracting from the salutary effect of the standing order, the suspension might very well be limited to fourteen days. I take it that these successive suspensions refer to offences committed in the same session, so that it would only be in the case of a senator's third offence in the same session that this would apply. It is only in extreme cases that the heavier penalty would be inflicted. I admit that the Standing order is not quite clear, and I think an alteration should be made. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be remembered that last session, when the Tariff was going through, a proposal was made to give a certain amount - we will call it a bonus - by way of encouragement, to persons who should grow sugar-cane by means of white labour only. The encouragement took this form in the Tariff - that whereas there was to be an Excise duty of £3 per ton on all sugar . manufactured within Australia, a payment equivalent to £2 per ton of manufactured sugar was to be given to those who grew their cane with white labour only. There was some doubt at the time as to how that provision would operate, and before the payments commenced to be made the amounts collected in excise, in the various States, were paid into a trust fund. Prom that fund the bonuses were paid. The balance of the money so collected has not yet been distributed to the States, with the exception of a sum that has been, as it were, advanced. There has been no final settlement because the exact basis upon which those payments shall be made to the States from the trust fund has not yet been decided. It has turned out in operation that this amount of £2 per ton, if deducted merely from the excise paid in respect of sugar grown by white labour, would fall inequitably on the various States. During this period the quantity of sugar grown by the aid of white labour was 30,000 tons. That is to say, bonuses have been paid to the amount of £60,000. The proportion of sugar grown by white labour, as compared with black labour, in Queensland, is as -15 to "85. The proportions in New South Wales are exactly the reverse, being 15 grown by black labour and -S5 grown by white labour. A groat difficulty has arisen because, notwithstanding all the care that has been taken, the sugars become so inexplicably mixed in the process of refining, that it is not possible to trace sugar from cane grown by black labour, as distinguished from that from cane gi own by white labour. We must treat the two kinds of sugar as being indistinguishable after refining. Therefore, supposing the payment of the bonuses were made as a rebate of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton from the £3 per ton excise, the burden of the policy we have pursued would fall entirely upon those States that are consuming locally-produced sugar. The proportions of locally-produced and imported sugar consumed in the States vary considerably. I do not think that any one could possibly have foreseen that the burden of assisting the sugar-planters in making the change from black labour to white labour was going to fall exclusively upon the consumers of locally-grown sugar ; and I do not think that any one believes that that would be an equitable arrangement. If it were followed out it would lead to most extraordinary results ; . because the States that use imported sugar receive £6 per ton Customs duty upon that  sugar, whereas the States which consume locally-produced sugar only get at most £3 per ton. If that state of things were to exist permanently it would be an advantage to the sugar-producing States to export their sugar, and to import sugar for their own consumption. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that any State would do it, but it was suggested in a letter written by the Premier of New South Wales that such a thing as that might possibly occur. I use the argument to show that an absurd result would happen if the burden were to fall entirely upon the States which consume locally-grown sugar, to the extent to which they do consume it. This question would not have been so acute had it not been for the partial . failure of the sugar crop in New South Wales, and more particularly in Queensland. Had there been an abundant crop, as in previous years, the local wants of Australia would have been nearly met by the local production of sugar, and in that case the burden would have fallen upon the whole of Australia fairly equitably according to the consumption of sugar. But it so happened that there was a very short crop, and consequently some of the States have relied almost entirely upon imported sugar. The consequence of that has been that their Treasurers have the great advantage of receiving £6 per ton import duty. That state of things cannot be expected to continue. As the local production increases, it must gradually disappear. When the local production overtakes the local consumption, this contribution as a bonus to the sugar-growers will, if we take as a. basis the consumption of sugar, be fairly equal throughout Australia. It cannot be expected that we should wait until that time arrives, and that cannot be a good system to- adopt which depends upon such accidents as I have pointed out, the accident of. the relative consumption of locally-produced and imported sugar in the various States, and the accident of the seasons. The Treasurer has supplied me with some interesting tables of figures which I have caused to be circulated amongst honorable senators. The total production of Australian sugar foi- the year 1902-3 is stated in these tables as 91,500 tons, and the total quantity of sugar imported was 85,500 tons. So that already during this year we are supplying more than half of our requirements, notwithstanding the very bad season we have had. </para>

                            <para>- The stocks held at the commencement of the year were 2,000 tons less than at the end of the year, so that involves a very slight variation. Of the 30,000 tons of sugar produced in Australia this year by white labour, it will be 'seen that 12,000 tons were produced in Queensland, and 18,000 tons in New South Wales. The total consumption in New South Wales is 68,000 tons, of which 60,000 tons is the quantity consumed within New South Wales, and 8,000 tons were distributed amongst the other States in this proportion : - 3,000 tons to Western Australia: 4,500 tons to Ta s.manina ; and-500 tons to South Australia. In connexion with the point to which I have previously referred honorable senators will see that these quantities of sugar being refined in New South Wales from sugar produced in New South Wales and Queensland, and then sent in these varying quantities to the other States, it is almost impossible, under the previously existing arrangement, to secure an equitable payment of- the amount due to the growers on the production of sugar by white labour. The Treasurer has shown at page 2 of the statement of figures circulated what would be the result of a distribution on a basis of consumption, and on a population basis. From these figures it will be found that New South Wales, on a basis of consumption, would have to find £44,400 out of a total of £6.0,000, and on a population basis £21,642 ; Victoria, on a basis of consumption, £2,500, and on a population basis £18,786 ; Queensland, on- a basis of consumption, £7,100, and on a population, basis £7,962. Honorable senators will see that, so far as Queensland is concerned, the proposed change in the method of distribution makes a difference of only a few hundreds of pounds. South Australia did not consume any locally-produced sugar, and on a basis of consumption she would therefore not have to pay anything, but on a population basis she would have to pay £5,65S. Western Australia on a basis of consumption would have to pay £2,400, and on a population basis £3,246 ;. Tasmania, on a basis of consumption £3,600, and on a basis of population, £2,706. If we were to adopt the principle of paying on a basis of consumption the amounts would of course vary from year to year. As I have pointed out, as soon as the local production overtook local consumption it would practically be the same all over the continent, but up to that time it would <inline font-style="italic">vary</inline> very much, because of the accident of one State relying more upon local production and another more on importation, lt may be fairly admitted, however, that until the time arrived when local production overtook local consumption there would be a tendency to a larger consumption of the local article in the States in which sugar is produced, but it is only in that respect that the proposed alteration would be of benefit to the States which produce sugar. The proposal made is simply to substitute for an unsatisfactory and inequitable principle of distributing this particular expenditure upon a basis of consumption, the principle of distribution upon a population basis. The only advantage to the States of Queensland and New South Wales, in which sugar is produced, will be that there will be a tendency in those States to a continually increasing consumption of the local article, until the local production overtakes the local consumption. It is only in that respect that there will be a slight and continually diminishing advantage to those two States. </para>

                            <para>- That is the amount collected upon sugar imported into that State. South Australia has had the great advantage - and it has been an accidental advantage - of collecting a large revenue upon imported sugar. But, as I say, if we were to adopt a distribution on the basis of consumption permanently it is perfectly clear that the various States might soon be engaging in a sort of cut-throat game by trying to unload locally-produced sugar on other States and importing their own. </para>

The revenue which New South Wales derived from imported sugar amounted to £66,000, and the revenue which that State derived from Australian sugar was £168,000, or a total of £234,000. Each State will get the amount of excise that has been paid in respect of sugar according to the consumption in that State, and the amount to be paid by way of bonus is new expenditure which under terms of the Constitution will be equally distributed amongst the States on a population basis. </para>

                        <para>- I think we are to be congratulated upon the presentation of this Bill to the Senate. It is a measure of fair play. The people of the Commonwealth as a whole, and particularly the people of Victoria and South Australia, were anxious that the policy of a white Australia should be carried out, and they must, therefore, be prepared to pay their proportion of the expense of that luxury. The peculiarity of the position is that the greater the success obtained in the cultivation of sugar by white labour the less will be the income received by the States of Victoria and South Australia from the present duty. In my opinion the whole of the revenue obtained from the sugar duties ought under existing circumstances to be distributed upon a population basis. If Queensland succeeded after a time in growing sufficient sugar by white labour to satisfy her own requirements, her revenue from it would be only £1 per ton under the existing arrangement, whereas if the people of South Australia used only imported sugar the Government of that State would secure a revenue of £6 per ton. It will thus be seen that the present arrangement is manifestly unjust. In order that all the States may be fairly dealt with all the revenue at present obtained from the duty on sugar should be divided on a population basis, no matter where it is collected. I intend to support the second reading of the Bill because it is a measure of fair play. I sympathize to some extent with the people of Victoria and South Australia, but they have only themselves to blame, because they were the most enthusiastic in supporting this form of protection. The result of the introduction of this policy of a so-called white Australia is a manifest instance of the unfairness of protection. The very State which has to bear the great burden of the cost of giving effect to it is being punished, inasmuch as the revenue obtained by it from the excise duty on sugar is only £1 per ton as compared with the revenue of £6 per ton obtained by the other States consuming imported sugar. Under the present system that state of affairs would exist until Queensland could supply the whole of Australia with the local article, when all the States would secure only £1 per ton from the excise duty. Every honorable senator knows that I did not favour the proposal for the expulsion of kanakas from Queensland, and I sympathized with New South Wales and Queensland, who appeared likely to be called upon to bear the whole of the cost of the white labour movement. Under this Bill, New South Wales will secure the treatment that it well deserves, for on a population basis, as against a consumption basis, it will gain £22,75S per annum. Tasmania will also gain £894 per annum.- It is quite true, as the Postmaster-General has said, that at present it would almost pay the Government of Queensland to offer inducements for the export of locally-grown sugar, so that the people there would use the imported article and the State would secure the increased revenue. It affords a striking illustration of the fallacy of protection. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend shakes his head ; but if he gives the matter a moment's consideration, I am sure he will be in entire agreement with my case. The whole course of his life, so far as we know him in this Chamber, has been that of a gentleman, who considers the well-being of his fellow men - and the well - being of women and children - before a great many other matters. That is his great characteristic, and I honour him for it. I think, therefore, that what I have indicated will meet with his approbation rather than the opposition that the shaking of his head perhaps implied. I desire to challenge one statement made by the Postmaster-General, and that is as to the quantity of sugar which has been grown by white labour in Queensland. I assert that the rebate has been allowed on sugar nominally grown by white labour, but in reality not grown in that way. At the close of last session I went to the north of Queensland for the express purpose of making a study of this matter on the spot. I took care to keep out of the reach and beyond the influence of proprietors of sugar plantations and sugar mills ; and, as far as possible, I sought my information from unprejudiced sources. This rebate, which has been allowed upon thousands of tons of sugar, has not been given in respect of sugar grown by white labour, but of sugar cultivated by coloured labour. It was probably only after the actual cultivation had ceased that the white labour came in. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator will tell me that he knows more about this matter than do the official inspectors of the Queensland Government, I shall, of course, implicitly accept his assurance. I am speaking, however, upon the authority of officials who have no interest in politics or in profits, and I say that it is a perfect sham to suggest that much of the cane which was made subject to rebate was ever grown by white labour. Stalwart men are not employed in cultivating sugar cane in Queensland. We have abundant evidence to show that it is practically impossible to obtain white men to cut cane, let alone to cultivate it. </para>

                            <para>- If the statements made in connexion with the Mossman mill are not correct, I am making reference to assertions which are not facts. I have yet to be assured, however, that a number of directors of a public company which has been in existence for years, and whose interests are concerned in the working, not the mere flotation, of a company, would deliberately meet together and publish statements that were untrue. The statements to which I refer were made not only by these directors, but by those who wrote to them asking for the return of deposits which they had forfeited, owing to their inability to supply white labour to cut the crops. That failure to supply white labour has occurred not once but twice. One contractor forfeited his deposit, and the directors made it a gift to the next man who came along and undertook the work. He was promised the deposit, but he not only failed to secure it, but lost his own as well. It is impossible to suppose that these statements are untrue, for they are contained in official documents. There is the <inline font-style="italic">ad misericordiam</inline> appeal for consideration at the hands of the directors, which was made by the man who failed to win the deposit offered to him and also lost his own. </para>

                            <para>- The honor-' able senator' will have an opportunity of dealing with the matter later on. If it is difficult and apparently impossible to secure white labour to cut a crop that creates its own breathing space, how much more difficult must it be to obtain white labour to work within the rows of cane, and to trash it, 'or, in other words, to remove the dead leaves. I am not speaking without some little personal knowledge of sugar-growing, because my late father was one of the most prominent pioneers of the sugar industry in New South Wales. He lost years of his life and thousands of pounds in endeavouring to establish the industry of sugar-growing, in New South Wales, at a point south of the line at which it has since been found profitable. "Therefore, I am speaking with an intimate knowledge of sugar-growing and sugar-making up to a certain point. I am not speaking as a man whose knowledge has been wholly obtained by reading reports and newspaper paragraphs, or even by visiting cane-fields. I am speaking with a sense of heavy family loss which, to a certain extent, is reflected upon myself as the son of a man who lost large sums of money, and many years of his life, in an endeavour to achieve success in a new industry. I hope that I shall be forgiven for this personal reference. I have made it simply with a view of showing that I am not a mere <inline font-style="italic">doctrinaire,</inline> or one who has picked up a few phrases about sugar-growing. So far back as the sixties, I had an immediate connexion with the industry. </para>

                            <para>- Not where we were situated. But I have not raised the question of kanaka labour, except in so far as I have said that we have been paying a rebate on sugar produced from cane supposed to have been grown by white labour, but which was never in reality cultivated by white labour. The future lies before us. Whether by Act of Parliament we can succeed in altering the decrees of Providence is a problem we are now attempting to solve. We have heard of the Frenchman who regretted his non-existence at the time of the Creation, because if he had been there he could have given the Almighty several useful hints ; and if, in accordance with a belief of that kind, we think we can alter the climate, the temperature, the atmosphere of the country, and also the characteristics of the worker, to suit existing labour conditions, by Act of Parliament, well and good. We are now engaged in that experiment, but I repeat that as regards the employment of white women by the rapacious husbands and fathers, and the employment of young' children, there is no word of condemnation that can be offered in opposition to such a state of affairs, which is not worthy of a" man who attempts to represent the people. I am saying nothing under the shelter of privilege. I published the same statements, with my name attached, in the morning press of Sydney when I came back from North Queensland. It is notorious that there are persons engaged in the sugar industry who are debasing their women folk and destroying the health of their young children by placing them at labour which the average white man will not tackle, and the advantage they obtain from this sweated labour is supplemented by a bonus? It is the worst form of sweating for a man to make use of a wife or a daughter or a child to do such work, which even with a £50 bonus thrown in he cannot get white labourers to tackle. That is what I am objecting to,' and that is what I intend to take the vote of the Senate on. I think that my honorable friends in the labour party will be the first to support the refusal to pay a bonus in respect of cane grown by female labour or by child labour, because if there is one particular subject to which they have devoted themselves, and for which they are entitled to credit in then-career as a political body, it is the effort by which they have successfully assisted to put down sweating in various trades. What sweating can be worse than the sweating of a man's own children and wife ? </para>

                            <para>- With this exception, and, perhaps, one other that I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> intends to bring forward, I am entirely in favour of" the Bill, which is, I believe, based on broad equity, because if Australia, as a whole, is to benefit by the white Australia policy, then all the States should pay the price of it, and the burden should not be thrown on one or two States. I give the Government every credit for bringing in a Bill which is equitable so far as I am able to form an opinion. I support the measure with the exception that I wish to see a provision made that child and female labour shall not be used to gather in the bonus, and I shall give my assent - at least, I think I shall- - to the amendment which is to be submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> with the object of securing a greater measure of equity in the distribution of the bonus. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).As regards the measure itself, I have nothing to add to what has been said. I propose to support the second reading. The oversight that has rendered its introduction necessary was one which was quite natural, and for which no blame can possibly attach to anybody. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has remarked, it was hardly possible to foresee everything when shaping the Tariff in the early portion of last session. It is one of those little oversights which we all have to share the responsibility of, and which may very well be pardoned. What I desire to draw attention to is the exact meaning of clause 2. I assume that its purpose is to insure that the bonus shall be paid to every cane-grower who uses white labour. But as it stands it almost seems to me that it will be only some of the employers of white labour who will get in. It decrees that the bonus shall be paid on sugar-cane or beet - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>As we know that kanakas are being lawfully employed in Queensland, and as the Act which provides for their deportation countenances their employment until the termination of their existing contracts, it seems to me that, under the wording of this clause, a sugar-grower using a kanaka after that date, and subsequently dispensing with him, and then reverting to white labour, could not claim the bonus on the sugar which will be the result of the employment of white labour. I understand that in the ease of sugar-cane it is possible to get two or three yields from one planting. </para>

                            <para>- We have a Federal law in which the planters were told that they could continue their engagements with their kanakas - under their State law they can continue to employ kanakas for a given period - and that those who dispensed with kanakas were to get a rebate. Taking advantage of the opportunity which was afforded to them of gradually dispensing with coloured labour, the planters proceeded to do so. This year a planter who has 50 or 100 kanakas under contract lets that contract run out, dispenses with black labour, and then employs white labour, but next year, although for the whole period of twelve months - from the reaping of one crop to the gathering of the other - he has never had other than white labour on his plantation, he is not to get a bonus, because the plant was planted some time previously. </para>

                            <para>- After that explanation, sooner- than see the Bill put through I shall vote against it. Because I do not believe for a moment that it was ever intended to tell the planters, when we passed the Pacific Island Labourers Act, concurrently with the sugar rebate provision in the Excise Act, that we were playing a fraud with them, for that is really what it amounts to. What was the good of offering .this opportunity of gradually dispensing with kanaka, labour if we were simply to say that for the whole time, seven or ten years; as long as a single root remained under cultivation, in the planting of which the kanaka had anything to do, the planter was not to get the bonus? </para>

                            <para>- It may be impossible for the honorable senator to understand what I understand, but I think I know. I have an assurance that four or five crops can be taken from one plant or root ; and, although the kanakas are there to-day under the Federal law as well as under the State law, if a plant is put in to-day with the aid of kanaka labour, and four subsequent crops are taken off it with the aid of white labour, and those four .are entirely cultivated by white labour, the planter cannot get the bonus. What is the planter to do with the kanakas whom he already has in his employ? </para>

I am not saying that so long as a planter employs kanaka labour he should get the bonus, but I do say that when he has " white-washed" his plantation and done 'what this Parliament wants him to do by dispensing with kanakas and employing white labour only, he should receive the bonus for the crops taken off his plantation during the time it was cultivated by white labour. He is entitled to ask for and receive the bonus provided for in this measure for what he has done in that respect. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable and learned senator means that the planting of the root by black labour means partly growing the cane by black labour, he is correct. But it is surely necessary to allow for the transition stage between the employment of white and black labour. It is necessary to recognise that something of the kind had to take place. You should not bring your guillotine down so sharply. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking of the action of the Government in the past. If I were I might have to employ stronger language. I am speaking of the Bill now before the Senate, and I ask for the judgment of the Senate as to whether it will allow the clause which I have been criticising to be passed as it stands. It is inevitable that, kanakas having been employed upon the sugar plantations of Queensland, some, legacy of their work should remain. You cannot get rid of them all at once. It must be seen that there is necessarily a stage when the planter will be passing from the use of black labour to the use of white. There must be a reasonable recognition of the facts of the case. The planters who have put in roots with the aid of black labour, cannot be expected to rip up those roots and re-plant with white labour. </para>

                            <para>- But what is the other position ? If you do not give the planter the bonus, he has every inducement to retain kanakas in his employment until his stools are worked out. I could understand it if the Government said, " While we, in tend to pay the full measure of the bonus for sugar which from the inception of the first planting has been handled by white labour, we will pay a smaller proportion of the bonus for sugar produced from crops that have been only partly handled by white labour." In the cases I have indicated, where plants were put in with kanaka labour and in subsequent years crops were taken off by white labour, to give the planters some proportion of the bonus in recognition of the fact that they have dispensed with black labour would be a fair solution of the difficulty. But to say that they are to get no bonus at all in the future and no inducement for dispensing with black labour is most unfair. Some provision should be made on the lines I have mentioned. While the full bonus is paid to those who plant and handle and cut their cane with white labour only, at least some proportion of the bonus - what proportion I do not say - should be given to those who in the later stages of cultivation have employed white labour only. I would allow nothing for the crop produced while kanaka labour was employed ; but the moment the planters dispense with their kanakas and employ white labour let them have the benefit of the policy we have sought to inaugurate, and give them a proportion of the bonus. </para>

The Bill now before us is certainly an improvement upon the previous measure, but it does an injustice to the State which I represent as compared with New South Wales to such an extent that I feel bound on behalf of Tasmania to ask my honorable and learned friend, the Postmaster-General, to pay careful attention to me for a few moments while I consider the terrible loss that Tasmania is going to sustain, and the exceedingly advantageous position in which New South Wales is about to be placed. I am alluding to the fact that very few black labourers have in the past been employed in New South Wales, and to the enormous loss of revenue which my State is suffering, while New South Wales suffers no loss whatever. </para>

                            <para>- I should like the Minister to understand that for the year 1900 the consumption of sugar in Tasmania was 7,800 tons, which at £6 per ton brought us in a revenue of £47,000. That meant a larger revenue than the whole of the income tax of Tasmania. But we are now called upon to suffer a loss of that revenue to such an extent that the question becomes very serious. I do not know whether my brother Tasmanian senators are going to support me, but I shall feel bound to propose some amendment with the object of doing justice to my State. Taking the excise at £3 per ton and the rebate for white-grown sugar at £2 a ton, if all foreign sugar is shut out, and if no rebate is claimed, Tasmania will lose £23,500 a year. But if rebate of £2 a ton is claimed on all sugar produced in Australia and consumed in Tasmania, our loss will be £40,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>- No ; from information supplied by the statistician of Tasmania. Our loss may range from £23,000 to £40,000. Even in the tables now put before us, Tasmania's revenue is put down at £34,500, whereas I have shown that in 1900 we received £47,000 from this source. A small State like mine cannot afford to suffer this enormous loss. I never heard that there was any black labour trouble in northern New South Wales. I understood that the great bulk of the sugar cane produced there was - to all intents and purposes - cultivated by white men. My argument is borne out by the figures before us, which show that the sugar produced by black labour in Queensland was85 per cent. of the whole quantity, whereas in New South Wales the sugar produced by black labour was only 15 per cent. of the whole. Those figures show that there are really very few kanakas employed in New South Wales. Yet Ministers have been induced to bring in a Bill which will make the consuming States, which are already losing seriously on their sugar revenue, pay a bonus to New South Wales for inducing her to do what she has always done. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid we cannot, but that is no reason why an injustice should be done to Tasmania. The facts show that instead of conserving the interests of Australia, as some of us thought we were doing, we were simply the slaves of a phrase when we inaugurated this policy. I want to call attention to the loss of revenue which the Commonwealth is going to sustain. Let us look the facts fairly in the face and see exactly what we are doing for the sake of making Australia white - when we know all the while that it is going to be piebald. I understand that the consumption of sugar is about 180,000 tons, and if the time comes - as come I hope it may - when the whole of our sugar is produced in Queensland and New South Wales - principally in Queensland - we shall lose on the basis of £5 a ton about £900,000 a year. When the consumption has increased to 200,000 tons the loss will be absolutely £1,000,000. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to supply us with an estimate showing what the Minister for Trade and Customs and his officers think we shall have to pay for a white Australia. Let us know what it is going to cost, and then let us ask ourselves whether the game is worth the candle <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Probably our friends in the labour corner may say that it is worth while, and other honorable senators may have the courage to say that it is not. If it is going to take from Tasmania a revenue of £30,000 a year in one item, all I can say is that we cannot possibly afford it. </para>

                            <para>- What is the use of my honorable friend talking in that way? It is not a question of telling the truth, but a question of opinion. We all know that at certain times it is human nature for people to wish to go with the crowd. It is not a question of the truth - I wish it was - it is a question of opinion upon which no two of us agree. Our experience, since we passed the Act, goes to show, so far as evidence can be obtained, that we have probably made a mess of it. I do not care to consider whether they can or cannot, but we have evidence to show that white men will not do the work required to be done in the north of Queensland. That evidence comes to us from bishops, clergymen, and missionaries, who desire to see a white Australia as much as any honorable senator in this Chamber. All the evidence coming to us goes to show that we cannot get the sugar industry efficiently attended to by white labour. </para>

                            <para>- Not to the same extent. I understand that it was stated in another place that the real difference in cost between the cultivation and harvesting of cane by white labour, as compared with black labour, is only 6d. per ton. Honorable senators will see, that, in this Bill, we are allowing 4s. per ton. Do not let us make any more blunders. Is a bonus of4s. per ton a fair bonus? We have been told by an honorable member in another place that 6d. per ton. would be a fair thing, and it will be admitted that there is a vast difference between 6d. and 4s. I ask the Minister in charge of this Bill, and every other honorable senator, before we agree to pay a bonus of 4s. per ton, to see that we have statistics and facts to enable us to determine what a fair bonus would be. There is an enormous difference between 6d. and 4s., and I should like to know where the truth lies. Another matter alluded to at some length by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is old ground as far as I am concerned. When I went to Bundaberg I found the planters there up in arms, and when I came back I tabled certain questions in the Senate, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> gave me bluffing answers, amidst the cheers and laughter of the labour party. When. I got back to Tasmania, I was so impressed by the gross injustice of what the Government was doing that I wrote to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and I got back a snubby letter. Within a month from that time, the Minister for Trade and Customs had done the very thing which he had been requested to do by the planters and by myself. On two occasions he very properly extended the time during which the planters could register as being willing to cultivate entirely by white labour. The Senate has sanctioned the continuance of kanaka labour until the 1st January, 1907, and we have also sanctioned the introduction of kanakas up to the 31st December, 1903. Taking those facts in conjunction with the point in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and myself are interested, it will be seen how grossly unjust this Bill is. We allow the planters under the law to introduce black men up to the end of this year, and we compel them to introduce them under, I believe, a three years agreement. We thus facilitate action on the part of the planters in introducing kanakas. Some of the planters may have extended their agreements with the kanakas for a further three years. Yet if they plant cane by black labour, and at any time hereafter say that they are going to employ white labour, and actually cultivate with white labour for twelve months, they will not be entitled to a bonus. If the planter has entered into an agreement with his kanakas, and is bound to keep them, surely he has a right to plant cane with that black labour ; and if the moment their agreement is up he deports them to their islands, and then continues to cultivate that cane for twelve months with white labour, as a matter of right and justice we cannot deny him the bonus. Just as the Minister for Trade and Customs would not listen to what he was urged to do by the planters and by myself, and yet on two subsequent occasions extended the time, so will the right honorable gentleman again have to extend the time provided for under this Bill. </para>

As between the poorer States and the planters, I do not know that we should go a step further. We have treated them most liberally. I am in a difficulty, because while, as between planter and planter, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milieu's</inline> contention, as between my own State and the planters I think we are being asked to pay far too much for a white Australia, when we might have avoided paying anything if we had simply allowed the kanakas to die out. </para>

In dealing with a measure of this kind a number of side issues demand consideration, and all I plead for is that honorable senators will give this Bill full consideration in order that we may not make another blunder which we would have to correct later on. So firmly do I believe that we shall make a blunder, that I should like to limit the Bill to some extent, and if it could be done under the Constitution I should certainly move the omission of the words " the Commonwealth," with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words " within the State of Queensland." If that cannot be done under the Constitution I scarcely know what course we should adopt, but I shall avail myself of such opportunities as present themselves to show the injustice which Tasmania is suffering from. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to supply us with figures showing the actual difference in cost in the planting and harvesting of sugar-cane by white and by black labour, because, as I have stated, we have been informed that the difference is only Gel. per ton and not 4s. as provided for in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- This Bonus Bill will operate very unfairly as regards South Australia. In South Australia we have been paying a heavy penalty for a great many years in order that the idea of a white Australia might be given effect to. In obedience to the sentiment in favour of a white Australia we prevented the introduction of coloured labour into the Northern Territory. But, notwithstanding the sacrifice we have made, of some £S0,000 a year for several years, we are now called upon to make another great sacrifice on behalf of a State that paid no respect whatever to the white Australia sentiment, but whose people on the contrary, in the most selfish way, proceeded to develop its territory in the way most profitable to themselves. We have laboured under the disadvantage of maintaining the idea of a white Australia, and have suffered a large loss of revenue. The prodigal daughter, Queensland, is now coming back to the fold, and is making a great appeal for consideration, because she is prepared to support the idea previously given effect to by South Australia, and we are now asked to put the ring on her finger and kill the fatted calf. </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable senator is being more generously treated than other people in South Australia. I can quote figures taken from official statistics of the State of South Australia, and also figures supplied by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It will thus be seen that the Colonial Sugar Company's charges have really been increased by £3 per ton, and it is difficult to understand how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is able to obtain sugar for the price at which he previously secured it. As a matter of fact, consumers of sugar in South Australia are to-day paying £4 5s. per ton in excess of the price they would have had to pay for it if we had not federated. On October 1st, 1901 - seven days prior to the laying of the Tariff on the table of the House of Representatives, and at a time when the duty on sugar was £3 per ton - the price of the Colonial Sugar Company's 1A sugar was £16 5s. per ton under bond, and £19 15s. duty paid. On 1st November of the same year - a few days after the introduction of the Tariff - the prices were £16 5s. under bond,, and £22 5s. duty paid, the duty having been increased to ±'6 per ton. Honorable senators will see, therefore, that the price was increased to the full extent of the additional duty imposed. On the 1st November, 1902, the price of sugar all over the world - and this is a matter to which I would call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> special attention - had fallen £1 5s. per ton. The prices in South Australia were then £14 5s. under bond, and £20 5s. duty paid. The price of sugar under bond had fallen, but it will be seen that the full extent of the duty was added to the ruling rates. The present prices in Adelaide are £15 10s. per ton under bond, and £21 10s. duty paid, so that even now we are paying more for our sugar supplies than we had- to pay prior to Federation. There has been no juggling in connexion with these prices. They are quotations from the Colonial' Company's 1a sugar, and they show that, notwithstanding the fall of £1 5s. per ton since 1st October, 1901, the price of 1a sugar, duty paid, in Adelaide has increased by £1 15s. per ton. The fall of £1 5s. per ton in the price of sugar all over the world, and the additional £3 for extra duty, represent £4 5s. more than we should be paying had we not federated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> tells us, however, that he is paying no more for his sugar than he had to give for it prior to the introduction' of the Tariff. Instead of now being called upon to pay £1 15s. per ton in excess of the price demanded before Federation, we should really be paying £1 5s. per ton less. ' That would have been the position had we not federated. The position is very clearly stated. Owing to the imposition of the duty nf £6 per ton, the people of South Australia are now called upon' to pay 100 per cent, more duty on their sugar than they were required to give for it before. But it may be urged that the whole of the £97,000 revenue which has been collected from this source has gone into the coffers of the State, and that the Government has received the full benefit of the increased collection. We have been clearly told, however, by the Postmaster-General, that in prosperous years sufficient sugar will be grown within the Commonwealth to supply the wants of the people of Australia. That is what we are all hoping to see ; but we have to remember that .is soon as that position is reached, South Australia will be credited with only about £16,000 a year, instead of the £97,000 per annum now obtained from this source. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Consequently South Australia will have to make up that loss of about £80,000, which represents about ½d. in the £1 on our land tax by means of increased taxation. Notwithstanding that we shall lose that amount through the Customs, the consumers will not pay less for their sugar. We are asked to contribute a further sum of £5,000 per annum to Queensland and New South Wales, although it has been shown that New South Wales never employed coloured labour to any great extent. This proposal would not have been applied to New South Wales but for the fact that the Constitution provides that a bonus shall not be given for a specific purpose to any one State, but shall be applied to the whole Commonwealth. South Australia has been making great sacrifices, and now she is to be called upon to sacrifice nearly £100,000 a year, in order that she may subscribe to the finances of New South Wales and Queensland. The financial position of these States is better than that of the State which I have the honour to represent. New South Wales at nil events is in a better position than South Australia, while Queensland is doing what we decline to do in the interests of this sentiment.' This Bill will be monstrously unjust to the people of South Australia. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> has referred at considerable length to the great injustice which will be inflicted upon the State which he represents if this rebate is applied on a population basis. Prior to Federation no Excise duty was levied on sugar grown in Australia, and the existing duty of £3 per ton really means that the sugar-growers of the Commonwealth have to pay that impost for the privilege of carrying on their operations. In other words they are called upon to pay to the people of Australia as a whole the sum of £274,500 per annum, although to those who produce their sugar by white labour a refund of £60,000 is to be made. It will thus be seen that instead of any injustice being inflicted upon any State by reason of the imposition of this excise duty, a very great benefit is being conferred upon the States among whom the revenue so obtained is distributed. The imposition of the duty has been a distinct advantage to the various States. Of course, a portion of the impost is returned if the sugar upon which it is levied is grown by white labour ; but I cannot see where any injustice occurs. </para>

                            <para>- But the excise will continue after that period has elapsed. The honorable senator said that South Australia had made enormous sacrifices in order that the policy of a white Australia should be carried out, and that Queensland had acted in a most selfish manner. South Australia certainly prohibited coloured people from entering the Northern Territory. The Government of that State had an opportunity of leasing the Northern Territory to a syndicate upon the condition that they should have a free hand in regard to the employment of coloured labour, and they are entitled to a certain degree of credit for refusing that offer. It must be remembered, however, that no State would have allowed a syndicate or a chartered company to take -such an enormous area under its exclusive control. Therefore, while South Australia is to be commended for its action in that matter, the fact must not be overlooked that it did only what any other State would have done in the circumstances. </para>

I would point out that Queensland was the first State in the Commonwealth to prohibit the introduction of coloured labour. Thirty or 40 years ago when there were something like 30,000 Chinese on the goldfields near the Palmer River, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Douglas brought in a Bill to prevent coloured labour from coming into Queensland. That Bill was not assented to by the Imperial authorities, and, in order to carry out its object, the State Government had to resort to something in the nature of a ruse - it had to apply strict quarantine regulations, and quarantine all ships which came from China and other parts with coloured labour for Queensland. In view of the fact that the present proportion of coloured labour in Queensland is not nearly so large as it is in the Northern </para>

                            <para>- I am not referring to that fact. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> contention is an admirable one. If the people who are growing sugar in Queensland desire to substitute white for coloured labour, surely we should give them every encouragement. In dealing with this matter we must recollect that, having put in a crop, the planters do not plant again for from three to six or seven years. If we say to them that until they have put in their crops by white labour, they shall not reap the benefit of this rebate,' although they employ white labour in all the remaining operations, we shall force them to continue the employment of coloured labour, although, ostensibly, we desire them to discontinue it. If the amendment is carried, and we provide that as long as they employ white labour from the time of one cutting until the next takes place, we shall mete out justice to them. If they comply with that condition they will be undoubtedly entitled to the refund. Many of these people are employing coloured labour at present, and if we carry the Bill as presented by the Government every kanaka that it is possible to introduce this year into Australia will be brought in. Those who are in the unfortunate position of having failed to plant since the 2Sth February last will receive no benefit so long as their crops continue, and therefore they will import as many kanakas as the}' can in order to derive the benefit of cheap labour. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that Queenslanders generally must feel very grateful for the manner in which senators from other States have met this proposal of the Government. There are only two States - Queensland more so than' New South Wales - which are particularly desirous of getting this bonus. While we are naturally anxious to get the benefit of the bonus, and of a white Australia, we must see that we do not defeat our aim. I venture to think that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> proposition is carried out we shall not succeed in our desire to have cane produced by white labour. Perhaps honorable senators may think it strange that I should urge a limit to be put on this proposal, but I do so in the interests of the producers of white-grown sugar. When the Pacific Island Labourers Bill was passed, towards the end of 1901, all the planters knew that kanaka labour was to be done away with. The Government and all those of us who favoured a white Australia were in a dilemma as to how best to encourage the white grower, and it was decided that the best way would be to give a rebate of 4s. a ton to the man who produced his cane with white labour. A number of growers - over 1,000 - registered to produce white-grown sugar, and the question was put to the Minister - " Am I to be debarred from getting the bonus because I planted my cane with black labour in 1901? I do not think I should be so debarred." The Minister said " No ; we shall not debar you because your cane was planted in 1901. We shall not. debar you if your cane was planted in the early part of 1902. But if you plant cane with black labour after that time you will not get the bonus." That was the limit at that time. Senators Dobson, Drake, and others went through Queensland, and a number of cane-growers said that they did not know that the white Australia policy was likely to be so successful, otherwise they would not have planted their cane with black labour, and they wished to know if they would be debarred from getting the bonus this year if their cane was planted with black labour at the end of 1902. The Minister came out with a new regulation, and said - " Those who plant cane with black labour up to February, 1903, shall get the bonus, but we are not going to allow any further extensions. If you plant cane with black labour after the date you will not get the bonus." What will happen if it is made possible up to the- end of 1907 for a man to claim . the bonus for white-grown sugar? How will the Government be able to say what is white-grown sugar ? </para>

                            <para>- If they register twelve months before, I imagine that it will not be open to the end of 1907. To show the success of the rebate or bonus system, 1,600 out of the 2,610 planters mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> in his report - all small men it is admitted - are registered to produce white grown sugar. If we allow a man to get the bonus this year, to employ kanakas next year to do the greater portion of the work in producing white grown sugar, and to come along in 1905 and ask for a bonus, is that fair to the planters who have continued to employ white labour since the commencement of the. operation of the Act ? I do not think it is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> knows of some cases in which the planters have taken advantage of the bonus for 1902, and as soon as it was paid, reverted to the use of black labour. Is that what the Senate wishes to encourage? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has told us that at Cairns he was waited upon by a deputation of planters, who said that they would be perfectly satisfied with this concession. Some honorable senators think that an injustice is being done, but I am satisfied that no injustice will be done in limiting the time to 1903. The great injustice which I think the Bill does is in providing that, at the end of 1907 the bonus shall cease, because in the Commonwealth we have 60,000 coloured aliens. The Premier of Queensland, who hoped the white Australia pOlicy would get a fair trial, has said that a number of the planters in that State are employing Hindoos, Chinese, and other coloured aliens in place of the kanakas. What is to happen at the end of 1907, if one plantation has 100 Hindoos employed and a neighbouring one has white men employed? Should not the planters who employ white labour receive some encouragement ? Would honorable senators by the withdrawal of the bonus compel those planters to revert to the employment of coloured labour - Papuans, South Sea Islanders, or Hindoos <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I imagine that there will be considerable difficulty in getting rid of the kanakas. </para>

                    <para class="block">I shall do my best to see that the provisions of the Act are carried out, but we do ' not know what obstacles may be placed in our way. Now, dismissing the kanakas from our consideration, we have in the Commonwealth 70,000 other coloured aliens, in respect of whom we have <inline font-style="italic">uo</inline> legislation. Until the law is altered we shall not be able to send the Chinese away, and in all probability a number of the bigger planters who now employ South Sea Islanders will, as soon as they have to get rid of that labour, employ Hindoos and Chinese. The small grower who is prepared to employ white labour should be in some way encouraged in that regard, and should not be asked to compete with the planters who can employ Hindoos and Chinamen. This sugar question has given the free-trade party a nut to crack. Although we have an import duty of <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per ton and an excise duty of £3 per ton, yet the people throughout the Commonwealth, so far as I can ascertain, get their sugar cheaper now than they did before. </para>

                            <para>- If we took off the £6 per ton, the sugar industry in Queensland would be ruined. Even with black labour we could not compete with sugar-producers in other parts of the world. There is no getting away from the solid fact that, while we are paying £6 per ton on imported sugar, we are paying less for our sugar retail. I shall try in Committee to secure an extension of the term from 1907 to, say, 1910. I know that the date 1907 which we fixed in the Customs Tariff Bill has created a fear in the minds of sugar planters that the rebate may be taken away from them at that date. The date ought to be extended in order to give them an additional assurance. The excise ought to be retained, because it does not come out of the growers' pockets, but largely out of the pockets of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The bonus or rebate of £2 per ton has been a God-send to the growers of cane by white labour in Queensland, because they get the same price now for their cane - 12s., 13s., or 14s. per ton - as they did before, in addition to the bonus from the Government. The storekeepers and others throughout Queensland ' are delighted with the change, and have become converts to the white Australia policy. I do not anticipate that those who favour that policy will have any trouble with their constituents at the next election, so that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser's</inline> doleful prognostications as to what is going to happen to me at the hands of Queenslanders are not likely to be realized. </para>

They now have to undo what they formerly did. I am not going to oppose the Bill - unless I change my mind afterwards - but even if we make this alteration there will be more trouble ahead.

                            <para>- There was a nominal duty throughout Australia I am quite aware, but every honorable senator knows that it was of no value. It was of about as much use to the producer as would be a duty imposed on wool, wheat, and butter. I have bought sugar in Queensland for the last 35 years. Quite recently I have paid as low as ten guineas for No. 3 sugar produced in Queensland. The sugar was sold in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and Tasmania, and even in London, without any advantage from' a duty and competed with sugars grown in other parts of the world. It was a remarkably cheap product from the point of view of the Queensland people. Of course Queensland sugar, sold in Melbourne in competition with sugars produced elsewhere, could not be cheaper than the other sugars because it had to pay duty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but the men who grow their sugar by white labour have now and always will have the advantage of £5 per ton over imported sugar. Of course that is an immense pull to them, and until their sugar is exported will continue to be an advantage. I do not begrudge them the advantage, considering the disabilities under which we have placed them. But, though it is of no use trying to gather up spilt milk, what ought to have been done was to leave the sugar business alone for a few years. Really and truly there was no white Australia about it. The industry would have made great headway if we had let it alone. It will , not make great headway under difficulties, because, no matter what honorable senators say, it will be impossible to grow sugar north of Townsville, without black labour - or labour that will be able to stand the climate. It cannot be done. We now have proof that it cannot be done. I have repeatedly said on the floor of this Senate and now repeat that we ought to have left the sugar-growers alone : because people cannot, even if they wish to do so, grow sugar by white labour in Cairns and similar districts. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that there may not be a struggling small man here and there who may attempt ' to do it, but I maintain that sugar will not be grown north of Townsville as successfully as it has been grown with the aid of black labour. It is impossible. To grow it with the aid of white labour means asking white men to do what they ought not to do, and cannot do if they try. This policy means putting back that part of Queensland into a primeval condition, which is a foolish thing to do. The statistics before us fully prove my statement. Only 15 per cent, of the sugar grown in Queensland is produced by white labour. This Bill does not treat the growers fairly. Suppose a man puts in a crop this year. The stools will produce sugar for five or six years. It does not appear to me to be at all fair or equitable to refuse to pay that man the bonus, if in the future he cultivates and harvests his sugar with white labour. Is it to be said that because the cane was put down by black labour last year, and because the grower continues to produce sugar from the roots that are in the ground, and employs white labour only, he is to be deprived -of the bonus which is to be paid to other growers? The position is absurd and unfair. A grower may have put in a crop with the aid of black labour some years ago, and there may be alongside him a man who put in his cane with white labour. It will require an army oi inspectors to carry out this business. We have too many inspectors already. The Commonwealth is overladen with public servants. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to say a few words about this Bill, which is one I entirely disapprove of. I do not desire to touch upon the subject of a white Australia, beyond saying that when Queensland spoke out so very strongly upon that subject, she ought to have realized also that if her policy was to be carried out she should be responsible for the burden it entailed. She should not have expected that she would be allowed to come cap in hand and ask such a poor State as Tasmania to pay for the privilege she desired to obtain. Last year Tasmania's share of the burden to enable Queensland to secure the privilege was £16,206. We lost that amount of money, and got nothing in return for it. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not think that Tasmania did. Speaking for myself I was most strongly against it. I say that here in the Senate Chamber, and I can go out upon it. I do not see why the Government should now penalize Tasmania still further to the extent which will result from the operation of this Bill. I am sure that every honorable senator is animated as I am myself with a desire to deal fairly and squarely, and to treat all the States of the Commonwealth liberally and properly. But in a matter of this kind it is the duty of the Government to consider the straits that the smaller States are put into financially by the passage of legislation of this character.

                            <para>.- I quite admit that, but the honorable senator will agree with me that we require some scheme which will deal fairly with all parties. The honorable senator spoke of honesty of purpose just now, and all I ask for is honesty of treatment for the different States. When I find that the small State of Tasmania, which is now in great difficulty financially, is called upon to pay £16,206 for this purpose, it appears to me that the Government cannot have given sufficient consideration to the position of that State, or they would not have brought forward a Bill like this without some provision to meet the case I have laid before the Senate. </para>

The Bill is a very simple one, as honorable senators will see, and consists of only three clauses, giving the necessary authority for the alteration to which I have referred. </para>

                            <para>- The total amount of the increased subsidy, namely, £16,000, will remain, but the proportions had not been worked out at the time that the motion was framed and placed upon the notice-paper, and, therefore, I could not then give the exact amount. I shall now show the proportions of the subsidy which will be paid by the various contributing bodies. The arrangements relate to services which are practically one, and it is just as well that we should deal with them in that light. The contract, which was originally entered upon for a series of .four years, expired .on the 30th April last. There can be no doubt that during that period the service resulted in a considerable loss, owing largely to the fact that the trade between Australia and Canada has not yet had a fair chance to develop. We hope that in consequence, among other things, of the establishment of more immediate cable communication between Canada and. Australia, the traffic between these two great countries will increase. In the meantime we are asking for authority to extend this service for another two years, so that at the expiration of that time we shall be able to consider the very much wider question of a service of a much better character. I may mention here that I have endeavoured to make arrangements, so that all our mail contracts, including the coastal contracts of the various States, shall fall in about the same time. In that way we shall have a very much better opportunity to negotiate for a first-class mail service. I have had some figures prepared which perhaps will be interesting to honorable senators. They involve matters in regard to which I am continually being questioned, and perhaps it would be as well to place them upon record. The contract for the P. and O. and Orient lines, of which we have heard so much of late, will terminate on the 31st January, 1905, and the subsidy is £72,000 per annum. The contract for the Canadian-Australian line, presuming that this extension is ratified, will expire on the 30th April, 1905, and the subsidy in connexion with it will comprise £13,636 7s. 3d. paid by New South Wales, and £10,227 5s. 6d. paid by Queensland. Then there are certain Queensland contracts. For example, we have the A.U.S.N. contract to carry mails between Brisbane, Cooktown, Gladstone, Townsville, and Cairns - generally known as the Barcoo line - which expires on the 28th October, 1905. The subsidy in that case is £16,750 per annum. There is also the Gulf Line from Brisbane to Normanton, which will expire on the 15th January, 1906, and the subsidy in connexion with which is £6,000 per annum. We have recently entered into a short contract with regard to Tasmania, which will expire on the 30th September, 1906. Under that contract we shall be paying at the rate of £500 per month until the 30th September next, when we shall pay at the rate of £9,000 per annum until 3 1st January, 1905, when a large new steamer will be put into service ; the payment will then be . £13,000 per annum. Another contract provides for a service on the north-west coast of Western Australia - from Fremantle to Wyndham. It will expire on the 2Sth February, 1906, and under it we are paying £4,000 per annum. The contract for a service on the south-east coast of Western Australia - Albany, Esperance, and Eucla - expires on the 31st December, 1905, and for that service we are paying £6,000 per annum. For the service between Adelaide and Port Darwin we are paying £3,600 per annum. These represent the principal contracts that we have for the carriage of mails by sea. It will be observed that they will all expire during the year 1905 or the beginning of 1906, when we shall have to decide the big question of the mail service between Australia and Great Britain. We do not know what service the companies that are now doing the t work, or other companies that may attempt to come in, will be prepared to offer us, but I think it will be agreed that we should have as many strings as possible to our bow when the time comes to call for tenders. That time is rapidly approaching, and I am now taking steps with a view to calling for tenders for new services. It is certainly desirable that when that time arrives we should be able to offer what inducements we can to first-class companies. The service to which this motion refers cannot be put forward primarily as being a postal service, nor can any of the others which I have mentioned. It has been the practice in the past for the various States to debit the expense of these services, to the Postal Department. That practice has been looked upon as a convenient one, but I hope that we shall soon follow the example of other countries, such as Canada, and have a commercial or development fund for the purpose of subsidizing services which, in the main, are run, not for the- purpose of carrying postal matter, but to develop commerce and accommodate shippers and passengers. </para>

                            <para>- This particular extension will be charged to those States. Al* hough it will be a new contract in the sense that we shall have to draw up a fresh agreement and sign it, we regard it really as being an extension of the existing service. The old agreement has actually run out, but the company has been paid to continue the service from month to month. We propose now to extend it for two years from the 1st of May last, in order that it shall not come to an abrupt conclusion. There can be no doubt that the company has lost very heavily in the past in carrying out this service. Of course I cannot undertake to say definitely what its losses have been. Various amounts have been stated, but it cannot be denied that the service has been a losing one for them. In making the new arrangement, therefore, we had to consider the terms upon which the company would consent to carry on for another two years. That matter involved long negotiations between the Government and the company, and the increased amount of £16,000 was the lowest that they would consent to accept for the continuation of the service. Hitherto the subsidy has been paid in the following proportions : - New- South Wales,. £10,000 per annum; Queensland, '£7,500 per annum; Canada, £25,000 per annum ; and Fiji, £1,500 per annum. Those payments make up the total subsidy of £44,000 which has been given up to the present time. The increase of £16,000, which will bring the total subsidy up to £60,000, has been apportioned in this way : Canada will pay an additional £9,090 18s. 2d. per annum, the Commonwealth an additional £6,363 12s. 9d. per annum, which will be debited as transferred expenditure to New South Wales and Queensland, and Fiji an additional £545 9s. Id. per annum. The increased sum of £6,363 12s. 9d. to be paid annually by the Commonwealth will be distributed between Queensland and New South Wales, so that the last-named State will be called called upon to pay £3,636 7s. 3d., while Queensland will contribute £2,727 5s. 6d. per annum. One condition which has been insisted upon by the Government and agreed to by the company is that the <inline font-style="italic">Miowera,</inline> which, as is generally known, is not equal in speed and convenience to the other two boats on the service - the <inline font-style="italic">Moana</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Aorangi</inline> - shall be taken off for one trip and completely overhauled. Necessary repairs are to be effected and she is to be improved, so as to be made thoroughly efficient to the satisfaction of the Prime. Minister, or at his option, of the Postmaster-General. If the <inline font-style="italic">Miowera</inline> is improved so as to give that satisfaction, we reckon that she will be able to make her trips as satisfactorily as the <inline font-style="italic">Moana</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Aorangi,</inline> and we shall then have between Australia and Vancouver a service which will be very satisfactory from a passenger, as well as a cargo, point of view. Of course, as. a postal service, it will also be of very great advantage to us as between Australia and Canada. </para>

                            <para>- From three to four days longer than it takes the mails by the P. and O, line to go to England. So far as Canada is concerned, it is an up-to-date and as good a mail service as we could expect to get. We should have no regular communication with Fiji if it were not for this service. I do not think that I have put the case too strongly because it is of no use to try to make out that it is a first-class mail service. We ask for an extension principally because it is one of our trade routes, and a route in a direction in which we hope that trade will considerably develop. We think that it would be a very unfortunate thing if at this particular time that service should cease. </para>

While I say that I am not prepared to take exception at this stage to the proposal that the whole of this expenditure shall be charged to certain States, I wish to place on record that I am not prepared to sanction that as a principle so far as the vessels which have to do with our outgoing commerce are concerned. I admit at once that it is a renewal of an existing arrangement, but that arrangement was made when the States were separate entities and had necessarily to arrange for the conduct of their affairs. Surely it was not unreasonable £o assume that once Federation became an accomplished fact all matters of this kind were to be dealt with by the Federal authorities for Federal purposes. This mail service, the cost of which is to fall on two States is distinctly for the benefit of every State in the Union. Can it be supposed for a moment that only the mails of New South Wales and Queensland are transmitted by these boats ? I think it would not be at all difficult to show that this is a charge which might fairly be laid on the Commonwealth. I am not prepared now to take any exception to the motion, or to move any amendment, but as one of the representatives of New South Wales, I wish it to be distinctly understood that, whilst at the present time I agree to the motion, I do not, in any way, indorse the proposition which it really contains. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that. At the same time, I think it must be admitted that I am stating a reasonable case, and I hope in a reasonable way, when I say that this mail subsidy is distinctly for the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. Surely it was to be supposed that in our external relations matters were to be dealt with from a Commonwealth stand-point only - that if there was any purpose in establishing the Commonwealth at all, it was to permit of that being done. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite true, but they will not affect the contention I am advancing - that this charge is one which might fairly have been distributed amongst the States seeing that the result of ' the expenditure must be a general benefit. I do not mean to say that the lion's share of that benefit may not be reaped by the two States containing the ports of call. These subsidized steamers running to another country must clearly carry the mails of all the States. </para>

                            <para>- The poundage is so small that it is hardly worth talking about. I do not think that it in any way affects my contention that since this service is for the good of all the States it ought to be paid for by the States in proportion either to the population or to the benefit which it is held that they derive therefrom. Seeing that I have approached the subject with some idea, so far as the representative of one State can do, of rendering some slight assistance to the other States, I may be pardoned for expressing the hope that the representatives of the other States will consider, in a similar spirit, any proposition wherein it may appear that New South Wales gains some slight advantage. I wish to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the time-table. If a letter which I had the opportunity of perusing is correct, there has been a great deal of clumsiness in fixing the dates for the despatch of the vessels. I understand that two steamers largely serving the same purpose have sailed on the same date. </para>

I do not hold him responsible for the sailing of the other boat, but I merely suggest that some step might be taken to largely increase our mail facilities with the American continent and Europe.

                            <para>- I am very pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has spoken as he has done. My attention has also been drawn to this matter. If it is to be a purely mail service, it is a question whether it would not be more rapid <inline font-style="italic">viâ</inline> SanFrancisco. But I take it that the wish of the Senate is rather to support the all-red route, and hence our willingness, I presume, to put up with the slight delay in the carriage of the mails. The information which has been furnished to me would seem to show that very shortly a mail will go from San Francisco to New York in three and a half days, and consequently it is desirable that our mail boats should possess a greater rate of speed than they have hitherto done. I was glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> say that theMiowera is to be replaced - by a boat of larger tonnage, I presume? </para>

                    <para>The Bill is designed to prevent an inconvenience which, we think, may arise under the wording of the Constitution Act on the occasion of the next election of senators. We have the general provision with regard to the election of members of the Senate, which, I think, is perfectly clear to all senators. We have all gone through an election for the term of six years, and I think I need hardly say anything with regard to that portion of the subject. Section 15 says - </para>
                    <para>If the place of a senator becomes vacant before the expiration of his term of service, the Houses of Parliament of the State for which he was chosen shall, sitting and voting together, choose a person to hold the place until the expiration of the term, or until the election of a successor as hereinafter provided, whichever first happens. But if the Houses of Parliament of the State are not in session at the time when the vacancy is notified, the Governor of the State, with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, may appoint a person to hold the place until the expiration of fourteen days after the beginning of the next session of the Parliament of the State, or until the election of a successor; whichever first happens. </para>

                    <para>That has happened in the case of two States - in Victoria by the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood,</inline> and in Western Australia by the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing.</inline> Consequently at the next election for senators in those States the people will be called upon to elect three senators for six years, and one senator for the balance of the term of the senator who was previously sitting here. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable senator for the correction. Still, the one case is sufficient to illustrate the position. The case that has occurred recently may happen again - that there may be some casual election to fill the place of a senator whose full term was six years. In Victoria at the next election the people will be called upon to elect three senators for six years, and one for three years. The question is, how is that to be done <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It might be done by holding separate elections at the same time : one of three senators for six years - for which any one, under the conditions of the Constitution Act, might be nominated - and one for a senator to sit three years. It appears to me that a very great difficulty might arise from holding separate elections for the senators for the six years term, and for the one senator for the three years term, at the same time. It would be exceedingly difficult for electors to know how to vote. In the first place, the probability is that those persons who were nominated for the six years <inline font-style="italic">term</inline> would also be nominated for the three years term ; because the per sons who were nominated for one of the full terms might feel that, in order to secure their election, it was wiser also to be nominated for the shorter term. On the voter going to the polling place he would find four, five, or six names on the voting paper for the election of the three senators who were to be chosen for six years. He would have to vote for those senators, and then take another ballot-paper containing the same names, and vote for one senator for the three years term. </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly what we are saying in this Bill. By following the line of common sense, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has reached the conclusion that the Government recommend. Certainly our proposal has the merit of simplicity. We assume that every candidate would like to be elected for six years, if possible, but that if he cannot succeed in securing election for six years, he would like to be elected for three years. Therefore, the fairest course is to elect the four senators together, allowing any number of persons to be nominated for the four seats, letting the first, second, and third on the poll be elected for six years, and the fourth on the poll be elected for three years. This seems to be the simplest and the fairest plan, and obviates the difficulty that might arise if we attempted to have two elections at the same time. </para>

Probably I speak feelingly upon the point because, as far as I can see, the measure can only affect the State of Victoria on the present occasion. But other senators have an interest in it because, if it becomes law, it may affect them in the future exactly as it will now . affect senators from Victoria. There is a provision in the Constitution for the rotation of senators. When we had to arrange as to the retirement of senators, we agreed ,that the three lowest on the poll for each State should be the first to retire. When that arrangement was made, there were a good many honorable senators who did not agree with the proposal. </para>

                            <para>- There may be a good many reasons which lead to a candidate being low clown on the poll. The money element entered strongly into the last election. A candidate with £10,000 at his disposal in a State election has a much better chance than a candidate with only £100 or £200. On the occasion to which I refer, the Government proposed that for each State the three senators who were lowest on the poll should retire at the end of the first three years. Many of us thought that that was hardly fair. Although I did not oppose the arrangement, I considered that' the fairer method would have been to choose the retiring senators by- lot, because, as I have already said, there are elements apart from political capacity which play an important part in elections. </para>

                            <para>- The moneyed men have a great advantage in these elections notwithstanding our Electoral Act, because, as the Americans say - "Money speaks." Those whose friends spend money in their behalf always have the best chance. Certain senators were penalized by the arrangement to which I have referred. Now, under this Bill, a retiring senator, because he happens to be 40 or 50 votes lower on the poll than a man who comes in to fill a casual vacancy may, under the peculiar conditions to be created, lose the chance of election for a six years' term. That is not fair. It is not just. I will illustrate the case of those who in 'Victoria will retire at the next election as against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid,</inline> who has' been elected to fill the seat formerly occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood.</inline> Senators Best, Styles, and myself will retire and seek re-election. At the last election there was a very close contest so far as we three were concerned. A little more that 3,000 votes divided us. Suppose that at the next election there are for the four seats five candidates. It may be that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> will obtain a few more votes than I secure. In that case, under this Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> will get a six years' term, and I shall have to face the electors again at the end of three years. That is to say, I shall have to contest three elections in five and a half years. </para>

I would place the other senator, who is chosen to fill the casual vacancy, in the position in which he was when he came into the Senate, namely, of having to sit for the tei in of the senator whom he succeeded. </para>

                        <para>- I notice that in connexion with the nomination clause of this Bill we are directed to " see the principal A.ct." I find that the section to which we are referred in the principal Act disqualifies a member of a States Parliament from being nominated for election as a member of' the Federal Parliament. That in my opinion is not a section which should have been introduced into the Act. I know that when the Electoral Bill passed this Chamber there was no such clause in it. I was not here when the Bill came back from another place, and I intend to refer to that section now. It seems to me that it was intended to give to honorable senators a monopoly of their seats. I have no doubt whatever that that was the object of the section. Most of us won our place and position through our reputation in State politics, and our only formidable opponents when we seek re-election will be. those who are similarly known to the electors. According to the section no member of a State Parliament can be nominated for election to the Federal Parliament, unless he resigns his seat as a member of the State Parliament at least a fortnight before the day of nomination. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that, but we are directed to that section by this Bill. We know that the Commonwealth Parliament offers very few attractions to State members, because the sacrifice of time involved in attending this Parliament is too great. The objection to the section is that it unduly restricts the choice of the electors. </para>

                        <para>- I think that perhaps upon consideration the President may be inclined to admit that a Bill "to make further provision for the election of senators" might be amended in almost any direction. On the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson,</inline> if I may be allowed just a word, I would say that, while I opposed the section calling upon State members to resign before they could be nominated for election to the Senate, because I thought it was unfair, those who were in favour of that section certainly had something to say on their side. They argued that if such a provision as that were not included in the Federal Electoral Act, a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives might hold two seats, and they pointed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson</inline> as a shocking example of the evil which they proposed I to avoid. The honorable senator, in addition to the seat which he holds in the Senate, holds a seat in the Legislative Council of Queensland. </para>

We are now discussing a Bill to provide in what manner senators who occupy casual vacancies shall be elected, and I do not see that that has any necessary connexion with, or is relevant to, the question 'now being raised. There may be great differences of opinion upon the matter referred to, but it is not raised by this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I shall leave that matter, and deal with the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett.</inline> I do not think that the honorable senator's position would be very much improved if the arrangements proposed in this Bill were not made. I think it will be a convenience to the elector, if, when he comes to vote, he has a ballot paper enabling him to fill four vacancies, rather than two ballot papers, one enabling him to fill three vacancies, and the other enabling him to fill one. I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> whether he thinks he would not be in just the same position if there were no casual vacancy to be filled ? If the honorable senator could not secure a. place amongst the three senators to be elected, if there were no casual vacancy he would be left out altogether, and would really be in a worse position. In the case of a man who could not secure a place amongst three senators, but who might secure a place if four were to be elected, it is an advantage to have, a by-election taking place at the same time as the election for the three senators. </para>

                    <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).I should like to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General and the Senate to what appears to me to be an oversight in this Bill. It sets forth certain forms, schedules («) and (6), which are modified duplicates, of schedules in the principal Act. I see nothing in the Bill now before us to substitute the schedules <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">(I)</inline> for the schedules in the principal Act, and a difficulty will arise as to whether the forms of the principal Act or- the schedules of this Bill are to be used. For instance, there is a slight variation in the form of the writ for elections, and the Bill does not say that the modified form here proposed is to take the place of that set out in the principal Act. I ask which form is going to be used? I think there should be something in the Bill before us to say that the schedules attached to this Bill are substituted for the forms provided in the main Act in order that the matter may be made perfectly clear. Honorable senators will remember that in the Sugar. Rebates Abolition Bill, which was discussed this afternoon, it is clearly stated that bounties are to be substituted for the rebates. In a similar way, I think that this Bill should state that the schedules attached to it are to be substituted for those in the principal Act. I invite attention also to the clause of this Bill dealing with the powers of the Court of Disputed Returns. I do not know that the opening for any difficulty is quite so wide in this case, but if honorable senators will look at clause11 of the Bill they will find that the Court of Disputed Returns is given power to declare three things, one of which is that any candidate who is not returned as elected was elected to fill a periodical vacancy or casual vacancy as the case may be. If honorable senators will turn to the principal Act they will find that under section 197 a similar power is given in slightly different terms. I am not at all certain whether the ingenuity which sometimes marks the legal fraternity may not determine that as this measure is the later one something is intended other than that which is provided for by section 197 of the principal Act. Under subsection (3) of section 197 of the principal Act the Court of Disputed Returns may declare any candidate duly elected who was not returned as elected. </para>

                        <para>- If the two Acts are to be incorporated why should we state twice, and in different terms, what we wish the Court of Disputed Returns to do. This is not an additional power, but one which is already given to the Court of Disputed Returns, and there is therefore no necessity to reaffirm it. If it is intended that there should be any variation of the powers conferred upon the Court of Disputed Returns it would be as well to make some reference to the fact in this Bill, and possibly to repeal section 197 of the principal Act. But if that is not intended there is no necessity to reaffirm in this Bill a power already conferred upon the court. I should like to say with regard to the very important and interesting point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                            <para>-I am very pleased to hear it, because I am sure that honorable senators, and myself particularly, will welcome the. return of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> after the coming elections. I could not help thinking that, in the views which the honorable senator enunciated, there was a claim that honorable senators have something like a prescriptive right to a seat in this Chamber. Stated in that bald way that may perhaps appear to be a startling doctrine to enunciate, still, I think the views enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett,</inline> when boiled down, come to that. What the honorable senator's contention amounted to was this : If four senators have to be elected, one of them, because he happens to have held a seat here previously, should be given some advantage over another. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, but I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> enunciated the doctrine which I have stated in somewhat different words to the Senate - that if on going up for election the four ex-senators are returned, the three who have held seats in the Senate for the longest term shall have some prior right over the fourth, and whatever number of votes they may poll the fourth man shall be the senator returned to serve for a three years' term, even though he may have polled two votes for every one polled by the other honorable senators. I do not say that the majority is always right, though it generally is when I happen to win an election, but I remind honorable senators that we shall be treading upon very dangerous ground if we attempt to lay down in a Bill of this kind anything which departs from the principle which the Bill itself contains. I see no reason for what has been suggested, and I think that people outside will probably consider that it is an attempt to establish some prescriptive right to the seats they have once given us. </para>
