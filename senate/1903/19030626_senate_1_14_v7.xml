                    <para>The adjustments of revenue between the States, as directed by section 93 of the Constitution, have been made with one exception, viz. , that duties collected by the various States under their State Tariffs between 1st January and 8th October, 1901, inclusive, on goods transferred after the latter date from one Mate to another, have not yet been debited to the importing and credited to the consuming States. The raison for this is that the Customs-Department considered that the operation of the section did not extend to goods imported into* States prior to 8th October, 1901. The necessary information is, however, now being obtained with a view to making the additional adjustment required. </para>

                <para class="block">I believe that the motion will meet with such acceptance at the hands of the Senate that' I shall not take up more ,than a moment or two in stating my reasons for placing the transparent truism involved therein on the paper. The very first Bill which the Senate received from the House of Representatives was the subject of some little conflict between the Houses, resulting in a decision being mutually arrived at which has been maintained as the - established rule to this day. The only exception was that to which I now call attention in the Vice-Regal speech closing last session. The first Bill of a monetary character which reached the Senate from the House of Representatives had its preamble framed in the following terms : - </para>

                <para class="block">We took exception to that. We fought out the question as far as we could by request, and gave an instruction to the Committee as a whole, without division, and, if I remember rightly, almost without debate. When we got into Committee, certainly without division, and after very little debate, we formulated the proposal that a request should be sent to the other Chamber, desiring that the position of the Senate, as having an equal right in the voting of Supply with the House of Representatives, should be acknowledged. Then, for the third time, the House of Representatives sent us the Bill with this preamble - </para>

                <para class="block">The framework of that preamble gave a proper recognition of the position of the Senate under the Constitution. It was accepted by this Chamber, as satisfying the requirements of the Constitution. Since then every Bill having for its object the voting of money, that has reached us from the other Chamber has contained exactly the same preamble. Yet when it came to the closing of Parliament, and the mouth of the Senate was, so to speak, shut, there being no opportunity for us to maintain the position which is ours by the Constitution - not by any claim for privilege, or by any demand set up by the Senate for a recognition of a position to which it is not entitled, but under the terms of the Constitution itself - we were astounded to hear the following words used in the ViceRegal address in this very Chamber - </para>

                <para class="block">That, to my mind, was a distinct and deliberate attack made by the framers of the Governor-General's speech upon the constitutional position of this Chamber. I do not wish to refer to bygone incidents, or to hang any considerable argument upon the facts I have adduced in regard to this matter of the address at the close of last session. What I desire is, however, to refer to the subject as indicating what may be made the cause of a conflict between the two Chambers in the future, unless the constitutional position of the Senate in the matter of the Grant of Supply is 'properly recognised, as .we claim that it should be. It will be observed that, in framing my motion, I have made no allusion to the incidents which I have adduced as reasons for its adoption. I have scrupulously avoided any reference that could possibly be regarded as being of a party character. Such references as I have made in my speech have been solely for the purpose of justifying the moving of the motion, which I consider to be necessary. I am not wedded to the terms of the motion, though I think that its language is sufficiently dignified to be worthy of the Chamber as containing an expression of our desire that our constitutional position shall be recognised in future in connexion with Commonwealth Vice-Regal addresses and messages. I claim nothing more, and nothing less. It cannot be assumed that this is in any way a party motion or anything more than a proposition submitted to the Senate with a view of maintaining intact the position which we occupy under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>

The trouble appears to be that, in proroguing Parliament, the Senate was not joined with the House of Representatives in being thanked for the Grant of Supply. It does not appear to me to be a matter of very great moment, but possibly the honorable senator is justified in attaching some amount of importance to it. I will not raise that question. If, however, the honorable senator will now withdraw his motion, seeing that it has had the effect which he desires, I will undertake that the Governor-General shall be advised in future to join the Senate with the House of Representatives in his thanks. </para>

But I heard last night that my honorable and learned friend, the Postmaster-General, regards it as a vote of censure, partly upon the Government and partly upon himself. How can it be a vote of censure upon the honorable and learned senator when all I am doing is to suggest that he is being overworked and should have comradeship in the conduct of the business of the Senate, instead of being left to "play a lone hand" as he very often is? No member of the Senate more cheerfully recognises the courtesy and ability of my honorable and learned friend, the Postmaster-General, than I do. If he entertains the idea that my motion is directed against him, I say plainly that I shall be compelled, in accordance with parliamentary custom, to withdraw it, because I should be bound to accept his assurance if he said that he considered it to be aimed at him. But, on the other hand, the honorable and learned senator, in accordance with the same parliamentary custom, will be bound to accept my assurance that the motion is not aimed at him, so that each of us has a gun loaded and equally dangerous. </para>

But, seriously, I do offer to my honorable and learned friend the assurance that, so far from there being any suggestion of a personal attack upon himself in the motion, I am disposed - if he maintains that view - out of my regard for his courtesy and ability in the conduct of the business of the Senate, to decline to proceed with it. I should decline to proceed with any motion that could justly be regarded as a personal attack upon any member of the Senate. But, at the same time, I may give some justification for the motion. Let me here say in advance that I do not intend to proceed to-day with the next motion that stands in my name upon the business paper. </para>

                        <para>- Certain communications have passed between the Minister for Defence and myself with reference to the next motion standing in my name.

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General is right. I now remember that we did sit on a previous Friday. My experience this session has been that I have come down from Sydney and remained in Melbourne four days, though the Senate has only sat two days out of the four. There have been constant adjournments because the Government had no business to go on with.. That happened last week. Had it not been that the Postmaster-General was ready to proceed with other business to-day we should not have had a Friday sitting. The Government appear to be getting more reasonable . Here I congratulate the Postmaster-General upon his almost invariably reasonable method of conducting business. Little frailties attach to us all, and I will not pay my honorable and learned friend the poor compliment of flattery by saying that he is always perfect. No one is. But I do congratulate him upon a distinguished courtesy, and a very distinguished and wide ability. That does not, however, alter the fact that the Senate has, over and over again, thought that the honorable and learned senator should have a colleague. Over and over again we have, by word of mouth, if not by resolution, urged that the Senate should be recognised as a Chamber in which the Government should be represented by more than one Minister. It is not fair to the Minister, or to the Senate itself, that there should be only one representative of the Government here. </para>

                        <para>.- I cordially agree with the honorable senator. The fact is that when the present Ministry was formed, the Prime Minister forgot what was the position of the Senate under the Constitution. He overlooked the fact that it was the most powerful elective House of any Legislature in the British Dominions. He regarded it as a kind of glorified nominee Chamber, and thought that one paid Minister would be able successfully to cope with all the Ministerial work that might be forthcoming here. It must be patent to honorable senators that such is not the case. Even a rudimentary study of the Constitution will show that the powers and the work of this Chamber are of a very much broader character than are those of a mere Chamber of revision. The promise which the Postmaster-General gave a few minutes ago that, in future addresses from the ViceRegal Throne, proper recognition will be given to the fact that this Chamber has an equal voice with the House of Representatives in the granting of supply, must convey to the people of the Commonwealth the fact that the Senate is very far from being limited in its powers and authority to the position of a Legislative Council in any one of the States. That being so, it is surely desirable that the many expressions of opinion which have fallen from honorable senators - and which have come at least as often from the Government side as from the opposition side of the Chamber - should be put into the form of a declaration, such as is involved in the motion, which I, with great respect, have the honour to submit for the consideration of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator gives me his assurance that this motion is not levelled at myself personally. If it is not, it must be levelled at my colleague the Vice-President of the Executive Council. There are two Ministers in the Senate, and what occasion can there be for this motion, if there is nothing to complain of - and I say there is not - in regard to the conduct of our business during the present session. As a matter of fact, I think there was no reason to complain last session. Without making any invidious comparisons, I think I may say that the business was then conducted in this Chamber as well as it was in the House of Representatives. We had the same work to perform as had another place, even if we did not talk as much ; and if, with two Ministers in the Senate, we were able to conduct our business as well as it was transacted with a larger number of Ministers in another place, why should a question of this kind be now raised ? I am strongly of opinion that there has been no cause of complaint whatever as to the conduct of business this session. We have had sufficient business to keep us fairly well employed. It is not the rule for the Senate to meet more than two, or at most three days a week at the beginning of the session, and this is the second Friday out of five on which we have sat. Honorable senators will remember that on the Thursday previous to the week in which we held our first Friday sitting this session, we dealt with some private members' business, so as to obviate the necessity of meeting on the following day. We took <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> motion, and there was no other urgent business that required our attention. On the first week of the session we sat on Tuesday, Wednesday, and  Thursday. We met on Friday 12th June - the first day set apart for private members' business - and the present sitting is being devoted to the same work. We have been going along under easy sail. We have always had business to transact, and we have in sight sufficient work to keep us occupied until other measures come to hand from another place. I have leave to introduce the Patents Bill, which will be read a first time this afternoon, and will be ready for the second reading on Wednesday next, so that we have important work to engage our attention, although we have not yet received any of the heavy Bills from another place. But in one respect we are ahead of that Chamber, which has not yet found time to pass its standing orders. In view of these facts, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> says that he has no special fault to find with the way in which the business of the Government is conducted </para>

                    <para>- I confess .that I am disappointed with the speech which has just been delivered by the Postmaster-General. The honorable, and learned senator regards this motion as being either a reflection upon himself or upon his colleague, whom we all admire, and whom we should like to see here. I have spoken very plainly in reference to this, matter .on previous occasions, and I intend to do so again. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is not here because he is not adequately paid for his services. Why beat about the bush in regard to. this matter ? The motion is not a reflection on the Postmaster-General - who leads the Senate with a considerable degree of tact, ability, and courtesy in the absence of his colleague - nor is it a reflection in the slightest degree on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with that interjection. No one can dispute the fact that we have very extensive powers and privileges under the Constitution. We are not in the position of a Legislative Council, and we, have a right to see that a fair proportion of the Executive Ministers, properly paid for their services, have seats in this Chamber. On two or three occasions I have called the attention of the Senate to what, in my judgment, amounts, to say the least of it, to the casting of a slight upon the Senate. We have 36 senators, or nearly half the number of members of another place, and yet the House of Representatives have six paid Ministers, while we have but one. Is that fair ? Who is responsible for this state of affairs ? Certainly the Ministry of to-day, and I assert that they have treated the Vice-President of the Executive Council in a shabby manner. It is unfair to ask him to be here continuously as an honorary Minister, and to expect him to depend upon the paltry sum of £400 a year. </para>

                        <para>- It has a great deal to do with me. I insist- that we should have Ministerial representation here according to our rights and powers and number of members. This motion is neither a reflection on the Postmaster-General nor on the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but it is a serious reflection on the Ministry as a whole. I am here to support the policy of the Government, but not to support an injustice. I believe that a gross wrong has been inflicted upon the Vice-President of the Executive Council by the shabby treatment which he has received from a pecuniary point of view. I feel very strongly upon this matter, and if only one honorable senator votes in the division on the question with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I shall be that one. If the honorable senator had not raised the question I should have done so at an early date. Further, I may say that I shall take every possible opportunity of referring to it. </para>

I wish to see the Senate treated properly, and I am not willing that it should be treated merely as an exalted' Legislative Council, but in accordance with the terms of the Constitution, under which our powers are similar to those ,of the House of Representatives, except that we cannot initiate Money Bills. I think that honorable senators should affirm, in the terms of the motion proposed, that we are not satisfied with only one paid Minister. If the Government are willing to send one honorary Minister, in addition to two paid Ministers, to represent them in the Senate, we shall have no objection. But, so long as I am here, consistently with the rules of the Senate, I shall protest in the strongest language at my command against the Senate being treated with an indignity which I hope honorable senators will no longer bear. </para>

                        <para>- The whole difficulty is that Ministers wish to introduce their own Bills, and I admit that there is a good deal of force in the contention. That difficulty is really the ground of our objection, because on that account almost all Bills are introduced in another place, as an honorary Minister does not as a rule introduce Bills, and the Postmaster-General would introduce only Bills affecting his own Department. We raise no objection to the conduct, of business by the Postmaster - General, or by the honorary representative of the Government in the Senate, with whose position we sympathize. But the Senate is placed in a very invidious position, and the whole of the business of the Commonwealth is paralyzed by the introduction in one House of the Parliament of all the principal measures discussed. What have we been doing ever since Parliament opened 1 The Senate has practically been a debating society during the whole of the time. We have been discussing trivial measures of no importance, and we have been simply marking time. We have had the standing orders to discuss in order to keep us going for a certain time ; we have had private members' business to take up the Fridays' sittings; and we have sat only two days a week in order to string out as much as possible the time taken up with the measures which have been introduced in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- That may be true ; but on the third day we have only discussed private members' business, which, though of incidental importance, is not really the business of the country. There are only two ways in which this objectionable state of affairs can be remedied. One is the appointment of two or more paid Ministers to the Senate ; the other is a suggestion, which I throw out tentatively, that Ministers should be allowed to introduce Bills in either House. </para>

                        <para>- Those are the remedies for the present unfortunate state of affairs. If the course I suggest had been adopted, the Minister for Defence could have come into the Senate to introduce the Defence Bill, and we should have got over the personal difficulty of his desire to introduce his own measure. If that had been done, we could have discussed that important measure, instead of wasting time as we have been doing since the Senate was called together. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> motion is a very timely one, and that it is entitled to serious consideration. As to there being any intention to cast any personal slight on the Postmaster-General, I believe that every member of the Senate recognises the able manner in which the honorable and learned senator has conducted the business. We have not the slightest fault to find either with his ability or with . the manner in which he has represented the Government in this Chamber. </para>

                    (New South Wales).With the previous speakers I desire to say that I personally bear the highest testimony to the able manner in which the representatives of the Government have conducted the business of the Senate. But we have to consider the public at large as well as ourselves. There is an impression abroad now that the House of Representatives is the predominant House of the Parliament, and we should let the public know that men of prominence in the political world may have an opportunity of enjoying office even though they happen to be members of the Senate. At present there is only one Minister holding a portfolio in the Senate, and when, in the course of time, a change of Government takes place we can only expect that the new Ministry will be represented in the Senate in the same way. We know that human nature is the same in politicians as in members of the general public, and men like to have an opportunity of occupying prominent places in the Government of the country. The consequence under the existing system will be that the majority of men of prominence will naturally prefer to go into the other House. I desire to see at least two Ministers with portfolios in the Senate, and if there are honorary Ministers - and there are two in the present Cabinet - there would be no objection to one being a member of the Senate. I have a strong personal esteem for the two representatives of the present Government in the Senate, and they will, I think, admit that' honorable senators on this side have endeavoured to show them every respect. I am sure that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline>
                    as he has already told us, has no wish to say anything disparaging of the Postmaster-General. I should have preferred the motion to be so worded as to take effect from the beginning of next session, because a general election, so far as the House of Representatives is concerned, will take place in the meantime, and we could then have had the Ministry represented by two paid Ministers in the Senate.

                        <para>- Although we have had the assurance that there is no intention to do so, it certainly looks as if that motive were present to some extent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> talks of the House of Representatives being the preponderating Chamber, and says that a slur is being cast upon the Senate. In my opinion there has been nothing of the kind. The Prime Minister is responsible for the formation of the Government, and he naturally selects the best men he can get. If there are good men who are members of the Senate he will select them. I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> lays a great deal too much stress upon the word " paid." Over and over again the honorable senator has said that we should have two "paid" Ministers representing the Government in the Senate. Does not my honorable friend know that the representative of the Government here who is not paid is generally recognised and acknowledged to be about the most able man in either House of the Federal Parliament? What is the use of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Glassey talking nonsense about " paid " Ministers ? If some men were given a million a year it would not make them either better or worse. In my opinion, the Senate may well congratulate itself upon having the Government represented here by the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the Postmaster-General, who are very capable and efficient Ministers. I do not hesitate to say that the time will come when we shall have 'less efficient Ministerial representatives in this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. The position which the Senate will take, in the opinion of the country, will depend upon its individual members, upon their ability and firmness, and not upon our having one or two paid Ministers. This is altogether a matter which concerns the Prime Minister, as he is responsible for his team to the House of Representatives and to the electors. Honorable senators quite forget that the House of Representatives is bound to be the preponderating Chamber. That House makes and unmakes Ministries, and we do not, and that makes the whole difference. That House controls and conducts the finances of the Commonwealth, and that makes a very vast difference. However much we may desire to magnify our position, or even to maintain the position given to us by the Constitution, we shall not do it by crying out that we wish to have paid Ministers representing the Government here. Let us do our work in the best way we can, and, so long as we have two representatives of the Government as thoroughly efficient as the honorable and learned senators 'who represent the present Ministry in the Senate, we shall have nothing to complain of. I believe that the Prime Minister will only laugh at this motion if we pass it. </para>

And I did not imply, nor did I say, that in consequence of not being salaried, like other Ministers, he is any less attentive in his administration or his intention to be here when he can afford to do so.

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and the Postmaster-General have very carefully avoided the kernel of the whole matter. They have endeavoured to introduce a personal element into the discussion, notwithstanding the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was careful to say that no such thought had entered his mind. If honorable senators will take the trouble to refresh their memories as. to the constitution of the Ministry, they will find that in the other House there are the Minister for External Affairs, the Attorney-General, the </para>

                <para class="block">Minister for Home Affairs, the Treasurer, the Minister for Trade and Customs, the Minister for Defence, and a Minister without portfolio, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh, whereas in the Senate we have one salaried Minister and the Vice-President of the Executive  Council, a gentleman of admittedly rare ability. Is it fair that the other House should have not twice but three or four times the proportion of Ministerial representation that the Senate has ? It does not do justice to the position of the Senate. With every desire to appreciate the ability of the Postmaster-General, it is quite evident that, he can not be in two places at the same time. On several occasions yesterday when honorable senators were speaking he was not present. He cannot be in his place at the table and attending as he must do at times to business outside. It is unbecoming that at any time a debate should be carried on without a single representative of the Ministry being present. I was intending to speak yesterday afternoon, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> was out of the Chamber. It was my intention to draw attention to his absence, but before I could do so he had returned. He is as attentive to his business as a man can be, but one man cannot be half-a-dozen men, or even two men. One man cannot be at the table attending to his duty and answering questions addressed to colleagues in the other House, or doing something else outside the Chamber. The dignity of the Senate requires that it should share to a larger extent than it does in the number of Ministerial portfolios. That is all we ask, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> had risen to the occasion, he would have said : "The Senate is not treated in a way consonant with its dignity. There ought to be at least another Minister here, and I shall do my best to represent to the Ministry that the present state of affairs should be rectified." That is the position which I think he should have taken up. Instead of that he chose to introduce an entirely personal matter, and to say that the motion was a reflection on him, whereas it is nothing of the sort. I trust most emphatically that the motion will be carried, and that, sooner or later, it will have a substantial result. </para>

                    <para>- While agreeing in the main with the arguments adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> as to the advisableness of having more Ministerial representation in the Senate, I certainly hope that he will not press this motion to a division. I think that there can be no better reason adduced for taking that course than the arguments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> put forward in support of the motion. Notwithstanding the very great admiration which we all know he entertains for the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I think that the latter gentleman on this occasion might well ask to be saved from his friends. I do not think he can feel in the least degree grateful for the turn which the discussion is likely to take as the result of the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey.</inline> If it be the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is not recompensed adequately, surely that is a matter which is entirely between himself and his colleagues. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> chooses to accept a certain position, and to discharge its duties as he does with so much success, surely the terms on which he accepted that position is a matter which is entirely for discussion between himself and his colleagues. It has been pointed out that what we really complain of is that through the absence of a certain number of Ministers we are denied the privilege of having certain measures introduced in the Senate, and the Defence Bill has been given in illustration by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> Assuming that the Attorney-General had a seat in' the Senate, what particular measured would be. introduced here? </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator think that if the motion is carried, and appears on our Journals, the Ministry will upset all their arrangements, and endeavour to substitute a Minister from the other House, for somebody here, before the legislation which is now in hand is dealt with? With the legislation that was passed during last session, and with the legislation that is now in hand disposed of, there would be very little scope indeed for any particular measure within the province of any one Minister, which would necessarily be introduced in a particular Chamber, because of his presence therein. It seems to me that with that legislation disposed of practically the only measures that will be submitted by Ministers to Parliament will be Bills dealing with matters of general policy, which will fall, to a great extent, as much within the province of one Minister as another. Under these circumstances I do not see that there is very much in the argument adduced that if we had certain Ministers here we should get special Bills introduced in the Senate first instead of in the other House. With regard to the position of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, it has been well pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that it is not the question of his remuneration that we should discuss on a motion of this character. Have we in the Senate a sufficient representation, paid or unpaid, of the Executive? I know that there is not the same feeling entertained for an honorary Minister as for a paid Minister ; but the reason for that, to my mind, is because as a rule an honorary Minister having no Department to administer and receiving no special remuneration for his duties, does not devote himself to Cabinet work to the extent that a salaried Minister does. </para>

                        <para>- The whole question is, have we a sufficient representation of the Executive in the Senate. It is not desirable that we should place a motion of this kind on our records, because it is not for us to enter into the question of the remuneration which may be received by any Cabinet Minister who is here. If he accepts the responsibility of the introduction of Ministerial proposals, and if he is recognised as properly doing that, and as discharging the duties incidental to that position with satisfaction, that is all we have to consider. How he is being remunerated is a matter entirely for himself. Perhaps we might have further representation of the Executive in the Senate, but it would not necessarily flow from that that we should get special measures introduced which are not now initiated here. The Senate is in a totally different position from the Legislative Council of any State. That proposition is stated frequently from all sides of the Chamber ; we are never tired of stating it. By reason of that fact there might be a larger representation of the Executive here as a recognition of the different position which the Senate occupies from an ordinary State Upper House. But whether we should get from that the material benefit or advantage, which some supporters of the motion anticipate, I very much doubt. I do not think that we should get anything more than a formal recognition of the status and dignity of the Senate under the Constitution by any increased representation of the Executive here. For that reason I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will be satisfied with the expression of opinion which he has elicited from all sides, and will not press his motion to a division. If it were placed on the records the result to my mind would certainly not be as good as he has anticipated. </para>

                    <para>- I have a good deal of sympathy with the motion that has been proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> It is only natural that we, as members, of the Senate, should take a very high, view of the position of this Chamber,, and if we can in any way increase its strength it is our duty to do so. Notwithstanding all that has been said, there is a suspicion in the minds of senators that this Chamber does not receive adequate representation in the Cabinet, and that it does not have that weight in the framing of legislation which it would receive if different arrangements were made. I am not wedded to the claim that there ought to be another salaried Minister, but there should be more adequate Cabinet representation in the Senate in order that we might have initiated here measures that are withheld from us under present conditions. I join in the expressions of approval which have been given as to the leadership of the Senate. No complaint can be made in that direction. In fact, I will go further and say that, considering the work of the past and present session, I do not expect to see better leadership in the Senate than we have at present, and had last session. If I were to make comparisons between the Senate and other legislative bodies, I should say that the leadership in this Chamber could scarcely be improved upon so far as concerns the arrangement and conduct of the business. Senator Smith has' raised a point that deserves consideration. It relates to giving the right to Ministers to introduce Bills, or to defend their administration, in either House. If some arrangement like that- were made it would meet a great deal of the difficulty that has presented itself. Under such an arrangement we might now be discussing a measure like the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which I hold to be second to none in importance. That measure' cannot be introduced in the Senate under present circumstances, because the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has taken a keen interest in the subject for many years, is in charge of it, and naturally desires to have the honour of submitting it to the Federal Parliament. Because he is a member of the House of Representatives he cannot enter the precincts of the Senate, and the Bill, in consequence of the state of business in the other Chamber, remains in the background. In addition to what has been said, I would point out that we might have another honorary Minister in the Senate, so that the younger members of the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Senate could have an opportunity for training in this respect. 1 am aware that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is an honorary Minister, but for reasons which are generally understood he is not present to assist his colleague. We know very well that he has a large and extensive practice in Sydney, and under present conditions' we cannot expect him to be always in his place. That fact tells in favour of my argument that there ought to be more adequate representation of the Cabinet in the Senate, either in accordance with the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> or by the appointment of another honorary Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> motion says nothing with regard to paid Ministers, but simply that there should be " more adequate representation " in the Senate. I believe that there should be more adequate representation, in order that business may be transacted more expeditiously, and so as to enable a greater number of important measures to be initiated here. I trust that the Government will seriously consider the position, and that some arrangement will be made whereby a Minister may be able to introduce his own Bills in either Chamber. I hope that the motion will not be pressed to a division. The expression of opinion is . overwhelming, and, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will allow his motion to be withdrawn, I am satisfied that the Government will consider the position, and that the defects pointed out will be remedied. </para>

                    <para>- I should be sorry to allow this motion to be withdrawn, or to go to a division, without expressing my entire sympathy with its principle, and my hope that in some way or other the Government will take an early opportunity of giving effect to what I understand to be the universal wish of the Senate. The motion peculiarly concerns us all. It is not a party proposal. It is submitted because there is a feeling that the Senate desires to do its duty in the most effective way possible, and to take that conspicuous share in the legislation and government of the country to which, under the Constitution, it is entitled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has not submitted the motion with any intention of entangling the Govern men t, but simply to give the Senate an opportunity of expressing its view upon a broad question affecting the purpose of its own existence and the business of the country. The first portion of the motion expresses the desirableness of having more adequate representation in the Senate, and that view will be commended by all of us. I do not know that the language might not have been altered. By " adequate," we do not mean to cast any reflection on the representatives of the Government who are now in the Senate </para>

                        <para>- We may all agree that within the scope of their opportunities, the representatives of the Government in the Senate have discharged their duties in accordance with the best traditions of parliamentary procedure. Subject to the considerations affecting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> with which we all sympathize, we agree that there could be no better representation of the Government than we have had. But that representation has been subject to the important disability which I have pointed out; and that appears to me to be to some extent a reflection upon the Government, though probably it is due to the exigencies of Commonwealth political life. We have no authoritative representation of the Government in the Senate by two Ministers appointed in accordance with the Constitution to do the work which the Constitution places upon their shoulders. My view from the very beginning of our existence as a Commonwealth has been that the Government made a great mistake, constitutionally, first of all in appointing two honorary Ministers ; and, secondly, in choosing to represent them in the Senate, not two paid Ministers, but one honorary and one paid Minister. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> will believe me when I say that I am not making this remark with a view of discriminating in any way, but I cannot help observing that during our discussions upon the Tariff it seemed an anomaly that the Senate should practically be led by an honorary and unpaid Minister, who was devoting the whole of his time and industry to the discharge of the duties allotted to him. We can well understand that the two Ministers in this Chamber have to divide their responsibilities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> takes charge of one part of the business, and I dare say that certain other portions of it are more immediately relegated to the charge of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> But the conditions that prevailed last session were anomalous. They were such as I think never existed in any House of Parliament in the world before. I know of no precedent for them. I trust that steps will be taken to remedy that state of things. Under the Constitution there ought to be seven Ministers and no more. Those seven Ministers should be paid the £12,000 a year prescribed by the Constitution, and that amount should be properly distributed. I feel sure that it was the sentiment of good-will on the part of the Parliament, and the feeling that we were inaugurating a new system, that prevented attacks being made upon ,the Government at the beginning of our proceedings for what they did in this respect. We felt bound to extend to the Government a generous good-will, so far as procedure was concerned, and that probably accounted for the circumstance, that not much criticism was offered in respect of the appointment of honorary Ministers. I have always felt that there is no room under our Constitution for honorary Ministers at all; that the Ministers appointed under the Constitution should be seven in number ; that they should be paid ; and that of those seven two should be in the Senate. The second part of the motion expresses the opinion - </para>

                        <para>- I take that into consideration. He has charge of one of the largest Departments, which is second to none in the troublesome details involved in * its administration. If we watch the papers from day to day we cannot help feeling 0that the Postmaster-General has the temper of an angel, as he must have. When we take all his administrative work into consideration, and remember that added to that he has the duty of coming into the Senate single-handed to guide us in our deliberations as the acting leader of the Senate, I think we may fairly say that he is being placed in a very invidious and difficult position. That should be remedied. If the spirit of this motion were carried into effect, and two paid Ministers - one of whom at least would be here constantly - held seats in the Senate, in all probability we should have scope for a greater amount of legislative business than we have at present. It is unnecessary to say one word as to the position in which the Senate has been placed since the opening of the present session. No one will underrate the importance of the standing orders we have passed, or the importance of some of the questions .before us, such as the amendment to clause 2 of the Sugar Bonus Bill which I have moved, the Sugar Bonus Bill itself, the Patents Bill, or the Naturalization Bill. But some of these are matters which will involve no lengthy debate, and we 'have really been marking time from the commencement of the session. It is no use burking our position. We are not going to pass a motion of want of confidence in the Government, but the fact is as I .have stated. We are all anxious for work and capable of work. This is not an assembly of indolent or incompetent persons, and whilst we are here, able-bodied and able-minded, ready for the work of legislation, we ought to have plenty of it given to us. It is our right, under the Constitution, to see that that is done, and I have the greatest pleasure in expressing my hearty sympathy with the motion, and the desire that in both its branches it will be carried into effect. </para>

                    <para>- If I regarded this motion as being in any sense of the word a reflection on the two Ministers holding seats in the Senate, I should vote against it. But as I am satisfied that neither the mover, nor any supporter of it, desires that it shall be considered in that way, I shall vote for it, and, if necessary, I hope it will go to a division. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has just pointed. out the amount of work which one Minister has to carry out. We have been several weeks in session, and the Postmaster-General, who is in charge of the Senate, has to introduce not only his own measures but to take charge of the Bills of six other Ministers that are introduced in another place, and sent up to us. That in itself should be sufficient to show that another paid Minister is required here. We have only one paid Minister in the Senate. The honorary Minister cannot afford "to give the whole of his time to the business of the Senate. No honorary Minister- could be expected to do so for £400 a year when he has others dependent upon him for a living. We are continually telling the public that we are very much more important than the Legislative Council of any of the States. 1 would point out, however, that the Legislative Council of Victoria had two paid Ministers out of ten, or one-fifth of the Ministerial representation, while here we have but one paid Minister out of seven, although we are so very much more important than that Chamber. Let us practice what we preach. If we are so much more important than ares the State Legislative Councils let us have more Ministerial representation in the Senate. What are the prizes which a man seeks when he enters Parliament ? He seeks first of all to gratify his ambition. Ambition first of all prompted many of us to seek a seat in the Senate, but if a man is not too old he has a desire to secure a portfolio. Here, however, there happens to be only one. </para>

                        <para>- I say that there are many honours which a man seeks in entering Parliament. When I assert that a man wishes to gratify his ambition by entering the Senate, I do not mean that he enters the Chamber because of monetary considerations, but because he desires the honour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> with that delightful inconsistency for which he is so noted, said that we ought to do our work faithfully and well. We are quite willing to do our work as well as we can, but we have nothing to do. We would not be discussing this subject if we had any very important business to transact. Of course, the honorable senator in charge of the motion had a right to bring this matter forward, but he would consent to allow the motion to stand over if the Government had any more important business awaiting attention. It is unwise and unfair to expect the "Postmaster-General to support a motion of this kind. I think we all recognise that it is a mild form of censure of the Prime Minister for having failed in the first place to give us two paid Ministers. That being so, we can scarcely expect a member of the Government to support a motion to censure his leader, however mild that censure may be. I do not think I can add anything more to the discussion, but I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Barrett</inline> that what he has suggested would involve an amendment of the Constitution. It seems to me that if we are going to allow a Minister to speak in this Chamber as well as' in another place, we shall require an amendment of the Constitution. If we are going to do that let us go the whole way and adopt the Swiss system of electing Ministers and allowing them to speak in either Chamber. </para>

But there is a difficulty in these matters, and an amendment of the Constitution would be found much more difficult than seems to be the case at first sight. In the meantime, however, no alteration of the Constitution is required in order to give effect to this motion. The Government has simply to say - " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett,</inline> take a portfolio here ;" or perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> or even the mover of this motion, would not object to accept office.

                        <para>- I am glad that the motion has been brought forward. If it does nothing else, it will at least show the Government that the Senate is not satisfied. In the course of a conversation, I mentioned the matter to the Prime Minister about twelve months ago, and he gave me a reply. He did not inquire whether I considered that reply sufficiently ambiguous ; but it was. Of course I admitted that we had the pick of the bunch so far as Ministers were concerned. I think we have, and if they were both paid Ministers we should nob have anything of which to complain. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will agree to the addition of those words I shall not move the amendment I have indicated. I propose, however, to move that the motion be amended by the omission of the second paragraph. Although we had some reason to complain last session that we had at times no business to engage our attention, and had to submit to two or three adjournments, &gt;I think we have had no reason for such a complaint this session. Our hands are' full, and we may expect to have plenty to occupy our time until the end of the session. Therefore, I do not think the second paragraph is necessary. If it should become necessary at any time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will be able to move in the matter. It seems to me that it is not good tactics for the Opposition to urge that the Government should have more Ministers in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- ,1 am sure we all agree with the complimentary references which have been made, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> but the Opposition will recognise that if the other representative of the Ministry had been absent from the Chamber on many occasions last session, they might have expected to score in connexion with certain matters in which the}' were defeated. The presence of two paid Ministers in the Senate would strengthen the Ministry, and indeed an intelligent Ministry would at an early date look upon the Senate as a place of refuge, to which their members could fly. A man who is elected to the Senate has not to consult his constituents for six years, whereas a member of another place has to go before the electors every three years. Prom that stand-point then it would be wise for the Ministry to have another representative here. There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent us from having more than seven Ministers if they are necessary. So far as I can learn, the only honorable senator who objects to having paid Ministers in the Senate is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> The honorable and learned senator would have no paid Ministers here, and no responsible Ministers whom we could criticise in any way. I think it would be an advantage to the Senate to have Ministers representing Departments here, so that, in case their Departments were not administered properly, we should be in a position to bring our objections under their notice. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that, in the desire to condense my remarks, in moving the motion I omitted reference to the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Apparently my omission has been seized upon by the Postmaster-General as indicating some kind of reflection, if not. an attack, upon the honorable and learned senator. No such reflection was intended, and no reflection is involved in the smallest degree, with reference to the absence of the Vice-President of the Executive Council during the present session. This is shown by the fact that I gave notice of this motion on our third sitting day, the 3rd June. The motion will be found in print upon the business-paper for the fourth sitting day, and notice of it must therefore have been given at an earlier date. It was really given on our second sitting day, because, if I may be permitted to use an Hibernianism, our first sitting day was no sitting day, as it was merely the day of the opening of Parliament. On- the 3rd June I gave notice of this motion, and how was it possible foi' me at that time to have any knowledge of what the Vice-President's movements would be <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I had not the faintest idea that the honorable and learned senator would be absent when I gave notice of the motion, and in moving it to-day, I make no reflection whatever upon the honorable and learned senator. I recognise the difficulties surrounding his position. But I also recognise that the honorable and learned senator occupies a position unknown under the Constitution - he is the fifth wheel of the Ministerial coach. There is another little matter I wish to clear up. I alleged that we had sat only on one Friday up to date for the month during which the Senate has been sitting. I find that that is absolutely so. We did not sit on the 29th May, or on the 5th or 19th June. We sat only on the 12th June. </para>

The expression of opinion on my motion has been so very unanimous in its favour, that I think I -should be doing wrong if I did not take a vote of the Senate upon it. There could be only one excuse for withdrawing it, namely, that some personal reflection had been meant. As there is none meant, and that is admitted, except by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> because I find the Postmaster-General has been good enough to eliminate the idea of there being anything personal in the matter, I should not be justified in complying with the request of one honorable senator as against the request of so many others. </para>

I have accepted the suggestion to. amend the first paragraph of the motion, and if that is carried there will be no reason for the second. What is asked for in the second paragraph of the motion would flow from the first, because, when there are two paid Ministers in the Senate, it will undoubtedly be convenient for the Government of the day to introduce a larger proportion of measures in this Chamber. I therefore ask leave to amend the motion by omitting the second paragraph. </para>

                <para class="block">There have been issued since the introduction of the Federal Tariff a very large number of orders, regulations, and decisions. The papers have aggregated some 400 or 500, and some of them contain up to 100 decisions each, so that the information contained in them is very considerable. It seems to me desirable that honorable senators should have an opportunity of inspecting these. I have been told that the reason why the motion was not allowed to pass as formal was that there were certain confidential orders issued which could not be made public. I am perfectly willing to amend my motion so that it will exclude confidential orders issued by the Department to its officers. Obviously, a great Department cannot be carried on without certain more or less confidential communications, and it would not be proper for me to ask that these should be made public. Apart from these, I think it is desirable that the papers should be at the disposal of honorable senators. </para>

                <para class="block">That seems at the very outset to amount to a confession that they had not been able to get the evidence they considered should be obtained before any action was taken. In fact, after reading the whole of the report, I should say that they came to the conclusion that the proposal possessed certain very attractive features, but they were not disposed to recommend its adoption then in Victoria. I believe that the Senate will come to the decision that, though it contains some good points, it would be utterly impracticable to put the proposal into operation at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> dealt with the question more particularly from the financial point of view, no doubt in the hope that it would appeal to honorable senators. His contention is that his proposal, if adopted, would have the effect of producing a very considerable revenue, and he quoted the case of France. When I was in France for a few days in 1893, this subject attracted my interest very much. It seemed to me to be a very good idea to have the sale of tobacco regulated, and, of course, to collect such a large revenue as they do from this source- -about £14,000,000,I think. When I was in England, subsequently, I discussed the subject with my friends. The point of view which was taken by the connoisseurs was that not so many varieties of tobacco were sold in France as in England, that, though the tobacco which was produced in France was of a more even character, the quality was not even, but what I may call medium, that whereas one could get tobacco which is very much worse in a free-trade country, he could also get tobaccos which were very much better. A comparison of the shops will convey that impression. In France a very small shop, not much bigger than a large packing-case, suffices for selling tobacco and postage stamps. If one desires to buy tobacco he is offered probably three kinds at three prices, and he can have whichever sort he likes. In. the case of cigars he is offered two, or perhaps three, varieties, and he can take them or leave them ; he cannot get other qualities in the place. In Great Britain, and, I suppose in every country where the Government has not a monopoly, the tobacco shop is a splendid emporium where one can purchase almost any kind of tobacco which is manufactured in any part of the world. </para>

                        <para>- In an English tobacco shop one can secure the finest brands of tobacco that are made in Great Britain and America and cigars from all countries, and the probability is that a connoisseur who is willing to pay the price can get a tobacco which is more particularly to his liking. One can get perhaps a more uniform quality in a country where a monopoly exists, but one can get a greater range of choice in a country where the business is carried on by private enterprise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> seems to think that by creating 'a Government monopoly we shall be able to attach the whole of the net profit which goes into the pockets of the private manufacturers. Of course, he does not lose sight of the fact that we are deriving a large revenue - equal to about £1,400,000 - from the Customs and Excise duties on tobacco. I suppose he calculates that under his system we should be able to get just as much, plus the net profits which go into the pockets of private manufacturers. But then there are other things to be considered. Of course, the profit consists of the difference between the cost of production and the price which is obtained. The honorable senator .. will admit that in production, as it is carried on in most countries, there are certain features which he deprecates as much as I- do. If he creates a Government monopoly, I presume that he would desire to do away with the sweating of the employes. In doing away with that evil, he would necessarily increase the cost of production. </para>

In the case of the Post and Telegraph Department, we paid so much for our services, and such rates to our employes that we could not afford to carry newspapers or telegrams below a certain figure. .But the other House said - " We do not care whether you can do so or not; we are going to have cheaper rates," and the rates were reduced, although it was stated distinctly that they were non-paying rates. In fact, upon the information being given, it insisted upon making the rates still lower. If Parliament, as I understand, is to fix the rates to be charged for tobacco, and will not listen, as it would not listen before, to any argument based on the cost of production- </para>

                        <para>- Tobacco may be a luxury, but if we have to decide how much revenue we wish to raise by its sale, and that is to depend upon a vote that is given in Parliament, I am .perfectly sure that pressure will " be ' put upon the members to reduce the price. We should have debates exactly the same as we had on the question of the import duties. When it was proposed to put a duty on tobacco in order to raise revenue, did we not find honorable senators insisting that the duty should be reduced, for the purpose of enabling the poor man to obtain his tobacco cheaper ? In the same way, if a monopoly in tobacco were established, there certainly would be a continual effort on the part of Members of Parliament to reduce the price. I mention that because the honorable senator has relied upon the margin of profit between the cost of production and the price at which the article will be sold to the consumer. He has admitted, in the first place, that he would take steps to improve the position of the workers. That would increase the cost of production. There is also a considerable danger, at all events, that Parliament would insist upon fixing the price at which the commodity was sold, and would so fix it that the margin of profit upon which the honorable senator counts would be whittled away. That is not, therefore, a strong point in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> argument. At present we derive from the use of tobacco a considerable revenue, which, if necessary, can be increased. If the necessities of the Commonwealth are such that we require to obtain a larger revenue, the duty on tobacco can be increased at any time. It is a most convenient way of obtaining increased revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. But I have pointed out that an effort was made last session to make the cost of tobacco' cheap, and that the same thing will be done again. If the obtaining of revenue is the object in view, we can get it under our present system just as well as by the nationalization of the tobacco industry. The honorable senator argued that there would be a saving, because possibly there would not be the same necessity to spend money in posters and advertising. That may be so, but such articles are advertised to bring under the attention of consumers the qualities of different brands, and the places at which they may be obtained. That is all involved in the point that in a country like Great Britain there is a greater range of choice than there is in a country where a monopoly obtains. In making these remarks I do not wish it to be considered that I wholly condemn the principle of the nationalization of the tobacco industry. I admit that there is this advantage in the proposal - that it gives a certain amount of assurance that the workers engaged in the production of the article will receive fair wages and proper conditions of living. That, to my mind, is one of the principal arguments in favour of what is proposed, and I venture to say that it is a far stronger one than that we should be able to get a large amount of profit from the industry. I do not know whether the honorable senator has taken into consideration the practicability of putting his proposal into operation - whether under the Constitution there is power to do so. I cannot see that the Constitution gives us power at present to interfere in a matter of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see how the Government would displace any one by establishing ironworks ; whereas if the honorable senator's idea be carried out, it will mean that the Commonwealth will have to take the manufacture and sale of tobacco entirely out of the hands of private firms. In the case of ironworks, the national industry could be carried on side by side with the private industry. Probably there would be sufficient business to keep both Commonwealth ironworks and private works going. But if the Commonwealth took over the tobacco industry, it would be impossible to run it side by side with private enterprise. Otherwise it would not be a monopoly at all. I suppose the honorable senator would not contemplate shutting up the present factories and tobacco shops throughout the States ? </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria, the State bought out the private telephone company, because the company was willing to sell. It was a matter of sale and purchase. There was no reason why that should not occur. But what would it mean if the Commonwealth had to acquire a monopoly in the manufacture and sale of tobacco <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> propose that the Commonwealth Government shall buy out all the manufacturers and retailers of tobacco, and pay them compensation ? 'If so, we should have a far larger job on our hands than we have now in paying for the properties connected with the transferred Departments. The' thing appears to me to be one that can hardly be contemplated at the present time. There may be some good points in the honorable senator's proposal, but I do not see how they could possibly be given effect to now. If not unconstitutional, as I think it is, his proposal is impracticable. I do not blame the honorable senator for bringing it forward for discussion, and it is just as well that during the session honorable senators should have an opportunity of expressing their opinions about it. But I think that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has heard what others have to say he will be inclined at the present stage to withdraw his motion. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has undoubtedly the appearance of equity, and in that respect I am not surprised that he should have tabled it. I think it should be possible, however, to convince him that there is really a want of equity underlying it, and that when he has heard all that can be advanced in opposition to it, he will not ask for a division. Clearly, if the amendment were carried into law, the grower who has hitherto employed white labour would be politically pock-marked for the rest of his life. He would be unable to shake off the mark of having employed white labour. We will say that there are to-day on the banks of the Logan River in Queensland or on the Richmond River in New South Wales farms owned by farmers employing only white labour, and who have never employed coloured labour. Is it not e vident that if those men were deprived of the right to obtain the bonus, on the ground that they had employed white labour in the past, they would be placed at a most serious disadvantage in competing with those who might commence operations on sugar plantations next to them. ' On the one side of the fence we should have a man, who had hitherto employed white labour, denied the right to the bonus, while on the other side of the 'fence there would be a new grower who would receive the bonus, notwithstanding that up ' to that time he had perhaps been an employer of coloured labour in another part of Australia'. Under this amendment, those who have hitherto employed white labour would be . penalized for all time because of that fact, and -would never be able to rehabilitate themselves so as to secure the bonus. But the man on the other side of the fence, who had perhaps been " up to his neck," to use a familiar expression, in what was at one time known as the Queensland slave trade, would secure it. ' In the old days, when things were done by unauthorized speculators which warranted the opprobrium of the term of slavery, as applied to the traffic - although, thank God, that has not happened- for a quarter of a century - this man might have been engaged in the trade, but he would be able to start a sugar farm and obtain the bonus in opposition to his neighbour who had been employing white labour from the first. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not elaborate that argument, but I shall deal with the point introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> as to the right of a man who has hitherto grown cane with white labour to the benefit of a protective duty. In reply 'to the further proposition, which I think fell from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that the cane-grower now is not limited to his own State, but has the whole Commonwealth for his market, I would point out that, as regards the advantage of the protection offered in the form of a duty, the New South Wales growers have infinitely less advantage than they had before. I admit that they had only a duty of £3 per ton by way of protection, but they had New South Wales as a close preserve, and no other sugar could compete with their product. Certainly the growers of New South Wales can now send their sugar free to all the markets in the Commonwealth, .but there is no inducement for them to do so, because New South Wales does not grow sufficient for her own requirements. The barriers to intercolonial trade now being broken down, Queensland sugar, with a bounty of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton to help it, can come into New South Wales, 'and compete, practically ruinously, with the local grower who has no protection whatever against it. Queensland does not consume all that she produces, but New South Wales does. A considerable quantity of Queensland sugar has for years past been introduced into' New South Wales, and that practice will continue, with the difference that the black-grown sugar of North Queensland, produced at a cheaper rate in the matter of labour, and the Queensland sugar produced by white labour, and enjoying a bounty of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton, will now come in duty free. In New South Wales the local grower will be entirely overrun by these importations, and will have no protection whatever if this amendment is carried. I do not think I need elaborate the point. It must be perfectly clear that if this amendment is carried the New South Wales grower will not have a show. </para>

                        <para>- 1 am not asking for the bonus to be paid to the sugar-growers of New South Wales for doing what they did before. If I did, it would be an inequitable proposal. I am simply urging that, as compared with the man who is to receive the bonus in the future, the New South Wales growers should not be penalized and- placed at a disadvantage to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton of sugar, because they have employed white labour in the past. I shall not raise the question again as to the difference between the cost of white and coloured labour. I do not know whether <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton fairly represents that difference, but I understand from the statement that I have read - although. I believe it has been challenged to some extent - that <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton is, perhaps, too large a bonus. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not know .whether the honorable and learned senator is referring to a member of another place, and if he is, I do not know whether that gentleman is an authority. But I am not going to discuss the question, as I do not know whether <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton is a fair sum or not. It has been decided practically that that bonus shall be paid, and, therefore, I say that if we give it to the sugar-growers of one district and deny it to those of another district, we shall practically render it impossible' foi' the latter to compete, not because they have not employed white labour in the past, but because we have set up a new condition of tilings. I am not quite sure whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has paid close attention to two provisions in the Constitution. I refer to sub-section (3) of section 51 and section 99. They contain provisions which are worthy of consideration. Sub-section (3) of section 51 provides that the Parliament shall, subject to the Constitution, have power to make laws with respect to- </para>

                <para>Bounties on the production or export of goods, but so that such bounties shall be uniform, throughout the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>How can a bounty be uniform if the man on one side of a fence is never to receive it because of something that has happened in the past, while the man on the other side is to be entitled to it. Of course, the Commonwealth must be able to lay down conditions attaching to the payment of bonuses, which, if not complied with in the future, will act as a bar, but I take it that it is absolutely impossible for us to pass bonus provisions applicable only in certain localities because of something that has happened in the past over which we had no control. Section 99 provides that - </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth shall not by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue - </para>
                <para>Surely this would come under the heading of trade ? give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. </para>
                <para class="block">I cannot help thinking that the proposal involved in this amendment comes within the purview of one or both of these provisions in the Constitution. Of course, it is a constitutional matter which this Chamber is not competent to settle, but we may fairly take it into consideration. Another point which has already been mentioned is that if this amendment be passed, farmers who have hitherto used only white labour will be compelled to set to work to obtain all the coloured labour they can find in the Commonwealth that has been thrown out of employment through the operation of the bounty, and to set that coloured labour to work in opposition to the white labour which has already received employment. </para>

                        <para>.- There is enough coloured labour in Queensland to do very much more than cultivate all the canefields of New South Wales if transported there. In North Queensland, for instance, the whole of the banana trade is carried on by Chinese labour, and the immensely large shipping business in Cairns in bananas is the result of Chinese- labour. There is also a great deal of Javanese, Japanese, and Hindoo labour. . I have no desire to see this class of labour transported to New South Wales as the result of our attempt to improve the conditions of white labour in Australia. At a time when there is no symptom of hysteria in the Chamber, I wish to make it quite ' clear that in anything I have said, or may say in the future, with reference to the prospects of success in the great experiment being made, there is a vast difference between an honest doubt of future success, and opposition. I do not oppose, but I have my honest doubts, as to whether this will be a successful experiment. In trying the experiment let us try it honestly and fairly, and on the best terms, to enable its results to be capably judged. I have never said, nor intended to say, and I have never voted, nor intended to vote, in any way against the policy of a. white Australia ; but I do think that, under the amendment, if carried, there would certainly be a prospect of the employment of coloured labour in localities where white labour is now employed, and if white labour can successfully grow a tropical crop, it is in those localities. I- speak largely from the stand-point of New South Wales that State white labour has been more generally employed in connexion with the growth of sugar than in Queensland. I am therefore justified in putting forward the view which I entertain, with some element of practical knowledge, with reference to the effect which the amendment submitted will have upon an industry which we are, by our present legislation, seeking to advance, rather than to retard. </para>

                    <para>- I believe that when this Bill becomes law it will be more just than the rebate provisions of the Excise Tariff Act which we seek to repeal. Although I say that, I must confess an behalf of Tasmania, that I think we are being altogether too lavish and too generous in dealing with the sugar industry, and the course which is being adopted involves great injustice to my own State. Tasmania is losing enormously in revenue by the alteration of ' the duties on sugar, and that is a loss which we cannot afford. If I saw that the whole of the loss which we in Tasmania are helping to make up would go towards the assistance of the planter in getting rid of black labour and employing white,' I should be satisfied, although I should still hold that we are treating the sugar planter too generously. But when we know that the rich State of New South Wales is being paid for doing what she did before, and that we are giving the sugar growers of that State £36,000 per annum, or £2 per ton on 18,000 tons of sugar, which they have all along been growing with white labour, honorable senators must see that we are merely placing a sum of money in the pockets of the New South Wales planters who are doing nothing at all to help forward the policy of a white Australia. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> to consider whether even at this hour he and his colleagues cannot initiate some more just way of doing that which we all desire to do. I believe that the only thing we desire to do is to get rid of the black man, in order to employ the white man in his place. </para>

I learn that there is a distance of about 100 miles between the southern plantations of Queensland and the northern plantations of New South Wales j but, with regard to the great sugar plantations upon - which black labour is chiefly employed, I believe there is a distance between them and the New South Wales plantations of 300 or 400 miles, and there is a very considerable difference in climate and other conditions. That make's the payment of this bonus to the New South Wales planters all the more unjust. I think that some scheme' might be devised by which the bonus could be given to the planters in proportion to the number of coloured labourers they get rid of, having regard to the number of acres they are cultivating. It appears to me that some such scheme, thou"gh it might not carry out all that we desire, would certainly operate more equitably than will this proposal for paying bonuses to New South Wales planters </para>

                    amendment were carried, the New South Wales planters would immediately procure all the black labour they could.' But those planters could have secured Hindoos, Chinamen, or kanakas all these years, and they did not do so because they found that the climate in which they were carrying on the industry would permit of white men doing the work, and they were always able to get a sufficiency of white labour. Why, in the circumstances, should they get a bonus? The Federal Parliament has voted this bonus for a particular purpose, and now, in the Bill before us, it is proposed deliberately to give it for some other purpose. In fact we are simply throwing this money at the heads of the New South Wales planters. I have already asked the Postmaster-General, if he can, to tell honorable senators what really is the difference in cost in the employment of white and black labour on the canefields. We have an honorable member in another place repeating again and again that the difference amounts to 6d. per ton of cane, and we are being asked under this Bill to vote a' bonus of 4s. per ton. I naturally ask for this information, because, while there is undoubted injustice being done to the smaller States, if we can cut down the 4s. a ton proposed we shall mitigate the the evil in that way. If
                    <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline>
                    per ton of sugar would be a fair thing, why should we vote
                    <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline>
                    per ton ? Tasmania, and some of the other small States, certainly cannot afford it. I hope that before the Bill leaves the Committee,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>
                    will give us some information upon this point, because we should not be asked to give a greater bonus to planters employing white labour than the difference in cost between the employment of white and black labour entitles them to. We desire to help them ; we have shown the utmost sympathy with them, and in my opinion we have gone altogether too far in that direction. . It is said by some honorable senators that we are now objecting to the cost involved in establishing the white Australia policy ; but if the cost which we are asked to pay is more than is necessary to secure what we desire, we have a right to object.

                    <para>- The debate upon the amendment has been an extremely interesting one, and it has been conducted with an almost complete absence of feeling in respect to the large question which this amendment does not touch - the question of a white Australia. I think it is fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and other honorable senators who have spoken, that I should notice one or two points to which they have referred. I quite agree that in approaching any amendment on this Bill, we should be animated by a desire to honestly carry out the policy. We are not by this Bill, or any other Bill, seeking to reverse the policy adopted in the legislation passed in relation to the sugar industry. We are not here to reconsider or to modify either the import or the excise duty, nor are we unfortunately here to open up the question, which is exceedingly debatable, of the extreme liberality - to put it in no other way - of this £2 per ton rebate, intended to be offered now by way of bonus, for the carrying out of the policy. My object in submitting my amendment is to honestly carry out the policy to which the Parliament is committed. ' I frankly admit that there is a good deal to be said on both sides, but when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> - who I am quite sure approaches the subject from his stand-point with the same desire to do what is right as I do - suggests that I have some indirect motive in moving the amendment, and that it is simply an attempt to strike a blow indirectly at this policy of a white Australia, all I can say is that I have no such intention. My desire is to adhere strictly to that policy, and to carry it out to a conclusion. Last year we adopted a rebate, and this year we propose, for the purpose of administration, to call it a bonus. What I object to is to give to the planters who never have employed coloured labour in the production of sugar, not a bonus, but a gratuity. It is now a question between the taxpayers and the planters. The rebate was a sum paid by the consumers, but the bonus is to be a burden on the taxpayers. The total amount paid last year - and I suppose it will go on increasing - was about £60,000. The rebate was intended to induce the planters in particular parts of Queensland to substitute white for black labour, but we paid £36,000 to the planters of New South Wales, where the reason for the rebate never existed  and only £24,000 to Queensland, whose planters the Parliament intended to benefit. I have no desire to keep this money from New South Wales any more than from South Australia. I do not know sufficient about the Northern Territory, which, unfortunately, has been seriously retarded in its development by its adhesion to a white labour policy, to say whether any sugarcane is grown there. I wish the same rule to apply all round. I object to giving the gratuity to persons to whom the Parliament never desired to grant it under cover of a bonus which was intended for a totally different purpose. That is the basis on which this matter rests. It is not a matter for rhetoric at all. I claim, and I think those who support the amendment may well claim, to be strict adherents of the policy of this Government and of this Parliament, which, whether we object to it or not, is designed to secure the cessation of the employment of coloured labour on the sugar-fields, and to pay the compensation which is alleged to be necessary. The planters in North Queensland came to this Parliament and said through their representatives and otherwise - "in the more temperate regions of Queensland and .New South Wales, it is all very well to have white labour, but with us black labour is necessary, or if it is not necessary, we shall have to pay double wages for white labour." My honorable friends on my left pressed on our attention over and over again the fact that coloured labour was secured at a lower rate of wages than white labour. And to secure the "whitewashing" of the black or coloured part of the Queensland cane-fields, Parliament assented to this act of justice 0 c  d and this payment. Why should the bonus be paid to planters who, apparently, have been thriving under  a protective duty ? Senators Neild and Smith put forward an argument which, at first sight, was a little attractive. It does not seem to me in any way to touch the principle which  Parliament  is " seeking to carry out, and with which I thoroughly agree now that it has been accepted. My honorable friends ask, if this is done, what will be the result? One result, they say, may be that the planters who cannot get the bonus will immediately gather in all the coloured labour available and employ it on their fields in order to reduce the cost of production. That certainly cannot apply to last year, because the rebate has been paid. It can only exist in 1904-5-6 ; we are not dealing with a bonus which is to last for ever. To hold over us the bogy that these people will immediately crowd down upon themselves the coloured labour is simply ridiculous. What would they gain by doing that? They would simply gain the advantage of the employment of some coloured labour during those three years, and, of course, it is pure speculation that they could do such a thing, because probably all, or a great portion of the coloured labour obtainable, would be employed in North Queensland, a large proportion of the kanakas having to bc deported, and only a certain proportion being allowed to remain in the country after a fixed time. But the very same reason applies at the end of 1906, and that shows the absolute futility of this bonus  payment  by the taxpayers for the purpose of procuring a white Australia. In 1906 the bonus will end, and do not honorable senators think that every grower who can get coloured labour, if it is true that it is the much cheaper article, will, if he can, immediately substitute coloured for white labour to keep down the cost of production? My eyes have been opened this afternoon by being told that there is plenty of coloured labour on the cane-fields to-day, and that the number employed in Queensland is 4,228. It is an exceedingly interesting argument to put, but what does it amount to? In itself it amounts to nothing, but in relation to the expiration of the period of the bonus - it amounts to a confession that the sum of £300,000 or £400,000 which this policy will cost the taxpayers, assuming that the bonus increases from £60,000 to £100.000 a year, will be just as if it had been thrown into the sea. That opens up to us a very grave consideration indeed, -in these times when economy is so largely in demand. "We are not justified in increasing the burdens on the people by one solitary sovereign more than is absolutely necessary for the purpose which the Parliament has sanctioned, namely, not the payment -of a bonus for the growing of sugar in Australia, but the payment of a bonus to those planters who previously grew their sugar with coloured labour, and are to be offered this inducement to use white labour. The Senate will not be doing its duty to the taxpayers whom it represents if it allows the money to be diverted into a wrong channel. As long as I am here, even if I am alone, I .shall record my protest, not against the payment of the money to New South Wales, South Australia, or any other State, but against the payment of it to people who have been doing well all along, and have no right to this inducement and to this gratuity. Just one word in regard to the constitutional position to which I referred yesterday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has read the two provisions in the Constitution which bear on the point - of course the underlying principle .is equality - and said that we have no -right to discriminate, or to give a bonus to one part of Australia, and withdraw it from another. We are not doing anything of the kind. If this were a bonus given for the cultivation of sugar in Australia, then it could not be limited to Queensland. New South Wales, or any other part of the Commonwealth. To do so would be unconstitutional. This particular bonus is uniform throughout Australia. What for ? It is a bonus paid to planters who have hitherto employed coloured labour, and who are to receive this encouragement to use white labour. It is open -to every grower of sugar throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Every planter in New South Wales who has used coloured labour is entitled to this bonus in common with the planters in Queensland. The confusion arises from regarding this as a bonus for the encouragement of sugar-growing, whereas it is merely to encourage the employment of white labour. Therefore, although I admit the force of the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I think that he will probably see that, considering what the object of the Bill really is, my amendment is no infringement of any constitutional principle whatever, but that the contribution to growers who have never used coloured labour is an infringement. The unconstitutionality is on the part of the Bill as it stands. My amendment rectifies that. But whether it will rectify it or not, the sugar-growers on the Richmond and the Tweed in New South Wales have no right to receive this bonus from the taxpayers of Australia. It is on those grounds, and with a view of furthering the abolition of the employment of coloured labour on the cane-fields, that I submit the amendment. I am not submitting it in a hostile spirit in the slightest degree, but with a view of saving the taxpayers' money, and seeing that the bonus goes into the right pockets. </para>

There is a considerable difference between the position of New South Wales and that of South Australia in regard to sugar. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> no doubt, has a good knowledge of his own State. He is aware that there is more immediate steam-boat connexion between New South Wales and Queensland than between any other two States. New South Wales is to Queensland the first State of Australia on the steam-boat routes, and consequently becomes a selling depot for Queensland sugar. The difficulty is aggravated by there being something like a steam-boat daily between the two States. What chance would the sugar-grower in New South Wales have of competing on even terms if the Queensland grower had an advantage over him of £2 per ton ? Those are two points which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has not mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> amendment speaks of the growers.

It would be perfectly easy by some pleasant legal fiction of that kind to transfer an estate to a son, a daughter, or a wife, who would then become the grower known to the law, and be able to obtain the bonus by a back-door process which should not be encouraged by legislation. We should endeavour to pass such laws as will be obeyed, not dodged. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> proposal is one that unquestionably would be dodged, because it could be dodged with the greatest ease in the world. Every one of these people who are to be legislatively pock-marked for ever could get out of the difficulty as far as concerns pounds, shillings, and pence by a dummy sale. Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> were a typical employer of white labour, and had a plantation upon which only white labour was employed. Under his own proposal he could not receive the bonus. But he could sell to me, and I, who, we will say, had never employed other than black labour, could get the bonus. </para>

                        <para>.- I am afraid there is coming into the Chamber this afternoon a light air which narrowly approaches frivolity ; because I am sure that an honorable and learned senator like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would not seriously propose to attach a disability to the soil us well as to the man. If a man commits the. enormity of employing white labour, and is never to receive a bonus because he has done so, while the man who has employed black labour on the other side of the road does receive a bonus, it will be most unjust. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think there are three members of the Committee who have not already recognised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> amendment is an attempt by a side wind to do an injustice to the white sugar-growers of New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> may protest till he is black in the face that he is submitting a general proposition. Of course he is ; but we know the intention of that proposition. The white Australia policy is not only a policy to " whitewash" the black spots, but to keep the white spots still white. The amendment of the honorable and learned senator would have the effect of blackening what is already white, and keeping black what is already black. It would have the effect of penalizing people who have stuck to the white Australia policy, and compelling them to revert to a piebald method of cultivation. There must be some growers in New South Wales who employ coloured labour. According to the return referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> 15 per cent, of the sugar produced in New South Wales is grown by black labour. But as soon as an amendment of this description began to take effect, those. who had employed white labour in the past would be compelled to take up the coloured labour which must still remain here independent of any action we may take in the near future. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is only the echo of some greater voice in the State from which he comes. I wish to point out that the growers who in the past have endeavoured to carry out the policy of a white Australia will be compelled, if this amendment be carried, to go in the opposite direction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> and others from New South Wales will bear me out in saying that the industry in New South Wales has been struggling for years. Now that some effort is being made to encourage the growers there, it is urged that they should be penalized by being refused this bounty on the ground that they have not employed coloured labour in the past. I hope that will not be done. While this bonus operates, the coloured people who will be displaced by its provisions will very likely find employment for the next three or four years in other directions. If they cannot do so, they will probably depart for countries where they can find employment, and leave Australia whiter than it was before the introduction of this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is considerably exercised in his mind as to the statement made by some honorable member of another place that this bonus is really too high. The same assertion has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline></para>

                        <para>- For the benefit of these honorable senators I shall give a few figures, which should settle all doubts upon the point. This has been a great question for pamphleteering. We "were flooded last session with pamphlets relating to the white Australia proposal. Among others we received one from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell,</inline> giving the acreage under sugar cultivation, the number of registered cane-growers, and the number of kanakas and other coloured people employed in the cane-growing industry in Queensland. Honorable senators will remember that when this question was before the Senate last session, I set <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> certain equations to solve. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell's</inline> figures showed that in one district in Queensland there were 1,911 coloured persons, 1,332 registered white cane-growers, and 1,666 other white people employed in the industry. AVe may say that there were practically 2,000 coloured people and 3,000 white people cultivating the 45,000 acres under sugar-cane in the district in question. The pamphlet showed that in another district there were 523 registered cane-growers, and if we allow them the same proportion of white labour which is really necessary to do the work that the kanaka must not carry out, according 'to the conditions under which they are introduced, we shall find that about 1,000 white people and nearly 5,000coloured people were cultivating 35,000 acres under sugar-cane in the district. These figures show us that the value of a white man's labour was considered to be double that of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> kanaka or coloured man - that one white man was worth two kanakas or two coloured men. That is a deduction which even <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> himself cannot contradict, and I am simply making this statement to show that the bonus is not too high. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell,</inline> the amount of wages paid to the coloured man was £35 per annum, while the white man received £90 or £95 per annum. Thus two coloured men receiving a total of £70 per annum are considered to be able to do an amount of work equal to that performed by a white man receiving £90 or £95 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- I will say that if the honorable senator would exercise a little more intelligence, he would remember that the calculation on which this estimate of £35 a year was based covered three years, and included £30 as the cost of introduction, and £5 for deportation, together with the cost of maintenance, wages and everything else. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell's</inline> return, the labour value of the kanaka as compared with the white man, is as <inline font-style="italic">5k</inline> acres to 11 acres, showing that one white man according to these calculations is capable of cultivating 11 acres of cane, while it requires two coloured men to do the same amount of work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> -and other honorable senators will recognise that we must take the same average of sugar production per acre, and we shall find that about one ton of sugar to the acre is considered a reasonable average, although the actual production may be a little more or a little less. Thus the cost of the white labour involved in the production of 11 tons of sugar is £95, while the cost of the coloured labour required to produce the same quantity is only £70. Honorable senators will find when they have apportioned these amounts as they should be apportioned in connexion with that small item in the production of sugar, that there is' a difference of £25 between the labour of the one and the labour of the other. That is to say there is a difference,,f £25 between the cost of the white and black labour required to produce the quantity of sugar named If we divide 25 by ] 1 we have a little over £2 per ton. Therefore no matter what honorable members of another place, who have never considered the figures supplied to us by the Queensland sugar expert, may say, we have mathematical proof that the bounty of £2 per ton in the present circumstances is not one penny too much. In the near future when the white men have to do the work, and exercise their genius in the cane-fields, that amount may not be necessary in view of the improvements which they may effect. </para>

                        <para>- That is a statement made by those who are engaged in the industry. and who know what they are talking about. When they issued their pamphlet they knew that it would be read by all who are interested in this great question, and they state clearly that the difference in cost between the production of sugar by white labour and by black labour is 7s. 6d. per acre. I understand that the production of cane per acre averages 15 tons. At 10 per cent, that would be equal to H- tons of sugar per acre, and therefore the rebate of £2 per ton of sugar would be equal to £3 per acre of cane. That is what the people of the Commonwealth are being asked to return to the planter, because he has expended 7s. 6d. per acre more than he has done previously by employing black labour. It is, therefore, quite clear that under this Bill we are being asked to pay a very much larger bonus than is necessary to fairly compensate the planter, who has been using black labour, for employing white labour in the future. We are told that there is a necessity for paying this bonus to men who have been producing sugar by white labour all along, because they have been doing a noble thing in refusing to employ coloured labour. But we know that they have not employed white labour from any philanthropic motive, but because they have found that it pays them better than any other class of labour. The people of South Australia, who have been acting upon the policy of a white Australia, from sentimental rather than from practical considerations, are now called upon to contribute towards this bonus to people who are only continuing the industry in the way in which they have conducted it for several years. </para>

                        <para>- I know that we have a good many Chinamen in the Northern Territory who were introduced at the time the railway was built there, but since that time we have said that no Chinamen shall enter South Australia, except the very small number who are able to get in under the tonnage regulations. We have stood by that loyally, and have been making enormous sacrifices in the interests of a white Australia, and yet we are now called upon to make this additional sacrifice, not in the interests of a white Australia, but in order to compensate men who have been employing white labour in the cultivation of sugar all along, because it has paid them to do so. We have already passed ari Act which prohibits the introduction of Asiatics, South Sea Islanders, 'and other coloured races, and if it be true, as has been suggested, that the coloured men now engaged in other avocations in the Commonwealth may be utilized in the production of sugar in New South Wales, it must not be forgotten that the places they leave elsewhere will have to be filled by white men, because there will be no opportunity in the future for the- introduction of cheap Asiatic labour. I say that those who are supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> amendment are loyal . to the white Australia idea,, but we are not willing that a large number of the people of Australia shall be penalized to the extent' to which they will be under this Bill, in order to enrich a few persons who are under no necessity to appeal to the public for assistance. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> remark that. I am the echo of a greater voice, I may tell the honorable senator that I echo the voice of the people of South Australia in this matter, and I am proud to be in a position to do so. </para>

                    <para>- This subject has been discussed from almost every possible stand-point, but I am quite satisfied that, no matter how it is viewed, the unfairness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> proposal must be apparent. Whether it is viewed from the stand-point of a white Australia, of taxation, or of trade as between one grower and another, the unfairness of the proposal must be obvious. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> in common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> seems to think that the taxpayers of Australia are being heavily taxed to pay this bonus for white-grown sugar, but I think I can show that they are paying very little indeed. Apart from the amount of protection which we give the sugar industry, which is protected in common with a number of other industries, and, so far as the bonus or rebate merely is concerned, I hold that the taxpayer is paying nothing whatever. It must not be forgotten that the amount of the excise which goes back in the shape of rebate or bonus to the grower of sugar by white labour comes out of the industry itself. We call upon the industry to pay an excise duty of <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> for every ton of sugar produced, and we pay back to those engaged in the industry 2 out of the £3 upon every ton of sugar grown by white labour. It must, therefore, be apparent that it is the industry that is paying for sugar grown in that way, and not the taxpayers of Australia. Viewing the question in that way, I hold that we are entitled to give the growers of sugar by white labour a certain amount of encouragement. Those who are in favour of the white Australia policy cannot avoid that position. So far from the white Australia policy being an expensive one, we are, under this Bill, being asked simply to give back to the sugar industry two-thirds of what we have taken from it, and I think we could not do less than what is proposed to encourage the growth of sugar by white labour, and to establish the white Australia policy. </para>

                    <para>- In the discussion which took place between us at the table, the question of gangs of black labour was not introduced. I ask to be permitted to make a reference or two of a somewhat personal character. I wish to show clearly that for years my course of action as a public man has been in the direction of helping women and children, and that, in moving this amendment, I am pursuing the same line of policy as I have pursued for the last twenty years. The first measure which I had the honour of passing through the Parliament of my own State was one for the protection of child-life and child-health, and the last measure I had the honour of passing through Parliament, before coming to this higher sphere of duty, was one to amend that Act in the direction of making it more perfect. I was also prominently connected with the passing through that Parliament of a Bill to give divorce relief to deserted wives, bringing the law of the State into line with the law of Scotland. And I think I need do no more than mention the phrase "Old-age Pensions," to remind honorable senators that in that important sphere of humanitarian effort my name does not remain unknown throughout the Commonwealth. I have merely made these references to relieve myself from any possible charge that I am attempting to take up a new role with a sinister object. I have no sinister object. </para>

                    <para>- I am quite willing to fix the age at 18 years. We have the example of the world to show us that the reproductiveness of the white race in tropical countries diminishes. We have not yet had an opportunity of seeing how far the tropical portions of Queensland will give similar evidence, because they have been settled with a mixed population of men, women, and children, and have only been occupied within a period very much less than the duration of one generation. I have a keen recollection of having, in the humble capacity of a mercantile clerk, something very small to do with the establishment of a boiling down station in the locality which is now the city of Townsville. If that is within my business recollection it shows very clearly that the settlement of the white race in a general way in Queensland lias been very recent. There has been no large white population in the tropical portions of the State for even twenty years - it may be fairly put, I suppose, at about fifteen years. Therefore, there has not yet been any opportunity for ascertaining how far the tropical climate may affect the reproductiveness, the health, and the stamina of the race. It must be admitted that whatever risk of climate there exists in respect of a white population in the tropical portions of Queensland, that risk, however slight, must be enormously enhanced by undesirable labour. Leaving aside all accusation, or all statement of what is alleged to have happened in the past, I ask the Committee to unite in preventing by legislation the possibility of white women being employed in a work which hitherto has found acceptance at the hands Only of kanakas. Surely where the kanaka has been employed for 30 or 40 years cannot be a place where honorable senators would wish to see white women employed at the same class of labour. And surely if it is desirable to protect the adult woman, it is equally desirable to protect the growing boy, upon whose healthy and successful development depends the future success of Queensland. If the standard of health, the standard of physical development, is reduced in that respect, an injury will be done to the future of that section of the population of the Commonwealth which honorable senators will be sorry to have had a hand in bringing about. I do not think it necessary to support my amendment at greater length. If, in the division, I am in the minority, it will not prove that I am in the wrong, and if I am in the majority, it will not prove that I am right. </para>

I shall not say that those who -vote against me will be guilty of doing anything.

            <para>SenatorDRAKE. - I suppose we all agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that it is most undesirable that women or children shall be employed in plantation work in the same way as kanakas have been employed. But when it comes to a question of women or children assisting in family labour - in what might almost be called a cottage industry - I believe that a great many honorable senators will consider that it is better that they should be employed in that way than that they should be starving. We have to bear in mind that some persons engaged in the cultivation of products like sugar-cane may be very poor, and that a little assistance occasionally from members of the family may enable them to get over their difficulties and earn the means of a livelihood. I shall not deal with the matter from that point of view. I put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> whether his amendment is not utterly impracticable. It is exceedingly difficult at the present time, by the use of a number of inspectors, to watch all these plantations and see that coloured labour is not employed sometimes in connexion with cane for which a bonus is to be claimed. If we go further, and insist that where cane is grown on a small scale by small settlers, the occasional assistance of members of the family shall vitiate a claim for a bonus, it will necessitate the employment of almost as many inspectors as there are cane-growers. The thing is, from that point of view, entirely unpracticable. I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that, other things being equal, I should prefer that women and children should not bo employed. But this proposal would defeat the objects of the Bill. If it is to be applied to the cultivators of sugar, why not to the growers of - other kinds of agricultural produce) </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe in sweating women or children. My voice will always be raised in the endeavour to abolish sweating. I take it that this policy already entails a great deal of trouble and expense to carry out. If we say that by means of- it we will not only determine the question of white and black labour but also the industrial conditions under which sugar is to be produced, we shall add largely to the expense of working it That is another indication that the honorable senator by this proposal is endeavouring to kill the effectiveness of the measure. Furthermore, I take it that Queensland has her own educational laws, under which children are compelled to attend school until they have obtained a certificate or have reached the ago oi fourteen years. If that be so, under the school laws of .Queensland children will not be allowed to work in the cane-fields. As to women, I have yet to learn that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> objects to their working in factories. When the Post and Telegraph Bill was before us he did not propose, when we dealt with postal contracts, to provide that no women should be employed in the factories making our goods. I know what field work is, and I say positively, as one who has taken part in both field and factory labour, that I would rather see a female relative of mine engaged in field work than - in some kinds of - factory work, both from the moral and physical point of view. But this amendment is not moved altogether with the view of studying the interests of women. I am associated with a party which, if it stands for anything at all, stands for the abolition of sweating and the protection of women and children in the industrial sphere. But I have no hesitation in condemning the present proposal, altheugh, as I have already said, if I were in a State Parliament that was dealing with industrial conditions, I should be prepared i to make it a general rule, not to prevent the employment of women in outdoor work, but to regulate their hours and conditions of I labour. But the honorable senator does not : propose to do that. He proposes to inter- - fere neither with the rates of pay, hours.df I labour, nor conditions of work: He merely declares that women shall be prohibited from working. As to children, I would observe that when a boy reaches the age of sixteen, the best thing that can happen for' him is that he shall be put to work. If some boys who are now running round our streets were working in the fields, it would be better both for them and for Australia. The honorable senator is not acting in the best interests of the boys of this country when he says that when they reach the age of eighteen they should not be allowed to work in the fields. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> worked as a boy in the fields of Queensland, and does not seem to be any the worse for it. I have met scores of Queenslanders who come from the torrid regions and who have been engaged both in field and in mining work. From the physical point' of view they compare very favorably with other Australians. I look upon this as a piece of mock heroics - as an attempt to pose as the defender of women and children on the part of one who has never shown himself to be a supporter of any practical proposal of the kind. </para>
