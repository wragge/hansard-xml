              <para>- Like most of the honorable senator&#39;s calculations, that one is inaccurate. The more I hear from the advocates of the Bill the more convinced I am that a High Court is not required. I hear a succession of special pleadings, very clever, and plausible, but to me very unconvincing. I listened with a good deal of interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> whom I regard as a rising and brilliant man.

              <para>- No; because he wrote what was not correct in my opinion - that the Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria are not as broadminded as they would have been if they had been politicians. How could he form an opinion on that point? Has he ever been a politician? And, if not, why should he make such a reflection upon any Occupant of our Bench? No doubt he is well acquainted with the theory of law, but I am not aware that he ever had an extensive practice as a lawyer. It is all right for a man at the University, with an assured income, to sit down in his study arid criticise the work of another man with which he has no practical acquaintance. When I heard his view that the Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria have lacked political experience, and therefore have been rather narrow-minded, I decided in future to accept anything coming from that source with a- good deal of hesitation. Hitherto, I have regarded Professor Harrison Moore as a gentleman who thoroughly understood his profession, and whose word had great weight with me, but in future it will have very little weight with me. In his opinion, we have all along appointed the wrong men to the Bench of the Supreme Court ; we should not have appointed those Judges if it be true that they have not been politicians. It turns out, however, that the professor did not understand what he was writing about, for at least one half of the Judges from the outset had held prominent positions - in some cases leading positions - in the politics of their time. </para>

              <para>- Yes. To say that those men were narrow-minded, because they had not had parliamentary experience, is something new to me at all events. As a layman, I cannot conceive that a few years&#39; experience in a State -Parliament would&#39; be of very great benefit to a Judge in administering the law. Surely we have some very high-class lawyers who have never seen the inside of a Parliament House, and perhaps it is all the better that they have not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has said that the cost of the High Court per head will be only three farthings. </para>

              <para>- It is more than a penny per head, because 4,000,000 pence come to over &#163;16,000. Three farthings per head will not amount to &#163;20,000. I shall not argue about a trifle like that. It does not matter whether the cost is three farthings or &#163;3 per head. If the High Court is not required it should not be created ; but if it is required, let us spend the necessary money. </para>

              <para>- I should think that no man would assist the honorable senator to carry an amendment which would give a pension of &#163;450 to a man who had held office for only one day. If a man were sworn in one day, and met with an accident next day which would prevent him from taking his seat on the bench, he would be entitled to a pension of &#163;450 a year for life. I do not think we are in a condition to be quite so generous as that. </para>

              <para>-No one can tell what to-morrow may bring forth. My honorable friend also advocates high salaries for the Judges - why? - because a seat on the Federal Bench is a very much higher position than a seat on a State Bench. I wonder why he does not practise what he preaches? The  Clerk  of the Victorian Parliament receives a salary of &#163;1,200, but the  Clerk  of the great Federal Parliament receives a salary of &#163;900. </para>

The Secretary of the Department for Home Affairs in this great Commonwealth receives a salary of &#163;750, but the Secretary of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works and Water Supply - a glorified municipal counci - is paid &#163;1,000 a year. A Federal J udge, however, is to receive more than a State Judge. </para>

              <para>- Oh yes. We hear a lot about the enormous incomes which eminent counsel earn, but, like the Scotchman, I have had my do&#39;ots about it all along. A good many persons, including myself, think that the Chief Justices of the States could be clothed with the necessary authority to form the High Court for some years. One objection to that proposal was voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the level-headed young man from Western Australia, as he was described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal,</inline> and it was that their travelling expenses would be very heavy. He quite overlooked the fact that the Bill provides for travelling expenses for the Judges of the High Court ; it is an unknown part of the outlay. A far more serious charge, however, was made against the States J Judges when it was said that they would be biased. I do not believe that there is the slightest foundation for the suggestion that the States Judges would be biased in any dispute between the Commonwealth and a State. Suppose that adispute arose between South Australia and the Commonwealth ; if it were thought necessary, although I do not think so, the Chief Justice of that State would not preside in the High Court in such a case. In any.dispute between Victoria and South Australia, the Chief Justice of neither of those States need preside. There would still be four other Chief Justices.. In any dispute that , might arise there will always be the Chief Justices of at least three States which are not interested. But, even if that were not the case, I should be perfectly satisfied to intrust my interests to the Chief Justices of any of the States. I never heard of any of them being biased. Is it to be supposed that they would be biased in favour of their own States as- against the Commonwealth because the States paid them their salaries <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If that be so the same argument would apply1 to the Federal Judges, who would be biased in favour of the Commonwealth, .which was their paymaster. If there is any truth in the argument at all, why would not the Federal High Court Judges be biased in favour of the Commonwealth in a dispute between  States and Commonwealth ? But the argument will not hold water. I have not yet heard where the Federal High Court is going to sit. Will it have a court-house with all its paraphernalia in each one of the capitals, or is it to be located in the capital city of the Commonwealth ? If so, would it not be as well to postpone the appointment of the court until the Federal capital is selected, and a building is erected to receive the Judges ? At present I do not know whether it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to erect court-houses in every State, or in one particular State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made a point to the- effect that the people of Australia accepted the High Court in agreeing to the Constitution Bill. Of course they did. They had to accept the whole Bill or reject it. If every elector in Australia had been opposed to the High Court, the Commonwealth Bill would still have gone through, because, after all, the High Court is only a small matter compared with the great interests involved. </para>

              <para>- I voted against the first Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie seems to be always wrong in his inferences as to what I have done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> also made reference to the Brunswick meeting, where the High Court was supported. It looks as though a part of the people of this State were in favour of the proposed expenditure upon the High Court. But, for a moment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> overlooked the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hume</inline> Cook, the member of the House of Representatives for the electorate in which Brunswick is situated, had already pledged himself to the High Court, and that the meeting was held in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hume</inline> Cook&#39;s stronghold, near to where he lives. As a matter of course, his friends supported him in that, as they do in nearly .every other subject, because he is a very brilliant and popular young fellow. I can very well understand that senators, in addressing meetings on this question, would be looked upon as being after all simply members of an Upper House. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Another point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made showed that he is very anxious about the&#39; Inter-State Railway, and believes that the High Court will have some influence in regard to its construction. I will not call it a transcontinental railway, because it is only a line between two States - connecting Port Augusta with Kalgoorlie. I do not see how the High Court can act if South Australia declines to sanction the construction of the line. The High Court cannot override the Constitution. </para>

I could not help noticing some of the arguments used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> yesterday. I paid special attention to his speech, because he is a lawyer, and has erudition. I understood him to say that there were nine Federal Supreme Court Judges in America, And that it was contemplated to appoint twelve more. Accepting the fact that there are nine Federal Supreme Court Judges in the United States, if we had the same proportion to population, we should have half a Judge. The United States has twenty times the population that Australia has. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> tells us that there are also 120 other Judges. In course of time there will be 1 20 other J Judges here if we keep on as we are going. </para>

              <para>- I assisted the labour party to oppose that loan. They were quite right in opposing it. But if the loan money had been raised, it must have been spent for the purposes specified in the Bill, and the result would have been to find employment for 1,000 men for two or three years. The labour party objected to a loan which would have been the means of affording employment to so many men for so long a time. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; we are all in the same boat. But the parting of the ways has come since then. I now object to this expenditure on the High Court, but the majority of the labour party - not the whole of them - intend to support the spending of &#163;35,000 a year upon- it. The interest on a loan of &#163;500,000 at 3&#163; per cent, would have been &#163;17,500 a year. The expenditure on the High Court, which will not be less than &#163;35,000 a year, capitalized at 3A per cent., means a million of money. The labour party do not mind spending on the High Court, which is non productive, and will not employ labour, the interest on a million of money per annum, but they objected to speed the interest on half -a-million on works which would have involved four-fifths of the expenditure going into the pockets of the workers of Australia. There is no reply to that point. Honorable senators know that it is perfectly true. The money under this Bill is to be expended, not amongst the workers of </para>

              <para>- I do not want the honorable senator to do so. But when I turn, to the division list of another place, and consider the lawyers who were opposed to the Bill, I feel bound to take up the same position. A number of eminent barristers voted on the one side or the other on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. In favour of it were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> E. Groom and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. I.</inline> A. Isaacs. But let honorable senators listen to the names of the eminent lawyers who were opposed to it. And here let me say that this disposes of the idea which is sometimes expressed that the lawyers want this court to be established in order to create work for their profession. I do not think that the lawyers are very much worse than other classes of people, nor do I know that they are very much better. There is a good deal of human nature in all of us. But the division list effectively disposes of the story that the lawyers want the High Court because it will find additional employment for their brethren. There were against the measure <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, and Messrs. Glynn, Higgins, McCay, Hughes, and Conroy. When I hear these interjections about Victoria, I am led to believe that Victoria is like a&#39; red rag to some honorable senators from the Never-Never country. I remind them that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> is not a Victorian, nor are Messrs Hughes and Conroy. </para>

In speaking upon the Address in Reply, I expressed the opinion that so many matters of importance required attention that there would probably not be time to pass this, measure  during this session. The opposition which has been expressed to the measure by the Melbourne press and&#39; the Kyabram movement generally, and the turn-about-face they have exhibited in connexion with the Naval Agreement, have gone a long way to induce nae to alter my opinion. If they showed any consistency in their professed desire for economy with common sense, I should be prepared to assist them ; but, when I find that they are willing to make &#39; a row over the expenditure of &#163;20,000 upon the establishment of a High Court, while at the same time they are prepared to support the Naval Agreement, involving an expenditure of &#163;200,000 a year, I can have no faith in the sincerity of their professions. </para>

            <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Aye</inline> does not support it for the time being, but the other Melbourne newspaper does, and the Kyabram movement generally is in favour of that expenditure. The shallowness of this kind of economy is too apparent to deceive any one. When I find: politics reduced to the advocacy of such miserable economy as that, I am prepared to support an expenditure of &#163;20,000 upon the High Court, and to oppose the larger expenditure of &#163;200,000 upon the proposed Naval Agreement. </para>

              <para>- No; they are quite willing, apparently, that money should be expended upon matters which most people believe can be very well done without. They are prepared in some instances to throw money into the sea, and to refuse expenditure upon useful works. When the Commonwealth Bill was before the electors, there were very few who gave any attention to the Federal Constitution who did not thoroughly understand that the High Court was part and parcel of the proposed Federation, and at the Federal elections it was clearly pointed out that it was necessary to establish a High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has made some comparisons with the other House, but in trying to make out a case that the lawyers in that House were not in favour of this measure, the honorable senator told us that only Messrs. Groom and Isaacs supported the Bill. </para>

              <para>- What about the members of the Ministry and prominent men on the Opposition side ? The honorable senator&#39;s manipulation of names was not fair argument. When he knew that Messrs. Reid, Bruce Smith, and Fuller, as well as the legal members of the Ministry, supported the Bill, he might well have mentioned their names when making his comparison. As I have already said, the manner in which the Victorian press is trying to bully politicians in this State has had a great effect in inducing me to alter my opinion. Rather than be bullied and led by the nose, as some politicians in Victoria have been, I would prefer to do without a seat in this or in any other Chamber. If politicians, particularly in Victoria, do not show a little more backbone there will be more disgrace than credit attaching to the position. For that, more than for any other reason, I am prepared to vote for this measure. </para>

              <para>- That may be so, but we have had altogether too much of press dictation, and if Federal members do not show a little more independence we shall probably be informed by the press shortly that we can do without not only a High Court, but a Federal Parliament. If this sort of thing continues, I expect before long to see that suggestion made. It will probably be proposed that we shall do without the Federal Parliament by handing over our work to the Kyabram Parliament located for the time being in the Exhibition Building. </para>

              <para>- Or by giving the States Parliaments power to legislate in Federal affairs. There would be just as much reason in that proposal as there is in the proposal to hand over the work of the High Court to States Judges. It would be only carrying the absurdity a little&#39; further, but the proposal would be quite as logical. The necessity for the establishment of a High Court has already been shown by honorable senators who have given more attention to the subject, and I need not therefore dwell upon that point. I shall certainly do what I can to resist the dictation which the Melbourne newspapers address morning after morning to Federal representatives of Victoria and of the other States, as to how they shall vote on Federal matters. There are many great Federal undertakings which have noc received the attention to which their importance entitles them. The establishment of the Federal capital is not a matter which concerns my State one way or the other, but we know that at the present time every attempt is being made to throw cold water upon the demand for the settlement of that question. The transcontinental railway is being treated in a similar manner, and yet these are matters of the greatest importance to the country. </para>

              <para>- I think I may be allowed to refer to these matters as involving expense, because the principal argument used against this measure is that it involves the expenditure of money. I take it that much of the opposition shown to the Bill is owing to that fact. Most honorable senators agree as to the necessity for the establishment of some kind of Federal Court, and the question&#39; has been narrowed down to one of expense. And in connexion with that aspect of the matter, I point out that the proposal to depute States Courts to do the work of the Federal High Court will also involve expense. We have had a case in point- already in our experience of the Works Department. At the present time we are paying a great deal more for our Works Department than we should be paying, simply because the work is being done by officers of the States Departments. </para>

              <para>- I know that the work is now costing a great deal more than it cost when the States Departments did the work for1 their own Parliaments. The cost of this Department is increased because we have no direct control of those who are doing the work. I know that it is impossible for us to have a Works Department in every State to carry on the small public works we have had to deal with so far ; but there is no getting away from the fact that public works are costing the Federal Government more than they have cost the States Governments, because we have no direct control of the officers doing the work. The same thing will happen if we try the experiment of getting States Courts to do the work of a Federal High Court. We shall find that it will cost a great deal more. </para>

I intend to vote for this measure.

            <para>- After the very exhaustive speeches to which we have listened upon this question, I do&#39; not intend to take up the time of the Senate at any great length. I may say, to begin with, that I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill. I confess, however, that I shall do so with very great reluctance, for several reasons, which I will give very shortly. The first reason is that this Bill has come up to us with an appropriation. That fact, in a very great measure, ties our hands. It limits us rigidly to what the House of Representatives has done. I do not think that is treating the Senate in a proper fashion. We ought to have a&#62; free hand in machinery Bills of this character to lay down whatever lines we please - to increase the number of Judges, if wethink that a proper course, and in other ways amend the measure. &#34;Unfortunately, as I have said, the Bill contains an appropriation, and in that way ties our hands. Another reason why I object to the Bill is that it comes here shorn of a great deal of its usefulness - mutilated and emasculated.. The measure, as introduced in another place, was one which, I believe, the great majority of the people of Australia wereprepared to support. I know that in Queensland the idea was that Federation necessarily involved the institution of a High Court to which the people of the entire Commonwealth could appeal in the ultimate that, in short, the court would be the crowning glory of our judicial system. But the measure, if passed as submitted to this1 Chamber, will create a court contemptible in its &#34; looped and windowed raggedness.&#34;&#39; It is true that in some matters the HighCourt will have original jurisdiction, but I believe that the people of Australia desire that original jurisdiction shall be exercised in every particular - that a litigant may be able to obtain the best and highest legal opinion within the confines of the Commonwealth, and not have to drag his casethrough the various inferior courts. The large majority of the people are, I believe, anxious that  there  shall be a final Court of Appeal in the Commonwealth - that whileour laws are made in Australia by the people of Australia they should be interpreted by Judges appointed by the Australian Government, and paid by the Australian people. </para>

              <para>- It is utterly useless, so far as I am concerned, for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to make that interjection. It would have been very much better for Australia, and for other countries with which I have some acquaintance, if they had been governed less by the methods of the shop and more on the lines of statesmanship. There is a great deal of difference between running a business and running a country. There are people who have been trained up with the huckster&#39;s mind. I am not making any reflection on commercial men, who are absolutely necessary under our present conditions ; but their minds are confined to the narrow groove of the market place. They are utterly out of their sphere in the wider arena of statesmanship, where the. affairs of the community and the welfare and social conditions of the people sire at stake. The fact that the commercial men of Australia believe in appeal to the Privy Council would be quite sufficient to convince me, if there was not a single other good reason for objecting to such an appeal. The Federal High Court ought to have original jurisdiction all round, and there ought. to be five Judges. Some of our Victorian friends are railing against the extravagance of the Commonwealth ; but how many Judges are there for the State of Victoria <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It would appear that the Federal Parliament is called upon to attire our High Court, sp to speak,  in rags, and house it in a stable, so that the States may indulge in all sorts of extravagance. No doubt the States &#39; have been extravagant, spending money without stint; and, to save a particular section of the community from further taxation, we are asked to emasculate the Federal High Court and make it of no earthly use - to place it in the position, so to speak, of a poor relation -seated &#34;below the salt&#34; and beneath the contempt of all the States Supreme Courts. That is not a position which will redound -to either the credit or the profit of Australia. I am not surprised at the action of my Victorian friends, because there is a power in that State which apparently controls everything. But this power is blind of one eye, gouty in both feet - I refer to the movement called Kyabram - and it is astonishing that when this impotent : power waves its crutch in the air, and threatens Victorian members of the Federal Parliament, they come to heel like collie dogs at the shepherd&#39;s whistle. </para>

              <para>- That is what I am saying. Why do these people yell out for economy ? It is that they may save their own wretched skins from further taxation. But do they think the people of the other portions of the Commonwealth will be content to have their judicial system mutilated merely to save a section from contributing their fair share towards the cost of government <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I misinterpret the feeling of my constituents very much if I come to the conclusion that they are in favour of a Supreme Court of the character which these advocates of economy desire. The public want a Supreme Court which will be accessible to all citizens, and will be &#39; an honour to the Commonwealth. I suppose that the Judges of this &#39; Supreme Court would be required to go on circuit; but how are three men to spread themselves over the whole continent&#39;? </para>

              <para>- A High Court is provided for by the Constitution ; it is not for us to say when it is required. The Government have been taunted with not bringing forward this measure earlier, but I think there is a very complete answer to that objection. The Government first brought forward what they believed to be the most necessary legislation. There was a time , limit specified in the Constitution with regard to the Tariff, while the &#34; white &#34; Australia question pressed for solution, and the franchise had to be fixed. All the preliminary business of founding the Commonwealth had to be done at the very earliest opportunity, and when it had been cleared out of the way the Government introduced this further measure to carry out the bargain which had been entered -into by the various States. Not a single honorable senator has expressed the opinion that we should never have a Federal High Court, but have only argued that for economical reasons its creation ought to be delayed. My contention is that in matters of this kind delays are dangerous. We know how the legal mind runs in grooves - how lawyers are governed by precedent more than by anything else. It is only proper that in the early days of the Commonwealth our precedents should be laid down, not by State authorities, but by Commonwealth authorities who are in touch with Australian sentiment. We know perfectly well that there isa feeling of irritation between the States Governments and the Federal authorities. If I were to say what I think I should at once describe the feeling as actuated by nothing else but jealousy and envy. We know that the States Judges move in certain State circles, and it is unavoidable that they should be tinctured with State feeling on the question of Federation. For that reason I do not think it is desirable- to have our Federal legislation interpreted by men who are appointed by the States, and responsible to the States. I do not see how it would be possible to get decisions on any uniform lines from State Judges. If there were a law suit between Victoria and the Commonwealth, it would be tried by three Supreme Court Judges from the other States. We certainly would get a decision ; but if at some future period a case arose, say between New South Walesand the Commonwealth, there would be a different set of Judges, who might give adifferent decision. There would be no recognised authority under such a scheme ; but if a Federal High Court be established the laws in the different States in their relation to the Federation, will be immediately brought into line. Precedents will beclearly established by the High Court ; and if the law be wrong, the people will be able to&#62; immediately proceed to alter it in accord with public opinion. It is very desirable for that reason that a High Court should beat once established. In considering this matter, I, rightly or wrongly, have been driven to the conclusion that the cry for economy is merely a stalking horse - thatthere are other reasons operating in the minds of people who say that we ought not tohave a High Court, because- it will cost toomuch. What are those other reasons <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I find throughout the Continent, in certain circles, an extremely &#39; strong feeling of hostility to the Federal Government and Parliament. In their view the Government is too drastic, and the Parliament is too liberal, because too much progress has been made with democratic legislation. The interests of the masses have been considered too much, and the interests of the classes too little, and for that reason they are extremely unwilling that such a democratic Government should have the opportunity of choosing the men to fill the positions on theBench of the High Court. </para>

              <para>- I think that outside the Senate a feeling of that kind does prevail. They- want the patronage togo somewhere else. They are afraid that if the choice rests with the present Ministers, the J Judges will be too Australian that their sympathy will be rather with the people than with the commercial or moneyed classes. I believe that feeling exists in the mind of a very large section of the people. </para>

              <para>- Tes. When a section of the House of Representatives was instrumental in reducing the expenditure on defence we heard the very same cry. No word of economy was uttered : it was called cheeseparing, bad statesmanship, and so on. When the people of the States made up their minds to federate they must have known well enough that they would have to pay for their whistle. They ought to have prepared for Federation by cutting down their State expenditure. But have they done so ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> has said that the High Court will cost &#163;30,000 <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> year. No opponent of the Bill says that we ought not to have a High Court. They say that according to the &#39;Constitution it must be created. They admit that a High Court is both desirable and necessary, but they say it should be created at some other time. If we must have a High Court let us admit the situation at once : it will cost money. We cannot keep up our present establishments, and, in addition, have this Other institution without making extra taxation necessary.- If we can-not do that what is our alternative 1 It is to cut down our present establishments. We have a number of Governors who, with all due respect to them, are of no earth&#93; y use to the Commonwealth. They do mot perform a single useful function <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> fiar as the people of Australia are concerned, and yet on the average they cost the States from &#163;7,000 to &#163;10,000 per annum. Here is a method by which our Kyabram friends could promote economy. Why not -abolish the office of Governor ? </para>

              <para>- I am not talking about republicanism. I am a utilitarian, as I suppose the honorable and learned senator is under certain conditions. I do not want any figure-heads here - merely ornamental persons who do nothing, and who are very well paid for doing it. My desire is that we should not have a single office which is not necessary. If I am to choose between spending &#163;30,000 a year on a High Court, which I consider is absolutely necessary, and  &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000 on States Governors, who I consider are not necessary, then I sha&#39;ll not hesitate for a single moment. I shall vote to abolish the States Governors, who are of no earthly use. If there must be a connecting link between the States and the Crown, then we could follow the example of Canada. We have heard a great deal about the salaries of Canadian Judges. If the example of that Confederation is a good one to follow with regard to Judges - and I am not saying that it is not - then it is also a good one to follow in regard to States Governors. In Canada the provinces &#39; are placed under the charge of LieutenantGovernors who receive comparatively small salaries, and who are Canadian citizens. </para>

            <para>- It was my privilege - I think I may say very great honour - to preside over the Judiciary Committee of the Convention. For that reason alone, I feel that I can scarcely allow this opportunity to pass without expressing my views as shortly as I can, and giving some explanation of why the Judiciary Committee recommended the establishment of a High Court. I wish first to express my thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> who I understand alluded, in his speech,, to the position which I then occupied. I thank my honorable friend&#39; for the observations which he made, and which were in line with and bore out the unanimous views of the committee, from which, I am sorry to say, some of its members, who were then extremely enthusiastic in some directions, have fallen away. </para>

I believe, firmly, with my honorable friend, that if the Bill as originally introduced had been put before the people of this country, with proper explanations, in an unbiased way, free from by - issues, it would have received their unanimous approval. That is not merely a controversial view ; because I am going to consider this questionquite apart from any controversial position. This is no party measure.

              <para>- It is no party measure in this Parliament. The party lines which divide us in this Parliament do not embrace this particularmeasure. That has been recognised in the debates in both branches of the Legislature. It was recognised in the voting. And the reason is that the measure - this organization of the national Judiciary -has a far higher motive and object than the carrying out of any particular party policy. It is above party. It appeals, as I think,, to the duty which we owe to the Constitution, Therefore, I approach the Bill quite apart from any controversial spirit whatever. If we did consider it from that point of view, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> undoubtedly would be justified in saying that the element, I will not say of suspicion, bub of jealousy, might naturally be introduced. So long as we have representative government, so long as we have party government on the British system, so long as human nature is human nature, it is clearly to beexpected, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> indicated, that there would ordinarily be party opposition to handing over patronage and power to the Ministry in office. I believe, in accordance with the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> that anything of that description can be swept out of our minds. I support the Bill and the Government in this instance, because, in my judgment, they are pursuing the right and only path. They are keeping faith with the Constitution. They arekeeping faith with the people. I believein the first place that every true Federalist - I am not introducing any element o&#163; controversy or disapproval, one way or the other - every one who at the time of the Convention, and prior to it, during the efforts which were made to educate the  public on this great question, was a Federalist, ought to support the Bill. In the second place, every man, whether a Federalist or not, seeing that this Federal union is accomplished, ought to seek to make it complete find effective under the Constitution. </para>

              <para>- Then my honorable friend does not come in the category of those whom I have within my mind. I say that, because of the nature of this Bill, and because of the position which the Judiciary sought to &#39; be set up occupies under our Federal system. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> said that he would vote for&#39; the Bill with reluctance because it was a ragged measure, and that the High Court to be established under it would be a court which would not fill us with pride. &#34;Well, I cannot go quite that length with him. I shall vote for the Bill, also with reluctance, because the court will be one of three J Judges ; and I will give reasons why I think there ought to be five. But whilst I say that, instead of following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> in believing that the court will be one which will - I think he used the word - be contemptible, I believe that if it is properly constituted, and if it does the duty which we expect it to dis: charge under this Constitution of ours, it will rise .to a level at which it will give satisfaction to the people of this country, small though it be in its beginning. Furthermore, instead of dwindling, I hope it will grow in strength and usefulness, like the mustard seed, which grew into a great tree, and sheltered the birds of&#39; heaven in its  branches. I trust that&#39; it will grow with its responsibilities, increase with its duties, and always remain an exponent of that dignity, &#39; efficiency, and power which should pertain to the High Court of the Commonwealth. I think that the Ministry are pursuing the right course. I think so, because the Judiciary is embedded in the Constitution. I am afraid it is sometimes overlooked that the High Court is established by the Constitution. The other courts Parliament may or may not create. Under the Constitution Parliament may or may not give Federal jurisdiction to existing courts. But the &#39;High Court on every constitutional principle is, in my judgment - I say so with the utmost respect for those who disagree with me - beyond the legal or moral competence of Parliament to block ; just as, once organized, it will be beyond the legal or moral competence of Parliament to abolish it. </para>

              <para>- I shall come to that point in a minute or two. If my honorable friend agrees with me up to this point, we have got a step in advance. Such is the view which I take of the Constitution. That is the view which weighed with rae upon the Judiciary Committee of the Convention in seeking the form in which the sections affecting the Judiciary appear in the Constitution. That is the view which was carried out in the unanimous report of the Judiciary Committee. The Convention, following the advice of the Judiciary Committee, adopted those sections in the particular form in which they now stand in the Constitution. The Judiciary, in the position in which it stands now, resembles a warship fully constructed, equipped, and armed in every, way, but not manned. It is on the slips, ready to be launched, and all that this Parliament has to do is to launch it. </para>

              <para>- We certainly want a stoker. My honorable friend would make an excellent stoker. Does any one deny that the Judiciary is established by the Constitution <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> Does any one say that if we organize the High Court, and bring it into operation, Parliament could abolish it? Of course wo could not. The people of this country have enacted this Constitution. They have enacted the High Court, and they have intrusted Parliament, simply as their Ministers, with the Ministerial duty of choosing or- enabling the Executive Government to choose the personnel of the court, and to provide the wherewithal in money which the Convention had no power to provide for the purpose of enabling the High Court to be carried on. It is also true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has said, that there is not a single soul, so far as I am aware, who has been extravagant and absurd enough to declare that the Federal J udiciary should not be set going - not one. Petitions have been received from my own State, but not one of them says that there shall be no Judiciary. They do not ask the Senate to reject the Bill. All they do is to suggest a substitution - that we should have a peripatetic Court of States Chief Justices, and that they should sit periodically in three cities. It is the most crude notion in the world. Which three cities <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> And which Chief Justices ? I am not disparaging the opinion of the petitioners for a moment, nor am I speaking -without the greatest respect for the opinions which have been expressed adversely to those which I now have the opportunity by favour of the Senate of expressing. But when it is suggested by a series of petitions not that we should reject the Bill - a view which I could quite understand emanating from people who did not comprehend the Constitution under which we live - but that we should establish a Judiciary of a peripatetic character, consisting of three Chief Justices, owing place and pay and allegiance to their own States, who should sit in three different cities. I am lost in wonder that otherwise sensible men could conceive such a proposal. Such a court would lead to the greatest irritation and discontent. It would violate the Constitution. The proposal is really too absurd for serious notice. Opposition has arisen, also, because some members of this Parliament who, like myself, were proud of being members of the Convention, seem to have desired to fight over again in Parliament points upon which they were defeated in the Convention. We must take the ^Constitution as we find it. I say, with great deference to my friends to whom I have referred, that we ought not to resist the effective organization of the Judiciary simply because some of us were beaten on some points affecting the Judiciary in the Convention. I .was interested, when my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> was speaking, by his reference to the division list of another place. He laid some stress on the fact that an honorable and learned member from my own State who was a member of the Judiciary Committee of the Convention - my honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> - has opposed the Bill. In the other branch of the Legislature, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">Glynn, I find, recalled the fact that he moved an amendment at the close of the Convention, when what were called the drafting committee&#39;s amendments were being considered. I may say that I am not with my honorable friend in his view - which was that appeals would be entertained by the Privy Council direct from the States Courts even under the Constitution as it stands. But assuming that that view were correct, he moved an amendment to make it clear that such appeals should not be made. He said, speaking on the motion for the third reading of this Bill-- </para>

          <para class="block">That condition of things existed in April, 1 898. It was then known that my honorable and learned friend&#39;s amendment was defeated. The Bill as it went to the referendum and afterwards to England did not contain his amendment. It contained as I think, and think still, an insufficient limitation of the appeal to the Privy Council. But I had to be content. That was the position of affairs then. The first referendum took place, and my honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> was one of the strongest advocates of this Bill without his amendment at that referendum. Not only was he one of the most eloquent platform advocates of the Bill, but he wrote a series of able articles in the newspapers urging its adoption on every ground, and not least because of the Judiciary. He commended this Bill and this Judiciary - without his amendment - to the acceptance of the people of South Australia in the most emphatic manner. I can use no better language than the honorable and learned gentleman then used. I refer to this simply because my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> seemed to be influenced by the array of undoubtedly eminent legal men against the measure in another place, and he specially mentioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> Now I offer the honorable senator the other <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline></para>

              <para>- We have taken that away by the Constitution. We have preserved iri the Constitution our power, and with the permission- which I think ought never to have been hesitated about - of the Imperial Parliament, we have the power of interpreting our own Constitution and our own laws. It is no use talking of that ; that is done. But if my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> were to have his way, and could reject this Bill, what would be the position ? We could not have any decision within this Commonwealth upon any constitutional question between the Commonwealth and States <inline font-style="italic">inter se,</inline> or between States themselves <inline font-style="italic">inter se,</inline> because they could never get to the. Privy Council. It is only the High Court that can decide them in the first instance, and it is only the High Court that can certify, if it so desires, that they are matters proper for appeal to the Privy Council. We should under the Constitution be in exactly the position so lucidly shown by my honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> in his considered advocacy of the Commonwealth Bill in 1898 - that unless a High Court were established we might be involved to-morrow in most serious disputes between the Commonwealth and the States, or the States as between themselves, and we should be without any remedy. </para>

If America is to be any guide, the High Court there gives decisions on the most vital and important questions between the States and the Commonwealth, and  considering that the Bench of New South Wales -consists of seven Judges, and the Bench of Victoria consists of six or seven, and that sometimes the decisions are given by five Judges, I think that as this High Court is to be a Court of Appeal and the interpreter of the Constitution, it would, to some extent, belittle the Court if you had to take a case from five strong Judges in New South  Wales or Victoria to even three eminent Judges of the Federal Court. </para>

              <para>- I am not suggesting that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is not saying the same now. I am only observing how deeply grateful I am to him for guiding me on the right course of supporting this measure, although it will only give us what he describes as three eminent Judges. I have not had the privilege of hearing the debate so far, but I will pledge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> my uncompromising support if he will take steps in Committee to increase the number of Judges from three to five. </para>

              <para>- For the different reasons which have been summarized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> the question rests between those who do not declare for no Judiciary, but contend for no Judiciary at present, and those who seek to substitute States Judges. The climax and achievement of all the opposition - and as to the wisdom or unwisdom of the opposition I make no comment - is that, in the establishment of our national court, they have succeeded in cutting.&#39; off two Judges, and saving &#177;&#39;6,000 a year in a country with a Customs revenue of &#163;10,000,000. </para>

              <para>- It was the debate on the proposal to reduce the number of Judges to three. There was a proposal to leave the matter within the power of Parliament ; but the Convention were against that idea, and refused to reduce the number to three. It was not until the Melbourne Convention that the number was altered ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will remember that the Judiciary Committee recommended that there should be four Judges and a Chief Justice. I am now merely endeavouring to recall <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> earlier and fresher impressions. Where is the opposition to this Bill ? Where is the people&#39;s opposition? True, we are dealing with what is an Imperial Act of Parliament, but the Constitution is an enactment of the people of Australia, and we ought to have regard to the fact that no one can alter the Constitution but the people. It has been suggested that the people assented to the Constitution, but not to that particular part which provides for the creation of the High Court. The assent of the people was to this particular part and every part of the Constitution. I have a pretty good memory qf what took place before the first and second referendums, in order to inform the people ; and I believe that every advocate of Federation in my own State - at any rate it was so with myself - regarded the Federal Judiciary as the guardian of the rights of South Australia, and contended that on it rested the protection as well of the State as of the liberty of individual citizens against encroachment or destruction by the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> who has the art of making matters clear and emphatic with his pen, used both pen and tongue in urging the necessity for a Federal Judiciary, and the immense part it would play in the development of our Constitution and in the protection of the rights of the States, the rights of the Commonwealth, and the rights of individual citizens. Moreover, I think that the South Australian representatives in the Convention issued to every elector a synopsis of the Bill, prepared, I believe, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> in popular language ; and both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline></para>

              <para>- Surely the honorable senator requires no further arguments than those he has himself supplied though later on I shall present one or two humbler arguments of my own. I have had. experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in the Judiciary Committee of the Convention, in the Convention itself, and in this Chamber, and I know that no man is more open to reason when he is appealed to on any great national question ; and, with all humility, I shall endeavour to offer him - and I hop&#38; successfully - one or two additional reasons why it is imperative this High Court should be established now. I care nothing about party in connexion with this question. I am here as a member of the Convention, and as one who recommended the people to enter into the Federal Union. I speak as one who urged his own State to join, for one reason, amongst others, that there would be a High Courtto afford protection against any attempted injustice. Why is the provision for a High Court embedded in the Constitution ? If aHigh Court were not essential, that provision would not be there, but the matter would have been left to Parliament. If a High Court is essential it ought to be immediately brought into operation, because we cannot postpone that which is essential in laying the foundations of government.&#39; An expression has been used, in a sneering sort of way, that in this particular our Constitution is simply a pedantic copy of the United States Constitution. I am sorry that expression has been used. The section was not inserted because of any idea of pedantry, but because the United States Constitution at that time was the highest type of Federal government. Our Constitution is, to my mind, an improved type of Federal government. It is democratic - that is to say, it is the people&#39;s govern ment and the people&#39;s Constitution to a degree to which the United States Constitution can lay no claim. The provisions for a High Court are in the Constitution because we were guided by the 100 years&#39; experience and aspirations of the American people, and 100 years of interpretation and working of their Constitution. I regard our Constitution as an improvement on that of the United States ; and our object was to meet the needs and aspirations of a people who were constituting themselves a nation 100 years after the United States had come into existence. We bettered the great example presented by a less perfect type, ifI may use the expression. I hope honorable senators will allow me toquotetwo sentences, not from an American writer, whomight be supposed to be prejudiced, but from a great constitutional writer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dicey.</inline> On page 126 of his work <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dicey</inline> says - </para>

          <para class="block">That was before we developed our Constitution. </para>

          <para class="block">I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will notice this - - the control of the Legislature by the courts - </para>
          <para class="block">That is the highest summit, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dicey,</inline> of this perfect system of federalism - - are there exhibited in their most salient and perfect form. </para>
          <para>That Constitution is inferior to ours, not in the sense of disparagement, but in the sense of being less advanced. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dicey</inline> goes on - </para>
          <para>The principle which shapes every part of the American polity is that distribution of limited executive, legislative, and judicial authority among bodies, each co-ordinate with, and independent of, the other, which is essential to the Federal form of government. </para>
          <para>What are the three essentials of the Federal form of government? The Executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary. Are we to have a truncated Federal system? If we want a system of government at all in accordance with the Constitution - if we are loyal to what we have created - I am at a loss to understand on what footing honorable senators can advocate the burial for even a day of one absolutely essential branch of the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dicey,</inline> on page 146 of his work, says - </para>
          <para>To have laid down the principle clearly is much - </para>
          <para class="block">The principle is that the people govern in the Federation ; that the dominant law of the Constitution overspreads and overrides the whole of our self-government. </para>
          <para>But the great problem was how to insure that the principle should be obeyed ; for there existed a danger that Judges depending on the Federal Government should wrest the Constitution in favour of the central power, and that Judges created by the States should wrest it in favour of State rights or interests. </para>
          <para>This problem has been solved by the creation of the Supreme Court and the Federal Judiciary. </para>

          <para class="block">Government and Parliament put in the provision that those constitutional questions should not be decided by the Privy Council, but by our own High Court, and it is only when the High Court can certify that a question is one which ought to be determined by the Privy Council, that an appeal is allowed. It is absolute disloyalty to the Constitution to suggest that the High Court should not be created.

              <para>- We need not trouble about these allusions because they are not parallel, as my honorable friend admits. Why should we shrink from carrying out the obligations of the Constitution, from building on the foundations which we have laid ? Why should we not carry out the trust which the people - by, this Constitution - have imposed upon us of organizing a tribunal that shall do final justice to our fellow citizens? That is the question I ask, and it is a practical one, I think. There is. nothing so practical as the administration of justice. There is nothing so practical and so essential in any self-governing community as the establishment of a national court. </para>

I have done it in my own State at the time when an agitation was carried on in regard to section 74 of the Constitution. Many people differed from me with regard to that, and I have the greatest respect for my opponents. We had a very active controversy ; but at the meetings which I addressed the audiences agreed with me at the finish, and every one of them was unanimous, not only in regard to the establishment of the judiciary, but also as to limiting the power of appeal to the Privy Council.

              <para>- Saved &#163;50,000 and delayed justice. I will answer that argument. The people agreed that the Constitution should be the supreme law of the land.

          <para>This Act,- and all laws mode by the Parliament . of the Commonwealth under the Constitution, shall be binding on the Courts, Judges, and people of <inline font-style="italic">every</inline> State, and of every part of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para class="block">The Queen, by proclamation, declared that there should be a new Government and a new community - that the people of these States should be united in a Federal Government, under thu name of the Commonwealth of Australia. Such being our Constitution, how can my honorable friends opposite reconcile it with what they want, or with saying that .the people of the Commonwealth and of the States are the same people <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Of course, the people of the Commonwealth are constituted of the people of the States, and the people of the States make up the people of the Commonwealth ; but the people of the Commonwealth constitute a new political community. It is because ours is a dual citizenship that the citizenship of a State and the citizenship of the Commonwealth are totally different things. Some honorable senators do not give enough weight to the fact that we ought to regard this question from the point of view of citizens of the Commonwealth, and not from that of citizens of the States. We are concerned with it as citizens of the Commonwealth, and not in any other capacity. This Constitution is the seal and impress of our nationality. That being so, how can anyone contend that, being a new political community - just as though we were a separate island - we should not have a separate court <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> . 1 agree with every word that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> said as to that. We shall be shorn of what ought to be our greatest glory and privilege as a nation if we do not have a national court. No one can reflect upon the fact that the highest purpose of all Government is to provide by its own courts and its own judicature for the administration of justice without realizing the necessity for the establishment of this court. If it is to be a national court, undoubtedly we have to consider its dignity and its efficiency. Honorable senators must not think for a moment that I would support any extravagance. Let them cut down as much as they like, but let them secure first that we shall have a strong and capable Bench. Let us first establish our judicature, and then consider how far we can go in the regions of economy, with a view of preventing any undue burdens - subserving always the great purpose of having an efficient national court. Let honorable senators, if they like, take away from the court all unnecessary paraphernalia. I am no lever of paraphernalia. I have visited the Supreme Court of the United States, and have seen the Judges administering justice without full-bottomed wigs, and wearing simple gowns. I have seen the advocates appearing before them without either wigs or gowns, or any other furniture of that sort. I venture to think that no one could enter the atmosphere of that court without coming away with a sense of its dignity, and filled with the utmost respect for it. We do not want lordly trappings, but we do want a capable Bench. It has been said that the whole purpose of British civilization is to put twelve men in a jury-box. It ought equally to be our object to organize an efficient High Court for Australia-. I think I may say that nothing gave me greater pleasure than to hear the assent of my honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who, for the moment, is not in his place, to the proposition which 1 ventured to put to him, that, quite apart from the Constitution, no one looking at the position which the Commonwealth of Australia occupies can possibly say that it is to our credit not to have a national court. The position in that respect is strengthened by every circumstance upon which we can bring our minds to bear in connexion with the purpose and the conditions attending the establishment of our union. We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> himself, in a despatch laid before Parliament the other day in connexion with the <inline font-style="italic">V&#246;ndel</inline> case, described the Australian Commonwealth as &#34; a new political community.&#34; I am certain that some of our honorable friends who differ from the views which I venture to submit have lost sight of that all important fact. We are a new Government. We are in that sense a nation as completely as if we were upon another continent, and the expression used by the Secretary of State for the Colonies is one which very fairly describes the position. There can then he no question that the first act on the part of a new political community is to organize the administration of its justice by its own courts - not to borrow courts from the States, which are component parts of the entity, and not to borrow Judges from those States. We may appoint those Judges to constitute our national court, if we please. I hope honorable senators understand that in no respect does any remark I have made affect the selection of the Judges. Whenever the selection comes to be made, it must be made from the men who are most able, most learned, possessing most strength and firmness, and most in touch with the great Constitution which they will have to administer. It is from such men that the court should be chosen. </para>

              <para>- I again ask my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> not to interrupt. It does not seem courteous on my part if I do not reply to his interjections, but to do so only prolongs what one has to say. W e surely should lay ourselves out for having a national court. Senator Stewart referred to the possibility of the court being small, and not being properly housed. A court is a court, even if it meets under a gum tree. The Majesty of Justice requires no trappings. But I think that under this Bill <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> need entertain no apprehensions on that score. Whatever view we take as to the equipment of the court, we certainly ought not to abdicate the function which pertains to every Government, and to the Federal Government as the Government of a new political community of establishing a court to administer justice to our own people. Here all the reasons are emphasized by- the fact that whilst we are called . upon, quite apart from .the Constitution, to constitute a national court it is, under the Constitution itself, essential and imperative. It is essential and imperative, because this is a Federal Constitution. It is a Constitution under which we have a government of laws, not a government of men, and the scope and authority of each branch of the system of government is distinct. Who is to determine when the boundaries are overstepped <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is it to be determined by the arbitrament of the sword, or by a properly constituted- tribunal ? On every question of dispute, on every occasion of difference between the Commonwealth and the State, or between the two Houses of the Federal Parliament as to the scope of the Constitution, we cannot have a referendum. We cannot ask the people what they wish, and whether they will amend the Constitution. For that reason this Federal Judiciary is established in our Constitution. It is essential as a national court, it is essential under the terms of the Constitution, and no man can deny, and no man has denied, that the power to construe the Constitution, to interpret its laws, to preserve what has been described as the just equipoise of the State and the Commonwealth, to preserve individual liberty at the high level of the Constitution, rests in one body only - the High Court of Australia - in the judicial power exercised by the High Court of Australia, by virtue of its appellate jurisdiction. I do not attach the slightest importance to a great deal of the original jurisdiction of which the proposed High Court under this Bill has been shorn. The original jurisdiction which still remains to it is that which is essential to my mind, but the power and the controlling influence of the High Court of Australia, as the embodiment and exponent of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, rests in its appellate jurisdiction. Having been given under the Constitution a Judiciary for this purpose, it is there the balance is held between the States and the Commonwealth, between the citizens and those chosen to conduct public &#39; affairs. What court has been appointed for that purpose? Not the Privy Council. If the Convention had chosen, if the people of Australia had chosen, they might have declared by their Constitution that the Privy Council should be the High Court of Australia. </para>

            <para>The written Constitution- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Honorable senators will bear in mind that ours is a written, rigid Constitution, subject to a particular machinery of amendment - instead of being torn asunder, or left by the way as the nation expanded and new and wholly unexpected conditions arose, has grown with the growth of the nation, so that it still embraces and covers the whole of our vast national life. </para>
          <para class="block">That is what we desire for our High Court. We do notdesire that it should be constituted of rigid lawyers uninspired by the spirit of the Constitution, but of men who will develop it as the Constitution was developed in America - who will have regard to the fact that there are expressed powers and implied powers, and to the fact that we are a growing and expanding country, men who will, by the legitimate exercise of the powers of judicial exposition, make this instrument, without amendment, beneficently cover all the advances the Commonwealth may make. To what in America do we owe that marvellous condition of things ? We owe it, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Choate,</inline> to the wisdom of the framers who put into the Constitution only the fundamental rules and principles, and to the vigorous and masterly manner in which the Supreme Court has exercised its essential and lawful function of construing the Constitution. I think we may very well be led to accept these views as to what the Judiciary will be under our Constitution, by observing the beneficent influence of a similar tribunal in the United States. I believe that our High Court, constituted as it oughtto be, will shine with no less brilliancy, and exercise no less a powerful and beneficent influence on the nation of Australia than has the Supreme Court of the United States exercised upon the destinies of that great country. I have taken the liberty of referring honorable senators to the views of statesmen in the United States as to the principles and operations of the Judiciary there, which has had as much to do with the working of the American Constitution as have the framers of the Constitution themselves. We know that amendments in the American Constitution have been few. Why? We know that the people of America have been rarely agitated in regard to amendments. Why ? How is it that the balance has been so well preserved in that Constitution, which was inaugurated under conditions nothing like so favorable as those which prevailed in the case of Australia? </para>

              <para>- No doubt the difficulties of amendment are greater in the United States than here. But no amendments are necessary where the expansive force of the Constitution, within legitimate limits, is exerted through the calm atmosphere of a judicial tribunal instead of through the tempestuous agitations which must go on throughout the Commonwealth if we adopt the principle of altering the Constitution whenever a change is requiredor any doubt is expressed as to the particular scope of the instrument of government. </para>

              <para>- It is not admitted, and there is not a shred of foundation for the statement. It has been recognised by every constitutional writer that the J udges of any High Court, in dealing with  a Constitutionand instrument of government - which no one pretends is complete in itself, but which merely lays down broad general principles - must be animated by, in one sense, a far higher and broader apprehension than the mere lawyer who is dealing with an ordinary Act of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> may think that my views are tinged with the same sentiments that prevailed when the Judiciary Committee of the Convention sat ; and, therefore, I ask him to listen to one or two quotations in order to show that the Federal Judiciary is commended not merely by those who have been actively concerned in Federation, but by those who view it from the outside stand-point of constitutionalism in relation to &#39;Federation. I have here an interesting volume by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bryce</inline> entitled <inline font-style="italic">Studies in History and Jurisprudence,</inline> which was written after what I call the unwise and unwarrantable interference of the Imperial authorities with the appellate scheme in connexion with the J udiciary as established by the people of Australia. This book, therefore, was written in full view of some of the restrictions to which we have had to assent, while retaining the power to settle finally all constitutional questions. I shall ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> whether the quotation which I am about to make does not satisfy him as a practical statesman that theJudiciary ought to be set in motion, or, at any rate, that he ought not to vote against the second reading of this, by which we shall simply affirm the principle of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bryce,</inline> at page 512, says - </para>

We are not speaking of the Privy Council, but of the contemplated High Court of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> was a member of the Judiciary Committee of the Convention, and in Adelaide was one of the strongest advocates for the Judiciary and for the total cessation of all power of appeal to the Privy Council. He described the proposed High Court as destined to be the &#34; arbiter between the States and the Commonwealth,&#34; although now he says it is absurd to speak of such a court safeguarding the Constitution. But I prefer <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> in his better and more regenerate days, when his view was exactly that which all of us took, and which is held by every constitutional writer who has dealt with the subject. We never dreamt of making the Privy Council the High Court of Australia. </para>

              <para>- They may say that they will wait a little longer. We know how disastrous an argument of that sort is. I read that quotation merely to show the development of Professor Harrison Moore. Then, in 1902, came his book, <inline font-style="italic">2&#39;lie. Commonwealth of Australia,</inline> in which he emphasized in scarcely less plain, clear, and capable language, the same doctrines, with a little more elaboration of phrase. And this year, when the matter is discussed in the newspapers - in Victoria, as much as in any other Seate and a question of economy has arisen, writing as a thoughtful man may do - a philosopher rather than a practical statesman - he contributes to the <inline font-style="italic">Annals qf tlie American Academy qf Political and Social Science</inline> an article in which he suggests the possibility of the creation of the High Court being delayed for the present. </para>

              <para>- I know ; but really my honorable and learned friend is doing an injustice to the professor in reminding us that, affected by his environment, and giving expression to the idea which he thinks is prevalent - that the creation of the High Court will be delayed - he does an injustice to himself. He falls away from those considered opinions which are absolutely unassailable, expressed and held for two years, and he backslides to the extent of falling in so far with what he thinks - mistakenly, I believe - is the prevalent opinion in Victoria.. </para>

              <para>- Of course he is influenced. He has not changed his opinion on the constitutional question. He does not approve of this postponement ; he simply gives expression to what he believes is the prevailing sentiment, as to which I think he is mistaken. These authorities show that in our Constition, more so even than in that of the United States, the judicial power is the keystone of the Federal arch. It is the pivot on which the whole thing turns. It was put in the Constitution for that purpose. It was put in because, as it has been expressed, it was the citadel at once of public justice, public security, and individual freedom ; it was the balance-wheel of the Constitution. We had no right, as a Parliament, to delay as long as we have, or to take the legislative steps which we have taken in other directions until this balancewheel was assured, so that in case of emergency or difficulty everything might proceed harmoniously. Why should we not do what the Constitution prescribes <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It has surrounded the High Court with every safeguard for its integrity, with every condition necessary to secure its independence, with every condition- required to keep it free from the domination of Parliament. Why should we not launch it ? Why should not thepeople be entitled to say - &#34; Whatever we may think of lawyers&#39; views, we put in the Judiciary as part of the three-fold machine, and you have postponed carrying our behest into effect.&#34; My .honorable friends ask, why should the High Court be created at once 1 I answer that the Constitution contemplated that it should be established at once. </para>

It is for those who wish to delay the erection of the High Court to say for how long it is to be postponed, and to point to any words in the Constitution authorizing postponement. In its form the Constitution is an Imperial Act, but for its permanence and efficiency it has a far higher sanction than that of the Imperial Parliament. It is the enactment of the people of Australia. It is binding on the King, the Imperial Parliament, the States and the people of this country ; and no Imperial Parliament, and .no King dare alter one line of the Constitution without the consent of the people of Australia.

              <para>- No. That shows the exact difference. The Constitution vests the judicial power in a Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court, but in no other court. Parliament had no power to create a Federal High Court. It was created by the Constitution. Other courts Parliament may bring into existence. </para>

              <para>- But my honorable and learned friend has admitted that the High Court must be organized Parliament is not doing its duty in refraining from clothing the High Court with powers which will enable it to exercise its functions. It is urged that we should delay. The United States entered upon its career on the 30th April, 1789. Its Judges were appointed before the Judiciary Act was passed by Congress. In the Convention from which our Constitution emanated the same course was advised. The question was debated for a considerable time. The number of Judges was cut down in the Mebourne session from five to three, and it was thought unadvisable thatthe Executive should appoint Judges until Parliament decided whether the number should be restored to five, or left at three. What does that indicate ? It indicates that here, as in the United States, it was contemplated that the High Court should be brought into existence at once. In the United States a J udiciary Bill was carried, and became law within six months of the establishment of union. It was amongst the first Acts passed by Congress. </para>

              <para>- That shows the impotency of the tribunal across the seas. It has been said that this provision of the Constitution is not what is called mandatory. A singular reason for that was given by an honorable and learned member of the Judiciary Committee. He said that it was not mandatory, because you could not get a mandamus to compel Parliament to carry this section of the Constitution into effect. That would have been a very good argument to address to a bench of magistrates or a licensing court, but as addressed to the High Court of Parliament it seems to me to have been a kind of affront. That the provision is mandatory is shown by a quotation which I will read from Chancellor Kent&#39;s book, in which he says - </para>

            <para>The Constitution (a) declares that &#34;the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish . &#34; In this respect it is mandatory upon the Legislature to establish courts of justice commensurate with the judicial power of the Union. </para>

          <para>Surely that is of more value than the statement of an opposing lawyer who says that the section is not mandatory, because it could not be enforced by a mandamus. Story in his book on the Constitution says that Congress had no discretion as to the appointment of the Federal Courts. The duty of Congress is as ours is - because the language of our Constitution is advisedly the same as the language of the American Constitution - quite imperative. &#34;Was that contemplated by the Convention ? Undoubtedly it was. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;Wise,</inline> the present Attorney-General of New South Wales, was. a member of the Judiciary Committee of the Convention. What did he say ? I will read his words. At the Adelaide Convention he said - </para>
          <para>The first act of Parliament must be to pass a Judicial^&#39; Act. </para>
          <para>The whole Convention&#34; understood it so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> merely gave expression to the deliberate policy and intention of the Convention with regard to the Judiciary. Then we have this fact - that not merely can there be. no appeal upon any constitutional question until the High Court is established, but there can be no settlement of any constitutional question. If the Inter-State Commission is established there can be no appeal unless the High Court is established. </para>

              <para>- The Canadian people are satisfied with their system, but it is on different lines from ours. For all I know, it may be better than ours, but it is not a true Federal system. Here we have a sovereign Commonwealth and sovereign States. In Canada the Judgesof the provinces are appointed and paid by the Dominion Government. There there is a system of national courts from end to end. There are really no State Courts. They are all Dominion Courts in Canada, therefore, there is no need for such a Federal Judiciary as we have under our Constitution. What is imperative for us, is unnecessary in Canada. In Canada there is one State system of Judicature. Here the Statesappoint, pay, and Control their own Judicature. In Canada the whole of the jurisdiction of the provincial courts is controlled and paid for by the Dominion Government. Here it is suggested that our High Court should consist of borrowed Judges appointed and paid by the States. In Canada the Dominion Government has power <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> veto every State Act of Parliament. We would have none of that. But not only so, it is the Dominion Government that appoints the Lieutenant-Governors of theProvinces, and the Lieutenant-Governors also have a veto. We have nothing of thekind. The only thing we have under our Constitution to represent all the control which is given in all these various ways is our Federal High Court. Then it is said that we have these appeals to the Privy Council. Well, we have no appeals to thePrivy Council, in my opinion, unless they pass through the High Court. The view which was taken with regard to appeals directsome time ago appears to me one which will be found erroneous in practice, though I may be mistaken in that. When we have a Federal High Court, I hope all appeals from States Courts will pass through the Federal High Court before they go to the Privy Council, if they go there at all. But in addition to that, we are going to give Federal jurisdiction to the States Courts. That was introduced by the Judiciary Committee with a view to saving the expense of all the network of Federal Courts which exist in the United States. Do honorable senators mean to tell me that these appeals will go to the Privy Council direct? Not a bit of it. It would be making a perfect farce of the Constitution to do that. </para>

              <para>- I had not noticed that, but I noticed that there was a discussion in another place as to whether we could make a provision of that kind. Undoubtedly we can, because a State Court stands in a double position under this Judiciary Bill. It has its concurrent jurisdiction, which it has had heretofore, subject to the control of the High Court. Then it becomes a Federal Court the moment it is clothed with Federal jurisdiction. It will be in that sense an inferior court of the Federal system as regards its Federal jurisdiction, and we have most ample power to bring such court under our own tribunal, the Commonwealth High Court, constituted as the people willed it should be, to determine appeals from courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. </para>

              <para>- I am not dealing with clause 40 or clause 50 - I am dealing with the principle. I say we have no power under our Constitution, except of minimizing, subject to the assent of His Majesty, the cases in which appeal? may be sought. But I also wish it to be understood that I disagree with those who think that in the case of the States Supreme Courts not exercising Federal jurisdiction, but clothed with their ordinary jurisdiction, and exercising the concurrent jurisdiction which they exercise now, there may be an appeal to the Privy Council, and also an appeal to the High Court. That argument has been used in ordertosuggestthat wemayhave a plaintiff appealing to the Privy Council and a defendant appealing to the High Court. Such a confusion, in my opinion, is never likely to arise, because, in the first place, the practice of the Privy Council always has been to abstain from encouraging appeals to itself until every other appeal in the colony from which the appeal comes is exhausted. I believe that that practice will prevail. </para>

              <para>- It may not prevail, but all that is beside the question. All I desire to say is that when objection is taken to the right of appeal from States Courts to the Privy Council being withdrawn, my view of the effect of sections 73 and 74of the Constitution is that they will be found to work so that the High Court will entertain these appeals as well as appeals from its own inferior courts - that is, from the States Courts - when exercising Federal jurisdiction. Just one word from the point of view of economy. I do not disparage economy. It is just and reasonable in itself ; but I take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> view that there is no Department in the public service in connexion with this Constitution to which it may be applied with less wisdom than the establishment of our Federal Judicature. The danger, very often, in yielding to a cry for economy is that men, as we all do sometimes, lose their heads, and allow themselves to be carried away to economize in the wrong direction, or in reference to the wrong object. Something, it is felt, must be thrown to the wolves, and we must throw the nearest thing which is at hand. We do not, perhaps, give the matter that care and attention which we ought. I remember an an old school story about a man who adopted economy in (he feeding of his horses.&#39; He succeeded very well, until he reduced them to living on one straw a day, and then they died. Very often the spirit of economy becomes a disease, and I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> as a practical man, to consider whether these doctrines of economy may not be driven to death. I ask the honorable and learned senator to be guided by the views which I have read from his own speech at the Convention, and to adopt the course he there laid down, rather than the one which seems to influence him now: I am sure that, if he does so, it will give him more satisfaction afterwards. </para>

              <para>- First settle the court, and then be economical. We are dealing now with the second reading of this measure, and I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to show his devotion to the principle, that is all. He may then be as economical as he pleases, so long as we have a tribunal worthy of the nation, and efficient for the upright and independent administration of justice. As to its work, that has been sufficiently dealt with, but I find that while we have the little dispute to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> alluded in connexion with territory, we have also a dispute arising now in connexion with the Murray River. A great meeting took place on the 20th of this month, that is only a few days ago,, presided over by the  President  of the River Murray League, and amongst other resolutions passed by that meeting there was this - </para>

              <para>- They have not got it anywhere, and crazy or not, they are determined to give effect to their views by instituting legal proceedings. There is only one court which can deal with that question in this country, which is a dispute between three States <inline font-style="italic">inter sc.</inline> It may depend on the Constitution, or upon many questions, but it is a dispute between States, and I say that if we abstain from organizing the High Court we shall be depriving the State of South Australia and the other States of an opportunity of having that question settled. The people have declared that these constitutional questions are to be settled here, and it is our duty to carry out that behest and provide the necessary machinery. It has been said that there will be no work for the High Court, but I shall, without comment, enumerate a few of the cases which have arisen. A little time ago there was an application for a mandamus in New South Wales, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Owen said that an application of the kind could only be granted by the Federal High Court. </para>

Tasmania is either being kept out of her money, or has it by the grace and favour of the Commonwealth, simply because the constitutional question which depends absolutely on the construction of two sections of the Constitution cannot be settled in the absence of a High Court.

              <para>- I would rather that the very existence of a court might tend to make the Parliaments and the Executives of the States a little more careful about encroachments, in order to avoid the necessity of going before any tribunal. As to the number of Judges, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that there ought to be five. There is a numerical strength as well as an intellectual strength. We might get one Judge strong and powerful enough to discharge the business of the court; but the court will be exposed to criticism, and at the present moment there is jealousy in regard to it. Judges are human, and therefore I say that we ought to have a numerical strength as well as an intellectual strength. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> referred to the number of Judges in America and to an intention there is of increasing them. I should like to tell honorable senators that when the United States were launched . on their national career of union in 1789 with a population less than ours, and with, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> and others admit, less possibilities of work than are presented to our High Court, five Judges and a Chief Justice were appointed. And not only so, but a large number of other courts were constituted at the same time for the purpose of doing work under the Federal Constitution. I shall be no party to any method of having Judges on loan. I have heard of Justices in eyre, but never of Justices on hire. The London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> in speaking the other day of the absurd anomaly of having an Australian Judge on the Privy Council, who was never there to discharge his duties, said that no man can serve two masters ; and to appoint three of the States Chief Justices to temporarily perform the functions of the High Court would be ludicrous. Why should we have to go to the States <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We are the superior governing body, and we ought not to have to prostrate ourselves at the feet of the States, in order to have Commonwealth justice administered. We must also remember that the States Chief. Justices are Lieutenant-Governors. I entertain the very strongest view that it is an anomaly and blemish on the judicial office to accept an executive office, such as that of a Lieutenant-Governor. If we appoint the Chief Justices of the States to the Federal High Court, we shall appoint men who are holders of a high executive office in a State, and if there is a possibility in surroundings of influence or bias - I do not use the words in their ordinary sense- </para>

              <para>- If there is any possibility of unconscious inclinations, we shall intensify the tendency tenfold by placing an executive officer of a State on the highest judicial tribunal of the Commonwealth. I hope that we shall not, under this Bill or any other, allow a Judge of the High Court Bench to occupy an executive office of that description, and if there is no provision in the Bill to exclude the Judges from such a position, I shall seek in Committee to move an amendment in that direction, because it interferes with the performance of judicial duty. It is an anomalous position. It is introducing the Executive into the J Judicary. It is putting a man who ought to be outside the pale of social functions, public demonstrations,&#39; and all that sort of thing, in the midst of them. It is placing a man in a position in which he is bound to exercise hospitality, to discriminate between friends and foes, to take sides in social cliques and jealousies, to show favour to one and disfavour to another. I have always understood that the dignity and integrity of a Judge, and his influence in the community, do not rest on his kitchen or his hospitality, but on the dignity of his high office and the single-minded and assiduous discharge of his political duties without fear or favour to any of mankind. That is an additional reason, and I think it is a final reason to honorable senators. There is another reason so far as regards the Judges themselves. They are estimable and capable men. I do not know any Benches which are better manned than the State Benches of Australia within the limits of their jurisdiction. If you find the right men, choose your Federal Judges if you please from amongst them or from amongst the Bar or from the Parliament, but it is no reason for attempting to make the States Chief Justices do double duty. It is no reason for placing them in the anomalous and uncomfortable position of being the paid servant of one State appointed to dispense justice in the High Court of another self-governing community. But besides that I do not want these gentlemen, however estimable and capable, who have grown up during the best years of their lives in the service of the States, to have imposed upon them new duties, to be transported into  new and unaccustomed fields of intellectual activity - it may be into a field towards which some of them may not have had very friendly leanings, being imbued with the sympathies and limitations of the State Bench as contrasted with the higher and wider tribunal under the Federal Constitution. Is it fair to ask any men, &#39;who it may be, have been strenuous, and no doubt conscientious, in their resistance to the scope and the jurisdiction of the national tribunal, to assume the position, and exercise and enlarge judicial powers which they may have declared that tribunal should never possess ? Not only so, but in sympathy with the growth of the Commonwealth you are to ask them to enlarge a jurisdiction which they may have already declared to be too large - to make co-equal with the Privy Council, if not supreme, that jurisdiction and judicial power which they may have declared should be in all respects and in all cases less and subordinate. How could we put men - our&#39; worst enemies - in such a position as that ? It has been interjected that the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States are influenced by the prevailing condition of things. What I desire to see on any Bench which may be created from the Commonwealth is an expansiveness and a liberalness of mind rising above and beyond the ordinary rut - I speak with the utmost respect - of the interpretation of. local statutes. But I agree in this respect with what Professor Harrison Moore said - </para>

          <para class="block">State and Commonwealth, the expansion of the people, the growth of our national sentiment and development, in saying what may or may not come within the ambit of the Constitution, according to &#39; its just interpretation. Proud as we are to be citizens of this Commonwealth, to us individually it may be a matter of little moment whether this Bill passes or not: but to the Commonwealth itself it is of supreme concern. Upon it depends the freedom, the  expansion and - that which I put as high as any other element - the harmony of our national life - the success or failure of our Union. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I would rather see no court at all, a condition of constitutional anarchy which would compel men to do what the Constitution bids them do, than a court which would inspire us with contempt. We want a court, but. one worthy of the Commonwealth. We want a tribunal stately in intellect, stately in numbers, stately in its march towards the solution of the great questions with which it will have to deal. It need have no guards, palaces, or treasures. It need possess ho claim to dignity except that which arises from the truth and wis- , dom of its judgments. It need have nosplendour but the publicity of its judgments and their essential justice. Such a court as that will, to my mind, be in the noblest sense the Minister of a free people to do justice, uphold their freedom, and preserve the ark of the Constitution inviolate. It will be sustained by the confidence and respect of the nation. It will be inspired by a sense of responsibility, by the magnitude of its duties, and it will be so armed in integrity, so secure in its independence that it shall be said with truth of each member&#39; of the Bench - &#34; There is no human being, no Ministry, whose smile or frown, whose favour or disfavour, shall make his pulse beat one atom faster, or move by one hair&#39;s breadth the even equipoise of the scales of justice.&#34; My faith is that this will be such a court that when these early years pass away and we pass away with them, there will be nopart in the process of launching this Constitution of which our children will be more proud than that of bringing this great court into operation - a sanctuary to which States and people, poor and rich, may repair for that justice which it is the highest attribute of any civilized country to render to its citizens. </para>
