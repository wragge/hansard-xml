                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR</inline>
                (South Australia). - On this question I may differ to a very great extent from honorable senators. I think that the King and his representatives, wherever they may reside, ought to have the right of free speech. I .have always been in favour of the right of free speech, and I believe that it ought to be possessed by the King&#39;s representatives, subject to the same criticisms as everybody else. Whenever the head of the Empire, or any representative of His Majesty, makes any remarks which are not in accordance with the will of the people, then the people will know how to deal with them. I think it would be far better for the country for the representatives of the King to have this privilege, than to go about and express their opinions, as it -were, in an underhand manner, and thus undermine public opinion. It was not the custom for the Governor of a State, when it was a colony, to express his opinions on public questions. It was not the habit of the late Queen, nor is it the habit of the present King, to publicly express opinions on political questions. Seeing that to some extent the old custom has been violated, I am prepared to assist
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                to carry his motion. J know that there are a number of honorable senators who will each say - &#34; Well, I heard or I read the remarks that were made by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline>
                Clarke, but I could see nothing of a political character in them.&#34; Whether the intention of His Excellency was to exercise political influence or not, it is quite evident that some influence was exercised, because some persons, writing and speaking afterwards, took his remarks as coming from a gentleman, with both experience and authority. To my mind the error arose from the fact that His Excellency had been for some time connected with the Admiralty, and was imbued with those Imperial ideas which naturally must come to any person holding such an office as he occupied for&#34; some time. The mistake must have arisen from want of experience. He is holding the position of Governor for the first time, and on that ground I think he might be excused to some extent. It was the duty of the Victorian Ministers to inform His Excellency of the duties, of his position when he arrived. If they had mentioned the habits of his predecessors, I believe that His Excellency would have had common sense enough to have modelled his conduct by their example. I am very sorry that any gentleman should be sent from Great Britain to a State, or even the Commonwealth of Australia, to occupy a position of no more importance, so far as legislation and administration are concerned, than an umpire at a football match or a judge at a horse race. I do not think that gentlemen with intelligence should be asked to occupy these positions. But since it has been the custom to expect gentlemen to occupy the positions, and not to give expression to political opinions, then I think that a certain amount of blame must be attached to . the action of
                <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline>
                Clarke. I hope that the motion will be a warning to other gentlemen coming to Australia, until such time as the political fetters are struck off their limbs, to be very careful in giving expression to their political opinions. I have no more to say on the motion, which I hope will be carried.

                    <para>- The motion strikes me as being beyond the scope of the duties of the Federal Parliament. It amounts to nothing more nor less than an interference with the actions of a State official. That <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Clarke is Governor of Victoria does not remove His Excellency from the category of State officials, and if it is a proper function for the Senate to take exception to and discuss the actions of the highest official in a State, there is nothing to prevent it from interfering with the discharge of duty by its minor functionaries. Apparently it is to become our function to criticise the manner in which every State official discharges his duty. In these circumstances, I do not see anything to prevent the Senate, from seriously discussing the laches of a District Court bailiff. I am not drawing any comparison between the high official whose conduct we are discussing: and the exceedingly minor one who, I suggest, might be the subject of criticism here. Where is the line to be drawn? I take it that this is not a question of the good government of the Commonwealth. The Governor of a State gives a lecture which we have his official word for knowing he promised to deliver many months before the question of the naval subsidy was known to be one of the subjects which would come before the Federal Parliament during the present session. We have His Excellency&#39;s positive statement that he promised to give this particular lecture on this subject so long ago as last November, before it could have been known definitely that this question of the naval subsidy was coming before Parliament. Further, I believe that in .no portion of the lecture did His Excellency make political allusions. Surely it is not an outrage to speak of the greatness of England&#39;s great arm of defence, as a matter which is one of pride to every honest citizen* of the Empire, though we know that it is. not a matter of pride to some persons who live under the beneficent shelter of&#39; the flag that that great British) Navy carries into every sea of the <inline font-style="italic">world</inline> I cannot see where the offence comes in. If the lecture had been given definitely for the purpose &#187;f advocating the naval agreement, gentlemen who take exception to that agreement might naturally take exception to the lecture. But, as I said a moment, ago, I do not think that it is the function of the Commonwealth Legislature to criticise the discharge of duty by State officials.. Again I ask, where is such interference to cease ? If it begins with the&#39; highest it must extend. I suppose we shall next be criticising the deliverances of States Premiers. What is there to prevent a similar motion being tabled in connexion with some speech which may be made by a State Premier? If by a State Governor, why not a State Premier ? We should find ourselves in a very short time embroiled&#39; in political conflicts with every one of the States of the Commonwealth whose interests, we are sent here to conserve and promote.. From that stand-point it will be seen that I cannot possibly vote for this motion. I do not think we need consider the question of&#34; the naval subsidy at this juncture. I do- not think that we need consider anything more than that we are proposing by this motion to go absolutely outside the charter of the Constitution, and to deal with matters that are not within our ken. Does the matter dealt with in this motion come within the purview of any section of the Constitution? Can it be said even to come within the frequently quoted drag-net phrase of the Constitution^-&#34; The peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth &#34; ? It seems to me that it does not even come within that, and it cannot come within any one of the specified subjects with which we are empowered to deal. Holding the views I have expressed, I cannot see my way to support the motion. It seems to me that it is a motion which proposes to travel beyond the functions of the Senate and of the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry I cannot agree with the honorable senator who has just sat down. .With regard to the comparisons he has made between the Governor of a State and the bailiff of a District Court and the Governor of a State arid a State Premier, I shall have something to say later on. It appears to me that the question we have to consider is whether the State Governor of Victoria is privileged to say in Australia something which His Majesty the King himself would not be allowed to say if he came here. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Clarke is the representative of  His  Majesty the King in Victoria. I know that several honorable senators hold that, on that account, he is entitled to take part in any discussion of public affairs outside the State of Victoria. My own opinion is that that position is not tenable. Would the King himself be justified, if he came here, in discussing public questions? If  His  Majesty would not be justified in doing so, and if by the Constitution he would not be permitted to do so, then I submit that his representative could not go further than he himself would  be allowed to go. </para>

The Governor-General for instance could not &#34;address the people of the Commonwealth in his private capacity as Lord Tennyson. He necessarily addresses them in his public capacity as the Governor-General of the Australian Commonwealth.

                            Majesty could not do anything of the kind. Any public appearance which the King of England would make in that way would be as King and not in any other capacity. I may agree with some of the remarks which have fallen from

                            but we are not called upon to discuss what ought to be the law and custom, but what is the custom. The people of England, after a great deal of trouble with their Kings, and after they had cut off the heads of some of them, and did other nice tilings to others - for there were centuries of struggle before finality was arrived at - after all this agitation, trouble, and bother, they came to the conclusion that the only safe policy for the community was to segregate the King altogether from public affairs ; to make him merely the mouthpiece of his Ministers. The axiom is that &#34;The King can-do no wrong,&#34; and the King can do nothing right either-; he is merely a figurehead. Whatever he does is done at the instance of his Ministers, who are responsible&#39; to Parliament. I repeat that the Governor of a State is in exactly the same position as the King of Great Britain in this respect.

                            drew some comparisons for us, and said that if we had a right to interfere with the actions of a State Governor, or to criticise his actions, we should very soon be criticising the conduct of the bailiff of a District Court. That comparison is so much out of the way--

                        <para>- It is so much like Senator Neild that I will not discuss it. But the other comparison which the honorable senator drew was that between a State Governor and a State Premier,- and that isa comparison to which I may refer. A State Premier, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> ought to know, is in quite a different position from a State Governor. A. State Premier, in the first place, is a citizen of the Commonwealth, and every citizen of the Commonwealth has a right, nay, more, it is his duty, if he thinks well to do so, to criticise the conduct of the Federal Government and Parliament, and of Federal administration generally. No complaint can be made against a State Premier for doing that, and this Senate would have no more control over any action he might take than it would have over the action of any other citizen of the Commonwealth. But a State Governor is a person who is supposed to hold himself completely aloof from public affairs in the State he governs as the representative of the King. </para>

                        <para>- It is accepted on all hands that a State Governor cannot take part in any discussion concerning public affairs. But we are met with this statement : that although he cannot take part in discussions upon State affairs, he is quite within his rights in taking part in discussions upon Commonwealth affairs. I say that the representative of the King is in exactly the same position as the King himself would be if he were here, and as His Majesty could nob take part in those discussions, neither, I submit, can his representative. The State Governors are not citizens of the Commonwealth ; they are not electors. </para>

                        <para>- They put certain words into the mouth of the State Governor, as we saw they did recently in New South Wales. The statements made in that instance were not taken as the expression of the Governor&#39;s opinion, but as the opinion of the New South Wales Ministry, and the Governor was in no way held responsible for it. In support of the amendment I feel bound to say that the question whether Australia should contribute a subsidy to the Imperial fleet, or should lay the foundation of a fleet of her own, is one which is very seriously debated, and which was being earnestly debated in the Commonwealth when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Clarke delivered his address. I have no desire to insinuate that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Clarke deliberately took advantage of the occasion to press the views of the Imperial Government upon the people of the Commonwealth, but it looks very suspiciously like it. The question, as we all know, was then, and is now, agitating the public mind. A very considerable section of the community is in favour of the establishment, of an Australian fleet. These people take up the ground that we can best show our loyalty to the Empire, and our desire to maintain its integrity-- </para>

                        <para>- That is my opinion. On the other hand, a very large number of our citizens, of whom I believe Senator Fraser is one, believe that our best policy is to merge our sea defence in the sea defence of the Empire; and that we can best aid Britain, and best serve ourselves, by paying an annual contribution towards the up-keep of the British Navy. I do not propose to deal now with the arguments on either side, because that would not be permissible in a debate of this character ; but here we have an actively debatable political question upon which Australian opinion is clearly divided. But the Governor of a State intervenes and delivers himself of a strictly partisan speech at the very moment when this question is being debated in the Commonwealth Parliament. That is a position which he, as the representative of the King, under the British Constitution, was not entitled to take up. </para>

                        <para>- Eminent citizens would, I think, be much more acceptable in a country like Australia, which has neither a military nor a naval system of any extent, and the pursuits of the people of which are eminently peaceful. We in Australia are probably in many respects much further removed from any likely outbreak of war than are the people of any other country in the world. That being the case, a great number of people think it would be very much better for the Commonwealth if citizens who have distinguished themselves in other avenues than those of the army and navy should be sent out here as Governors. The appointment of these military and naval men is looked on with a certain amount of suspicion by many citizens of the Commonwealth. I am not going to say whether or not I think that suspicion is justified ; but my own belief is that if the people of the Commonwealth keep their heads, they need not care very much who is sent out as Governor. The policy of the Australian people ought to be clearly defined in their own minds, and they ought not to be diverted from it even if the high priest of Imperialism,&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> himself, came here. I do not imagine for a moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> takes any pleasure in bringing up this question ; at any rate I take no pleasure in discussing it. It is extremely undesirable that the representative of His Majesty should be, either personally or officially, dragged into discussions in or out of Parliament; but when a Governor deliberately thrusts himself into the public arena, we are bound to take cognisance of his action. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> that it is desirable that the representatives of  His  Majesty should carefully hold themselves apart from the discussion of such public questions as are agitating the minds of the people of the Commonwealth. I trust that, whether this motion be passed or not, it will have the effect of making our Governors a little more careful than they seem to have been in the very recent past. </para>

                    <para>. - I take it that it would be a sound rule for us to follow that we should never express a censure upon any person by vote of this Senate, unless, in the first place, our censure is founded on fact, and, in the second, place, it has regard to a person who is in some way responsible to us. General resolutions, embodying the mere abstract expression of opinion in regard to persons over whom we have no control, are, it seems to me, not only valueless, but will tend rather to depreciate the censure or praise of the Senate than to any other result. I have read very carefully this lecture by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Clarke, and from beginning to end I can find nothing in it which touches in any way on any debatable questions of Australian politics. </para>

                        <para>- With all respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I do not see anything to that effect in the lecture, which in itself is a most admirable deliverance. It is a splendid epitome of the history of the British Navy, and all that it does is to draw the lesson which any student must draw from that history, namely, that although we have maritime instincts - although our people are fighters and sailors, and although we have means to build ships and equip them as fully as have any people in the world - at the same time we must always be ready. That is the inference which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Clarke draws, and, as I say, I cannot, from the beginning to the end of the lecture, see one word which contains any expression of opinion on existing matters of controversy. . There is no suggestion as to whether the existing agreement should be continued, or some new agreement entered into, and there is only one reference to Australian ships. That reference it will be just as well to read, and it is as follows : - </para>

                    <para>That is the policy enforced by the whole teaching of naval war, but more important for us now than in the past because of the enormous increase of our national trade. A decisive naval victory at once simplifies the protection of commerce ; and, if an enemy refuses great naval actions, his squadrons in port must be closely watched and followed if they move. With this main object in view, our preparations for war must be and are being made. We divide the sea into naval stations for administrative and. police purposes in time of peace, proportioning our strength in each to that of possible antagonists, and with a special eye to the bases from which hostile fleets could act. Foi this reason the bulk of our force is in home waters and in the Mediterranean, the other great aggregation of ships being in China waters for obvious reasons, and a comparatively small squadron being maintained in the South Pacific. I need hardly say that these arrangements cannot be maintained in war, and that if we confined our squadrons to their stations we should play the enemy&#39;s game. If Nelson, in 1805, had been chained to the Mediterranean the Trafalgar campaign might have had another ending, and the world&#39;s history might have been different reading. You may occasionally see the ships of our Australian Squadron - not often enough - in Hobson&#39;s Bay ; but you do not see the ships in distant parts of the world which, and not these in Australian waters, are your real defence. </para>

                        <para>- Surely we cannot censure&#39; a person, whether a Governor or anybody else, for simply waving a flag <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I would speak as strongly as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> against any interference of our Governor-General in politics. But when we have a lecture of this kind, which is an admirable contribution to our knowledge of the subject, from a high authority - a contribution which most carefully avoids any reference whatever to subjects of current discussion - it is altogether out of place to inflict censure under the circumstances. I do not think it necessary for me to say more in support of the . view I have expressed, that on the facts there is no justification whatever for the assertion that this lecture was an interference in any of our public affairs. But, in addition, I think that we ought to be careful in inflicting censure, or making comments upon public speeches of persons who are outside our jurisdiction. I quite agree with what has been said . in this respect by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> It appears to me that, even if the State Governor of &#34; Victoria had descended into the arena of politics - even if he had so far . forgotten what is due to his position as to express himself strongly on a matter of current discussion, in Australian public affairs - what have we to do with that ? How can our censure affect the State Governor <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If our censure, conveyed through the Governor-General, did reach the Governor of Victoria, it would be quite open to the latter gentleman - and no one could blame bini - to politely tell the Senate that it concerned his business, and not ours. I admit at once, that for a State Governor to take any active part in Australian politics - although that is not prohibited - would be a great error of judgment and a breach of good taste ; but that has not taken place. My objection to the amendment is twofold. In the first place I say that, now that the motion has been placed on the notice-paper, it ought to be dealt with - that it is not fair to the subject of our censure, whether he be the State Governor or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, to put that motion aside, and deal with some general motion. We ought to deal with the matter as it has been placed before us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> and if there is no foundation or justification for the motion in fact, we ought to say so. With all respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> I think the amendment really puts ti us in a worse position than does the motion. First of all the amendment speaks of *&#39; public expression of Vice-Regal views.&#34; If that means the views of our own Governor-General, I quite agree, and I think anybody would agree that it would be most undesirable for the Governor - General to express any views on public affairs. But the Governor-General is not very likely to act in that manner. Following the words I have just quoted, are the words &#34;unless at the request of responsible Ministers,&#34; and, in my opinion, that makes matters worse than anything pictured by the supporters of the motion. Surely the idea of responsible government is that Ministers should speak, and not the Governor, who is only the mouth-piece of the Ministry. If Ministers requested the Government to speak on public affairs, and thereby shifted the responsibility from themselves to him, they would be getting altogether outside the region of responsible government. The amendment would place Ministers in a position they ought not to occupy, and would also be most unfair to the representative of the Crown, even if he assented.. The amendment is an affirmance of a much more vicious principle than anything contained in the lecture itself. This is an interesting subject to discuss, but I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will, on reflection, see that there is no justification in fact for the motion, and that the amendment only makes matters worse. As to the position which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest occupies in the motion, I cannot see that any censure can possibly be passed on him. Even if public affairs were discussed, and matters of public controversy were dealt with, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J</inline> ohn Forrest, as a Minister of the Crown, supported a particular view advocated by the Government in the other House, as it will be advocated in this Chamber, there is no reason why he should not have done so then and on every occasion he chooses. For the reasons I have given, I hope that neither the amendment nor the motion will be carried. </para>

                    <para>-- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will not withdraw his motion, I should like to say a few words. I hardly think the Senate can be congratulated on the use which is being made of Wednesday for private members&#39; business. The discussion of the motion and the amendment are, in my opinion, an absolute waste of time. I am very glad that, late in the day as it is, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> sees that the language he applied to the action of the State Governor cannot be justified. The Senate would bring everlasting disgrace on itself if it attempted to say that the State Governor of Victoria had been guilty of an unwarrantable interference, or was ignorant of the duties pertaining to his office. The motion has apparently arisen from a suspicion in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs&#39;</inline> mind that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has some idea of ingrafting his Imperialism upon the Commonwealth of Australia b)T appointing military and naval men to be States Governors. A moment&#39;s consideration will show that in searching for Governors the Secretary of State for the Colonies has to obtain men with some experience of human nature, and of the affairs of life, and who have leisure to come to Australia. If the Secretary of State for the Colonies tried to obtain business men or financial men, he would find them all too fully occupied to accept such- a position. I expect that for all time to come we shall very likely have a great preponderance of military and naval men appointed. I read this lecture with considerable pleasure and care, and I could not find one single sentence which infringed what I consider to be the absolute right of the State Governor. The lecture is entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Navy and the Nation,</inline> and it is a most admirable epitome of history, showing the important part which the navy has taken in making the Empire what it is to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs&#39;</inline> quarrel ought not to be with the State Governor, but with history. One of the complaints some of us have against our friends of the labour party is that they are always trying to remodel human nature, and imagining that man is a different kind of animal to what he is ;. They are constantly trying to reverse and violate the teachings of history. In this lecture, trie Governor of Victoria has done nothing but give us a splendid epitome of the part which the navy has played in building up the grand old Empire. I can hardly debate the motion with anything like seriousness, so I shall conclude with a little story which was told by, I think, Abraham Lincoln many years ago. With his suspicions that our privileges are being interfered with, and our democratic rights taken away by the utterances of States Governors, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> reminds me very much of a gentleman who was member for Wabash in Congress. He was everlastingly pointing out that every Bill infringed the Constitution. At last the members found him such a bore that they went to old Abe Lincoln, and said - &#34; Look here, Lincoln, you will have to take this gentleman in hand, and bring him down a peg.&#34; Abraham Lincoln undertook the task. The next Bill which was introduced happened to be one in which Lincoln&#39;s constituents were interested, and, sure enough, the member for Wabash imagined that the Constitution had again been violated. After his speech was concluded, Lincoln rose and said - &#34;The member- for Wabash reminds me very much of a friend who went out with his boy to shoot in the woods. Presently he let drive at a squirrel, but, after emptying his gun about twelve times, the squirrel was still on the bough where it was first seen. He tried to blame the gun. He thought that it had not been cleaned. The boy said - &#39;Oh, dad, the gun is all right. I looked to the gun, but where is your squirrel?&#39; &#39;Oh,&#39;, said the man, &#39;Don&#39;t you see it on the second bough from the bottom ?&#39; &#39; Oh,&#39; said the boy, &#39; I see the squirrel you are. shooting at. You are shooting &#176;at a louse on your -eyelash.&#39; &#34; It is something of that sort that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> and his friends in the labour corner are everlastingly thinking about. They are everlastingly thinking that their democratic rights are to be taken away from them. I thought the lecture of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Clarke so admirable that I sent a copy of it to the Minister of Education in Tasmania, and suggested to him that it should be printed for the use of scholars and others in Tasmania. So far from imputing to His Excellency that he does not know his duty, and is ignorant of the position he ought to take up, it appears&#39; to me that his lecture was studiously framed, with the object of not infringing even in the letter, let alone the spirit, the constitutional position which a Governor should hold. I hope that the time will never come when either the Governor-General or a State Governor will be held back from giving to the people of the country information on important subjects which they ought to be only too glad to receive. I hope that the Senate will reject both the amendment and the motion. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that both the amendment and the motion will be withdrawn. We do not wish to have an abstract motion carried saying that it is undesirable for the Governor - which would be the Governor-General I suppose - to take an active part in debatable politics. That is so well understood a principle of constitutional government that to pass an abstract motion on the subject would be simply to make ourselves ridiculous. And if we introduced the words &#34; unless at the request of responsible Ministers &#34; we should give to a Ministry, which might be going out of office, the power to authorize the Governor to make himself a party in their cause, and so place him in a. very unpleasant position in regard to their successors, a position which, I fancy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will see, would not be tenable for a moment. The amendment wishes us first to affirm a truism, and, secondly, to affirm, by way of exception, a very undesirable principle. I could not help thinking that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> had not read the lecture very carefully before he framed <inline font-weight="bold">Ms motion,</inline> because it did not deal with debatable politics at all. In South Australia we had a Governor who was supposed to know something about war affairs. I do not know whether his appointment was part of ,a deep-laid Imperialistic scheme to force upon us a military despotism. I was in the Government at the time, and we encouraged <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Jervois to give us .all the information he could, and to tell the people all he could. He did so, and so far from our bringing forward in Parliament motions to blame him. we were very much obliged to him. We entered on a military speculation more or less successful - in consequence of his remarks - and we were very thankful to him at the time, whatever our opinions might have been subsequently. No question of debatable politics was introduced by His Excellency then, any more than by the Governor of Victoria in his lecture. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Clarke - I presume with the advice of his Ministers, to whom he is responsible, and not with the advice of the Senate, to whom he is not responsible - appears to have given a discourse on the subject of defence in which not a single toe was trodden on so far as I can see, in which no debatable matter was introduced, but in which the general science of war and defence was dealt with. For us to criticise that discourse as an intrusion on his part into debatable politics is, I think, not to do him an injustice so much as to do ourselves a great injustice. Whether we have the power or not- and I am sure that we have not - of expressing an opinion on anything which the Governor of a State may do with the advice of his responsible advisers, it would be most inexpedient for us to interfere with, or even to discourage, the Governor of a State in giving his people the benefit of his best advice on a subject on which he is very well informed. I am sure that nobody has meant to say anything hard about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> Icannot help feeling that he must have given notice of his motion under a misapprehension, and I hope that on consideration he will withdraw it rather than put on our records a division on a subject of this description. </para>

                        <para>-I cannot see my way to ask leave to withdraw the motion. I suggested the amendment in order that those who desired to uphold the rights and privileges of Parliament, but who did not care to pass a motion which would be taken as a censure on a State Governor, might have an opportunity to express their opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> considers that it would be a mistake for the Senate to accept the amendment. Do the friends of the Governor of Victoria desire that there shall appear on the records of the Senate a motion such as I have moved, and do they not think that even if it is lost it is sure to have some supporters? I think it would be far better - and that is why I suggested the amendment - to pass a motion reaffirming our belief in our constitutional rights, and then allow the matter to go. I cannot fall in with the idea of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who, while supporting the motion, says he hopes that the time will arrive when the King will be able to express his opinions in the same way as any member of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> agrees with my view. If the King or his representative came down into the field of party politics he would enter the region of criticism, and in speaking of him we could use just as harsh terms as he might use regarding our views or ourselves. I do not think that such a state of affairs would conduce to our harmony or advancement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> seems to think that the Governor of a State, or the Governor-General, is a kind of umpire. He referred to the umpire on a football field. What would be thought of an umpire if he kicked the football on behalf of one side? I venture to think that if he did, he would perhaps not meet with the treatment that an umpire meets with on a football ground about Melbourne, but receive some hard knocks which would not be to his liking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> said that Governor Clarke carefully avoided making any reference to the naval agreement. Does not that indicate to his mind that His Excellency must have known when he was preparing the lecture, that it would be calculated to support a certain view, and that therefore his duty was to avoid making any reference to the proposed naval subsidy of &#163;200,000? I ask any honorable senator who has read the lecture, whether if it were delivered in Parliament by a member with just this simple addition - &#34; I have 110 more to say in support of the action of the Prime Minister, in signing the agreement for the payment of &#163;200,000 a year &#34;- </para>

I believe they would go into the lobbies and elsewhere, and say - &#34;What a magnificent speech <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-So</inline> made in favour of the subsidy.&#34; Probably as the House of Commons used to do after a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> the House of Representatives or the Senate would have to adjourn in order that its members might get into a state of levelheadedness after having heard such a magnificent speech. I do not wish to traverse the arguments I used in my opening speech. Unfortunately, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> was not present on that occasion, otherwise I think he would have seen some connexion between the lecture and the views of those who support the new naval agreement. Right throughout the lecture we find the phrases that are used by the Admiralty and various members who support the naval agreement - such phrases as these - &#34; The supremacy of the sea must be maintained ; &#34; &#34; The supremacy of the sea can only be maintained by being able to concentrate your navy at a certain point ; &#34; &#34; The supremacy of the sea is decided by the result of great naval battles at sea.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- There is only one subject in which the honorable senator takes an interest. I dealt with his observations last year, and I do not feel called upon at this stage to reply to his most irrelevant interjection. I think it is necessary to pass either the motion in its original form or the amendment. Some honorable senators are able to make a distinction between the State Governor and the Governor-General. I can see none. The Governor of Victoria represents the King just as much as Governor-General Tennyson does. I find a disposition on the part of State Governors to interfere. What did we see the other day? The Governor of Western Australia took a hand in urging its people to keep pegging away at the Federal Government until they expended a certain sum of money. Does any one agree with that? </para>

                        <para>- He may have spoken in a jocular manner, but his remarks looked serious in cold print; indeed, so serious that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton declined to express an opinion when he was asked whether the Government had anything to say about this interference by State Governors in Commonwealth politics. The Government did not feel called upon to express an opinion. I suppose they had not the courage to express an opinion. We must sympathize to a certain extent with the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> because the Government would be under a certain amount of censure if the motion were carried. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> used it as an argument against my motion that the lecture by Governor Clarke was. contemplated as far back as November, 1902, and that statement has been reiterated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> The former said that  His Excellency  could not have known of the new agreement. It was first proposed in 1897 when a Conference was held in London. When the First Lord of the Admiralty at a banquet threw out the suggestion that the colonies ought to make a larger contribution, it was condemned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H. Reid. I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Clarke was employed at the War-office until 1892. He was secretary to the Colonial Defence Committee, secretary to the Royal Commission on Navy and Army Administration, and superintendent of the Royal Carriage Factory. </para>

I do not wish further to take up the time of the Senate, as I have another motion coming on, and I am anxious to get to a vote. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is not here. The honorable and learned senator has said that the labour party always ignores the teachings of history. My object in moving this motion is that honorable senators should be reminded of the teachings of history. I desire them to remember that it was the interferences of Royalty at various periods in history which accounts for the fact that when we look down the list of the Kings and Queens of England we find that their average age was about 36. The people found it necessary to put them out of the way, because they would not adopt constitutional habits. </para>

                    <para>The anecdote by which Canute is best known to posterity rests on the authority of an early historian, Henry of Huntingdon. To rebuke the flattery of his courtiers it is said that he gathered them around him on the shore, and seated on a chair near the water-line commanded the advancing tide to respect the greatest of sea kings. Upon its onward flow compelling a retreat, he expatiated upon the weakness of earthly power in comparison with that of the Supreme. The world has always seen in this beautiful story a striking lesson to courtly sycophants. </para>

There are people in Melbourne who, perhaps, do not fall down and worship devils or idols of wood and stone, that can neither eat, nor see, nor smell, nor walk, but they certainly do appear to me to kneel down and worship anybody in a viceregal position. I have seen the footway traffic stopped in Bourke-street here in Melbourne, and I have seen between 200 and 300 people, men and women, standing on the edge of the footpath, opposite Robertson and Moffatt&#39;s, waiting until the Governor&#39;s wife made her exit after having made some purchases. </para>

                <para>SenatorHIGGS. - I do not think I would. There are some good people in Victoria who seem to be afflicted in that way, and it is for this reason that we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> considering the words of my motion an insult to the people of Victoria. I venture to say that if I engaged a hall here in Melbourne, and gave an address upon this subject, a motion would be carried by the audience in favour of an expression of opinion that the Governor should not take part in public affairs, even to the extent of delivering an eloquent lecture upon naval defence. There are two stand-points from which we may view this question. I am not very anxious about the motion, because if the Governors of the States are to be allowed to interfere in politics, the evil will work its own remedy. My idea is that all our Governors, whether of States or of Commonwealth, should be elected by ballot at the polls just as we are, and I shall not rest satisfied until, so far as I can bring it about, something like that takes place. The interference of State Governors in these matters will only strengthen the hands of those who believe in such a mode of selection. To discuss that matter at greater length would, perhaps, infringe upon the next question to come before the Senate, and I do not propose to deal with it further at this stage. I hope honorable senators will carry the amendment, and if they do not, I shall be very happy to vote for my motion. </para>

                    <para class="block">In my opinion this motion is a necessary one, and it is a great pity that a similar proposal was not voted on during last session. Now is an opportune time to discuss the question, because we shall shortly have with us the new Governor-General, who, I understand, will take up his duties in December next. If the new Governor-General comes here with any erroneous impressions, as he probably will, the passing of a motion such as that which I have now submitted will remove them. Has Excellency is now Governor of Bombay, where he has presided over some 20,000,000 Hindoos, and he will, in all probability, come here with wrong notions of the Australian people. </para>

                        <para>- If he should come here with any wrong impressions, I venture to say that the debate on this motion will disabuse his mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eraser</inline> seems amused, but I hope to show that there is no ground for amusement. Some Governors have come to Australia with very wrong impressions of the Australian people. Section 125 of the Constitution is as follows : - </para>

Such territory shall contain an area of not less than 100 square miles, and such portion thereof as shall consist of Crown lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without any payment therefor. The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meet at the seat of Government. </para>
                <para class="block">Although there is no provision in the Constitution stating in what part of the Commonwealth the Governor-General shall reside, I think common sense dictates that he ought to reside within easy distance of Parliament, so as to be available when wanted. It should not be necessary when there is a reconstruction of the Government for the Prime Minister to come to Parliament and say - &#34;This is what we propose to do, but we shall not be able to tell honorable members definitely until we have seen the Governor-General, who is distant some 500 miles.&#34; I do not think it is desirable that the Governor-General should maintain a kind of travelling caravan, such as has been stated in the press ex- President Kruger had in the Orange Free State. If the Governor-General is to be asked to keep up an establishment in New South Wales as well as in Victoria, the other States have a right to ask that he shall also have residences within their borders. Indeed, it might be suggested that the Governor General ought to visit every important town throughout the Commonwealth in order to keep himself in touch with public affairs, so far as he is entitled to do so in his position. </para>

                        <para>- Such a proposal, as I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to make, would deter any one from accepting the position of Governor-General. The proposal that the States should contribute to the up-keep of the Governor-General&#39;s establishment ought to be objected to by every one who desires to carry out the terms of the Constitution and adopt a common-sense course. The New South Wales Parliament is credited with having passed an Act authorizing the appropriation of &#163;3,500 per annum for the up-keep of the Governor-General&#39;s establishment in that State ; and a similar proposal was made in the State Parliament of Victoria, but was wisely rejected. To have a Governor-General&#39;s establishment in New South Wales as well as in Victoria is open to great objection, for the reason that, although, as has been repeatedly said - and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> said in reply to an argument once used in the Senate - the Governor-General has no power, but is merely the mouth-piece of the Executive Council, who are responsible to Parliament, vet on occasions the Governor-General, without a doubt, will be in a position to exercise considerable influence. If the Governor-General knows that New South &#34;Wales is contributing &#163;3,500 a year to the up-keep of his establishment, and at any time there arises a conflict as to States rights between that and any other State the Governor-General may use his influence. I venture to think that the friends -which the Governor-General makes during his stay in Sydney, and the obligation to which he is to some extent under, might influence him ; and that, in my opinion, would be altogether wrong. </para>

                        <para>- The Governor-General might not exercise his influence publicly, but he could do so privately, and he might influence the Colonial Office, and we should have no explanations. Whatever is expended in connexion with the Governor-General ought to be expended by the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. I now come to the erroneous views which are held by certain Governors, and by the people of the old country with regard to Australians, and the position of our Governors and Governor-General. There is a belief prevalent in England that Australians- like ostentatious display, and that a Governor who is in a position to afford to gratify that desire, is looked up to with great respect.

                        <para>- My contention is that we pay far too much for our vice-regal representative, and that economy might be exercised in this direction. In a normal year, the Governors of Australia, including the Governor-General, cost &#163;100,000; and it is very necessary for me to deal with the position of the States in regard to this matter. In my opinion, the whole of the work could be done for &#163;50,000, and a step towards economy would be taken if we refrained from establishing a Government House in New South Wales as well as in Victoria. When I say that there are erroneous impressions in the old country in regard to the Australian people, I am speaking of the Australian people as a whole. Men like Samuel Hordern, the leading draper in Sydney, take very different views. That gentleman,- when he returned recently from a trip to Europe, said that it would be worth while to have a good Governor coming out to Australia, and spending &#163;30,000 or &#163;40,000 per annum in carrying out his duties, because that would cause the people as-a whole to spend more money in order to keep pace with him. That is doubtless a view which a leading draper would very naturally take, and it is a .view held by those strange political economists who think that it is a fine thing for the country to pay &#163;10,000 or &#163;15,000 per annum to a Governor-General, in order that he may distribute the money in the purchase of champagne and on festivities of various kinds. The lavish proposals of the Government with regard to the Governor-General have a disastrous effect on the general community, because they lead to the ostentatious expenditure of public money, and involve corresponding expenditure on the part of people who cannot afford it. At an anti-sweating meeting, not long ago, it was stated that a lot of society people did not pay their dressmakers for a year, and sometimes not at all, with the result that the latter had to wait for their money after having paid for the material. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Senate counted.</inline> As stated in the motion, the salary of &#163;10,000 is an ample allowance to the Governor-General to enable him to carry out the duties outlined in the Constitution. We have no right to demand that the Governor-General shall carry out any other duties. Strange to say, I find that, although the <inline font-style="italic">Spectator</inline> has charged Australians with being- vulgar, and to some extent mean, it agrees with the view that &#163;10,000 is an ample salary. It says- </para>

                    <para>We believe, therefore, though fully perceiving the arguments for the other side, that &#163;10,000 a year is, except in India, where considerations of climate come in, an ample salary for a Viceroy, that he should be asked to keep up one house, and that his instructions should include a hint that he is to live like a gentleman and not as a financial prince. </para>
                    <para class="block">Honorable senators ought to recognise that there is a solid feeling on the part . of the people in England, that we are mean and vulgar, and that we are like a lot of spongers, loafers and beggars, who want a &#39; wealthy man to come here and spend his money for our enjoyment. It is necessary for these Houses of Parliament in some way to give expression to the idea that that is not the real view of the Australian people. They do not want anything of the kind. The Australian people believe with the <inline font-style="italic">Spectator</inline> that &#163;10,000 per annum is a sufficiently large salary. They say also that the Governor-General should be asked to keep up only one establishment, and should be expected to live like a gentleman, and not like a financial prince. I am pleased to know that, in the opinion of the (government, a wealthy man is not required to occupy the position. In reply to a question which I asked some time ago, the Government stated that in their opinion the people of the Commonwealth would be satisfied to have as Governor-General a man without means, provided he had the character, ability, and experience to fill the position. The London publications refer to the fact that there is in the old country a reservoir of ability, provided that the men who are expected to fill these high positions are not deterred by financial considerations. Now I come to the last part of my motion, which says that the Government should respectfully invite the Imperial authorities to appoint an Australian statesman who has served his country faithfully and well. I should not like to bind the Government to request that &#38; statesman be appointed. . I think that any number of our citizens have served their country faithfully and well. They may be members of the legal profession, or the medical profession, or they may have served their country in a business capacity. An Australian who has lived at least some ten years amongst us, knows more about our habits and customs - knows the people and their ways - better than a stranger. He would not be likely to pander to class prejudices, and would, I think, fill the position of Governor-General in a more satisfactory way than any gentleman imported. . An Australian citizen in the position of the Governor-General would never make the mistakes that some </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Governors have made. He would not be likely for example to fall into the error made by some Governors I know of - half-pay officers - who have come out here, and after being able to get in their wines free of duty, have sent them down to the auction room and secured the benefit of the increased price which had accrued. Nor would such a Governor-General be likely to make the mistake of paying English rates of wages to his servants. And, further, an Australian would not, I think, fall into the mistake made by a very popular Governor-General some time ago, who- seeing the unemployed in distress - distributed 100 bottles of champagne amongst them. His action reminded me of the story of the French Princess who, during the time of the Revolution, hearing that the people were crying for bread, asked why they did not eat cake. This Governor-General&#39;s distribution of champagne indicated to my mind a great want of knowledge of the Australian people, that would not be exhibited by an Australian citizen appointed to that position. When we come to the more serious mistakes made by Governors, we must take into consideration the grave error made by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth, who, in defiance of the advice of his Ministers and regardless of what had been done by Lord Hopetoun, advised the Imperial authorities not to assent to the kanaka legislation until certain regulations which will not be necessary for years to come had been passed. An Australian, I repeat, could not have fallen into that blunder. I can refer briefly to the names of some Australian statesmen from whom a selection could have been made if we bad required a Governor-General in the times in which they lived, or if it had been the custom then to appoint Australians to State governorships. I do not wish to refer more than is necessary to living statesmen, because, as the celebrated American humourist puts it, &#34; the chief element of fame consists in being dead.&#34; The men whose names I shall mention are spoken of in the highest regard now that they have passed away, but they might have been criticised as unfit to occupy the position of Governor-General while they were alive. Take the case of William Charles Wentworth, the founder of the Sydney University and the father of the New South Wales political constitution. Then I will mention the name of William Charles Windeyer, New South Wales, barrister, journalist, and Supreme Court Judge. Henry Parkes also served his country faithfully and well for fifty years. In Victoria the name of George Higinbotham must occur to most people. There is also Francis Longmore, formerly Minister for Lands. In Queensland there is Charles Lilley, the father of the education system - the father of free education, and for many years Chief Justice of that State. I may also mention William Brookes and John Dunmore Lang, who served not only Queensland but New South Wales - a man who was perhaps rather an enthusiast in one particular direction, but who had qualities which I think fitted him for the position we are now discussing. When we come to South Australia, there is Edward Gibbon Wakefield, the author of a book on the <inline font-style="italic">Art of Colonization,</inline> upon the principles of which I understand the colonies of New Zealand and South Australia were founded. When we come to Tasmania - if I may leave the dead for a moment, and refer to the living - we have the members of the Dobson family. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I might refer to the honorable and gallant <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> I should not object to his being called upon to fill a position of this kind in Australia. He has had some experience of the Australian people, and would not make the mistakes which have been made by some Imperial Governors. I hope the motion will commend itself to the Senate. I am aware that in its present form it presents a complicated question. There are really four motions in one. If some honorable senators cannot see their way to vote for the principle, that an Australian citizen should be eligible to fill the position of Governor-General, the President might perhaps divide the motion into sections, so as to facilitate business, and enable the Senate to vote fairly with regard to any portion of it. I venture to think that with regard to the first three propositions, no honorable senator can offer any objection. </para>

                    <para>. - I was naturally desirous to learn what were the particular reasons which actuated the honorable senator in his attack upon the expenditure connected with the Governor-General. There seem to be three principal reasons. The first is of course the constitutional reason ; the second is that it is extremely inconvenient for the Governor-General to be away from the seat of Government ; and the third is the reason- of economy. The honorable senator does not, I think, believe in the constitutional reason himself. He tells us that the Constitution does not require that the Governor-General should have more than one establishment for his convenience in the Commonwealth. Of course, the Constitution does not provide that, nor does it provide a great number of other things. Apart from that, we have to consider whether it is desirable that the Governor-General should have any convenience of the kind provided for him away from the present seat of government. I entirely disagree with the honorable senator in thinking that it is necessary or desirable that the Governor-General should always be at the seat of government. What are the instances of inconvenience which are given ? The honorable senator mentioned that the Prime Minister had to announce that it was proposed that certain alterations should be made in the Cabinet instead of being able to state that they had been made. The Prime Minister, I presume, announced that certain alterations would be made, provided the Governor-General accepted the advice of his responsible advisers. The honorable senator, as a constitutionalist, knows very well that that was all the information that Parliament would require. But does he really contend that it is a desirable tiling that the Governor-General should be glued down to the seat of government, and should not be able to travel about the Commonwealth ? If so, I entirely disagree with him. </para>

                <para class="block">I think, on the other hand, that it is most desirable that a gentleman occupying that high position, and being absolutely free from provincial preferences, should travel about the Commonwealth, visiting the various States. Knowing the good results that have followed from such a course, I hold that view strongly. The honorable senator is aware that our late highly-esteemed Governor - General on several occasions - I do not know how often - visited the State of Queensland ; in fact, in his delicate condition bf health he found great benefit from visiting the northern part of that State. Is it not desirable that that should be done under such circumstances <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not know any circumstance which would afford a reason for preventing the Governor-General from travelling from the seat of government. The instance he gave just now, and to which he attached considerable weight, seemed to me to have no value whatever. The honorable senator is of opinion that if the Governor-General were precluded from leaving the seat of government some money would be saved, because it would not be-&#39; necessary to provide funds for his travelling expenses or his accommodation in any other State. I am surprised that the honorable senator should be so infatuated with the economy craze as to carry it to the extent of objecting to accommodation being made for the Governor-General in the neighbouring State of New South Wales. The honorable senator knows that the circumstances of the time are somewhat peculiar. We are just commencing our career as a .Federation. For a long time previous to Federation there was a great deal of difficulty in deciding whether the capital of the Commonwealth should be in New South Wales or Victoria. Ultimately, a compromise was arranged ; and I think it is not unreasonable, but very proper, that the Governor-General should spend some of his time when he can do so without any delay to the public business, in the adjoining State. I am very glad that Lord Tennyson has availed himself of several opportunities of visiting New South Wales, South Australia, and other States. If the use of Sydney Government-house were given up, the amount that would be saved would be very small indeed. Its cost at the present time is &#163;2,500 a year. It is clear that if His Excellency were to spend all his time in Melbourne, a larger sum would have to be&#62; provided for the up-keep of Melbourne Government-house. The total vote for the upkeep of Government-houses, according to the understanding which was arrived at, and announced to Parliament last session, was &#163;6,000, and the provision on the Estimates for this year is &#163;6,015. Of that sum &#163;3,515 is for Melbourne Government-house and &#163;2,500 for Sydney Government-house. If His Excellency were required to spend all his time in Melbourne, the probability is that the up-keep of Government-house would be about &#163;6,000 instead of &#163;3,515. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is necessary to maintain caretakers to keep the building in proper order, but there is not the same expenditure on its up-keep during His Excellency&#39;s absence, as there would be if he resided there all his time. The increased expenditure is so insignificant that it is hardly sufficient to justify <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> in the action which he has taken. A paragraph of his motion affirms that the proposal that the States Governments should contribute to the up-keep of the GovernorGeneral&#39;s establishment is objectionable. He is rather belated in coming forward with that proposition, because the Government and the Parliament have held that view all along, and have refused to allow any part of this expenditure to be borne by a State. The Parliament of New South Wales passed *a Bill providing an annual sum of &#163;3,000 for the up-keep of the Sydney Government-house, and a similar Bill was introduced into the Parliament of Victoria, but was not carried. The Government decided at once that it was not a right principle that any portion of the expenditure on the Governor-General&#39;s establishment should be provided by a State ; and it did not avail itself of the provision which had been made by New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- No; we have not been asked to do so in the case of Sydney Government-house any more than in the case of Melbourne Government-house, or the building in which Parliament meets. The States have chosen to provide the buildings for our use. The Government of New South Wales said - &#34;Here is a </para>

                <para class="block">Government-house for the Governor-General to use,&#34; but the expenditure on its up-keep is borne by the people of the Commonwealth as &#34; other&#34; expenditure on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. So there is nothing in that part of the motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> thinks that a provision of &#163;10,000 for the Governor-General is sufficient, and presumably that there should not be any allowance for the up-keep of a Government-house. That is merely a matter of opinion. I suppose that each honorable- senator can have his own opinion as to what salary should .be paid. What is paid now is paid on the basis of the agreement which was come to last session, with the approval of both Houses - that the Commonwealth should provide a salary of &#163;10,000, and an allowance of &#163;6,000 for the maintenance of private residences. If we compare the expenditure which is incurred in connexion with the Governor-General with the expenditure which was previously incurred by the States in connexion with their Governors, we shall find that we are paying much less for the Governor-General and his establishment, than was paid in some of the States for the Governor and his establishment. So far from being extravagant, the comparison shows that we are exceedingly economical. Of course there would always be some persons who, if the salary of the office were &#163;10,000, would say that it should be &#163;9,000 ; or, if it were &#163;9,000, that it should be &#163;8,000 ; and so on, until it was cut down to almost nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has a very strong objection to our asking for the services of a gentleman of wealth in order to save the Commonwealth from expending money on behalf of the Governor-General. Holding that view, he should not object to the provision of a reasonable sum which would enable us to secure the services of a gentleman of first-class standing. With regard to the other portions of the motion, I can only say that &#39; I do not agree with the honorable senator. In our present circumstances, it would be exceedingly undesirable to have as Governor-General a gentleman who had been connected with the affairs of any State. The honorable senator has given us a long roll of names, and what do we find ? In every case the gentlemen whom he has named are connected with some State or another, and are comparatively little known outside its borders. He has told us about brilliant Victorian statesmen. Does he consider it advisable, at the present time, that our destinies should be controlled by a Victorian gentleman? He has named some gentlemen who, no doubt, attained to greatness in New South Wales. Does he think it desirable that the Governor-General should be distinctively a New South Welshman, and not connected with any other State? Or does he think it desirable that even if the Queensland gentlemen whom he named were all living, one of them should become Governor-General? If he does, I certainly do not agree with him. In our present state of development it is far better that we should have, as we had before, a gentleman from outside the Commonwealth, who is not connected with any State, and is entirely disconnected with our politics. The rule has worked very well so far, and I do not see any reason why a change should be made. I am not going to follow the honorable senator in his remarks as to what this or that Governor-General may have done, because I do not take much count of those tittle-tattle stories that are to be found in certain newspapers. They may be true, or they may not ; I do not know anything about them. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite new to me ; but I feel perfectly confident that His Excellency acted strictly within his instructions if he did advise that the Royal assent to a Bill should be delayed. In our short experience as a Federation we have been exceedingly fortunate in the choice of our Governors-General ; and, from all I have heard, we are likely to be exceedingly fortunate in the selection of the gentleman to succeed Lord Tennyson. In these circumstances, so far from thinking that the passing of this motion would have any happy effect, I think it would be singularly inappropriate. Therefore I ask the Senate not to approve of any portion of the motion. </para>

                    <para>- The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> conveyed to my mind that he rather regretted having put the motion on the paper. As a general rule he is very much in earnest. &#91;Senate <inline font-style="italic">counted.&#93;</inline> I am sure that I am not doing the honorable senator any injustice when I say that I do not think I ever heard him submit a proposition - I was going to say in a feeble manner - with less earnestness. He was not as earnest as he usually is when he takes up a question on which he desires the support of his fellow senators. He made a speech which, to a certain extent, will, perhaps, be a warrant for me to ramble over the points he submitted, just as he rambled over the various parts of his motion. I shall speak from a few notes I made while he was addressing the Chamber, although I freely admit that there may be a want of concinnity in my remarks. He commenced by &#34; flogging a dead horse.&#34; He dragged up a Bill which the Parliament of New South Wales passed years ago ; but which was a nullity from start to finish, for the simple reason that the Parliament of Victoria declined to pass a similar measure. When the honorable senator has to fall back upon a legislative corpse as a live argument for the departure which he proposes, surely he must have a singularly poor case to start with? The honorable senator objects to the Governor-General having a second residence. I believe my honorable friend comes from the State of Queensland, where the Governor has a city residence in Brisbane and a country residence in Toowoomba. In New South Wales the Governor for very many years has had a city residence, a seaside residence, with abundance of fresh air, but still he has also had a country residence, &#39;Sutton Forrest, near Moss Vale. Then we come to Victoria, and we find that the Victorian Governor has had, for I do not know how many years past, a palatial city residence, and a country residence at Mount Macedon. We find the same state of affairs in South Australia, where two establishments are provided for the Governor, one in the city of Adelaide, on North-terrace, and one at Marble Hill. I am not sufficiently well acquainted with Western Australia as to be able to say whether there are two residences provided for the Governor there. </para>

                        <para>- Not only had each of the Colonial Governors before the Commonwealth was established, two residences provided for him, but those two residences have been maintained in every instance except that of Tasmania. This is the case in Queensland, undoubtedly it is the case in New South Wales, it is certainly the case here in Victoria, and the Governor of South Australia has not forfeited his Marble Hill residence. It has, therefore, for many years past, been the established custom for the Governor of a colony or a State to have a second residence provided for him, and necessarily a second establishment has had to be kept up with greater or less expenditure. Is it not therefore unreasonable that the Governor-General, who is the over-ruling gubernatorial representative in the Commonwealth, should be denied a second residence, such as is at the disposal of every State Governor? I shall not discuss the cost of the two establishments at Sydney and Melbourne. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has given useful information upon the point showing that as against the expenditure that was incurred at Sydney, there is a corresponding reduction in the expenditure upon Government-house, Melbourne. That seems to rae to be a very complete answer to any charge of extravagance. I now come to the second paragraph of the motion, dealing with the question of the upkeep of the Governor-General&#39;s establishment. I do not know at which State this paragraph of the motion is directed. To be perfectly sure, I sent into the library for a copy of the Estimates of Expenditure for New South Wales for th&#171; year 1902-3. I have been through those Estimates over and over again, not only through the columns, but through the index- also, and I have not discovered that a single penny piece is put down for the expenses of the Governor-General in New South Wales. As there is no other establishment in the Commonwealth foi- the convenience of the Governor-General outside of Victoria than the one in Sydney, and as, clearly, the State of New South Wales is contributing nothing to the up-keep of the Commonwealth Government-house there, this second proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has no meaning&#39;, and does not apply to anything that exists to-day. I point out on this question of the up-keep of premises that it would be just as reasonable to ask members of the Federal Parliament to sweep and dust these premises, and do their own messengering as it is to ask the Governor-General to keep up the premises he occupies officially. The Governor - General&#39;shouse is not a -private house. We heard this afternoon the statement that the Governor-General cannot separate himself from his official position, and neither can he separate himself from his official residence. It is his official place of business, if I may put it in that way, and it is ridiculous to suppose that the Governor-General out of his salary, which is not a very munificent one after all, should pay for the up-keep of his establishment and the grounds surrounding it. I do not know that it is intended that he shall also defray the cost of ordinary repairs. The greater the pleasure of those who desire to see their country occupying a position, not of penury, but of reasonable and wholesome expenditure, and the larger the ground, and the. handsomer the house they provide, the greater the onslaught on the Governor-General&#39;s income for their up-keep. It would be regarded as a very extraordinary thing if we were to ask the Astronomer of any one of the States to defray the cost of the up-keep of his official premises. I cannot believe that this point has been really considered, because the GovernorGeneral&#39;s house is a great deal more than his residence. It is the place which he occupies officially, not only as a dwelling house, but as the centre from which his duties are discharged. What other premises has he except the Executive Council Chamber? Government-house is the all in all. It is the Governor-General&#39;s home, and the place from which his official energies are directed. I do not know why we should expect any officer of the State to look after the premises he occupies under similar conditions of residence and of official work. The question of salary is one which, I think, we need not discuss. Surely, Parliament has already spent enough time during its existence in discussing the question of the Governor-General&#39;s salary and allowances, and we need not in the present session attempt to again slay the slain. I do not feel disposed to occupy time in discussing that question. With reference to the inconvenience occasioned by the Governor-General&#39;s absence, we will say in Sydney, in residence, the same or even greater inconvenience, must be occasioned when the Governor-General is travelling in the Commonwealth. If he- is travelling in South Australia, in Queensland, or elsewhere in the Commonwealth, inconvenience will be occasioned to Ministers when they desire to communicate with him j but if he is in residence in one spot it will probably be much easier for Ministers to communicate with him, and to have meetings of the Executive Council in his presence than if he is travelling about from pillar to post. Surely it is not to be proposed that the Governor-General shall be tied to one house and to one spot during the whole of a prolonged session of. Parliament? I think I am justified in pointing to the fact that the illustrious Head of the Realm has travelled on the Continent of Europe during the continuance of the sittings of the Imperial Parliament in London. I have not read that this has been attended by any ill effects, or has occasioned any stir. The press has certainly not conveyed any indication that the action of the Head of the State has been unsatisfactory to the people of the Kingdom. </para>

                <para>On this question of having Australian statesmen as Governors-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> destroyed his entire argument by his own representation. The honorable senator represented that there were Australian statesmen who had served their various States and colonies so well that they would have made admirable Governors - General. He submitted the names of a number of gentlemen, who became really popular in a broad sense only after they had travelled hence. No one can deny that a majority of the illustrious men to whom the honorable senator referred had during their lifetime, perhaps, as many enemies as friends - from time to time their enemies were in the majority. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> quoted the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, probably New South Wales&#39; .greatest statesman ; but there - were times when that honorable gentleman was hurled from power. I do not know that he was ever hurled from power by a vote of Parliament, but he was hurled from power by a vote of the people, and though he came back again, perhaps stronger than ever, I would ask, at what stage of that statesman&#39;s career could he have been selected to occupy the presumably unbiased and unprejudiced position of Governor-General of Australia, without the gravest offence to an immense section of the people? It could not have been otherwise. What we secure in the present system of gubernatorial appointments is the selection of men whose past and whose present supply no basis of opposition, and are not an outrage to the feelings of any person in the community. I do not mean to say that wishy-washy characters are selected - God forbid that it should ever come to that - but men whose previous career has not placed them in antagonism to any great section, of the people. It would be a deplorable thing if we had at any time persons appointed to act in the presumably unbiased position of Governor-General whose past life and whose past actions had, from time to time, been of a character distinctly party, and distinctly in opposition to the views of great bodies of the people. Reference has been- made to the fact that at the present time the States Government-houses are filled by gentlemen who have served their country in the military and naval service. I do not wish to play the part of sycophant to any one, but I think it would be difficult to find in the whole list of the many illustrious men who have been sent to Australia as representatives of the Crown, any gentleman who has filled the position with more acceptance than has the grand old sailor we have in Sydney to-day. He is a gentleman whose every action is such as to endear him to the community at large, in a manner that could scarcely be possible if in years past he had been in violent antagonism to large sections of the people on political matters from time to time. It is customary for a State Governor to have two residences&#39; ; and as to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs&#39;</inline> second proposition, it has actually no meaning, seeing that no State is called upon to contribute to the up-keep of the GovernorGeneral&#39;s establishment. The salary is fixed by the Constitution, and it is absolutely unreasonable and impossible to expect the maintenance of buildings and grounds to be paid for out Of the salary. As to the fourth proposition I hope I have, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> did, offered reasons why gentlemen who have actively participated in the strife of politics and in the blows of party conflict would not be the best, men to select for the position. A Governor is supposed to know no party, but to be unbiased and free from those sentiments of antagonism, and even animosity, which are of necessity engendered amongst all statesmen and party leaders. </para>

                    <para>- So fully do I agree with what has already fallen from the Minister for Defence and from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> that it is not necessary foi&#34; me to take up much of the time of the Senate. It is quite true that public opinion does not call upon the Governor-General to maintain two establishments, but I think that public opinion is strongly in favour of his being seen in all parts of Australia ; and it would be a pity, when there are such suitable residences in Melbourne and Sydney, that His Excellency should not occupy them as his official duties permit. We must remember that the Federal capital has not yet been founded ; and I am not aware that Melbourne or Sydney has any prescriptive right to monopolize the Governor-General&#39;s time. If the capital had already been established, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs&#39;</inline> motion would have come with greater force, but at present I think that the mother State is entitled by courtesy, if on no other ground, to have the pleasure of the Governor-General&#39;s presence for some time in each year. If a State Government chooses to contribute to the up-keep of the Governor-General&#39;s establishment, why should it not be at liberty to do so <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> At one time it was anticipated that an additional &#163;10,000 per annum would be made up by the States towards the expenses of the Governor-General, and the New South Wales Parliament passed an Act agreeing to contribute its share, some &#163;3,500. Whether the New South Wales Parliament was obliged to make such a contribution or not, it at any rate had a perfect right to pass the Act. if it so pleased. As to the third proposition, we are all glad to hear that the Governor-General is quite satisfied that the salary is sufficient to enable him to support his. office. Of course, the &#163;10,000 has no reference to the expense of keeping up the establishments, but is, I take it, for His Excellency&#39;s personal expenses, and the expenses of his family. The salary is also exclusive of travelling expenses incurred by the Governor-General in his official capacity. I hope time will permit of every Governor-General,&#39; once during each twelve months of his term of office, visiting each State of the Commonwealth. It is desirable in the interests of Australia and of the Home authorities that when a GovernorGeneral retires he shall be able to speak from personal experience of the whole Territory. We have a very good example afforded in the way in which the King moves about, and also in the fact that there are Royal palaces in various parts of Great Britain. I personally regret that there is as 3&#39;et no Royal residence in Ireland,, but I think the time is not far distant when that will be remedied. As to the fourth proposition, it is true that up to this time we have not seen Australian statesmen actually ap- . pointed Governors, but we must remember that several prominent men in Australia have been Lieutenant-Governors. In the State which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> represents, the following prominent colonists have been Lieutenant-Governors :- <inline font-weight="bold">-Sir Maurice</inline> O&#39;Connell, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joshua</inline> Bell, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Palmer, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. The terms of office of these gentlemen, when added together, amount to a number of years. </para>

It is sufficiently embarrassing for a Governor to know that he has to hold the scales evenly as between the different political parties without every little incident connected with his career being debated, and, in some cases, debated in a semi-hostile fashion. I am sure that no one more than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> would be averse to such a proceeding. I am rather astonished that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> who, in the matter of the High Court, refused to become a reformer, should now raise a discussion on what he describes as the enormous expenditure on the Governors of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> is a representative of the working man, and I ask whether it is not notorious that in all the States the Governors have spent considerably more than their incomes. </para>

                            was on the wrong side on that occasion ; he was then extravagant, and now he wants to be what he would call &#34;a miserable economist.&#34; As I said before, we should keep the Governor-General as much as possible out of our discussions. The Governor-General&#39;s only mouth-piece is his Ministers, and it must be very painful to him to hear his actions and his movements discussed, and opinions expressed that he ought not to go. here, there, or elsewhere. Why cannot the Governor-General and Governors&#34; in their movements be treated as. private individuals ? If

I am not in favour of military and naval expenditure any more than the honorable senator, but of the two evils I shall choose the least. As to the proposal to appoint Australian statesmen as Governors-General, we know that, even at the present time, the States cannot arrange their quarrels. How would the selection be made? If a man were chosen from New South Wales probably Victoria, or some of the other great colonies, would complain. </para>

                        <para>- I have tested <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs&#39;</inline> economy and have very little faith in it indeed. When it suits him to air his eloquence on abstract propositions of this kind, which can lead to no practical&#39; results, he poses as an economist ; but when we had a practical issue before the Senate a few nights ago, where was he ? He was not a supporter of economy then. How does he reconcile the two positions? The conscience of some people seems to be very elastic. The Governor-General is a gentleman who has the respect of us all. He has to hold the balance between different political parties ; and we should endeavour to keep his name out of our debates. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> seems to. think that the Governor-General should not travel, because travelling is dangerous. He might as well say that the illustrious Head of the British Empire should not travel. The Head of the State is the symbol of its power. The Head of the British Empire is the symbol of that power which, in the hands of its Ministers, dispenses political justice to different parties. But the King does not do that individually ; and from the point of view that it is not desirable to mix up our Governors-General with party politics, I ask the honorable senator to withdraw his motion. </para>

                        <para>- He was then an economist. I believed that true economy would be better served by instituting the High Court than by having the work done in the method suggested by the honorable senator and his friends ; just as I believe that it is always better when purchasing something which is necessary in the conduct of one&#39;s business to buy a good article rather than a cheap one, merely because it is cheap. If one buys a good tool and pays a good price for it, probably it will last very much longer than an inferior one, which will not give the owner such good service. That was the principle upon which I voted last week. We are now discussing the office of Governor-General, and several matters connected with the position held by him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> seems to look upon it as a kind of blasphemy that the office of Governor-General, or his person, should be brought into any discussion in the Senate. </para>

Lord Tennyson, the present Governor-General, is, I suppose, an estimable nobleman ; as is also the gentleman who is to succeed him. We are not discussing these distinguished persons as individuals. We are merely dealing with the expenditure connected with their office. It is perfectly well known that, but for the insane jealousy of Sydney with regard to Melbourne, the proposal that the Governor-General should reside for a portion of the year in Sydney would never have been brought forward. </para>

                        <para>- Why should not the Governor-General live in Brisbane for a portion of the year? Why should he not live in Adelaide, or in Perth? Why should he not have residences in each of the States? If the Commonwealth is willing to bear the burden of this extravagance, I shall not object very much. But we ought not to be called upon to minister to the envious spirit that has found a place in the minds of the. people of Sydney. No ; I will not say the people of Sydney - I apologize to them ; I will say the minds of a certain section of the people of Sydney - the society section, whose chief aim in life is to grovel at the feet either of royalty itself or some faint pale reflection of royalty. There appears to be a section of the community which cannot live unless it is prostrating itself mentally or physically, or in both ways, at the feet of somebody or something ; and that somebody usually takes the form of a titled individual from the other end of the world. I have no objection to these people indulging their passion, any more than I should object to a Chinaman abasing himself before his joss. But what I contend is that if they will grovel they should do so at their own expense. Do not let them come round with the hat and ask others to contribute to the cost of their antics. </para>

                        <para>- They did not. The Government of New South Wales has offered, which means that the people of New South Wales would pay, whilst the people of Potts Point would&#34; enjoy. That makes it all the worse. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> that the Commonwealth ought not to permit the Governor-General to take a dole, for that is just what it means, from the Treasurer of any State. It is practically putting the Governor-General in the position of a pauper. The assumption is that the Commonwealth cannot afford to maintain the Governor-General in proper style, and therefore the State Government is to be called upon to contribute sums in aid. That is derogatory both to the Commonwealth and the Governor-General, and should be put a stop to as soon as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> gave as a reason why the Governor-General should have two residences that State Governors have two residences. But, if the States are guilty of extravagance, it is all the more reason why we should set them a good example. In :he early days, when the salaries of the Governors were fixed, and the residences which they occupied were built, extravagance was the order of the day, and luxurious living was the general custom amongst certain sections of society. But we are now living in a time when economy is on all men&#39;s lips, if it is not in their minds. It is agreed on all hands that a simpler method of living should be the rule of life, not only for Governors, but for all the well-to-do classes of society. That being the ease, we may very well restrict our Governor-General to that extremely handsome residence which is provided for him by the Commonwealth Government in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> and a section of the Victorian people are continually howling for economy. They object when we propose to raise a public servant&#39;s salary from &#163;90 to &#163;110 a year. They say that the Commonwealth is going to fall into a heap of ruins when we propose to deal fairly and squarely with the humbler workers. But when we come forward with a proposition to limit what &#39;I believe to be an unnecessary expense, the honorable senator is horror stricken. &#39; That is a sample of our &#39; Ky yabramites &#34; The policy of the Kyabramites all through has been to give every assistance in spending so far as luxuries ave concerned, but to apply the pruning knife to the necessaries of life. That may be the principle which governs the honorable senator and his associates, but I can&#39; assure him that those who sit in this corner are animated by quite a different idea. </para>

                        <para>- In the minds of some men that is an unnecessary expenditure, but we are not discussing that question, or I might have some remarks to make. We have two objects, I repeat, in cutting away unnecessary expenditure. We save money by abolishing unnecessary officials, and with the money so saved we are able to give better remuneration to those officials who are necessary, but who occupy, in my honorable friend&#39;s opinion, probably, a very humble position in the Commonwealth or State economy. That is our policy, shortly stated. The third paragraph of the motion reads as follows : - </para>

                <para class="block">I have never been able to discover yet what services the Governor-General performs which require such a handsome payment as &#163;10,000 a year. Speaking without reference to the individual, in my opinion the office is altogether unnecessary. The holder performs no useful function in the government of the Commonwealth, and yet in salary and allowances he gets &#163;2,000 more per annum than is paid to all the &#39; senators on these benches, who possess such great influence, and who are charged with such a serious responsibility in the conduct of the affairs of the Commonwealth. Just contrast one position with the other. One useless office swallows up &#163;16,000 per annum, while 36 senators, elected by, and responsible to, the people of the Commonwealth, and charged with .a certain amount of responsibility for the management of its affairs, receive only &#163;14,000 per annum amongst them, less income tax. </para>

It has had a succession of men, I believe the most illustrious in history, occupying the position of chief citizen. It has produced the men. Its people have taken a pride in the selection of their President. I believe the very fact that the chief office in the gift of the nation was open to every citizen has helped to raise the people as a whole. </para>

I believe that if the Governor-General were chosen by the people of Australia, the office would become an object of ambition to our young people, and it would tend very much to improve the tone of our public life. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> spoke somewhat disrespectfully of the public men who were mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> I believe that, if they were compared as individuals with those who have held a viceregal position in the States, and even in the Commonwealth, they would not lose anything by the comparison. On the whole, I would recommend the motion to the favorable consideration of honorable senators. It breathes economy and patriotism, and these are the two things which I think are required in Australia more than anything else at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- As it would involve a complete divergence from the terms of the motion, I propose to keep myself in order by not discussing that question \ but I shall be quite prepared, if the honorable senator will afford nae an opportunity at some other time, to discuss it fully. It is not a subject which should be dealt with lightly in response to an interjection. Those who have sought to justify the maintenance of two Government-houses have been forced, by paucity of argument in its support, to quote the fact that in each State the Governor has had a residence in the capital at the coast, and a summer residence in the hills. There is no analogy between that situation and the maintenance of residences in Melbourne and Sydney for the Governor - General. Neither palace is in any sense suitable for summer occupation, and the whole object in providing a Governor with two residences has been that during the summer when residence in the capital was absolutely unbearable, he could go to the hills and enjoy a peaceful quiet time in cool fresh air. If a proposal, based on that logical suggestion, had been made, and it had been pointed out that the Governor-General could reside in some high place in New South Wales, or at Mount Lofty in South Australia, or at any other places where Governors have been accustomed to live, I should have thought it most reasonable ; but it has never been made. The proposal that we should spend money in keeping up two Government-houses, was brought forward unhappily as a sop to Victoria and New South Wales. I do not propose to go into the question whether both States were entitled to a Federal Government-house, but both States made the claim, and, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake&#39;s</inline> word&#39;s, &#34; a compromise was arranged.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable and learned senator&#39;s explanation. From the first day on which the Federal Parliament met, we have been anxious to know how it arose that two Government-houses were grafted on to the Constitution, and we have never been able, in the Senate at any rate, to obtain any explanation of how this additional expense was thrown upon the country. I desire to make quite clear my reasons for supporting the amendment. We must consider what will be the logical outcome of the present position of affairs. It will be that, as soon as under the Constitution we have established our capital in our own territory, we shall be face to face with the fact that each of these States will demand a Government-house in its capital aswell. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> shakes his head, but,. I venture to say that, so surely as I am standing on this spot at this moment, we shall find that such a claim will be put forward, and on exactly the same grounds as have been advanced in support of the claim in the past. What will then be our position? We shall be saddled not only with the cost of maintaining a Government-house in Melbourne and Sydney, but with the cost of maintaining a. Government-house at the Federal capital. The same reasons will be given, the same eloquence will be aired, and we shall be told, as we have been told, that an analogy exists between the trips which the Governor-General will make to the other States and the fact that he resides in New South Wales. In connexion with these trips, the fact is that having two Government-houses is one of the chief obstacles, arising to prevent the Governor-General making these trips. He spends his time partly in Sydney and partly in Melbourne. I believe the present Governor-General&#39; spends part of his time in South Australia -r but, so far as I know, none of the other States have received a visit from him, because, during his spare time in the recess, has been living in New South Wales. I do not propose to discuss paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the motion at length. Personally, I think that if a State Government chooses to place a Government-house at the disposal of the Governor-General there can be no possible objection to the adoption of such a course. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> told us that the Parliament of New South Wales was prepared to provide &#163;3,500 for the maintenance of Government-house at Sydney, but the honorable senator quite forgot to carry the position a little further, and point out that it was contingent upon the other States providing a further &#163;6,500 towards the same expenditure. </para>

It was distinctly in that connexion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will find it -so stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, when the right honorable gentleman introduced the Bill to provide for Victoria&#39;s quota in the Victorian State Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner distinctly said that this further -expenditure arose from the fact that, through some undisclosed means, an arrangement had been made that a second Government-house should be kept up for the Governor-General. I am quoting only in general terms, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> chooses to refer to the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he will find the remarks to which I refer set out in full. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators may rely upon the fact that I am quite right, because I took particular pains on a previous occasion to look up this matter. I think that every State is entitled to place a Government-house at&#39; the disposal of the Governor-General in order that he may visit and gain a general knowledge of all the States, which it must be admitted on every side he should obtain. It is only by so doing, or by placing an unfair tax upon State Governors, that the Governor-General can acquire that knowledge. I cannot, therefore, support the second paragraph of the motion, nor can I support paragraphs 3 and 4. I do not think that a salary of &#163;10,000 is as much as the Governor-General requires to have placed at his disposal. I believe that the experience of the States has proved that. The fact that we have found ourselves obliged by a vote of Parliament to provide extra money for the maintenance of these official residences of the Governor-General is the very best proof that thi3 is the opinion of the majority as well as my own. </para>

                        <para>- I did not understand that to be the honorable senator&#39;s intention in moving the motion. The matter was fully debated in the Senate and in another place, and while it was decided that the salary should be &#163;10,000 a year, the outcome of the discussion was the passing of a Bill by both Houses of the Federal Parliament limiting the expenditure upon the establishment of the Governor-General to &#163;6,000, in addition to the constitutional salary. I do not think there is a disposition on the part of any honorable senator to object to that amount being voted for the upkeep of the Governor-General&#39;s establishment. I do not feel inclined to object to it, but I am quite of the opinion that the first paragraph of the motion is in accord with the feeling of the vast majority of the people of Australia. I think we cannot do better in considering this question than rely upon the Constitution, which clearly lays it down that the seat of government of the Commonwealth shall be in Melbourne until such time as the Federal capital is established. </para>

                            is only splitting straws, because he knows that, to all intents and purposes, the place where Parliament meets is for the time being the seat of government. I do not think that the Constitution contemplated for a moment that there should be two establishments kept up for the Governor-General. . I must admit that the Minister for Defence puts rather a different aspect upon the question when he shows that the cost to the Commonwealth is not increased. If I understood the honorable and learned senator aright, he showed that out of &#163;6,015 the cost of the establishment, &#163;3,515 was spent in Melbourne and &#163;2,500 in Sydney, and in answer to an interjection the Minister for Defence also assured the Senate that the cost was not any greater than it would have been if the Governor-General had spent all his time in Victoria.

                        <para>- I accept what the Minister has said, and I can have no objection to the Governor-General spending a certain time in Sydney when. that involves no additional cost to the Commonwealth. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has given the Senate that assurance, I scarcely feel inclined to vote for the motion. With the proposal contained in paragraph 4 I am entirely in accord. I am one who believes that the day- will come, and I hope it is not far distant, when some Australian statesman who has served his country faithfully will be chosen for the distinguished position of Governor-General. The objection of the Minister for Defence to this proposal is that it might give rise to&#62; jealousy as between State and State ; but in adopting this part of the motion we should only be following the long-established usage in America, where I do not know that any great jealousy is caused. </para>

                    <para class="block">Those who were present when this subject was previously under consideration will recollect that the general opinion was that it was too bad to keep members of the House of Representatives standing in the gangway, and other inconvenient places, like poor relations at some squire&#39;s banquet.. There was a general opinion that it would lead to greater harmony amongst members of the two Chambers if, at the opening of Parliament, they sat together in this Chamber. I agree that on the last occasion it was not within the province of the President to direct members of the Senate to give up their places to members of the House of Representatives ; but, inasmuch as there are 36 members of the Senate, and there is ample room in this Chamber for 70 or80 people, and as some members of the House of Representatives certainly took exception to having to stand outside, a provision might be agreed to for the purpose of providing them with better accommodation . </para>

It appears to me that the latter refers to the second part of the former, and not to the whole of it. Take a case to which the first part of the standing order applies. The Senate did not adjourn when the Parliament was opened this session, but went on with business. If the standing order is not altered, and it is followed by Standing Orders 3 and 4 in their present form, it will become necessary for the Senate to adjourn whether there is a President or whether there is not a President. The third standing order might be made paragraph (g) of the previous one, but then the fourth standing order says - </para>

                        <para>- It is usual for the Parliament to meet at twelve o&#39;clock, and to go through the preliminaries, and then to meet again at two o&#39;clock, when His Excellency attends and delivers his speech. I do not know that there is any very great reason why we should adjourn, but it will probably be convenient to meet at twelve o&#39;clock, adjourn for luncheon, and meet again when His Excellency comes to open the Parliament. The standing orders are not intended to alter the practice in any way. </para>

                        that the Parliament was usually opened by the Governor-General at half-past two o&#39;clock, but I find that this session was opened at noon. The journals of the Senate for the 26th May state that at noon the Clerk of the Parliament read the Proclamation ; that the Parliament was opened by the Governor-General ; that His Excellency and the members of the other House retired ; that the President read prayers, and reported that two vacancies had occurred in the recess ; that a reference was made to a late senator ; that a Bill was introduced

                        that petitions were presented, that it was announced that new senators had been chosen; and finally it was ordered that the Senate, at its rising, should adjourn until half-past two o&#39;clock next day. It was all done at one sitting, lasting from noon until one o&#39;clock. This standing order provides for a different practice. It says that where there is a  President  the Senate is to adjourn, and  His Excellency  to arrive at the next meeting ; but if there is no  President  the Senate is to elect a  President  and adjourn, and that at the next meeting the Governor-General is to arrive and the other proceedings are to go on. The standing orders as they read would make it compulsory on the part of the Senate to adjourn after the  President  had taken the chair, the  Clerk  had read the proclamation, and the writs of election had been laid on the table. At the present moment I cannot see exactly how the inconsistency with our practice should be cured.

                        BAKER (South Australia). - I think it my duty to point out to the Committee that this standing order involves a departure from our present practice. Our present practice is that a matter may be reconsidered in the same Committee without a report. That practice has its advantages, but it also has great disadvantages. One advantage is that on the same evening those who have a majority can reverse decisions formerly arrived at ; but one great inconvenience and unfairness involved is that no notice is given to honorable senators present that it is proposed to reverse decisions which the Committee has already arrived at. It was that unfairness which led the Standing Orders Committee to propose this standing order as it now stands.

                            <para>- The whole of these Standing Orders, from 242 to 250,. deal with the practice in regard to requests. It is a matter for very serious consideration whether it is necessary to have all these standing orders, Or whether it might not be necessary to have only Standing Order 248 providing for the proceedings in Committee on the Bill. We are dealing here with an entirely new power given to us under Section 53 of the Constitution. That section gives the Senate power at any stage to return to the House of Representatives any proposed law, and the section leaves the hands of the Senate perfectly free to deal with the Bill at any stage whatever, and wherever it becomes necessary to carry a request it maybe carried and sent down to the other House. It appears to me, that as the object of this section of the Constitution is to bring about agreement between the two Houses - and we never know the matter about which a dispute may arise, or the time or circumstances in which it may be necessary to put this section into force - if we adopt these standing orders they will tie our hands very much, and perhaps at a time when for the solution of the difficulty between the two Houses, it may be necessary that the hands of the Senate should be quite free. There is only one set of circumstances in which the ordinary rules regarding the amendment of Bills in Committee cannot apply, and that is in regard to the way in which the clauses are put. It appears to me that if we provide that in regard to these Bills, they shall be treated exactly as other Bills in every respect, with the exception of the putting of the clauses to the Committee, that will be all that is necessary. The Chairman of Committees will, no doubt, remember that in the earlier stages of the first session there was some difficulty about the putting of questions in Committee on these Bills. If in some instances the Chairman put the question to the Committee in the ordinary way - &#34;That the clause stand as printed,&#34; and that question were carried in the negative, we should have amended a Bill which we could not amend under the Constitution. The only way in which the clauses of such a Bill can be put is that provided by Standing Order 248, which adopts the practice we have been following. The clause of a Bill is not put definitely to the vote. The Committee is asked if there are any requests, and if there are none the clause is declared passed, whilst if there are requests they are carried or not as the case may be, and the Committee acts accordingly. I, therefore, suggest that we should not pass any of these standing orders up to Standing Order 248. The standing order to which I particularly object is 246, which provides - </para>

                            BAKER (South Australia). - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has stated, what he is perfectly right in stating, that if we pass these standing orders concerning Bills which the Senate may not amend we shall tie the hands of the Senate. But that is true of the whole of our standing orders. If the honorable and learned senator&#39;s argument is a sound one, we should not have any standing orders at all. The object of standing orders is to provide for the procedure in ordinary cases, so as to prevent unnecessary discussion, and to insure convenience in the general conduct of business. If the necessity arises, the standing orders can always be suspended, and they often are suspended when an emergency occurs. I can see no soundness in the argument advanced by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor.</inline>
                            If it is correct it should be carried still further, and we should say as to other Bills which the Senate may amend, that the whole of our standing orders tie us down to certain procedure ; and if we desire to be absolutely free and unfettered we should have no standing orders laying down the procedure with reference to otherBills.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline>
                            says that the proceedings on Bills which the Senate may not amend are the same as on other Bills, except as to the way in which the clauses are put to the Committee. The honorable and learned senator has overlooked the fact that in the case of Bills which we may amend, and do amend, we finally pass the Bill. The report of the Committee upon the Bill is adopted, we pass the third reading of the measure, and we send the Bill down to the House of Representatives. So that in those cases the Bill passes its third reading in both Houses, subject to agreement on certain amendments. But in the case of Bills which we may not amend, but upon which we may make requests, we do not pass the third reading in the Senate. We do not take the Bill out of Committee. We simply make a report, send down a request to the House of Representatives, and when a Message is sent to us in answer to our Message we go back into Committee on the Bill. There is a difference there in our method of procedure which I think
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline>
                            has overlooked.

                            <para>- Where we amended a Bill, and also made a request, I admit that there was an exception. I am dealing now, and these standing orders deal, with Bills which we may not amend at all, and we have not passed the third reading of such Bills until the two Houses are in agreement. We have always left those Bills in Committee when a request has been made by the Senate. That is the practice in South Australia, and the practice which has been adopted here Whether we pass these standing orders as they appear, or adopt the suggestion of the &#34;Vice-President of the Executive Council, is only a matter of convenience, and of what is the best method to adopt. I call the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the last report of the Standing Orders Committee. The Committee felt that a good many members of the Senate thought they ought to make some effort to come into accord with the House of Representatives. We made that effort, and the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate authorized me to write a letter to the Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives. I wrote a letter which set forth Standing Orders 246 and 248. We received a reply from the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives, in which, if they did not agree to what we proposed, they at all events made no objection. Having told them that we proposed to do a certain thing, and they having made no objection, I do not say that we are now absolutely bound, but there seems to me to be some sort of obligation upon us to keep faith with them by doing what we told them we proposed to do. </para>

                            <para>- There is no obligation perhaps ; but, on the score of peace and harmony at alf events, having informed the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives that we intended to adopt a certain course, and they having made no objection, will it not be conducive to a good understanding if we now follow the course which we told them we proposed to adopt ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> asks why we should bind ourselves not to ask for a free conference until three Messages have passed between the Houses. The reason the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate adopted that provision is that it embodies the practice in connexion with ordinary Bills. In connexion with those Bills three communications are provided for between the Houses, and if they cannot agree on the third communication, a conference is asked for. Of course we bind ourselves by these standing orders, but we do not bind our- &#39; selves any more than we do in connexion with ordinary Bills. Why should we make a distinction and a difference by holding ourselves absolutely free in one case and not in another ? I do not see that there is any principle involved in the matter. I do not see that there is any principle involved in any of these standing orders. The question is merely one of convenience, and honorable senators must recollect that the same power which makes these standing orders can alter them if it is shown that there is any necessity for an alteration. We can make or amend our standing orders without interference from any other power. I do not feel strongly upon the matter, but I have thought it well to put the opposite side to that which has been put to the Committee by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

The Committee pretty well agreed that there ought to be finality, and that it would not be conducive to the speedy transaction of public business if there was an impression in the minds of members of both Houses that they could keep throwing a Bill from House to House for an indefinite period. </para>

                            <para>- Or ask for a free conference. I think we are almost bound to pass the proposed standing order. When these particular standing orders in reference to Money Bills came before the Senate, members urged that they should not be passed until some understanding had been arrived at with the Standing Orders Committee of another place. Some members of the House of Representatives, when the Tariff Bill was under discussion, declined to agree that we had the right to send a Bill down a second time. The resolution that was carried by the House of Representatives in reference to our second series of requests was to the effect that that House refrained from exercising its constitutional rights in the interests of public business. There were some members of the Government who denied the right which the Senate claimed to send a Bill back at any stage. The President has told us that in response to the wishes expressed during the discussion, he wrote to the Standing Orders Committee of the other Chamber in these terms - </para>

                    <para class="block">Is that not- a striking admission? The Standing Orders Committee of this Chamber approached the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives, and asked if the latter had any objection to the two standing orders we proposed to adopt in regard to Money Bills, suggesting that, if there was any objection, there should be a free conference. The reply came that there was nothing to object to, and that in the opinion of the Standing Orders Committee in another place no conference was necessary. Does that not strengthen the hands of this &#39; Chamber ? &#34;Will it not strengthen our hands at some future time when we send our requests down, as we think, and as another place has already agreed, we are entitled to do. But if we do not have these standing orders, of what use will be the admission I have read ? </para>

                            <para>- It shows, to my mind, that if ever our right is challenged to send a Bill down at any stage within reason, we shall have a great advantage. When honorable members, who object to our right, go before the public and urge the absurdity of the Senate returning a Bill time after time, even, as some of them put it, up to 100 times, we may urge that the Senate has no desire to be unreasonable. It can be pointed out that on behalf of the Senate a letter was written to the Standing Orders Committee of another place suggesting that there should be three exchanges, and that a reply was received stating that there was no objection to such a course. Do honorable senators not see that this places us in a much stronger position before the public ? </para>

Honorable senators will readily see that a crisis may occur on a minor question, as it might have occurred in connexion with the Sugar Bounty Bill. That in itself was a small question, but the constitutional aspect was large. It would not do for us to appear before the public as merely endeavouring to strengthen our position as a Senate, and contending for a right to send a Bill back as often as we liked regardless of the merits of the proposal. </para>

                            <para>- I know that the standing orders can be suspended at any time. If it be thought that a Bill is of such a comprehensive character that the amendments we propose cannot be considered within three exchanges, there is no doubt that the standing orders might be suspended. But, for the purposes of ordinary business, it is well to have-standing orders of the kind. Members ought to be given an idea that they must try to make up their minds that there is a limit to the number of exchanges. I submit that if there is to be an unlimited number of exchanges, it will not lead to the speedy transaction of business. </para>

                        <para>- While I do not attach very much importance to* standing orders 242, 243, 244, and 245, I agree with the President that it would be advisable as a matter of convenience to have them before us, so that we may know exactly the immediate procedure we are to follow in regard to the particular class of Bills we may not amend. The proceedings on such Bills are embodied in Standing Orders 242 to 250, and the kernel is in Standing Order 246, which provides that a Bill may be sent three times back by the Senate to the House of Representatives, and three times returned by that House. When the matter was before us previously, a number of honorable senators thought that we should stultify ourselves by attempting to limit ourselves in this way, or to prescribe something which involves practically reciprocity. It was then intimated that it would be desirable for a Standing Orders Committee to communicate with the Standing Orders Committee of the other Chamber on the subject, for the purpose of securing if possible some joint standing orders, or of arriving at some understanding, so that we should have no difficulty hereafter in the working of a standing orders of the kind. The Standing Orders Committee of this Chamber did communicate with the Standing Orders Committee of another place, but I must say, that in my opinion, we are exactly in the same position that we were in before. The Standing Orders Committee of another place thank us for our courtesy, but at the same time they practically say - &#34; You do your business and we will do ours ; so far as the standing orders of the House of Representatives are concerned, there is nothing inconsistent.&#34; Probably there is nothing inconsistent, because the other place does not deal with contingencies of the kind. The only time they did deal with such a contingency, they protected . themselves by a resolution, and consequently, as we have been unable to arrive at definite joint standing orders on the subject, I do not think that the Senate need have any qualms as to how it should act, or any fear that it may be doing wrong, because they happen to have been transmitted to the committee of the House of Representatives, in now departing from these particular standing orders. The Standing Orders Committee of the Senate cannot for one moment bind this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- But the other place may not return the Bill three times. Surely it would be wiser for the Senate to leave itself completely free, and regulate its proceedings as the cases arise. It might be necessary to send a Bill once or twice, or even four or five times. I have no hesitation in saying that the Senate has established its right to repeat its requests, and Standing Order 249 provides that a request may be pressed - which means repeated - or not pressed. We have complete freedom, and I think t&#34;hat, as a matter of discretion, it would be unwise for us to attempt to bind ourselves to any number of times. It would be unwise to do so on the ground, first of all, that it is unnecessary, and secondly, that in order to make the standing order effective, it requires reciprocity, or, in short, joint standing orders. </para>

                        <para>- The Chairman has anticipated a good deal of what I intended to say, but I rise to draw attention to the singular harmony between Senators Baker and Higgs on this point. There is an assumption that seems to be totally unwarranted that there is an obligation imposed on the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate or the Standing Orders Committee of another place by the submission of standing orders to one Committee or the other. To put the matter in simple language, it appears that we are trying to make a bargain which would be bad if we succeeded, and about the success of which there is a certain amount of doubt. As already pointed out, there is no means whatever by which the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives can bind the Senate. We should be attempting to tie our own hands without knowing whether the hands of the other House were to be tied also. I see no reason for limiting our right to press tin amendment to three times. I do not think that by any possible standing order we could strengthen the position we acquired in reference to the Tariff. Indeed, by any standing order which could be framed, and which must necessarily be in the nature of a limitation, we should weaken our position. I quite agree with what the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said. I see no reason for having standing orders dealing with Money Bills, except possibly Standing Orders 248 and 249. I feel perfectly certain that if we pass Standing Order 246 we shall be deliberately and foolishly imposing a restriction on the Senate that the House of Representatives cannot impose, and should be tying our own hands, neither for the purpose of expediting business nor for any other reason that could be satisfactory to us. It is always open to the Senate to obtain a conference even without a standing order. We need not sa)&#39; whether we shall demand a conference -after sending three messages. We might ask for a conference after sending only one message. To limit our right to ask for a conference until three messages had been sent must be bad for lis. I therefore urge the Committee not to go back upon the position we have previously asserted, and which I hope we shall always maintain. </para>

                        <para>- Upon this question I have always been of opinion that the proper thing is to have joint standing orders. We shall then know what our rights are, and what the other House is prepared to do. We know how the machinery of the Constitution will work, but if we are going to tie our -hands by a standing order, and we subsequently find- that the other House does not agree with us, and trouble arises, we shall be a great deal worse off than would be the case if we had n&#169; standing order dealing with the subject. Under the circumstances, the idea of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> to omit this standing order will be the wisest procedure we can adopt. Do not let us tie our hands unless the hands of the other House are tied also. Let us know exactly what we are doing. It is admitted that these standing orders necessarily tie -our hands. Therefore, if no -proper understanding can be arranged with the other branch of the Legislature, let us have no standing order dealing with the subject. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree with the last speaker. It would be a silly thing for the Senate to provide, by a standing order, that we should be obliged to send three messages before being able to ask for a free conference. Such an arrangement would work greatly to our disadvantage. We should tie ourselves up without any necessity, and the standing order would militate against us. We ought to retain the right to send back a Bill more than three times if we think proper, and we should be able, to ask for a conference at any time when the necessity for it arises. </para>

                        BAKER (South Australia). - It is all very well to talk about joint standing orders, but there is not the slightest possibility of having them. I should be the very last person to seek in any way to tie the hands of the Senate unduly. I thought that in framing the standing order under discussion we were strengthening .the position of the Senate, because it was an intimation to the other branch of the Legislature that we would send three messages before we asked for a conference. Is it not more courteous and fairer to the other branch of the Legislature to indicate to them what course of procedure we will ordinarily adopt, and how many messages we will send to them before asking for a free conference

                        Is not that course of procedure more likely to lead to harmony, and to results that will not produce friction between the two Houses, than will be the case by leaving the procedure entirely open ?

At the same time I can see that there are strong arguments on the other side. I am not going to fight the matter. I am not very strong about it. I want to arrive at some <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> with the other branch of the Legislature as to the procedure we should adopt, and I think that they ought also to let us know what course of procedure they intend to adopt upon Money Bills. I think that this course holds out the olive branch to them by saying that we will send them three messages and then ask for a conference. If we leave the matter entirely open, measures might often be lost which would not otherwise be lost. I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council ought to consider the matter a little more before he arrives at a conclusion. The subject has been discussed by the Standing Orders Committee four or five times. They have considered it from all points of view, and the conclusion arrived at was that we ought to let the House of Representatives know what course of procedure we intended to adopt. </para>

                            <para>- I have not arrived at the conclusion which I have come to without much consideration. Perhaps I have not considered it as long as some other honorable senators have done, but I feel a sense of responsibility in the making of these standing orders just as any other honorable senator does. They do not affect party considerations. We ought to do the best we can to make the proceedings of the Senate work smoothly. If there is one view that ought to be present with us, in dealing with the standing orders, it is so to frame them that in time to come we shall not bind our hands unduly in any constitutional contest which we may have with the other House. This question of requests is likely to be the most fruitful battle-ground for contests between the two Houses - the ground upon which we shall exercise our greatest power, and upon which the House of Representatives will struggle to retain as much power as they can. Under these circumstances, we ought to be careful not to limit the power which the Constitution gives us. In addition to that, we should leave ourselves free to take advantage of the circumstances of the moment, which may enable us to send down a message for a conference, and which may put us in a better position than we should be in by sending down messages three times. . I doubt very much whether it is competent for us under the Constitution to make a standing order restricting us to three messages, and to sending back a Bill three times, and which will deprive us of the right of sending a request down to the House of Representatives after the third message has been despatched.

                            <para>- But the Constitution must be read as a whole ; and if the Constitution says that we may send down a request at any stage, and a standing order restricts the sending down of requests to three times, it seems to me that that standing order is in conflict with the Constitution. I was at first inclined to think that there was something to be said for the standing order, but, after looking over the correspondence which has taken place with, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, I was compelled to reconsider the position.. This correspondence gives us nothing whatever. It settles nothing. Let me call attention to what the correspondence really is. I admit at once, that if by any amicable arrangement joint standing orders could be arrived at between the two Houses, that would be &#34; a consummation devoutly to bewished.&#34; But is it likely that upon this most debatable of all questions, the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives is likely to give way any point which is likely to affect the privileges of their House? It is not at all likely. Let honorable senators look at the correspondence. The President&#39;s letter sends, down a copy of this standing order, and requests that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will bring this under the notice of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives for their consideration at an early date. </para>

                    <para class="block">If honorable senators look at the standing order they will see that it is not in conflict with our standing order, because it deals with quite a different thing. It does not deal with the position we are discussing. It is as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Whenever the Senate returns to the House any Bill which the Senate may not amend, requesting,. by message, the omission or amendment of any item or provision therein, the House shall thereupon, or on a later clay to be fixed, resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole, to consider the message, and the subsequent proceedings shall be as follow : - </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Then the subsequent proceedings follow. That is applicable to a Bill sent down once, and once only. It may also be applicable to every time when a Bill is sent down. But it does not in any way affect our right to send down messages three times. Even if there is anything in that, how can the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate in this or in any way bind the other House to surrender anything it thinks to be a privilege? It is impossible to suppose that it could be done. Therefore it appears to me that, although this correspondence was courteous, and exhibited the most friendly disposition towards the Senate, it gave us absolutely nothing. Is there, then, anything in the correspondence which binds the Senate now to pass a standing order which really ties our hands in the future ? There is another point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has dealt with, and which involves this question : Is it better to pass a Bill through its third reading and send down a request, or is it better to suspend the third reading and send the Bill down, waiting until the request is made, before reading the Bill a third third time ? I do not care which course is adopted. The advantage of reading a Bill a third time before sending down a request is this - that if the request is agreed to, and the Bill is amended accordingly, it need not come back to the Senate at all. The Bill is forthwith amended, and becomes a law then, and all that that House has to do is to send a message to the Senate saying it has amended the Bill in accordance with its request. It seems to me that it may be an advantage in saving time, On the other hand it may be advisable not to take the Bill out of Committee in order that we may be able to do what we like before it is read a third time. In these circumstances it might be advisable to follow the practice which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has suggested. I do not think it is a matter of much moment one way or the other, but if that practice is to be followed then all we need to do is to omit Standing Orders 246 and 247. </para>

There was a preponderance of opinion expressed against these standing orders, and their consideration was postponed with a view to affording the Standing Orders Committee an opportunity, either to alter them substantially, or to suggest their omission.

                        <para>- I do not intend to divide the Committee or to fight the question, but I wish to inform honorable senators that I do not agree with the proposed standing order. There is no doubt that there is a great deal to be_ said in its favour, and that it will save the President and the Chairman of Committees considerable trouble if it is adopted. But, working under a new Constitution, I think that we ought to have our own practice and procedure. The British House of Commons consists of about 680 members, while the Senate consists of 36 members. I can assure honorable senators that in adopting the standing orders they are adopting a great number of practices of which they know nothing. It is quite true that it finds a place in our present rules ; but I recognised the fact that they were adopted in a hurry, and I have not put them strictly in force. For instance, in the House of Commons a member is not allowed to read a newspaper or a book in the chamber. There are dozens of other practices of which honorable senators know nothing, and which they are adopting in the dark. There is another reason why we should not adopt the standing order. So long as it is in force we can never establish a-practice of our own. We have our own standing orders it is true, and so far as they provide for cases we are bound by them, but in minor matters we can never build up a practice of Our own. A considerable time ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Ayers was President of the Legislative Council of South Australia, I called his attention to the practice of the Chamber for years on some small matter. He said - &#34; I cannot help that. Our practice goes for nothing. We have a standing order which says that in cases not provided for the practice of the British House of Commons shall prevail, and we cannot build up a practice of our own.&#34; That I think is an objectionable state of affairs. However, I was in a minority on the Standing Orders Committee, and I make these remarks simply by way of&#34; protest. </para>

                        <para>- I agree entirely witH the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker.</inline> The standing orders of the House of Commons represent the persistent aggression of the people on the Lords.. Our Constitution represents exactly the opposite - the determination of the States, not to submit altogether to the domination of the people as a whole. One is the protest of the people against the domination of a class, and the other is the protest of the States against the domination of the people, speaking as a whole. </para>

                            <para>- Therefore its standing orders are uncommonly good for what they were intended. When we framed the Constitution we provided that, the Senate should not be in the position of &#39; the House of Lords. We determined that there should be a States House, which should have&#39; an individuality of its own. &#39; And it follows from the care which we took in protecting its constitution that it ought to- have rules which would insure its continuance and prevent it being submerged, as the Lords are submerged, in the dominance of the Commons, which is secured by its standing orders. Are we going &#39; to follow the standing orders of the House of Commons and allow a similar dominance to prevail? Those who do not appreciate the distinction between the Senate and the House of Lords and the other. House and the House of Commons, will thoroughly disagree with what I am saying. But those who realise that we have to preserve our States House under circumstances quite different from anything contemplated by the British Constitution will understand that the standing orders of the House of Commons, however applicable in many instances, are not of necessity applicable to the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- Although the argument may have been heard a hundred times, still there are some persons who do not quite understand that the Houses of this Parliament are not in the same position as the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly of a State. In connexion with a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, it was perfectly right that we should provide that where anything occurred which was not covered by our standing orders the rules of the House of Commons should prevail. We departed from that in the express instances which were set out in our standing orders, and we returned to that whenever our standing orders were&#39; silent. That was a logical and a proper result of the Constitution we established. But when we made a new Constitution, unknown altogether to British institutions, in which we followed other standards, and particularly the American standard, we got new lines of legislation. We established a Senate, and meant to establish it in quite a different position from either the House of Lords or any Legislative Council. We meant the Senate to take a much higher position and we gave it much&#39; higher and stronger powers than any House of Lords or any Legislative Council has ever had in the history of legislative bodies. . Then when we come to make standing orders for that Senate we provide for everything within the immediate scope of our vision as well as we can. Of course there is a residuum unprovided for, and what are we to do for that ? Now, it is suggested that whilst the Senate is a. distinct departure from the House of Lords,, or a Legislative Council, so far as the unforeseen or unprovided for is concerned, we should adopt the standing orders of a body that is absolutely dissimilar to ours, and1 that we shall put ourselves in a position which is quite inconsistent with the very basis of our Constitution. We should seriously and studiously consider and settle the rights of the Senate, and to begin by saying that our position is to be analogous to that of a House whose constitution is such that it is the very essence of our existence that we have distinctly departed from it, may have the effect of minimizing our rights in the particular instances in which we may be most concerned in insisting upon them. The matter is one for very careful consideration, and at the present moment I am disposed to agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Committee will act very wisely in adopting the recommendations of the Standing OrdersCommittee. If I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer&#39;s</inline> argument, the honorable and learned senator would imply, first of all, that the adoption of the rules of the dominant House is going to weaken the Senate, and, secondly, the honorable and learned senator would have us suppose that there is no analogy between our Constitution - sofar as the practice of Parliament is concerned and local Constitutions. Let us look at the facts. First of all, since ever we have had a Constitution, we have been working under standing orders which have been used for 30 or 35 years past by one of the State Houses of Parliament, the House of Assembly of South Australia. If honorable senators will look at the proposed standing orders now before us as they have been framed, they will find that, with the exception of a number which could perhaps be told off on the fingers of one hand, they are adopted from the practice of local Legislatures. This conclusively satisfies me, as I think it must satisfy every honorable senator who will think of what the practice has been in this Senate, and the complete analogy between it and the practice of the House from which he has come, that it is substantially founded on the practice of the House of Commons, as adopted and carried out by the practice of the local Legislatures, so far as that practice could be carried out, <inline font-style="italic">mutatis mutandis.</inline> When we come to look at the Constitution itself we shall find that it recognises all the great principles of the British Constitution. In section 49 of the Constitution it is provided - </para>

                    <para class="block">So far as our powers, privileges, and immunities are not provided for by the Constitution, we have adopted those of the House of Commons, and so it is with regard to forms and practices of the House of Commons, to which we are all accustomed, and. which we have been accustomed to work under in our local Legislatures, and since we have been a Federal Parliament. When we bear in mind that this practice and this particular standing order has been introduced into the standing orders of every local Legislature, and that we have at the same time adopted the same authorities and precedents for our guidance where we do not directly speak for ourselves, I think it will be admitted that it would be very unwise for the Senate to fail to take advantage of all those authorities and that practice which has been so well. known, which has been so thoroughly established, and to which we have become so accustomed. If at any time we find that certain matters have not been provided for in our own standing orders, and that the practice of the House of Commons is inconvenient for their settlement, we have a clear duty to adopt new standing orders to deal with them. I think that under all the circumstances the Committee would be very wise in adopting this standing order. . </para>

                        <para>- My honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> puts me in mind of the gentleman who under all circumstances would drag King&#34; Charles&#39; head into a discussion. The honorable and learned senator always manages to drag in the constitutional .aspect of a question, but that aspect does not happen to come in on the present occasion. The point we are considering is an exceedingly simple one. We are passing standing orders for our own guidance, and the conduct of the business of the Senate. We may not in these standing orders provide for every contingency that may arise, and we say that, in those cases in which we have made no provision, when the contingency does arise we shall be governed by the practice of the British Parliament. If there is a Parliament in the world to which we can look up as the mother of Parliaments, it is the British Parliament. There are wise rules laid down by that Parliament, not in standing orders only, and not to be found in formal print, but to be found in the various decisions given by the various eminent men who have occupied the position of Speaker of the House of Commons. When we find that we have made no provision in our standing orders to meet any special emergency which may arise, we can turn to what has been done in the British House of Commons, to the decisions of its various Speakers, and we shall find rules eminently adapted to meet the case arising. We have done that in South Australia ever since we have had responsible government in that State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> has himself been Premier there ; he has led the House of Assembly ; he has been a prominent member of the Legislature for many years, and the honorable and learned senator cannot instance a single case in which the slightest trouble ever occurred from the adoption of this course. Speakers of the South Australian House of Assembly have constantly appealed to the practice of the House of Commons. The  Clerk  of Parliaments in that State, had a very complete knowledge of the practice of the House of Commons, and he could always advise a  Speaker  when a difficulty arose. He was always ready with the decisions of Speakers Peel, Brand, Onslow, or some other  Speaker  of the House of Commons. If we provide for that here, a decision of a  Speaker  of the House of Commons upon a difficult point will settle the question, and I see no reason why we should not pass the same standing order which has been adopted in the South Australian Parliament, and I suppose in the Parliaments of all the States, and which has been, found to work so satisfactorily in the past. </para>

                        <para>- One would almost imagine from the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> that the honorable senator was a real colonial. He is always leaning up against some verandah post or another, and that is characteristic of the. young Australian. I do not agree entirely with the constitutional arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> but from my experience in the world I think we have been too long leaning on the precedents of Great Britain. Great Britain is herself going behind, simply because she is not prepared to adopt new machinery. I speak without any disrespect to the old institutions of the old country, which are very good where they are. Supposing we do not adopt this recommendation, and a difficulty arises, do honorable senators think that we in Australia are not far enough advanced in the machinery of government to get out of any difficulty that may arise just as easily and effectively as we should be able to do by following any precedent of the House of Commons, or of any other Legislature in the world? So long as we are prepared to lean on somebody else, and adopt machinery provided for us by somebody else, so long will we be prepared to remain in the old position, But when we adopt our own standing orders, and we find that we have not provided for everything that may occur, if we rely upon our own resources, I have not the least doubt that the precedents that may be created by our Presidents and Speakers will be found efficient to meet all the emergencies which may arise. I would rather rely for the future on our own opinions than on any practice of the past. The Commonwealth is a new institution, and its Parliament is different from that of any of the States, and different in its machinery from that of Great Britain. Whenever we may find ourselves in difficulty, we shall be able to get out of it as our forefathers did; and 1 hope that the amendment will not be carried. </para>

What we are really considering now are cases not provided for by the standing orders or by any subsequent sessional Order or other order, so that after every sitting of Parliament, or every three years, where even one point had to be added to our standing orders it could be so added. It appears to me that we can be guided by the House of Commons&#39; practice when we have not provided for cases - that we can adopt that practice with such modifications as we think fit in our standing orders - and thus under this new and unique Constitution have exactly the standing orders we want. If, when some point arises which we have omitted to decide by our standing orders, there is no party feeling we shall be a happy family, and settle the matter in five minutes. If, on the other hand, when such a point arises, there is party feeling, the party with a majority will try to snatch a victory and override the practice of Parliament. It is in such cases that we want the &#34; post &#34; to lean on ; we want the best practice we can get, and we go to the House of Commons because we have not been thoughtful enough to decide the question for ourselves. </para>

                        support the view taken by the President. Having heard the honorable and learned senator on several occasions, we might have divined that he would support the President in the view that this House has a Constitution, and is quite capable of interpreting it. It would be a great reflection on the members of the Senate, and on Australians generally, if we adopted such an amendment as that now proposed. Australians framed the Commonwealth Constitution, and I think Australians can interpret it. If at any time there arises a question in the Senate not provided for in the 440 standing orders, then I venture to think that our President, with his knowledge of constitutional procedure in various parts of the world, will be able to give a ruling. If honorable senators do not agree with that ruling they can dissent from it, and establish a different precedent. The great advantage of not having a standing order of the kind proposed is, that those honorable senators who prefer the House of Commons procedure may advocate it, whilst others, who favour the practice of the United States, may support the latter. As has been pointed out by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline>
                        this Commonwealth Constitution is unique in the world. It is admitted everywhere to be the broadest and freest Constitution ; and surely it will be a reflection on ourselves if we cannot lay down precedents on questions which do not come within the scope of our own standing orders.

                        (Tasmania). - I am extremely surprised at the turn which the debate has taken. When I submitted the amendment I really did not anticipate the opposition which has been shown ; and it is an opposition which I cannot understand. Perhaps I ought to say that I can understand the opposition only on the assumption that several honorable senators who have spoken or have interjected are being led away, or do not understand what is meant by the amendment. For instance, I heard an argument which seems to suggest that an honorable senator considers that a standing order which provides for reference to the House of Commons, would practically stand in the same relation to our own standing orders as does our own Constitution. But such an analogy is non-existent. There is no question of our having to refer to the practice of the House of Commons as something superior which will override our own standing orders. All we are asking is that in cases which are not provided for in our 400 odd carefully drawn standing orders, we shall have resort to the rules and forms of the practice of the House of Commons. What we shall specially resort to, if we find ourselves confronted by any difficulty not provided for in our own standing orders, will be the practice of the House of Commons. It has been urged as an argument against the proposed standing order that to adopt it would be imperilling our chance of building up our own practice. I see no danger on that score, and I venture to go further, and say that if we do succeed in building up our own practice here - and only time can enable us to do that - we shall not let it be overridden by the practice of the House of Commons.

                            <para>- I have a greater respect for Parliament than I have for the Trades and Labour Council. Magnificent an institution as the Trades and Labour Council may be, it is not Parliament, or any part of the Parliament. What we are practically concerned with are not the written standing orders of the House of Commons, but some practice that only many years can give to any deliberativebody. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> argument simply means that nothing is good unless it is new. Novelty may be good, but it is not a sole justification for adopting any particular course. What we are looking for is something to fall back upon in case of an emergency for which, with all our careful consideration, our standing orders do not provide. There seems to be some force in the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> that the amendment would interfere with our own practice. It is no doubt desirable that we should gradually form a practice of our own ; but that would not be interfered with by the adoption of proposed new standing order. Once we have established a practice in the Senate we may depend that the President would rely upon it, even if we do adopt the amendment. Such a ruling has been given from many a Chair in many a Parliament, in spite of the fact that the proposed standing order finds a place in the standing orders of every English-speaking Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly; in interpreting some question which may or may not be solved by reference to the standing orders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> interjection does not touch the argument. The President has ruled according to the practice established in the Chamber itself. I am not making these remarks in the least offensively, but merely trying to point out that there is nothing to prevent the President hereafter ruling in accordance with the practice which we shall establish. The President will not have to fly for refuge, excuse, or justification to the practice of the House of Commons, if we have established a practice here ; but until we have established a practice, what harm can be done in adopting that of the British House of Commons, which has never yet been found fault with in any British community. So far as I know&#39;, there is not a single English-speaking Parliament in the world where the proposed standing order is not in force. I submit, though not as an absolute argument, that if such a standing order, had been found objectionable, surely some satisfactory and conclusive reasons would have been shown during all the years of its application in Australia, Canada, and elsewhere why it should not be adopted. Standing orders do not bind us for all time ; and the standing order which I propose may be abandoned whenever our practice has become sufficiently established. But when we have been a Parliament for less than three years, there can be no harm in adopting such a standing order. If we have to resort to the House of Commons practice we can immediate&#93;}&#39; thereafter add a new standing order in order to meet any similar case in the future. That being so, there can be no sound objection to my amendment, especially as a similar standing order is in force in every English-speaking Parliament in the civilized world. </para>

                            <para>- I take the same view as the President. When we passed our 440 standing orders we believed we had dealt with every possible case that can arise, and it is only cases which are found not to be provided for that have to be considered. The rules, forms, and practice of the House of Commons embody an immense mass of precedents which, speaking generally, we know very little . about. We know in a general way what are the practices and usages of the House of Commons as to the well-known powers of debate, amendment, and so on ; and these are all provided for in our standing orders. But it is the unusual occurrences which are not likely to have standing orders applied to them, that we know very little about. I quite agree that if we were always to adopt the standing orders of the House df Commons in- any difficulty, we should never establish a practice of our own. Why should we not establish a practice of our own ? If some question be raised, not provided for by the standing orders, let us for a moment consider how the matter would develop. The President will be asked to give his ruling. He will rule from his knowledge of the standing orders, and no doubt in accordance with the analogy which he draws from the practice of the House of Commons. The probabilities are that he will always find some instance to support the ruling he is about to give. He will apply that instance, if it is fairly applicable, to our conditions. If it is not applicable he will find some way out of the difficulty himself. If we lay it down as a rule that we are bound to follow the practice of the House of Commons as far as it can be followed it binds us. In the other case, although the President can go to the practice and usages of the House of Commons to obtain light upon the matter, he need not follow them unless he chooses. After all, who is it that settles the practice of the Senate? It is not the President, nor the Chairman of Committees. It is the Senate itself. Because, if the Senate thinks that in any instance where the President has had to rule that ruling should not be followed, it can express its disapproval, and the decision of the Senate will become a precedent to be followed on other occasions. Consequently, we shall gradually build up a series of precedents for ourselves. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say so. I say that it is for the Senate, in the last resort, always to say what its practice shall be. The President rules, and <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> his ruling will be followed ; but if the Senate thinks that it should not be followed it will always have it in its hands to say so. Therefore, -the ruling is virtually the ruling of the Senate. Is there any reason why that course should not be adopted ? I see no reason whatever. I consider that it would be a good thing at the commencement of this new Parliament, now that we have fairly settled down to work, to make a practice of our own. Allusion has been made to the House of Commons rules being followed in the standing orders of the States Parliaments. But why is that ? It is because in the first- place the States Houses of Legislature found themselves in circumstances which they were unable to deal with under their own standing orders, and they found it con- venient to follow the rules of the House of </para>

But we are in a different position altogether. We are working under a Federal Constitution. The relative positions of our two Houses are, to a certain extent, parallel to the position in England, but they are also, to a large extent, different. We may often be misleading and deceiving ourselves by some false analogy in the practice of the House of Commons if we adopt the proposed standing order, whereas, if we leave ourselves free to make a practice of our own we shall have before us the rules of the House of Commons, and can adopt them if we please.

                        (Queensland).I hope that the views of the President of the Senate and of the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be adopted, and that the proposed new standing order will not be incorporated. Seeing that we have dealt with every contingency as far as we could foresee, it is desirable that we should reserve complete power t6 deal with any other question that may arise. Why not show an example of self-reliance to the people of the entire Commonwealth ? The jibe is continually thrown at the people of Australia that they are in an habitual condition of leaning up against a post. Let us begin by discarding the post - the post in this case being the British House of Commons. Let us form our own precedents, and erect a post of our own. Let us lay a foundation and build upon Commonwealth lines. It seems to me that this attempt to incorporate the practice of the British House of Commons on an Australian Federal Parliament is like an attempt to impose a piece of Elizabethan architecture on a Gothic building - some- : thing, entirely out of harmony with the original structure.

                        <para>- But why? We merely adopted the existing rules until we had an opportunity of framing rules of our own. We have had that opportunity. We have framed a considerable number of rules, and I trust that the Senate will come to the conclusion that in future we should continue to frame rules to suit our circumstances. I intend to oppose the inclusion of the standing order proposed. </para>

                        <para>.- If I thought that by failing to adopt the proposed standing order there is a risk of practices being established in the Senate in conflict with the best ideals which are to be found in the practices of the British Parliament I should not give the vote I contemplate giving, namely, against&#39; the introduction of what seems to me to be a most unnecessary and cumbersome piece of machinery. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> was absolutely correct in pointing out that the British House of Commons practice - and the practice is of more importance that the forms - has grown up in connexion with the management of a body numbering between 600 and 700. To apply such machinery to the affairs of the 36 gentlemen in this Senate I think would be exceedingly cumbersome. I feel assured that neither the President nor the Chairman of Committees - present or future - will ever seek to give decisions that will create practices at variance with the traditions and practice of the House of Commons where such practice is applicable to our circumstances. We should always have for our guidance the practices of the House of Commons, without the bondage of following procedure that is entirely unsuitable to our local conditions. Therefore, with the greatest respect for those who hold contrary views, I shall vote against the proposal, though by- no means from a desire to set up a brand-new pattern of authority. If I thought that such a thing was likely to come about, I should vote for the proposal ; but I am perfectly certain that while the present President and the present Chairman of Committees occupy their positions, we shall have no novelties introduced, even if we are not bound by the proposed standing order. </para>
