                    (New South Wales).I am sure that honorable senators will share my regret that many expressions of opinion - many incidents - have imparted into this discussion an amount of heat and friction which is extremely undesirable. But, whilst expressing that regret, I feel that the events to which I refer justify me in outlining the attitude which New South Wales takes up. The point from which I start is that the Constitution Act provides that the Federal Capital shall be located in New South Wales with certain restrictions. All that that State asks is that the bargain shall be kept. But, in reply, to our request, we are met with all sorts of objections aimed at the undertaking itself. My reply to the objectors is that the objections are made too late ; that if there was any fault to be found with section 125 it ought to have been found before the Constitution Bill was accepted. When the time comes for carrying out the arrangement, it is demurred to on the ground that it will be too expensive or too inconvenient. The time for those objections to be raised was when New South Wales was asked to enter the Federation. It does appear tome that something approaching a confidence trick is being attempted if, after having secured the co-operation of New South Wales by reason of that section, the undertaking is not carried out at the earliest possible moment.

                            <para>- I shall deal with that point later on, but may I remind the honorable and learned senator that he acquiesced in that very provision before it was accepted by New South Wales? Did he stand on a public platform in his own State and tell its people - or, better still, did he tell New South Wales - &#34;Whilst I am accepting the Constitution, it is my intention at the earliest possible moment to seek to amend that provision ? &#34; Had he taken that course his position would have been unassailable. But as he held his tongue at that time, we must assume that he acquiesced in the arrangement, and certainly by his silence he, like public men in other States, led New South Wales to believe that they agreed to the compact and were prepared to loyally carry it out. These latter-day objections and criticisms seem to me to savour of disloyalty. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to refer briefly to various events which have created a suspicion in the minds of the people of New South Wales. It will be within the knowledge of honorable senators that action has been contemplated against section 125 of the Constitution. Certainly, within very few months from the meeting of the Parliament, we had the two Melbourne newspapers leading a crusade against the selection of a site, commencing with gentle ridicule of what they were pleased to term &#34;The Bush Capital,&#34; and proceeding until they reached a depth of scurrility which is evidenced by the leading article in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> No public journal of any standing ever fell so low as the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> did to-day, when it launched out into such wild accusations against the integrity of New South Wales. </para>

We have the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> today referring to the condition that the Capital should be in New South Wales as a nefarious condition. Did it preach that doctrine when it urged the acceptance of the Constitution ?

The same newspaper, speaking on this matter, says that New South Wales exacted a bribe before she would join the union. If that statement had been made before New South Wales came into the Federation does any honorable senator, who knows how closely public opinion was divided in that State with regard to the Commonwealth Bill, think that she would have consented to join ? </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable senator and others consented to it also. It is said to be a bribe, and a nefarious condition now, but not a word of that kind was said then. But having brought New South Wales into the Federation by that means, the opponents of this Bill now want to depart from the terms that were agreed upon. Without going beyond the debates of the Senate, we have had declarations made which confirm my statement. We have had honorable senators stating by way of interjection that we might very well delay the establishment of the capital for twenty years. Amendments have been suggested, the effect of which would be practically to alter the Constitution. Only yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> told us that on financial grounds it would be a proper thing to amend the Bill so as to cause delay. I again ask the honorable and learned senator why he did not tell us before New South Wales came into the union that his acceptance of the Commonwealth Bill was conditional on several amendments being made in it ? But he kept that to himself. </para>

                            <para>- But the fact remains that this section, like the balance of the Constitution, was adopted by the people, and it stands there t&#187;-day with only one difference between it and the remainder of the Constitution. There is a marked difference between the provision under which the location of the capital is secured to New South Wales and the rest of the Constitution. The rest of the Constitution is an agreement entered into jointly and severally by the States. But the 125th section is an agreement entered into between New South Wales on the one part, and the people of the other States on the other. It is an arrangement under which New South Wales consented to join the Federation, on the condition that the capital should be within her territory. </para>

When New South Wales is told by such a prominent and experienced public man as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> is, that the section is a bribe, she has a right to be suspicious.

                            <para>- One inference from yesterday&#39;s debate is that, in opposing the selection of the capital, any stick is good enough to beat a dog with. We had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> stating that the delay in reference to the choosing of the capital was due to want of unanimity . on the part of the New South Wales, representatives. He said that had it not been for that want of unanimity the question would have been settled long since. The <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of that statement can be tested in this way : The New South Wales representatives are agreed to-day; but what attitude does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> take up now <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Having arrived at what he said was an essential condition - unanimity on the part of the New South Wales representatives - is his support secured <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Not for one moment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer&#39;s</inline> attitude reminds me very much of the old fable of the wolf and the lamb. The wolf complained that the lamb was muddying the water from which he was drinking ; but he was reminded that the lamb was on the nether side of the stream, and could not possibly have muddied the water. The wolf, however, wishing to consume the lamb, soon found some other cause for picking a quarrel. That is exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> has done. He says, in the first instance, that he wishes to have unanimity on the part of the New South Wales representatives ; and when that unanimity is secured he still refuses to carry out the terms of the Constitution. But while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> wishes to play the part of the wolf, I venture to say that the attitude of New South Wales will not be in any way lamb-like. How do honorable senators propose to carry out the agreement <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I am told by an interjection that it can be carried out by-and-by - all in good time. How are we to know when honorable senators will be prepared to deal with the question? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has given us some idea as to when he thinks it ought to be dealt with. I believe he has suggested twenty years hence. I am dealing, of course, with the more elaborate protest which the honorable and learned senator has placed before the Senate and the country. </para>

                            <para>- If we were to wait until the financial position in the opinion of the opponents of this measure had improved, the delay would be such that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> proposal would be moderation itself in comparison. It is not wonderful that New South Wales, regarding the arrangement that in the interim Melbourne should be the seat of government as a temporary expedient, should desire those who ask for further delay to indicate definitely when they would be prepared to deal with it if not now. It is perfectly true that no time limit is fixed in the Constitution ; but neither was there any time limit in regard to any other provision, with the . exception of the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- As our means of taxation are practically limited to Customs duties, they all come within the Tariff provision. With that exception, there is no time limit as to when the various obligations imposed upon this Parliament by the Constitution should be carried out. That being so, New South Wales had a perfect right to ask Parliament, as soon as the position of public business permitted, to proceed to carry out that portion of the Federal compact. It is the same with regard tq the Federal Capital as it was in regard to the High Court. There was no time limit fixed in the Constitution with regard to the establishment of that tribunal, but we all knew that it was intended to proceed with due expedition with its establishment. In the same way New South Wales has a perfect right to ask that the selection of the Federal Capital shall proceed, Parliament being guided by the same consideration. New South Wales certainly expects that this matter shall be determined in our time, and not by the next generation. There is a special reason for that demand, because the only plain difference between the section with which we are dealing, and the other provisions of the Constitution, is the moral obligation underlying it. This provision of the Constitution can be amended as can any other section in it if a majority of the people in a majority of the States approve of any proposed amendment. At present New South Wales has secured to her by the Constitution that the capital shall be within her territory. The selection of the capital is therefore a recognition of the moral obligation underlying that section ; but if that moral obligation is not carried out until twenty years hence, the generation which entered into it will have passed away. I certainly hope that I and most of my honorable friends will still be here twenty years hence ; but if not, I believe I shall have the consolation of meeting them elsewhere - though I admit that I&#39; am extremely complimentary to them when I say so ! The Premiers of the different States and the public men who guided public opinion, in reference to the bargain with New South Wales to which I am referring, are most of them here( to-day ; and as they helped to make the bargain I decline to believe that they will willingly break it. But as in the course of time they pass away, and another generation comes upon the political scene, it would not be unreasonable if the coming generation were to say - &#34; We have not had an opportunity of carrying out that arrangement hitherto, and as this is a part of the Constitution which we can amend, and we find it inconvenient to carry it out, we propose to amend it.&#34; There is on that ground a danger to New South Wales in not carrying out the Constitution now. We recognise that danger, and therefore urge that with all due expedition - bearing in mind our obligations in relation to other public business - this matter shall be proceeded, with and not delayed indefinitely. </para>

                            <para>-Whether it is a bogy or not will be seen from the fact that three years <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> elapsed since the Constitution was adopted, and the provision of the Constitution referring to the Federal Capital has not yet been carried out. When the site is selected, five or even ten years will elapse before the Federal Parliament will be sitting in the capital. When it is proposed that the site shall be selected, we are met with demands for an indefinite postponement of the whole matter. We are also met by proposals the effect of which must be to destroy the whole value of the bargain with New South Wales. Sydney has, I think, a right to assume that the capital will be placed at the nearest practical point to the 100-miles limit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> looks surprised at that proposition. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> speaking yesterday, said, as a Constitutionalist, that the provision with regard to the area, &#34;not less than 100 square miles&#34; meant a site as near to that limit as we could practically get. In other words, &#34;not less than 100 square miles&#34; means anything up to, say, 150 square miles, and as near to that limit as possible. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with the area of the territory to be acquired, but with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer&#39;s</inline> contention that &#34; not less than 100 square miles&#34; means within reasonable touch of that area. When the Constitution said that the Federal territory should not be less than 100 miles from Sydney, it meant that it was to be as near to 100 miles of Sydney as we could find a suitable site. I would confirm that view by reminding honorable senators of the negotiations which led up to the insertion of that section in the Constitution. There was first of all a demand from New South Wales that the capital should be located in Sydney. The representatives of the other States said - &#34;No, but we will meet you by saying that you may have the Federal territory 100 miles from Sydney.&#34; That was the answer. The New South- Wales people asked for Sydney, and the reply was - &#34;No, but you can have it 100 miles away from Sydney.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- That is quite immaterial. It is open for me to accuse Melbourne, but my desire is to discuss the facts. There was jealousy between the two States, and New South Wales declined to enter the Federation unless the capital were located at Sydney. The answer of the other States was, &#34; We shall not do that, but you can have the capital in New South Wales, though not within 100 miles of Sydney.&#34; The purpose of that condition was to have the capital in such a locality that it would not he within the centre of the influence of Melbourne. Do honorable senators mean to tell me that there would be any concession to New South Wales if the capital were placed at Albury % </para>

                            <para>- It would deprive New South Wales of one legal right, as I shall endeavour to show. I venture to say that if, prior to voting on the Constitution, the section had declared that the capital should be in the territory of New South Wales, but not less than 100 miles from Sydney, and on the border, the Constitution would never have been accepted. New South Wales would have regarded such a proposal as simply a fraud - as offering in words something not intended to be given in fact. </para>

                            <para>- The &#34;pound of flesh&#34; was conceded to New South Wales, and if the other States objected, they ought to have rejected the Constitution, with that condition in it. The attitude of honorable senators, even as shown in their interjections, reminds me of that neat little story in <inline font-style="italic">David Harum.</inline> David had struck a &#34;rank jib,&#34; but he purchased it and sold it, with the recommendation that the horse was free and without blemish, could trot a mile in 2 min. 30 sec., could be driven by a lady as well as a man, and could stand without hitching. We all know what happened ; and honorable senators are giving a guarantee which, on its face, appears right enough, but underneath there is a reservation which, if acted upon, will largely destroy the value of the concession to New South Wales. As a reason why the capital should be on the border-line, we have the preposterous proposition that New South Wales is likely to tear up her railway lines, adopt prohibitive railway tariffs, or in some other way hamper the work of the Federal Government. I cannot think that those who advance that suggestion believe it themselves. </para>

If New South Wales did attempt anything of the kind, I have sufficient belief in the innate powers of the Constitution to think that the Federal Government would find ways and means of carrying on their business. If there would be such a danger, in regard to the Federal territory, there is an equal danger to-day ; but I never fear when I get into the train at Sydney that my Melbourne friends will tear up the railway lines, in order that I may not be able to come to the Federal Parliament, and speak on behalf of my </para>

Honorable senators contend that the Constitution gives a right to take a larger area, because the section provides that the territory shall contain an area of &#34;not less than 100 square miles.&#34; The argument is that we may take any area in excess of that mentioned. Would it be contended that the Commonwealth had the power to take the whole State of New Wales? </para>

                            <para>- That, of course, means no right at all. But is it contended that the Commonwealth has the legal right to take an area in excess of 100 square miles? If so, the only logical conclusion of that is that the Commonwealth may take the whole of New South Wales, being not less than 1 00 miles from Sydney. Does any one contend that such a proposition will hold water? </para>

                            <para>- I am asking whether we have the right to take it ? If we have not the right to take the whole of New South Wales, we have no right to take 1,000 square miles. If there be the right to take more than 100 square miles, why the moderation in multiplying the area by only ten? I think I lay down a very fair proposition when I say that this section gives the Commonwealth the right to take such an area as may be necessary for Federal purposes. The language in the Constitution - &#34; not less than 100 square miles &#34; - is exactly the language used in the Bill we are discussing, which provides that the area shall not be less than 1,000 square miles. If the language in the Constitution justifies us in taking ten times the area mentioned, and this Bill becomes law, the latter may be interpreted as meaning that we may take ten times the area there mentioned, namely, 10,000 square miles, or 6,400,000 acres. </para>

It is provided that whatever area of Crown lands may be within the Federal territory shall be granted free to the Commonwealth. It is not only the 100 square miles which has to be granted free. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter whether there be little or much. The very fact that honorable senators who propose this larger area are prepared to pay for it, shows that they know their claim is not equitable. Honorable senators, when they talk about paying for any excess area, entirely overlook the fact that the Constitution proposes, in no doubtful language, that all Crown land within the area shall pass to the Commonwealth without payment. I feel quite certain that New South Wales is not prepared to make such a large surrender. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See affirmed the other day that he was not prepared to grant an inch more than 64,000 acres. I have had no means of communicating with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See as to what really was in his mind, but I regard his words as the naturally impatient answer of a man to what he believes to be an outrageous demand. I am safe in saying, however, that New South Wales will willingly and freely grant any land which is necessary for the fit and proper purposes of a Federal territory. What *s New South Wales asked to do to-day? New South Wales is asked to grant land for the purposes of a scheme of land nationalization. </para>

                            <para>- I do not at all object : in fact, I subscribe to the idea that the. ownership of the land within the Federal territory should remain with the Federal authorities ; but that can be done with 100 square miles just as well as with 1,000 square miles. I contend that, however right the principle may be, if Members of Parliament want to carry out an experiment with rural land it ought to be carried out in their own States, and with their own land. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> of the opportunity afforded by the broad acres of Western Australia for carrying out these political ideas, which, to my mind, are very suggestive of political youth. For the purposes of a Federal Capital 100 square miles is ample, and within that area the land nationalization experiment could be carried out. There is one other argument which is used in support of the proposition for a larger area, and which at first sight appears to have some weight. The argument is that the Federal territory shall be of such magnitude as will insure an increment in value sufficient to enable the capital to be self-supporting - in other words, to make its creation a good financial transaction. Those who advance that argument surely have very little knowledge either of the land proposed to be taken or of the land laws of New South Wales. In the first place, if 1,000 square miles be taken around either Tumut or Bombala, the great bulk of the land will be found to be distinctly poor. But whether the land be poor or rich makes no difference to the point which I wish to emphasize, namely, that before the Commonwealth can get any return, the value of that land will have to multiply four times. In New South Wales at the present time, the principle adopted by . the Government is to charge a rental of \\ percent, on the capital value. I assume, from interjections we have heard, that for any excess area taken honorable senators are willing that the Commonwealth should give New South Wales some financial recompense. If the Commonwealth Government take over the land at the capital value, they will have to let it at a rental of \\ per cent., or they will find no tenants, for the simple reason that immediately outside the Federal territory the New South Wales Government will be offering land at that rental. Any rental less than 5 per cent, will give no adequate return, allowing for the cost of a Lands 12 d 2 </para>

                    <para class="block">Department j so that, as I say, there can be no adequate return unless the land multiplies in value four times. Do honorable senators suppose that rural lands, stretching for sixty or seventy miles in the neighbourhood of a small capital, will multiply their value to that extent within any appreciable distance of time. I venture to say that it will be one of the most disastrous speculations ever indulged in if the Commonwealth, under the circumstances, seeks to acquire an area as a matter of purchase. I now desire to briefly say a word or two as to the arguments advanced on the merits of particular sites. I recognise that the contest is now narrowed down to Bombala and Tumut. I know my own State of New South Wales very well, and have a good general knowledge of Queensland ; and I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that the eastern coast of Australia is destined to carry by far the larger portion of the population of the continent. That being so, I should, quite apart from its undoubted merits, have preferred Armidale ; but I recognise that that site is impossible, in view of the pronounced opinions of honorable senators. While I regard Armidale as destined to be the centre oE the future population of the continent, I regard Lyndhurst as the present centre ; but recognising the opinion of my fellow members, I have to forego my preference for that site and to choose between Tumut and Bombala. I have no hesitation in making my choice ; but I would like to point out the somewhat inconsistent attitude of those who have spoken for Bombala. Yesterday we had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> strongly objecting to any material increase of the area beyond 100 square miles, but supporting Bombala and demanding a seaport. The land of New South Wales not being any more elastic than that of South Australia, he has not shown us yet how, while confining himself to the minimum of 100 square miles, he is going to have Bombala and a seaport within the Federal territory. Now we &#34;come to the arguments advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in favour of the same site. He affirms that one essential condition is that the Federal territory shall have a seaport. Only one of the sites suggested has a seaport, and that is Bombala. While he affirms that there is only one site which complies with that essential condition, yet he asks time to consider what site shall be selected. If, in his view, a seaport is an essential condition, he cannot logically ask any more time in which to consider the selection of a site, because there is only one site which possesses that requisite. I have spoken at greater length than I intended to do. I have sought, so far as I could, to put the facts before honorable senators as they present themselves to the minds of New South Welshmen. I would ask honorable senators to extend some consideration to the wishes, or, if they like, to the sensitiveness of New South Wales. What we ask is what we think we&#39; are legally entitled to ask - that, without any undue delay, steps shall be taken to determine the seat of government. I am not going to say that there should be any immediate effort to incur a large expenditure - I should oppose such a proposal - but I think that New South Wales&#34; has the right to ask, if only as an evidence of good faith on the part of the Federation, that the selection of a site shall be made now. </para>

                        <para>- I happen to be one of those who very earnestly desire that this question of the Federal territory, within which the seat of government has evidently to be placed, shall be settled at the earliest possible moment. &#39; I thoroughly agree with much of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said upon that subject. I think, without reservation or equivocation, that it is due in the first place to New South Wales that it should be settled as early as possible. </para>

                            <para>- Why should I be against Bombala ? On the contrary, I expect my honorable friend to support Bombala, and so solve the question. If all those who have doubts with respect to Tumut will immediately declare, by way of interjection, that they favour Bombala, we might end the sitting at once, and the session at a very early date. It is due, not merely to New South Wales, but to the Constitution and to the Commonwealth, that we should, at the earliest possible moment, define this territory within the borders of New South Wales, in order that we may settle at what part of the Federal area the seat of government shall be placed. That is what the Constitution requires of us. That is what all of us contemplated when entering into the Federal bargain. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it was the intention of the people of this country - who, in the final resort, declared the Constitution under which they intended to live - that that area of Federal territory should be placed as near as possible to Sydney, or to the 100-mile limit outside Sydney. I think that the language of the Constitution expresses plainly what was the intention of everybody - that it should be within the State of New South Wales, but not within 100 miles of Sydney. And it was a weakness on the part of my honorable friend&#39;s very able advocacy of the principle to which we are seeking to give effect that he should have suggested that a part of the inducement to New South Wales was that in respect of this provision the capital should be placed contiguous to the 100-mile limit. I do not think with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that the selection of the Federal territory and the establishment of the capital within that territory stand at all on the same footing as the establishment of the executive, the legislative, or the judiciary parts of the Constitution. I mean that the thing is equally extravagant from that point of view, as, I venture to think, with all submission, my honorable friend&#39;s suggestion about placing the territory contiguous to the 100-mile limit is extravagant from the other point of view. </para>

                            <para>- I really do not believe that it was in New South Wales, although I know there was a feeling of rivalry between the two States, or, perhaps, to reduce it to a narrower limit, between the two cities. In the Convention, it was proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne that Sydney should be made the capital in the Constitution, and it was supposed that the proposal was made not seriously, but in order to take wind out of the sails of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> It was abandoned, and the choice was left in the Constitution to the Parliament. I wish absolutely to dissociate myself from those who have suggested as a reason against Tumut, or any other site, that it would be in such a position within New South Wales as to be a kind of pocket borough for Sydney, or, in other words, that &#34;it would be so under the control of Sydney that, if the proceedings of the Commonwealth Government or Parliament displeased that State, the rails could be taken up, and -the gates closed, when we should be without either ingress or egress in respect to the Federal territory. I do not believe for an instant that there is any foundation for a suggestion of that kind. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> in a moment of heedless rhetoric, gave expression to that &#34;view, but I assume that he spoke unthinkingly, and without any serious intention of offering it as an argument. </para>

                            <para>- The &#34;idea ought not to be put forward that it might be done. I do not believe that the -settlement of this question is to be advanced one yard by stirring up strife, or by the introduction of other elements of heat or friction in addition to those which already exist in the rivalry between the two cities. We have examples of that rivalry frequently. It is absurd that we cannot enter into a discussion of this question without imputing motives, and suggesting courses of action which might be very proper on the part of some barbarous potentate or community in the centre of Africa, but which we can hardly attribute to any portion of the Australian Continent. Whilst I venture to think that it is our business to get &#34;the question settled at the earliest possible moment, still I am not prepared, and I do not think any of us are prepared to ;yield up our right of criticism, or surrender our judgment on a particular site, merely to have the question finally settled within the next day or two. There has been very great delay. The blame for that delay has rightly been placed on the shoulders of the Government, because it has been inexcusable. Speaking in May last on the Address-in-Reply, I said that it would have been perfectly easy to have had initial steps taken with a view to determining the position of the Federal territory. It might have been advanced a stage or two, -and we might then have been able without -difficulty to arrive at a final settlement before the session closed. The Parliament is in no way to blame. The people of New South Wales have to blame only the Ministry, and an particular the late Minister for Home </para>

It is placing all of us in an exceedingly embarrassing position to have this matter brought up for determination just as the sands in the glass of this Parliament are about run out. However, we have to deal with the question as far as we can. In what way are we asked to deal with it? The Bill seems to me to be founded on an entire misapprehension of the position under the Constitution. How such a Bill was ever framed by any one who has sought to apply an intelligent apprehension to the provisions of the Constitution under which it is supposed to be done, I cannot conceive.

                            <para>- How are we to get the Federal territory &#39;( This matter has been discussed from a point of view which is altogether misleading. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> discussed with very great force the position in respect to the 100-mile limit. Naturally he got confused by the expression &#34;not less than 100 miles,&#34; and he sought to differentiate between the right to insist on anything over 100 square miles and the 100-mile limit. Allow me to say that they are both in the same position. I do not believe that this Parliament can take one single square inch of territory without the consent of .New South Wales. It is of no use to blink the fact. </para>

                            <para>- Let us take the position under the Bill. This territory - whether we desire 1 0, 50, 1 00, or 10,000 square miles - must be the subject of cession by New South Wales. Therefore, those who desire to have more than &#93; 00 square miles are perfectly entitled to put in that request as well as any other request. It is just as effective to say, &#34; We desire that the area of this territory shall be 1,000 square miles,&#34; as it is to express a desire that it should be 50 square miles. </para>

                            <para>- I say that it would have been just as effective and more appropriate if we had proceeded by resolution. But having got the Bill, it may be treated as a resolution. What is misleading about the Bill is that it professes to determine the seat of government before the territory has been granted or required - before we have declared the territory within which the seat of government may be chosen. </para>

                            <para>- I take the view that it is not susceptible of reasonable argument that &#34; not less than 1 00 square miles&#34; means about 100 square miles. It means as much as you like ; and the very fact that the words are &#34; not less than &#34; indicate that it means as much as you like. It may be 10,000 square miles or the whole State of New South Wales, if you please ; but subject to the condition that New South Wales must cede it, whatever the area is. If we are guided by that consideration in regard to the words &#34; not less than &#34; it is as plain as possible what the framers of the Constitution meant, and what the Premiers meant, when they added those words to this particular part of the Constitution. If that is the case, and if the territory is subject to cession, I can only treat this Bill as an expression of the wish of the Parliament that the Federal area - whatever may be determined upon - shall be in the neighbourhood of a particular locality. I think it is an unfortunate thing that that wish is to be expressed by Bill. It appears to me that that matter has not been carefully thought out. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; &#34; shall&#34; or nothing. Let us accompany that by words which will show that we intend no discourtesy to New South Wales, and that we do not wish to be peremptory ; but let us express ourselves in such a way as to indicate what our view on the subject is If that is our meaning, there is no doubt about our right to express it. It is as possible for us to say what additional area we shall acquire as to limit it to 100 square miles. I do not know that the words &#34; not less than &#34; were introduced for the purpose of enabling us to take a larger area as some honorable senators seem to think, so as to embrace a port or a means of access by river. I know that in the American Constitution the words were &#34;not exceeding&#34; 100 square miles. The intention in that case was perfectly obvious. They wanted for a capital simply a place for a city with some elbow room; but we may require a larger area for the purpose of taking in - as some honorable senators say there is great necessity for doing - access to a river or a water frontage. It should not be forgotten that in regard to the District of Columbia, a portion of that territory was given by Maryland, and the other portion by Virginia. The two portions ran astride of the Potomac River, so that there was access by water. Fifty or sixty years ago - in 1846, I think - Virginia received back her portion of thirty-four square miles and left the territory as it is now, some sixty-four or sixty-six square miles in area. But probably it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution, and of the Premiers who inserted this provision, to give greater scope and expansiveness ; and it may be all the better for us that it should be so. But whether that was the intention or not, there is no doubt that this Bill does not decide matters. This Bill is only an expression of a wish. Whatever the form of enactment may be, both as to locality and as to area, and whether we shall get the territory or not - I have no doubt we shall get it - it must be obtained by cession from the Government and the people of New South Wales and not by virtue of any right of this Parliament to compulsorily acquire it. That being the view which I take of this Bill - that it gives expression to a wish - it is impossible for me to support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> I do not know what his idea was in moving it in. relation to a matter that has reached this stage. I rather agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who seems to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is very like a rudderless ship on an unknown sea and does not know quite where he is on this question. I do not know whether it is that he wants the site not to be selected at all, or whether he wishes to defeat this Bill as a lever to undoing the Constitution and ultimately putting the Federal Capital in Sydney. Is that what he means? Does he mean this amendment to be an insidious attempt to override the Constitution <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> My honorable and learned friend is constantly committing these little assaults - making these little nibbles, as I may call them - upon the Constitution. I do not know, in the present instance, if that is his intention or not ? </para>

                            <para>- I always thought my honorable and learned friend was a true Federalist, but I begin to doubt it, because I find that whenever he is making these attacks upon the Constitution he waves the flag of economy. We have heard that before, in regard to a much more vital part of the Constitution. As far as this particular matter is concerned, I think it would be a great mistake to carry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s.</inline> amendment. It is very much better for us &#34;to take the view that, as we have this Bill before us - irregular as it may be - it gives us an opportunity of reducing to a limit of two the eligible sites. Whether we insert the name of Bombala or retain the name of Tumut, it will be wise for us to come to a decision upon the measure. If we insert the name of Bombala, and the other branch of the Legislature does not agree with us in that respect, we shall at any rate have reduced the conflict for the present to these two places, and shall have an opportunity later on, with, I hope, more knowledge and information, and, perhaps, </para>

I intend to vote for Bombala, not because I intend to put my opinion dogmatically against the opinion of those who think that there are serious objections to that site, but for other reasons. I listened with great interest to some of the speeches made yesterday, with a view of eliciting information. The first speech made in advocacy of Tumut from the New South Wales side was not, to ray mind, convincing. But while I shall vote for Bombala, I wish <inline font-style="italic">-to</inline> say very plainly that if the matter is not settled now I reserve to myself distinctly the right, upon further investigation and further discussion, to change my mind upon the whole subject. I am prepared, if the matter is settled now, to accept Bombala and be satisfied with it. </para>

                        <para>- In addressing myself to the question before the Chair, I want to try, if possible, to follow the example set by several honorable senators who have preceded me, and to speak in such a way as to leave no sting behind. I must confess that, when I reflect upon some of the speeches that have been delivered, I come to the conclusion that there has been a good deal of irritation expressed. I, however, want to discuss it in a calm and temperate spirit, and to arrive at what I regard as a proper determination. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said that the course we are pursuing is not the proper one. Whether his contention be correct or not, if we pass this Bill it will be a deliberate expression of opinion by the Senate. When we previously discussed the subject, the Senate showed the way in which, in its opinion, the Government should deal with it, and the proposition agreed to on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> directed the Government to proceed by means of a Bill. We have two propositions before us. In the first place we have the Bill, the second reading of which has been moved ; and, secondly, we have an amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that the Bill be read this day six months. The object of the amendment is to shelve the Bill. I intend to support it. I have no hesitation in saying that it would be a good thing if the Bill were shelved under present circumstances ; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> proposal is not carried, I shall divide the Senate on the motion for the second reading, in order that I may express, by my vote, the opinion which I entertain. If the Government are successful in carrying the motion for the second reading of the measure, I shall vote for the site which I think ought to be selected ; but if I cannot secure the choice of my first preference, I shall do what I can with the object of preventing the Bill from becoming law. Probably in the end I may adopt the position which has been taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and vote for Bombala ; though I reserve to myself the right to alter my opinion in the light of the further knowledge which I may acquire in regard to any alternative site that may be proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> submitted a number of reasons in favour of his amendment, and with some of those reasons, though not with all, I agree. I was pleased to listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer.</inline> As was pointed out yesterday, this is probably the last occasion on which we shall hear the honorable and learned senator in the Senate, seeing that he has renounced his intention of resigning his seat ; and I should like to take the opportunity of expressing my personal opinion that his deliverance of yesterday is a credit to himself and undoubtedly expresses the Australian view. This afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> blamed the Government for the attitude which they have taken up on this question. The honorable and learned senator charged the Government with neglect of duty in not submitting the Bill before this late period of the session. I do not, however, blame the Government, who, so far as I can see, could have adopted no other course. We have only to remember the vast amount of legislative work which had to be done in order to agree that the Government could not have introduced a measure relating to the capital site at an earlier date. While this is true, however, my main objection to the measure is that it has been left to the dying hours of the last session of the first Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite true, if it be only praying for our souls. In a matter of such importance as the choice of a Federal Capital, it would have been better if the Government had given more time for its consideration, or, at this stage of the session, had excised it from their programme. The question of the Federal Capital has given most of us a great deal of difficulty. I have read the reports of the Royal Commission, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oliver,</inline> and have followed the evidence given by the various witnesses, in addition to personally inspecting every one of the proposed sites. Yet, after all, I confess that it has not been easy for me to make up my mind. There has been much conflict of opinion ; and everything points to the fact that there is not sufficient information before us to enable us to arrive at a proper decision. A good deal has been said as to the rights of New South Wales, and there is no doubt that section 125 of the Constitution declares that the Federal Capital shall be within that State, subject to certain obligations and conditions. I admit that the right of New South Wales is unchallengeable, and I should be no party to any proposal to go behind the agreement under the Constitution. But, in urging delay, I thoroughly believe I am acting in the interests not only of New South Wale3, but of the whole of the people of Australia. There is no mandatory provision in the Constitution that the Federal Capital shall be fixed within a specified time. We all know, however, that from the beginning, there has been a feverish anxiety that the first Parliament should enact all the legislation contemplated by the Constitution. The speeches which have been delivered by the representatives of New South Wales show that the proposal to now fix the Federal Capital is made entirely in the interests of that State. While it is perfectly true that the Constitution, as accepted, contained a provision that the Federal territory should be within New South Wales, the people of Australia, when the Constitution was before them, did not give the question that consideration which it deserves. The people now are seriously reconsidering the position, and there is a reaction in regard to many matters connected with the Federal movement. The people of Australia are not readily swallowing everything told them, as they did when Federation was being advocated ; and time is bringing forth fresh developments. </para>

We cannot disguise the fact that honorable senators desire to protect the interests of their own States, and I am only doing my duty in expressing what I believe to be the opinions and desires of the people of Victoria. If the question of the Federal Capital be relegated to the new Parliament which is to meet a few months hence, and it is then shown to be the desire of the States to carry out the bargain with New South Wales, I shall be prepared to do all that is reasonable to that end.

                            <para>- It is an opinion formed after hearing speeches, not only here, but in another place, and after conversations with members of the Parliament. What are the essential points of section 125 <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is provided, first, that the site shall be determined by Parliament; secondly, that the territory granted or acquired shall be owned by the Commonwealth; thirdly, that the land must be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth ; fourthly, that it shall be distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney; fifthly, that it shall contain not less than 100 square miles ; and sixthly, that the Parliament shall sit in Melbourne until it meets at the seat of Government. If one may judge from the speeches delivered, the whole trouble in regard to the matter arises from the fact that for the present the seat of government is in Victoria. When representatives of New South Wales talk about &#34; the bond,&#34; it is well that they should be reminded that there are other bonds. From the time this Parliament first met until the present moment, New South Wales representatives have been urging that the seat of government should- be moved to that State ; and if they do not carry out their share of the bargain under the Constitution, they will have only themselves to blame, should New South Wales eventually lose the honour of having the Federal territory within her boundaries. As to the area, the Constitution provides that it shall not be less than 100 square miles ; and my reading of the provision is that this, or any future Parliament, is not bound to that area. If it had been intended to confine the Federal territory to 100 square miles, the framers of the Constitution would have made that fact quite clear. No limit, however, is placed to the area, and the House of Representatives has declared that it is desirable to acquire 1,000 square miles. I do not think that there is any intention to contend that the Government of New South Wales can be compelled to grant more than 100 square miles ; but if in the wisdom of Parliament 1,000 square miles is deemed to be a proper area, we are quite within our rights in asking that it shall be ceded to us on equitable terms. In regard to this, and many other sections, the people of Australia did not realize what they were doing when they accepted the Constitution; and if there be an unwise provision in regard to the Federal territory or any other matter, surely we have a right to make the best arrangements possible under the circumstances. Some honorable senators have spoken as though the proposed extension of the Federal territory had been suddenly sprung upon the Federal Parliament. They must be aware that on nearly every platform in all the States of the Commonwealth candidates for the Federal Parliament advocated that a greater area than 100 square miles should be acquired. Some spoke of 1,&#34;000 square miles, others of 5,000 square miles, and on many platforms I advocated that the territory acquired should be as large as possible, and also that the land should never be sold, but should be held by the Government of the Commonwealth in trust for the generations to come. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to give a vote on this question in keeping with my election pledges, and when we come to consider that provision of this Bill, I shall be prepared to vote for it. Several objections have been urged against the proposal. In the first place it has been hotly opposed by representatives of New South Wales, and it has recently been publicly opposed by the State Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See. In my opinion that gentleman has very unwisely declared that he will not give us an inch beyond the area to which we are entitled under the Constitution, and I suppose he refers to the area of 100 square miles. I believe that members of the Federal Parliament are entitled to say what area they think ought to be acquired in the best interests of the people of Australia, and if any trouble subsequently arises the people of the State of New South Wales must be held responsible for it, because they will be going back upon the bond, which is conditional, and can only be Carried out if the conditions are faithfully adhered to. If the authorities in New South Wales throw obstacles in the way, it may be found that the greatest injury will be done to that State. If they fail to carry out a reasonable bargain proposed by the Federal Parliament they may find that there is such a thing as an alteration of the Constitution. It may be decided that the whole of the people of Australia shall be given the right to say where in future the Federal Capital shall be located. In discussing this question, we must have some consideration for the expense in which the people of the Commonwealth may be involved. Estimates of the probable cost have varied from &#163;200,000 to &#163;2,000,000, and in considering this Bill we require to look ahead and consider the probable cost. It is of no use for us to shut our eyes to facts. Once we carry the proposal of this Bill, it will be all moonshine to suppose that but a small sum of money will be spent upon the future Federal Capital. I have no doubt that the very fact that the capital has been selected, and that we are about to build, will entail upon the people of the Commonwealth the expenditure of a large amount of money. Personally, I should have no objection to the selection of the locality in which the Federal Capital is to be situated if there were some agreement or undertaking that, at all events for the present, there should not be any large expenditure of money in connexion with it. In my judgment the requirements of the Commonwealth do not require it. We can go on as we have been doing for the present. No one anticipated, that during the first three years of its existence the Federal Parliament would decide this important question. There is a further consideration to which I should like honorable senators who have not yet spoken to address themselves. I should like to know where the large amount of money which will be involved in carrying, out this proposal is to come from. Is it to be provided from loan or out of revenue? Honorable senators of the Labour Party have recently declared that, so far as our spending power is concerned, it must in the future depend upon the revenue derived from Customs. If we are to take this money from revenue and remain true to the principle affirmed, I desire to know how it is possible to provide the large amount of money which will be necessary to carry out this scheme. To live within our means should be our motto in dealing with this matter. That is a sound policy for individuals, and it is also a sound policy to urge upon the nation. If we do not proceed upon such a policy, extra taxation will have to be imposed upon the people of the States,, and I do not believe that they are at present prepared to stand it. The whole proposal is unnecessary. Australia does not require it. I intend to give my vote in such a way as to enable, not only the people of this State, but of the whole Commonwealth,, to express their opinion upon the subject. I shall therefore, in the first place, vote for the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> ; in the second place, I shall divide the House on the Bill, if I can get another honorable senator to help me; in the third place,, if I am forced to make a selection, I shall vote for that site which, in my opinion, will be best in the interests of Australia. If I am not successful in that I shall be guided by events; but, in any case, I shall do what I can to bring about delay in regard to this matter. </para>

There are, however, a few aspects of the question which I should like to submit to honorable senators who intend to vote for the second reading of this Bill.

                            <para>- I can well under stand that honorable senators representing New South Wales desire not only to see a Federal Capital site selected, but also to see the Federal Capital in course of erection. I should not object if our population was increasing as rapidly as it ought to be, and if we had had several good seasons instead of several bad ones. The reason why, under those circumstances, I should not object is because it is in the bond - a foolish bargain, I admit, but one which, in my opinion, must be kept, but later on. I should like to know who wants this capital ? </para>

                            <para>- I wish to know whether it is the members of the Federal Parliament who require a Federal Capital at once, or the people of the Commonwealth, and not any particular section of it. If Federal legislators require a Federal Capital for their convenience, I remind them that they cannot get one more centrally situated than is Melbourne. A glance at the map of Australia will prove that. In the Senate we have equal representation of the States. The little State of Tasmania has six representatives, who have as much right to be considered as have the six representatives of the big State of New South Wales. And in this matter, involving the spending of a lot of borrowed money, or even of revenue, the whole of the people must be considered. The people of South Australia and of Western Australia must also be considered. If it is contended that the people require a Federal Capital, what do they require it for ? Is it required for commercial and industrial purposes? Surely we have sufficient towns for the existing population of Australia? If a town had been required in the back blocks of New South Wales, in the neighbourhood of any particular site which may be selected, it would have been established there before now. If it is contended that a Federal Capital is required for commercial purposes, it will be admitted that some of the sites named would be of very little use to commercial men. There would be no outlook for them at Tumut or Lyndhurst, stuck away, as they are, in the middle of the State of New South Wales. None of the tax papers of the community require this capital, and it is not wanted for Legislative, industrial, commercial, or defence purposes. If it could be shown that the establishment of the Federal Capital would increase the wealth of Australia by &#163;5 I should be prepared to think over the matter. Railways, public works, and buildings do not form the State. People are essential to the building up of a nation. Does any one suppose that the creation of a town in any part of Australia would induce people to come here from abroad? If the Federal Capital were established, no doubt a large number of people would flock to it, as to a new gold diggings, and within a very short time possibly 20,000 people might be gathered together there, with the object of improving their positions in life. These people would have to be kept by the taxpayers&#39; money. Every penny of it -would have to come from that source, because it could not be drawn from any other. </para>

                            <para>- Still the money would come out of the taxpayers&#39; pockets. From what other source could it be derived <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The capital would not be established for commercial or industrial purposes, and if people flocked there from other parts of Australia they would leave vacant houses behind them. The Attorney-General appealed to us last night as level-headed common-sense business men ; but he did not give us anything to think about. He made a number of bald statements ; but he did not tell us the probable cost of the buildings at the Federal Capital, or how the necessary funds were to be obtained. The only estimate submitted to us is that framed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> and presented to the New South Wales Parliament on the 30th October, 1900 - three years ago. The Commission of Experts appointed by the Government did not furnish any idea as to the probable cost of the capital. The Commissioners spent a great deal of time in visiting the proposed sites, and although they were selected for their special knowledge they left us entirely in the dark upon the point I have mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> is the President of the Land Court of New South Wales and is a very able man. His figures indicate the idea which prevails in New South Wales as to the character of the buildings which should be erected at the Federal Capital. The cost of Parliament House is set down at &#177;&#39;750,000. That is a very good beginning. </para>

                            <para>- He was thinking about getting Melbourne money with which to build it. The Governor-General&#39;s residence is estimated to cost &#163;75,000, and the Post Office - out in the back-blocks of New South Wales - &#163;100,000. The military academy, barracks, arsenal and factory, and Commandant&#39;s residence are estimated to cost &#163;200,000. These figures are very amusing, no doubt ; but there will be another tale to tell when the people have to find the money. The Courts of Justice and various offices connected with them, are expected to cost &#163;300,000. When tired legislators feel that they want a little relaxation, a National Hall, with an art gallery, which is expected to cost &#163;150,000, will be at their disposal. Sundry other buildings are estimated to cost &#163;292,500. Among these are official residences for the Ministers of State, which are expected to COSt rom &#163;7,500 to &#163;10,000 each ; &#163;250,000 is the amount set down as the cost of laying out of the city, and the total amount of the estimate is &#163;2,117,500. I should call this &#34; laying out &#34; the taxpayers instead of laying out the Federal City. The items which I have quoted are quite exclusive of works connected with water supply, sewerage, lighting, or means of access. This is the only estimate which has been submitted to Parliament, and the only guide as to the money which will probably be spent. </para>

                            <para>- But what will happen when we have selected the site? When we have decided where the capital is to be established, we shall at once be called upon to vote &#163;30,000 or &#163;50,000 for carrying out survey and other similar works. Next year we shall probably be required to find &#163;150,000, and then, when we are fairly committed to the enterprise, the Government of the day, urged on by their supporters from New South Wales, will ask for &#163;250,000 more. So the game will go merrily on, year after year, until millions have been sunk in this alleged Federal Capital. Now let us see if we can understand why the representatives of New South Wales are so anxious to see the Federal Capital established. If we assume that the total expenditure upon the capital will be &#163;3,000,000-1 believe it will be nearer &#163;5,000,000- New South Wales would only have to contribute 36-10 per cent, of that amount, or &#163;1,083,000. The other five States would have to contribute nearly &#163;2,000,000, which would be spent in New South Wales. That, however, would represent only a small part of the loss sustained by the other States. The drain of population to which they would be subjected is worthy of consideration. I find that within ten years of the establishment of Washington, the Federal Capital of the United States, 24,000 people were congregated there. If a similar number of people were gathered together at the Federal Capital within the same period, they would represent a value to the Commonwealth of &#163;7,000,000. The value to the State of every person - man, woman, and child - in Australia is &#163;350, and, therefore, 20.000 persons at the Federal Capital would represent a total value of &#163;7,000,000. Of the people who went to the capital, New South Wales would probably contribute 7,000 or S,000, and the balance would come from other States, which would be poorer to the extent to which they were deprived of population, whilst New South Wales would be so much the richer. </para>

                            <para>- I quite understand why the people of New South Wales object to our acquiring anything more than 100 square miles of their territory. Personally I should like to appropriate 10,000 square miles. New South Wales has an area 50 per cent, larger than that of the French Republic or the great German Empire, and 1,000 square miles would represent only one three-hundredth part of the total. The people of New South Wales believe that there will be a large population at the Federal Capital, and that if the area of the Federal territory is limited, the residents within it will have to obtain their food and other supplies from New South Wales. They do not care to give us enough territory to enable us to grow food for our own people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said that if the Federal Capital were established upon a small block of 100 square miles in the middle of New South Wales, the people of that State would not take advantage of that fact to put the screw on the Federal Parliament if they wanted anything from it. </para>

                            <para>- The result of the vote taken upon the proposals embodied in the Bill, flatly contradict that idea. The conditions laid down in connexion with the capital site require that it shall be fifty miles long and twenty miles wide, that it shall extend from Tumut to the River Murray, and that it shall have a frontage of twenty miles to that river. This was done in order that at any future time it should not be within the power of the Government or Parliament of New South Wales to bring any undue pressure upon the Commonwealth Government. We do not believe that the present Parliament of N ew South Wales, which is acquainted with all the circumstances, would take any undue advantage of us ; but we cannot answer for the conduct of later Parliaments. Therefore the House of Representatives wisely decided by an overwhelming majority that the Federal territory should extend to the Victorian border. I do not know how senators from New South Wales can explain away the fact that eight representatives of that State voted for the provision to which I have referred. Probably they believed that the time might come when the Parliament of New South Wales would take an unfair advantage of the Commonwealth if the Federal Capital were surrounded on all sides by New South Wales territory. </para>

                            <para>- Eight representatives of New South Wales supported that proposal, the voting being thirty-five in favour of it and eleven against it - a majority of twenty four. It is worth the while of honorable senators to consider whether we ought not to insist that the Federal territory shall touch either the sea-coast or the boundary of one State other than New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>--The New South Wales representatives are always taunting us with that rubbishy idea. I do not believe that there is a man or woman in this State who wishes to repudiate the foolish bargain which was made by the Premiers of the States in reference to the Federal Capital. We indorsed it with our eyes open, and we are prepared to abide by it. It is merely a question of whether we can afford at the present time to waste some hundreds of thousands, possibly some millions, of pounds in building a city in the backblocks amongst mosquitoes and dead blacks. </para>

As honorable senators are aware, a Commission was appointed by the New South Wales Government, and subsequently another Commission by the Barton Government, for the purpose of investigating the claims of what were regarded as eligible sites for the future Federal Capital. Those two bodies cost thousands of pounds. They examined the rival sites but did not even mention either of these which are now recommended for our adoption. Indeed, there are not half-a-dozen senators who have inspected them. Personally, I have not been within miles of them.

In this connexion it is worth noting that at the present time the Government of South Australia refuses to give its sanction to the construction of the alleged transcontinental railway through its territory - a work which the residents of Western Australia consider would prove the salvation of the Commonwealth. I point to this fact to show that it is possible that the Parliament of a State may adopt a certain course of action. Consequently it would be well to place it beyond their power to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> admitted yesterday that, under the Constitution, no time limit was imposed within which the capital site must be selected. But I do not know that anybody wishes to take advantage of that fact. At the same time, let us use a little common sense, and exercise ordinary business prudence in connexion with this matter. Had the framers of the Constitution thought it necessary to embody a time limit in that instrument of government they would unquestionably have done so, just as they did in connexion with the abolition of the&#39; InterState duties. In that case they clearly set out that a uniform Tariff should come into operation within two years from th&#171; inauguration of the Commonwealth. Similarly they fixed five years as the limit of the bookkeeping period and ten years as the term during which the&#39; Braddon clause should remain operative. I do not believe that the fact that a constitutional compact was made that New South Wales should have the Federal Capital had any appreciable effect upon the result of the referendum in that State. </para>

It is a singular fact that the people from the other side of the little creek, called the Murray, are always ready to attack Victoria. They altogether overlook the other States. In speaking upon this Bill yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> advanced a very conclusive argument in favour of the selection of a site which nobody has ever seen, save the members of the two expert bodies to which I have referred, both of which condemned it. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner is the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and therefore we ought to vote for Tumut. </para>

The real considerations were those which prompted thousands, who, in common with myself, had voted against Federal Union upon the first referendum to vote in favour of it upon the second. The Federal Capital was not a factor in determining their views. Indeed, it was never thought of except by a few politicians who wished to be returned to the Commonwealth Parliament. The real considerations which prompted the people of New South Wales to support Federation upon the second occasion was the alteration which had been made in clause 57, which relates to disputes between the two Houses, and the still greater alteration which had been effected in clause 128. Still another consideration was that, upon the first referendum, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had said &#34; No,&#34; whilst upon the second he said &#34;Yes.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- They did not carry it by as large a majority as they did the second Bill. That shows that my statement is correct. A larger proportion of the people voted for the second Bill than supported the first. In New South Wales 20,000 more votes were cast in favour of Federal Union upon the second referendum than were recorded upon the first, not because that State was to be granted the Federal Capital, but because of the substantial amendments to which I have alluded. </para>

The idea that a bad smell could exist in any part of Melbourne is preposterous. If I had to vote for any site I should certainly support Armidale.

We know that Armidale is an excellent site, and I could quite understand them saying, &#34; Let us defer the selection of a site until population has gravitated north and Armidale becomes, a generation or two hence, the centre of population in the Commonwealth. In the meantime we shall remain in Melbourne, where we have the free use of a magnificent building which cost the people of Victoria &#163;600,000, as well as the free use of a residence for the Governor-General.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- There is no reason to believe that they will not. Through the Premier of the day the people of Victoria said to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, &#34; Here are two Parliament Houses ; take which you like.&#34; Inferentially they also said that we might occupy these buildings as long as we pleased. The late Prime Minister, with that intelligence which we know him to possess, selected the better of the two buildings. No limit was placed upon the term of our occupation, and we may remain here as long as we please. We may continue to occupy these buildings free of charge, although the people of Victoria have to pay &#163;21,000 a year interest in respect of the capital expenditure upon them. As long as Victoria does not complain, the Federal Parliament should not do so. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> occupied free of charge a handsome dwelling on the capital cost of which the owner was paying &#163;200 or &#163;300 a year interest, he would be quite ready to continue to remain in occupation on those terms. </para>

                            <para>- Then why not ask the Federal Parliament to volunteer to pay for the use of these buildings ? There is a splendid opening for some patriot to move that a rental of &#163;21,000 per annum be paid by the Federal Government for the use of these buildings. I know that as a Victorian I shall be charged with parochialism in opposing the immediate erection of a Federal Capital. It will be said that I am unfederal and unpatriotic, and a good many other &#34; uns &#34; will be employed in expressing disapproval of my action. I am here, however, as a member of the States House. I am here not to represent any particular section of the people, but as one of six senators who have the honour to represent Victoria ; and I shall do my best to conserve the interests of the people of the State as a whole. I think that I am best preserving the interests of the people of the State, and of the whole Commonwealth to boot, by opposing any present expenditure on a Federal Capital site, not to speak of a Federal Capital. </para>

                        (South Australia).I do not think it would be wise to allow this matter to be finally settled solely from the stand-point of the representatives of Victoria and New South Wales. The representatives of those two States appear to take a vital interest in the question; but honorable senators from all the other States are entitled to have a voice in the determination of the locality of the site and the expenditure which shall be incurred in connexion with it. Much has been said as to the desirableness of selecting a site nearer Sydney than Melbourne, and
                        <inline font-style="italic">vice versa;</inline>
                        but I believe that the majority of honorable senators representing the other States hold the opinion that the interests of the Commonwealth, rather than the individual interests of those two cities, should be considered. It has been said that if the Federal Parliament, acting on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth, is not prepared to accept any site or area which the Government of New South Wales chooses to offer, &#34;something must happen.&#34; I should like to call the attention of honorable senators from New South Wales, not to what might happen but to what in that event would happen. If the people of New South Wales were not prepared to meet the wishes of the Federal Parliament, acting in the interests of the people of Australia, the sittings of the Parliament would continue to be held in Melbourne. That, I conclude, would be the ultimate position. Honorable senators are called upon to determine the most suitable locality in which to establish the capital, and the area -which should be acquired. To my mind it would be in the interests of Australia, and in no wise prejudicial to the individual States of Victoria or New South Wales, to acquire an area considerably in excess of 1,000 square miles. I am about to make a proposal - not with the intention of delaying the selection of a site, or of doing anything to aggravate the people of New South Wales - that we should acquire a large territory. The people of New South Wales will have&#39; no right to take exception to my proposition, for residents of the territory which I have in view have, within the last twenty years, asked that it should be separated from that State and attached to Victoria. It comprises the Riverina and the district eastward to the sea. I think that the Federal territory should take in not only Tumut, Batlow, Yarrangobilly, and several other places which have been referred to as an inducement to the selection of a certain site, but the whole area between the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude and the Victorian border. The Murrumbidgee would form the northern and western boundary, whilst the territory would be bounded on the south and slightly to the west by the Murray. That would mean an area of about 20,000 square miles. Such a proposal probably startles honorable senators from New South Wales.

                        <para>- Until recently, little was done by the Government of New South Wales to develop that stretch of country, and they should, therefore, have no hesitation in ceding it to the Commonwealth. I entirely agree with the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that we shall have no power, so far as the Parliament itself is concerned, to acquire any territory until the Government or the people of New South Wales are prepared to cede it to us. In the event of a refusal the only course open to us would be to present an address to the British Parliament requesting them to amend the Constitution so as to compel New South Wales to cede the required territory to the Commonwealth. Honorable senators must recollect that our Constitution is an Act of the British Parliament, and the course I have indicated would thus be open to us. </para>

                    <para> The members of the British Parliament are men of common-sense, and they would far rather allow the Commonwealth to acquire an area of 20,000 square miles from a State comprising a territory of nearly 360,000 square miles than cut? off so large a slice of country from a small State like Victoria. Some people will be disposed to question my assertion as to the extent of New South Wales. We are all prone to exaggerate. When honorable senators representing New South Wales wish to make it appear that the State is only a small one, they say that it contains an area of only 310,000 square miles. If, on the other hand, they are blowing about its immensity, they assert that it contains an area of 360,000 square miles. I cannot absolutely say which of these statements is correct, but the truth must lie between the two extremes. I have not the least doubt that if the Constitution were amended so as to enable the Commonwealth Parliament and Government to find a home, several States, including even the small State of Victoria, would not object to hand over an area of 1,000 square miles in some quiet corner where the Federal pilgrims might rest in peace. Would it not be to the advantage of the people of Australia for the Commonwealth to acquire an area as large as that which I have indicated? If an area of 100 square miles in a central part of New South Wales were set apart for the purposes of the Federal Capital, it would, undoubtedly be an advantage to that State, as it would provide a new market for its produce, while its railway income would also be increased, because New South Wales might put restrictions on the introduction and the carriage of produce from any other State. It might say that because there was swine fever in Victoria the people in the Federal Capital should eat only New South Wales pork. </para>

                            <para>- It has not been appointed. Although I know that there might be a way of getting over a difficulty of that kind, still it is better to have the territory so situated that it would never arise. Why should we put ourselves in a difficulty when it can be avoided ? Suppose that we accepted the strip of country which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> pointed out on the map, and wanted to construct a railway from the Federal Capital, it could not be done without the consent of New South &#34;Wales, unless it was a line to the Victorian border ; but even in that case we should have to ask the permission of Victoria to carry the railway any further. Why should the Federal Government, or the people of Australia not included in Victoria or New South Wales, be placed in a position of that description <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> That is one of &#39;he reasons why I favour the acquisition or cession of a territory containing 20,000 square miles ; and I think it would be a fair thing for the Commonwealth to take over a portion of the public debt of New South Wales, proportionate to the amount which has been spent in the development of that country, and to add 10 per cent, to that amount, so that there would be no grievance left behind. </para>

                            <para>- If that territory were acquired by or ceded to the Commonwealth, it would include two of the best harbors in Australia. Jervis Bay is, in my opinion, as good as Sydney Harbor, and Twofold Bay is very little inferior to it. We could construct a railway anywhere within that territory ; it would not be necessary to get the permission of New South Wales or Victoria, because the construction of the line could be authorized by the Federal Parliament with the consent of the representatives of those States. By carrying out certain improvements we should add to the value of something that belonged to the people of Australia. In a large territory of that kind if would be almost impossible to create &#39;any value which, except in a very incidental manner, would overlap the territory of New South Wales and Victoria. We should be entirely isolated from the possibility of acquiring an undue benefit at the cost of any State. We should be doing good to the whole Commonwealth. Once we decided to select the territory, all interest in the capital site would collapse in the rest of New South Wales. The people of Lyndhurst, Orange, Armidale, and other places would at once cease their agitation for the establishment of the Seat of government. Once this territory was acquired by the Commonwealth a proper site could be quietly selected for the capital. I should not care whether it was established at Albury, Tumut, Lake George, or Bombala. It would amount to the same thing in the end. We should have all the benefits that would be conferred on the Commonwealth by the inclusion of those different sites in the Federal territory. If the representatives from the different States do not indorse my suggestions, then the next territory I am bound to advocate is a territory which would include Twofold Bay, and that is generally recognised as the Bombala site. It would be necessary to acquire an area of about 2,000 or 3,000 square miles, in which all kinds of climate could be found. A cold climate could be obtained up at Kiandra, in the Snowy Mountains ; a temperate climate at Dalgety or Bombala; or a genial, warm climate in the neighbourhood of Eden. The capital could be established in the most suitable portion of that area. I desire to point out why it is necessary to acquire a greater area in one locality than in another. In some localities a small area might suffice for the requirements of a Federal Capital ; but in another locality a much larger area would be required. And that only convinces me of the wisdom of those who framed a provision so elastic that the size of the area maybe decided according to the nature of the locality. What do we want in a Federal territory ? In the first place, we want a country which will give us an- ample water supply, and to achieve that object we must have a sufficient area to contain all the catchment for that water supply. Suppose that we had an area of 100 square miles in a certain position, and the catchment for the water supply to the capital was outside that area. It would be in the power of New South Wales at any time to say that it required all this water supply for irrigation purposes, and so place the Federal territory in exactly the same position as New South Wales and Victoria are attempting to place South Australia with respect to the River Murray. We do not want the Commonwealth to be placed in a difficulty of that kind. We want the Federal territory and the seat of government to be entirely independent of the State, out of which it may be carved, or which it may adjoin. In the case of Bombala, we should require to have 2,000 or 3,000 square miles, so as to include the entire catchment for the water supply. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. What difference would that make to New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Take a line north of Twofold Bay and extend it to Mount Kosciusko, and see what New South Wales has ever done for that territory. It has been almost entirely neglected. If it has been neglected to that extent, then it is a territory which New South Wales ought to be glad to get rid of, or one which the residents ought to be glad to see surrendered by New South Wales. To my mind it is the place to which the least objection should be made by New South Wales. Another advantage is that that territory is almost exactly equidistant from Sydney and Melbourne. Is that an objection to the representatives of Victoria ? Is it an objection to the representatives of New South Wales ? If the latter say that they wish the Federal territory to be nearer Sydney than Melbourne, they at once admit that they have some ulterior design or motive in making that selection. This territory would not only be equidistant from the two cities, but would possess almost every climate that could be desired. Some honorable senators who have not been there will say that they could not live there ; that the wind would blow the hair off their heads. But many persons who have never been in Southern Monaro have had their hair blown off their heads. In this territory we find fertile country. Some persons may ask - &#34; If it is fertile country, why was it not developed; long ago ? &#34; In the northern portions of New South Wales we find very fertile country which has only been partially developed. In Riverina we find some country which is very fertile - why has it not been developed ? According to all accounts there is some very fine country called Batlow - why has it not been developed <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Simply because it would not bring grist to the mill of the Sydney commercialists. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows very well that nothing has ever been done in New South Wales that did not have the effect of increasing the importance of Sydney. Anything that has been done by private enterprise in any portion of the territory of that State that would have the effect of jeopardizing the position of Sydney has been blanketed by the New South Wales Government on the very first opportunity. One has only to go to Twofold Bay to find evidence of that fact. The tableland on which Bombala is situated is exceedingly fertile in many places. There may be rough ranges, but when one gets half way to Eden, one reaches a stretch of country very similar to the high lands near Adelaide, and capable of equal development. For fruit-growing, vegetable-growing, and production of all descriptions, there is not a better place in all Australia. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of that description. Therefore, who will tell us. that this is not a suitable place for the Federal Capital <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not wish to weary honorable senators by a description of the country, but I should like them to go and see it for themselves. When some honorable senators tell us that they are going to vote, first, to hang up the decision for six months, and then for such a site as would delay the final selection, I am almost inclined to vote against the site which they support. I do not like conduct of that description. I should like to see them more straightforward in their actions. If they are favorable to bringing the Federal Capital into existence as soon as possible they should say so. If they are in favour of repudiating the obligation we are under to New South Wales and the Commonwealth, they should declare themselves to that effect, and not adopt a course of action that is not creditable to themselves or to Parliament. The enormous costwhich <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> talks about need not alarm the Commonwealth for a moment. In the first place, if we select the Federal Capital to-night, how many years will it require before very large sums of money can be spent? The first thing would be to enter into negotiations with the New South Go- j vera ment to acquire the land ; and, judging from the present temper of that body, those negotiations would extend over two or three years. Then the territory would have to be surveyed ; all the preliminary clearing would have to be done; competitive designs for public buildings would have to be invited ; and tenders would have to be called for. The representatives of &#34;Victoria, who are anxious that the Federal Parliament should remain in occupancy of this building for ten or fifteen years, need have no alarm. We could proceed gradually with the work. Every year we could devote &#163;100,000 out of revenue, or accumulate that amount of money, for the purposes of the capital, and thus prevent the necessity of borrowing. We should be quite justified in doing that, and could after a while erect all the buildings that are really necessary for the accommodation of the Commonwealth Parliament and its officers. We are not going to enter upon the policy outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> as quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles.</inline> We are not going to build mansions for the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, and the other members of the Commonwealth Go\ eminent. Those who are to occupy these high positions will have to stay at a hotel or provide house accommodation for themselves. If we were to build houses for the Federal Ministers, we should have just as much right to provide cottages for the Labour members. Indeed, that would be only fair. We pay the Federal Ministers large salaries, and they are quite able to build houses for themselves. Certainly, if they are to have houses, we should let the poor labour men have four-roomed cottages. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> was simply drawing the long bow, or painting a very exaggerated picture, by his remarks in that respect. We have been told that every one who has inquired into the position lays stress upon the need for accessibility. What does accessibility mean, to most people ? It means the easiest way to get to a place, and the easiest method of getting away again. If we chose the best position answering that description, we should select Albury, Yass, or Goulbourn. But accessibility to my mind has nothing whatever to do with present convenience. It has to do with the possibility of providing conveniences. If we can provide at Tumut, Bombala, or Lake  George, facilities equal to those provided in any other site, the first-named places will be just as accessible as the others. Suppose we were to select Bombala. The New South Wales Government has two or three times placed upon the Estimates a sum of money for building a railway from Cooma to Bombala. The Victorian Government has two or three times surveyed lines from Bairnsdale to Delegate on the border. If we were to select any site on the Southern Monaro plains, there would be a race between New South Wales and Victoria as to which would first connect its territory with the Federal territory. If the States decided not to build railways, we should still be in an independent position. All we should have to do - and we have full power under the Constitution to do it - would be to construct a railway to Eden, and to buy a yacht similar to the one owned by the New South Wales Government. Then the Federal Government could take its members of Parliament anywhere it liked. Therefore, in respect to accessibility, Bombala is the site that is most favoured by nature. If Victoria decided to build a railway from Bairnsdale to the border, it would run through country that, up to the present time, is undeveloped. It is country that is well worthy of development, and in which a railway would pay handsomely. It has great potentialities in regard to mining, agriculture, and the timber trade. </para>

                    <para class="block">South &#34;Wales Government undertakes the construction of a railway from Cooma or not, because when the Commonwealth Government has constructed a line from the tableland to Eden, if a line were constructed to Kiama, north of Jervis Bay, we should do just as much good as would be done by New South Wales by constructing the Cooma line. If that line were constructed it would practically be the shortest route from Melbourne to Sydney. That would be an advantage from which we as a Commonwealth would have the right to profit. I do not care what the opinion of honorable senators may be ; if they do not give me substantial facts to prove that Tumut or any other place possesses advantages superior to those of Bombala I shall vote for what I think is the best site. I come to my conclusion as to what is the best site, not from the reports of experts, in whom I have very little confidence, but from my own observation. We are told that near Tumut there are the Yarrangobilly Caves; but it must be remembered that these caves are not very far from Bombala. If one goes to Dalgety and is taken to Buckley&#39;s Crossing, one of the charms claimed for the district is that it is in proximity to those very caves; and it seems strange that what is a charm on one side of the Dividing Range should be urged as an objection on the other side. I shall not be moved from my determination except for substantial reasons, though, of course, the substantial reasons must not come in the form of brickbats or missiles of that description. I hope this matter will receive the closest attention, and that nothing definite will be done until we have made up our minds as to what is the best site, not in the interests of New South Wales or Victoria, but in the interests of the people of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has already given some indication of the enormous cost which would be involved by our remaining in Melbourne or removing to Sydney. That honorable senator has shown conclusively that the most economical position in which the seat of government can be established is on fairly good land with a fairly good climate, where the least possible improvements have been made, so that the people of Australia may get every advantage from the unearned increment. 1 hope that the matter will be settled this session, and that future generations of Australians will have no reason to regret the choice we make. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to say a few words in reply on the main question. I am very glad to be confirmed in the opinion I formed originally that there is a minority, and only a small minority, in favour of delay, and that a majority of senators sincerely desire that this matter shall be settled. I trust that the purposes of delay will not be served by any differences of opinion between the two Houses. I consider that the Government are not to blame for the fact that this measure has been brought forward at a late period of the session. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator after</inline> senator on the other side has in an off-hand way, without going into details, asserted that the Government are to be blamed for any delay there may have been. </para>

                            <para>- The same assertion has been made by honorable senators on my own side. No doubt the charge arises from the fact that every senator in his own mind places the public business in a certain order of importance, and is of opinion that particular measures ought to be introduced before others. But it is for the Government to determine the order in which business shall be introduced. Honorable senators know what a vast amount of business this Parliament had to undertake, and the Government ought to be acquitted of having in any way unnecessarily delayed this particular matter. I must strongly protest against the statements which have been made in reference to my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs. Whatever may be said of the Government generally, it is most unfair to charge the Minister for Trade and Customs with having at any time been slack in pressing this matter of the Federal Capital. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt, the honorable gentleman has been called all sorts of hard names ; but it is most unjust that any delay there may have been should be ascribed to his action. I rose particularly to reply to observations which have been made as to the proper interpretation of section 1 25 of the Constitution. It has been said by some honorable senators, and apparently accepted by others as if it were a statement which did not admit of contradiction, that under that section it is absolutely necessary that in the first place New South Wales should cede territory. One honorable senator went so far as to say that it is absolutely useless for us now to pass a Bill of this nature - that we must wait until New South Wales has ceded some territory before we express the determination of Parliament as to where the seat of government shall be. </para>

                            <para>- Whether we proceed hy resolution or by Bill, we are told that it is not proper to express the determination now, but that we ought to wait until New South Wales grants the territory. By a wrong construction of the section, it is said that if New South Wales should refuse - because that is what the contention means - to cede any territory, then all the provisions of the Constitution with regard to choosing the seat of government are absolutely nugatory. It is contended that, under such circumstances, we could not move at all, because there is no power to acquire territory by any other means. But that is not the opinion generally held on the subject. When I introduced the Bill, I said it was not my desire to raise these questions. I could see no necessity for doing so, for the reason that the Government of New South Wales have been hitherto, and are now, working so amicably with us as to leave no doubt whatever that as soon as we indicate in a proper constitutional manner the particular territory we desire, they will be ready and willing to do all that is necessary to a friendly settlement of the question. As representing the Commonwealth Government, I cannot allow to pass unchallenged the statement that if the Government of New South Wales were to refuse to cede territory there would be no power to acquire land for the seat of government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is the only  speaker  up to the present who has pointed out that under sub-section 39 of section 51 there is power to do everything incidental to the carrying out of the main objects of the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is quite at liberty to express that opinion. I admit that the interpretation of section 125 presents considerable difficulty. I know that section 111 provides for the surrender of territory, but I am not prepared to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that, in the last resort, there is no power in the Constitution to enable us to acquire land as Federal territory. To show that an opinion has been given on this subject contrary to that which has been so very confidently expressed in the Senate this afternoon, I refer honorable senators to <inline font-style="italic">Quick</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Garran.</inline> At page 981, in a discussion of the term &#34;Granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth,&#34; the authors say - </para>

In the Adelaide Bill it was provided simply that the seat of government &#34;shall be determined by the Parliament.&#34; At the Melbourne session, the words &#34;and shall be within Federal territory &#34; were added. This was expanded by the Premier&#39;s Conference to read, &#34;And shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth.&#34; The object appears to have been to supplement the power of surrender or acceptance by a special power of acquisition, to make it clear that the duty of the Federal Parliament to determine the site could not be blocked by a refusal of New South Wales to surrender the territory needed. </para>

                    <para>This view seems to be supported by a general perusal of the section. There is a clear declaration that the seat of government is to be determined by the Parliament, but there is no declaration that the concurrence of New South Wales is essential. Had that been the intention, it would &#39; surely have been expressly mentioned, and not, left to be gathered by implication - and especially by implication from such wide words as &#34;granted or acquired.&#34; </para>
                    <para class="block">This also will be found interesting as the opinion of the authors of this work upon several of the contentions which have been urged during this debate - &#34;Against this construction it may be urged that whilst the Federal territory is to contain an. area of &#34;not less than 100 square miles&#34; no maximum limit is fixed. It can hardly be supposed that the Federal Parliament has power to federalize an unlimited area of New South Wales as a seat of government. But the answer seems to be that the power only extends to the acquisition of an area reasonably necessary for the purpose ; and, perhaps, in the case of acquisition without surrender, the reasonable maximum would be held not to exceed, or greatly exceed, the minimum of 100 square miles.&#34; </para>

The honorable senator who said that misquoted the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor.</inline> What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> said was that the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Bill would apply to the acquisition of land for the Federal Capital ; but seeing that it was proposed by the Government to deal with that land after it was acquired in a special way, it would be necessary to pass another Bill in order to do so. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> on that occasion - but no objection appears to have been taken to the former&#39;s remarks. At page 2017 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for last year, in introducing the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition </para>

                    <para>Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> is reported to have said : - </para>
                    <para>There is a third class of acquisition of land for public purposes, which I will deal with separately, for, although the provisions of this Bill will be applicable to it, it will have to be dealt with principally by a special enactment. This is the acquisition of the Federal territory which may be necessary for the site of the Federal Capital. It is impossible to sa3&#39; now whether the territory which will be determined upon for the site of the Federal Capital will be property entirely granted by the State of New South Wales, as it may be, or whether it will be necessary to use the compulsory powers of the Constitution in order to acquire some site. But whichever course is followed, the Government have determined to make a new departure with regard to the holding of property within that territory. They have decided to reserve for the people of the Commonwealth for all time the benefit of the increase in value. They will not alienate a single foot of territory ; but it will be dealt with on some principle of leasing which will preserve to the people the benefit of what has been described as &#34;the unearned increment&#34; ; that is to say, the benefit which arises from the increasing value brought about by the whole people of the Commonwealth . That will be preserved for all time to the Commonwealth itself. It is quite evident that such a principle cannot be dealt with just in what may be described as a slap-dash method. </para>

                        <para>I am pointing out that this Bill may be and can be applied in respect of land acquired for the purpose of Federal territory ; but I am pointing out .it the same time that the considerations which must dominate the disposition of the Federal territory will be of so different a kind from that which applies to ordinal land that it will be necessary to have special legislation to deal with the acquisition and disposition of lands in the Federal territory. I make this statement, although it is but incidentally now, because this is a matter of policy which has been determined upon and which it is just as well that the Senate should be aware of as soon as possible. So that honorable members who ma}&#39; be discussing this question, having in view the Federal territory in which the Federal Capital will be, must always remember that there must be some special legislation to deal with that, and that the application of this Bill to territories such as I have described must be more or less incidental. </para>

I had no desire to touch upon this subject, but I have dealt with it somewhat fully to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was absolutely wrong in telling us that we ought to wait until New South Wales has come forward and ceded certain territory. That would appear to be an upside-down arrangement. </para>

What we have to do under section 125 of the Constitution is to express the determination of Parliament. If honorable senators will turn to the first section of the Constitution they will find that Parliament consists of the King, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, and I say that the only constitutional way in which we can express the determination of Parliament upon this subject is by means of a Bill passed by both Houses of the Federal Parliament and assented to by the King. </para>

                            <para>- In seeking to obtain an expression by means of a Bill of the determination of Parliament with regard to the seat of government, it is proper that the Government should take this course of action, in order to enable the Government of New South Wales to meet us, as I believe they will, in a friendly spirit. I had no wish to raise this question of the acquisition of territory. In introducing the second reading of the Bill, I said that I was perfectly sure that the Government of New South Wales would be prepared to meet us. There was no necessity whatever to raise the question; but, as it had been raised, I felt bound to point out that the opinion expressed by some honorable senators is not the opinion held by the Government on this subject. </para>

                        <para>- It is not competent for the Committee to now take part in an exhaustive ballot, but it appears to me that the same result may be achieved by adopting the ordinary method of procedure. Suppose, for instance, that some honorable senator desired to propose the insertion of the word &#34; Albury &#34; before the word &#34; Tumut,&#34; it would be competent for him to do so. If that proposal were rejected, it would be open for any other honorable senator to move the insertion of the word &#34; Bombala,&#34; and take a similar vote. If the name of any other site be inserted, the word &#34; Tumut &#34; must, of course, be subsequently omitted. </para>

                            <para>- I fear that the effect of following your suggestion will be to bring about an exhaustive ballot by indirect methods. If the amendment were carried we should have to proceed immediately afterwards to omit the word &#34; Tumut.&#34; Honorable senators who desire to proceed to an exhaustive ballot will have an opportunity of doing so, whilst others who would prefer to proceed in the ordinary way, as in connexion with other Bills, will be unable to adopt the course which they think most desirable. The invariable practice is to first strike out the words to which objec-tion is taken, and to afterwards insert others. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree with your suggestion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> as to the&#39; course to be followed. If the Committee do not agree to the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> some other honorable senator will be at liberty to propose another site. If we decide to insert the name of any other site we can then omit Tumut. If, however, each of the other sites fails to secure a majority of votes, Tumut will remain in the Rill. &#34;When I spoke on the motion for the second reading of the Bill I indicated my ideas in reference to the extent of the Federal territory. I wish to intimate that it does not matter to me what site is selected by the Committee, but, in discussing this Bill, it is absolutely necessary that we should determine the area of the Federal territory. If Tumut be chosen, I am quite prepared to allow the other provisions of the measure to pass, with the exception of that relating to the area of the territory which is to be acquired. If Bombala be selected, I shall be content to adopt a similar course. But I wish to alter the boundaries of the territory as prescribed in this Bill so that it shall include an area extending from the 35th parallel of latitude south adjoining the Murrumbidgee, and extending to the River Murray and the Victorian border running eastward. In the case of Lyndhurst, it does not matter whether we secure a territory of one square mile or 100 square miles, because the advantages to be derived by the Commonwealth from such a selection are <inline font-style="italic">nU,</inline> whereas the benefits to be reaped by New South Wales are paramount. I think that the representatives of any other State in the Commonwealth ought to regard this question from that stand-point, remembering that they should not study the interests of those who wish to have the Federal Capital located within sight of the masts of the ships in Port Jackson. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to speak upon this question with very great brevity, because I recognise that the Senate has arrived at a decision which relieves certain of its members of considerable difficulty. Had the Senate decided to take an exhaustive ballot upon these sites, some of us would have been placed in the invidious position of having to record eight votes against sites, each of which constitutes a centre of population in our respective electorates. Whilst I am at all times willing to face the music in support of what I believe to be right, I do not desire needlessly to come to loggerheads with those whom I represent. </para>

                            <para>.- I intend to stop speaking every time I am interrupted. Surely I am not offending anybody by offering these few remarks. It is little short of disgraceful that I am not allowed to speak without interruption. I repeat that no other locality can give me less support than Lyndhurst, and in advocating the claims of that particular site I must, therefore, be speaking without the smallest shadow of suspicion that I wish to gain any political advantage. But I advocate its selection upon two or three grounds. First of all there is no other site which to my mind offers greater advantages of centrality than does Lyndhurst. Its climate is admirable. As regards accessibility it would be possible to commence building operations there tomorrow morning, because the railway runs through the proposed site of the city streets. Consequently we have in the Lyndhurst site centrality for the present and the future. We have also the conditions of an admirable climate and of accessibility from the south. By the completion of two lines of railway which are in course of construction, Lyndhurst will become more central for South Australia and Western Australia, and in the near future for Queensland also, than any one of the other sites except that of Armidale, for which I entertain a great regard, but the selection of which I do not advocate, because I recognise that it would be futile to do so. For similar reasons I do not propose to speak about any of the other sites. I will further add that Lyndhurst possesses an admirable water supply. I make that statement upon the authority of one of the chief officers in the Water Conservation Department of New South Wales. How the Federal Capital Sites Commission managed to tot up the extraordinary sum which they estimate would be required to provide an adequate water supply for Lyndhurst is so utterly beyond the limits of human comprehension, that I must put it down to one of those accidents which sometimes happen, even to Royal Commissions. The water supply of that particular site is second to none. Moreover, the private lands there could be purchased more cheaply than could the lands at any of the other sites. </para>

In view of the fact that two Royal Commissions are diametrically opposed to one another upon a good many points, I do not think it is advisable that any honorable senator should endeavour to achieve perfection as regards his information. I merely speak from knowledge which I obtained personally on the ground. </para>

Nevertheless, Engineer Manning, of the Water Conservation Department of New South Wales -an officer who was engaged upon the Lyndhurst site for months taking the levels - assured me in conversation the other day that a single embankment would suffice to conserve enough water there to construct a winding lake through and beyond the limits of the city site upwards of thirty miles in length. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manning</inline> is wrong I cannot pretend to put him right ; but I have no reason to suppose that he is wrong. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to support the amendment. Last night, in speaking upon the second reading of the Bill, I advanced several reasons which weighed very strongly with me in coming to the conclusion that Lyndhurst was about the most favorably situated site of the whole of those which were examined by the Federal Capital Sites Commission. I also pointed out that in the other Chamber a very large vote was cast in favour of Lyndhurst. Although I know that very much exception has been taken to that vote upon the ground that it was largely given by the representatives of New South Wales, I do not think that is a reason of which one need be ashamed. I take it that the representatives of the parent State are better acquainted with the position and value of the different sites than are the representatives of other States in this Parliament. When, therefore, we find a consensus of opinion in New South Wales in favour of one particular site it indicates very clearly that it must be possessed of very great merit. I do not intend to detain the Committee by reading any of the quotations which I put before the Senate yesterday with regard to the suitability of Lyndhurst, but there are one or two other matters to which I desire to refer. The report of the Commissioners points out in unmistakable terms the suitability of that site for the purposes of a great city. It shows that if the capital were erected there it would have all the advantages of centrality and picturesqueness, and that the site is desirable from every other point of view.  </para>

                            <para>.- The report states that the Coombing rivulet scheme would be sufficient for a population of 40,000, and that when the population of the capital exceeded that total, it would be necessary to resort to a second scheme. Many years will elapse however before the population of the capital is anything like 40,000, So much for the question of water supply. I should like now to point out to honorable senators that when the appointment of the Royal Commission was being discussed in another place, the present Minister for Trade and Customs, said - </para>

                    <para>I have always recognised that the neighbourhood of Orange and the sites proposed at Bathurst and Lyndhurst are really part and parcel of the same area, and would have to be included in the Federal territory if any site near the Canobolas were selected, otherwise the territory which is available at the latter place would be insufficient. </para>

                    <para>There is no doubt that Orange, Bathurst, and Lyndhurst occupy an advantageous situation in relation to all the Australian capitals, and if a proposal which I submitted in 1885 had been adopted, and the railway had been extended from Cobar to Broken Hill, and a connexion had been made between Wellington or Dubbo and Werris Creek, there would have been, practically, a direct route to those sites from both Adelaide and Brisbane, and it would have been impossible to overlook them. I understand that the Government of New South Wales is about to construct both of the lines to which I have referred, which will thus furnish us with a direct line to Brisbane. Honorable members will remember that when they undertook the last parliamentary visit of inspection, they left here by the express and reached Orange in time for breakfast. The distance between the two places is much shorter than is the distance from Melbourne to Sydney. ... In addition to that, when the line was carried through to Adelaide, and later on to Perth, Orange will occupy a most unique position. </para>
                    <para class="block">I think that this quotation from a speech which was delivered some twelve months or more ago shows clearly that the Minister for Trade and Customs, whose ministerial life has been spent for the most part in New South W ales, thinks, from his knowledge of the State, that Orange would be a most suitable site for the capital, and would meet all the requirements of the present time. As has also been pointed out, the population of Australia is gradually centreing more around that site than around any other; and in any case the railways mentioned by the Minister, if constructed, will give the residents of the various States an opportunity to reach Lyndhurst without touching at either of the capital cities of Victoria or New South Wales. I trust that honorable senators, when called upon to vote, will bear in mind the several advantages that appertain to Lyndhurst. </para>

                            <para>.- I am glad to have that statement from the honorable senator. It is possible, and indeed probable, that there will not be a majority of votes cast in favour of Lyndhurst, but if an honorable senator really considers a certain site to be the most suitable for the capital it is just as well that he should state his reasons for that belief. It may be that the names of two or three other sites will be submitted to the Committee, and that one or other of them will be inserted in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- With all due respect to the honorable senator I contend that we did not. Albury from the standpoint of situation has very great claims to consideration, and there are other advantages associated with the Table Top site. I visited that site only a few clays ago, and those who have inspected it will bear me out in saying that it possesses certain advantages which are not to be found at any of the other sites. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question. While I admit that, in many respects, it would be an eligible site, I must point out that there is another site which has even greater claims to consideration. The drawback to Albury as a site for the capital is the difficulty in regard to water supply, and there is a further obstacle in relation to the generating of electric power, which does not apply to Bombala. The Snowy River, in a very short distance, descends in an easterly direction to the sea from the extreme altitude of nearly 9,000 feet ; while the Murray traverses a distance of nearly 2,000 miles from the same altitude before it reaches the sea. There must, therefore be a great difference in the power of the two streams to generate electricity. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is referring to the mouth of the river, while I am speaking of the altitude of the stream at its origin. It is true that the mouth of the river is 500 feet below the site, but at its source it is some thousands of feet above it. The Snowy River has its origin in Mount Kosciusko, and with a volume of water descending at that rapid rate we have the possibility of generating power, not only for electric traction, but also for electric lighting and other purposes. In that site there are possibilities that do not exist in connexion with any site which may be chosen in the district of Albury. Although for the purpose of a city Albury might furnish the best possible locality, it labours under the disadvantages which I have indicated, and consequently I cannot vote for its selection. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to emphasize the point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> because I have an amendment to move, which I think is absolutely necessary to give effect to the determination of the Committee. I take it, sir, that many honorable senators voted for Bombala on the ground, first, that , in its vicinity there is a port which we might be able to acquire, and that the capital ought to have a port ; and, secondly, that there is a large area of no particular value at the present moment which might be included in the Federal territory, and acquired without much trouble or opposition on the part of the mother State. The words which I desire to insert after &#34;Bombala,&#34; unless the Attorney-General has a better amendment to move, are - </para>

                <para class="block">It seems to me that an amendment of that kind is absolutely necessary in order to give effect to the determination of the Committee. I take it that we have no particular survey of this land, and no one can tell me, whether the territory between Bombala and the port of Twofold Bay embraces an area of 1,000, 2,000, or 3,000 square miles. I am firmly of opinion that we have no right to acquire such a large area against the will of New South Wales. I therefore desire to safeguard our Act by putting in a provision that it may be declared void by proclamation, if within a certain time we do not acquire that area, and do not arrange on satisfactory terms for access to the seat of government by railway extensions from Bairnsdale, in Victoria, and from Cooma, in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- If we are to strike out a word which is to indicate the intention of the Committee to strike out the remainder of the clause, honorable senators, who support the amendment, will discover that no other words will be put in. The result will be that we shall lose the provision with regard to the area being a thousand square miles. Those honorable senators who have carefully read the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Commissioner</inline> Oliver, will see that he recommends to the Government of New South Wales that an area of something like 1,000 square miles should be ceded. We certainly do not want to lose the 1,000 square miles provision. Therefore, I ask the Chairman to put the question, that after the word &#34;Bombala,&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment be inserted. Undoubtedly that amendment will be defeated. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> can move his amendment with respect to Twofold Bay, and that will be defeated. Thus we shall retain the 1,000 square miles provision. If the course which I recommend is not taken, alterations will be made in the clause which I am satisfied that the majority of honorable senators do not desire to make. </para>

We shall have those who agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> combining with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and those who believe in having 1,000 square miles, also combining with him, to create a blank. In order to give the Committee an intelligent method of expressing its opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment should come immediately after the word &#34; Bombala.&#34; Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment can afterwards be considered on its merits, or we can take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> amendment if he intends to propose one. Speaking for myself, I desire to strike out the words relating to the Murray and the Murrumbidgee, but to retain the 1,000 square miles provision. How can I express that opinion by striking out the word &#34;and <inline font-style="italic">&#34;?</inline></para>

                        <para>- Some strange confusion has arisen as to what would be the effect of my amendment. I would willingly withdraw it if there were any justification for so doing ; but there is none, as I shall show. It has been suggested by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that there will be some strange and unholy combination to support my amendment. But the opposite will be the case. I propose to strike out the word &#34; and &#34; with a view of striking out the remainder of the clause. The combinations will take place to defeat me, because both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will require the word &#34; and &#34; in order to make sense of the amendments which they intend to propose. Therefore, they will vote against me. For these reasons, without any desire to be discourteous, I decline to withdraw it. </para>

                    <para>- I am afraid that by the time we finish discussing this question we shall find ourselves in a very awkward fix. We shall find that we have reduced this Bill to an absolute farce. Honorable senators cannot realize too clearly the importance of the views that have been expressed by more than one honorable senator as to the true construction of the 125th section of the Constitution. It has been pointed out very clearly by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and others that we have no power to dictate to the Government of New South Wales with regard to taking an extensive area such as 100 square miles. If that be the case how can we go to the Government of New South -Wales with a request for a greater area ? </para>

                        <para>- I am discussing the question of the 1,000 square miles. We know perfectly well that there is to be a territory only for the purpose of establishing the capital city of the Commonwealth, and the Constitution says that there shall be no territory granted or acquired by the Commonwealth of an area less than 100 square miles, all the Crown land within that territory to be given free by the Government of New South Wales. Honorable senators ought to realize that it is proposed to approach the Government of New South Wales with a demand that there shall be granted 1,000 square miles, or, failing that, the Commonwealth will not have the territory at Bombala. It has been stated by the Government of New South Wales over and over again that they are prepared to cede the necessary area of 100 square miles prescribed by law ; and why should we put ourselves in the position of asking more than we are entitled to under the Constitution? It has been pointed out that if we want a cession of territory we have to go to New South Wales for it. Do honorable senators not know that the rights of the States are protected by the Constitution against the inroads of the Commonwealth - that no new State can be formed out of a State except by the consent of that State ? It is utterly absurd to attempt to dictate to New South Wales in this matter. Within the last few days it has been stated on both sides in the Parliament of New South Wales that that State is not prepared to give more than 100 square miles. </para>

                        <para>.- An Act of Parliament is supposed to direct something or other. Section 124 provides how a State may be formed, and that can only be done with the consent of the Parliaments of the States affected. It is not until we come to section 125 that we find really what our powers are in regard to establishing a capital site. I defy any honorable senator to find any other provision within the Constitution enabling us to obtain land for the purposes of a Federal territory. Some honorable senators have laid stress on the word &#34;acquire,&#34; but that word does not help them in the slightest. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators are only beating the wind when they attempt to lay down lines which clearly cannot be followed out. If there had been a simple resolution to the effect that it was desirable for the Government to obtain 1,000 square miles, nobody could have objected ; and, as a matter of order and right, it would only be for the Government of New South Wales to state whether they could or could not agree to the request. I ask honorable senators to realize that we are entitled only to the area prescribed in the Constitution, and that it is much better to confine our attention to that area. If we desire that there should be further negotiations, the proper course is to invite the Government by resolutions to conduct those negotiations ; but to place the stipulation in an Act of Parliament means that we shall accept the Bombala site, contingent only on New South Wales granting additional areas of land. We are really going to the New South Wales Government with a &#34; stand and deliver&#34; demand. If the New South Wales Government say that they are prepared to give 100 square miles and no more, can it be believed that the majority of honorable senators, holding the views they do in regard to the particular site, would be prepared to accept that area? Honorable senators are urging that we should acquire not only the tableland, but also the port sixty miles away. I do not deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment, because that is really not before us now; though if my objection to the 1,000 square miles is so strong, it may be realized how much stronger my opposition would be to the proposal to take over what is really a great State. I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will get half-a-dozen members to support his amendment. In dealing with matters of this kind it is well to look facts </para>

                    <para>- I have not taken part in this debate hitherto, because I really question the utility of our occupying time over this matter. The majority of honorable senators have decided on a certain site, and ther vote means that the question of the selection of the Federal territory is to be hung up indefinitely. </para>

                        <para>- I should like the honorable senator to be a little magnanimous. He and his colleagues have had three years&#39; experience of the Federal Parliament, and, judging from the local newspapers, they do not think we are very desirable citizens, and are willing that we should go away to the State of New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has submitted a proposal which, if carried, will indefinitely postpone the establishment of a Federal Capital. I am not prepared to vote for the establishment of a seat of government unless the territory is to be made self-supporting. I refuse to place a burden on the taxpayers of the backblocks of Queensland, for example, in the shape of a contribution towards meeting the cost of the expensive buildings which will be necessary within the Federal territory. </para>

Clause 125 enables us to acquire an area of not less than 100 square miles - that is the minimum.

                        <para>- Those are the very exceptional occasions when extremes meet and the honorable senator enjoys a few lucid intervals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in speaking upon the second reading of the Bill, mentioned the fact that some years ago the site of the city of Melbourne was bought for a few thousand pounds. To-day, without regard to this or any other of the buildings in the city, it has improved in value until it is worth &#163;15,000,000. We cannot expect that the site of the seat of government of the Commonwealth will attain a value of several millions for many years to come ; but we can expect that there will be a value given to the land which we select as the seat of government that will go to some one. If we act wisely we shall see that that value shall accrue to the Commonwealth, and in that way we may be able to save the general taxpayer from bearing a burden. If on the other hand we adopt the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and some other honorable senators, the collectively earned increment will go to private speculators in land, to land jobbers, and land boomsters, like the Honorable Thomas Bent and other people. With the knowledge which we have of the disasters which follow land booms, and the knowledge we possess respecting the immense wealth secured by people like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Daniel</inline> Cooper in New South Wales, by acquiring land at a low price and then leasing it, it is our duty to see that we keep the collectively earned increment of Commonwealth lands for the people of the Commonwealth. If I thought that the acquisition of the Federal territory was going to result in a burden being imposed on the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to meet the expenditure necessary for the establishment of the Federal Capital, I should refuse to go out of Melbourne, notwithstanding the fact that the refusal would be a breach of the compact made with New South Wales to select the capital in that State. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and other honorable senators from New South Wales tell us that not a single representative from New South Wales will be returned to the next Federal Parliament who will not be pledged against the proposal that 1,000 square miles should be acquired by the Commonwealth as Federal territory, I tell those honorable senators that I do not believe they know public opinion in New South Wales. I have no doubt that the decision arrived at by the Committee this evening will have the effect of hanging up the settlement of this question until next session. But I believe that we shall then find that every representative from New South Wales returned to the House of Representatives or to the Senate will be in favour, not only of giving us 1,000 square miles- </para>

                    <para>- I thought that Ministers, knowing full well, as I suppose they did, that Bombala would be selected by a large majority of the Committee of the Senate, would have been ready with some provision which would have enabled us to give effect to the determination of the Committee, which, I presume, will be the determination of the Senate. I know well that one cannot draft an important amendment at the table during a debate ; but I should like to inform honorable senators that I intend to propose a second amendment, and I would ask them to listen to the two amendments stated together. Honorable senators will see that while they will not clear away the difficulties, they indicate a way&#39; in which they can be got rid of. I believe most firmly that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> was perfectly right when he said that the Constitution does not authorize us to take 1,000 square miles of territory. Honorable senators must recollect that the Constitution is a contract. It is not in this case a question of fixing the site. Wherever we fix the site, New South Wales has contracted to grant the whole of the Crown land within the Federal area free of cost. I am satisfied, however, that any High Court will put a reasonable limit upon the words not less than 100 square miles. I cannot conceive for a moment that it will be admitted that we can multiply the area stated in the Constitution by ten, and multiply in the same way the area of Crown lands which the mother State must give to the Commonwealth free of charge. I, therefore, desire to indicate that when my turn comes I shall move the two following amendments. After the word &#34; should,&#34; line 5, I propose to add the following words : - </para>

                <para class="block">My reason for the amendment, in a word, is that I am told that it would require 2,000 square miles to take in the seat of government at Bombala with a strip of land fourteen miles wide down to the port. I am informed by a man who knows more of Federal law and other law than I do, because he is a leading and experienced barrister, that if we do fix the seat of government this session it can be unfixed again. I see no reason why it should not. If honorable senators fix the seat of government of the Commonwealth in a moribund Parliament, and the electors, by a substantial voice, speak in a contrary direction, I believe the Federal Parliament will be in a position to repeal the Act after an election. I wish to proceed upon business lines. I have no desire to give a whip hand over us to those with whom we may Have to deal in order to acquire Federal territory, a port, or anything else, and I therefore propose to add these words as a second amendment - </para>

                    <para>- I am in some doubt upon that question after the way in which some of the votes have resulted. I did not think that the majority of the Committee would sanction the proposal that the Commonwealth should acquire an area of not less than 1,000 square miles. The thirty fifth parallel of latitude enters the coast of New South Wales to the north of Jervis Bay, and the extensive territory contemplated by the amendment would embrace one-third of the coast line of New South Wales. I think that as a representative of the State which is threatened, I have a right to protest against what I regard as the biggest legislative steal ever proposed in a civilized community. </para>

It is proposed to take fully a third of the coast line of New South Wales, and to embrace within the Federal territory a very large proportion of the best lands in the State. </para>

                <para>That after the word &#34; should,&#34; line 5, the following words be inserted: - &#34;comprise an area of not less than 100 square miles, and also the port of Twofold Bay, the whole of the land surrounding such port to a depth of five miles, and a strip of land of the width of ten miles, extending from the scat of government to Twofold Bay. &#34; </para>
                <para class="block">I presume that honorable senators who have, selected Bombala desire to acquire a port, and to have the territory in the immediate neighbourhood of such port to themselves. I am informed by a gentleman who knows something about the matter that a territory of 1,000 square miles would not be sufficient if we desired to include a site for the capital at Bombala, the port of Twofold Bay, and a strip of territory connecting the two. It certainly would not enable us to acquire the area extending in another direction necessary for the purposes of water supply. I long ago stated that I should not move an amendment if the Government were prepared to submit a proper proposal to us, but I contend that an area of 1,000 square miles would not be sufficient. Then, again, we could only acquire such an enormous area by negotiation and compromise. We should have no right to demand it. I judge from the debate which took place in another place, and from the remarks of honorable senators, that they would like to have the port of Twofold Bay entirely under the control of the Commonwealth, and not to leave one portion of that harbor in the hands of the State. It would not be desirable to have a dual harbor control, and therefore I think that some amendment of the kind submitted is necessary. I suggest that this discussion might be allowed to proceed a little further, and that it should then be adjourned in order to afford the Government an opportunity to present a proposal. </para>

Other honorable senators however will probably wish to be informed of the reasons underlying my proposal. My view is that the land in the districts of Bombala, Tumut, and Orange - the three places which were recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> - have considerably increased in value since that gentleman presented his report. That additional value has resulted from a belief that one of these sites will be the future seat of government of the Commonwealth. Not a single act on the part of any resident of that area is responsible for the enhanced value of which I speak. I claim that that increased value properly belongs to the people of the Commonwealth, and that they should receive the benefit of it. The House of Representatives has decided that the value of the land which may be acquired shall be taken to be its value upon the 1st January, 1903. </para>

Therefore when he talks about lightening the burden of taxation upon the miner, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> speaks of reducing the burden which is imposed upon the person who uses the mangle, I consider that their professions are somewhat hypocritical. This is a practical proposal to relieve the taxpayer. I visited Tumut quite recently, and I found that since the Federal Capital Sites Commission presented their report the land there has increased in value to the extent of some pounds per acre. </para>

                        <para>- If the VicePresident&#39;s answer resembles some of his explanations it will not be very satisfactory. I repeat that since it was suggested that Tumut, Orange, and Bombala were places at which the seat of government of the Commonwealth should be established, the land there has increased in value. Who is responsible for that increased value? Certainly not the people who own the land. If any added value has accrued to that land by reason of the fact that it is proposed to establish the Federal Capital at one of these sites, that value I submit is the property of the people of the Commonwealth. Therefore I claim that we shall inflict no injustice whatever by making the provisions of this clause retrospective. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has alluded to the fact that in various localities which have been offered by the New South Wales Government as eligible sites for the Federal Capital land values have increased. He attributes that increase to the knowledge that one of these sites will probably be chosen as the future seat of government of the Commonwealth. But I. would point out to him that since these sites were offered to the Commonwealth land values in districts which have a reliable rainfall have increased all over Australia. In South Australia for example the value of agricultural land within Goyder&#39;s line of rainfall has increased by more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per acre. That is not due to the fact that the future Federal Capital is likely to be located in that territory. The same influences have operated in New South Wales. Land values there have increased because the price of produce, such as wheat, hay, and meat, has increased. As far as the Government have been able to ascertain there has been no increased value given to the lands surrounding Bombala, Tumut, and Orange by reason of the likelihood that one of those sites would be chosen for the Federal Capital. The value of lands of a similar character hundreds and thousands of miles distant has increased in an equal degree. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> does not wish us to rob the owners of these lands of the benefits to which they are justly entitled. The. Government must oppose the amendment. </para>

                    (New South Wales).I should like to inform the Committee of something which has transpired in New South Wales, and which absolutely confirms the statement of the &#34;Vice-President of the Executive Council. The Land Tax Commissioners there, in the exercise of the powers which are conferred upon them by the Land Tax Act, have recently been appraising the values upon which that tax is levied. Their invariable experience has been that, as the result of the drought, the values of land situated within the better rainfall districts have shown an upward tendency, not merely in particular localities, but throughout the whole of the State. On the other hand, land values in the more droughty districts have exhibited a falling tendency. Even if it could be shown that an increase has occurred in the value of certain of the Bombala lands, it would be beyond the ingenuity of man to determine how much of that increase is due to the improved condition of affairs generally, and how much to the probability that the locality in question will be chosen as the Federal Capital site. I would further ask if the laws which we pass are to deal with one individual in one way and with another in another? The Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act declares that where we resume land under that Act we must acquire it at its value upon the 1st January previously. Why should not the same principle apply here ? Above all things it is necessary in resuming these lands to provide that if an error is made it shall not be in the nature of a distinct injustice to the individuals who are chiefly affected by our action.

                        <para>- I have no desire that this Bill shall be sent to another place in a form which will enable holes to be picked in it. I am of opinion that the owners of property whose land is acquired by us should be liberally treated. I think that they ought to be allowed to add 10 per cent. to the value of their land as compensation for compulsory sale ; but that they should not receive one penny in respect of a rise in value due to any report or hope or suspicion of the selection of a site in the neighbourhood of their property. I, therefore, hold that certain words in section 19 of the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act should be added to the clause. </para>

If my amendment be out of order, I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to say how a clause relating to the assessment of the value of the land comprising the Federal territory - which is something quite apart from the question -of the seat of government - is within the order of leave. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the honorable senator, I would point out, first of all, that this Bill has been sent up from another place, and that, even if some of its provisions were beyond the order of leave, it is questionable how far the Senate, as the Chamber in which the measure was not originated, would be justified in rejecting them. The question of area relates to the question of the seat of government. I admit that if the measure originated in this Chamber there would be grave doubt as to how far we should be justified in inserting in it the provisions contained in clause 3 ; but, as this is simply a Bill to determine the site of the seat of government, it cannot be extended so as to provide against the principle of alienation. The question of alienation of land has nothing to do with the determination of the seat of government. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of the Bill is solely to determine the seat of government of the Commonwealth, the Constitution Act providing of course that the seat of government shall be within the Federal territory. It is quite true that reference is made in the Bill to territory, but the honorable senator is seeking to introduce something which would deal with the internal management of that territory. It appears to me that the amendment which he now proposes is not within the scope of the Bill. He might as well seek to introduce something referring to the liquor traffic as to the internal management of the land within that territory ; and, consequently, I think that the amendment is out of order. </para>

                    I am satisfied now, on reconsideration, that you are right. If you had not ruled the amendment out of order, I should have withdrawn it, because several honorable senators indicated to me that, whilst they were in favour of such a proposition, they thought that it could more properly be dealt with in another measure.

                    to the fact that his own colleague has told me that an area of 1,500 square miles, if not more, will be wanted. With that information in our possession, why should we allow the Bill to leave the Committee in this shape? We have selected the Bombala site, and suggested an area which would not give us the very port for which we have been asking. We shall have to go up in one direction to obtain the necessary area in order to procure a water supply and electric power. We shall have to get all the lands surrounding the capital site, and then take a broad strip to Twofold Bay and the lands surrounding that port.
