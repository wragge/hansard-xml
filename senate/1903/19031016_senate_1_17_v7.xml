                    <para>-CoI. NEILD (New South Wales). - In consequence of the urgency of business, I omitted to mention last night certain matters in connexion with this Bill. At this stage I desire to draw attention to them. I am glad, sir, to have the opportunity of saying what I have to say under your able and impartial chairmanship. We have been dealing with ' a measure which has been largely supported ' by the report of a Royal Commission. I desire to again draw attention to the fact of the unprecedented suppression of the minutes of its proceedings. We have certain results recorded in its report, but we have been denied all knowledge of the divisions which produced those results, and, therefore, denied all knowledge of the value of the report as representing the opinions of those whose names are attached to it. On more than one occasion I was promised - I admit, not definitely - by the late, Vice-President of the Executive Council that, if it were possible, the minutes of proceedings should be forthcoming ; but previously it was stated that those minutes - the official records of a Royal Commission - were the personal property of the Chairman, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will bear out my statement. Subsequently, the Ministry gave way to some extent, and I was promised that if possible these minutes should be obtained and laid upon the table, but, when I asked for a fulfilment of the promise later on, all knowledge of any such promise was denied, and, observing the uselessness of attempting to extract the information, I am now drawing attention to its absence. It is positively without precedent that a Royal Commission's report, involving meeting after meeting, discussion after discussion, and division after division, should be distributed and made use of as a method for passing a Bill without either House of the Parliament, or the public who are so intimately concerned, possessing tho slightest knowledge as to whether the decisions or opinions expressed in the document were arrived at unanimously or by bare majorities. If I remember aright the Royal Commission consisted of four gentlemen: We have no means of knowing whether the report embodies the opinions of all the Commissioners, or the opinions represented by the Chairman's casting vote. We do not know how many Commissioners were present when the decisions were arrived at. We are left in the blankest ignorance as to the value of a report presented under such circumstances. And, while I impute nothing to the discredit of any member of the ]:oval Commission, it must be patent to any ono who considers the question that the report may be after all only the report of the  Chairman,  achieved by his casting vote, because we know from the daily press that some Commissioners were not infrequently absent from illness or duty, and that sometimes one of them would go to make a re-inspection of a site. We know from the daily press,, assuming that it waa accurate, that the Commissioners were not always together in the later stages of their proceedings. I wish to know, even at this late hour, why it is that this important information is denied to us. What would be thought of the decisions of a Parliament which had no records) but which presented certain documents and signed resolutions, and the public were not permitted to know by what process those resolutions were achieved <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I have also to draw attention to that which I think constitutes a grave element of scandal. At the end of last May it came to my knowledge from a very high authoritative source, as well, as from sources of less consequence1 and importance, that the report which had been drawn up - if not by direct recommendation, at least by implication in its various parts - so strongly placed Lyndhurst in the front position that the matter was as good as settled so far as the Commissioners were concerned. I made that fact public, and I have not disclosed to this day the source of my information, except to the editor of the newspaper who published my article, and who was quite satisfied to publish it on the strength of the authority I named to him. What happened <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> On the day after the appearance of that article it was announced by the Minister, through the representatives of the press in both Melbourne and Sydney, and also in Parliament, that the report was ready, and was to come out immediately . Day after day there was an announcement that it was to appear the next day, or the day following. But what took place ? The Royal Commission obtained the services of a new secretary, and the report did not make its appearance for three weeks. The Parliament had heard from the mouth of the Minister that the report was ready, and would make its appearance, first of all, on the following Thursday, next on the following Monday, and then on the following Tuesday; but it did not appear for three weeks. In the meanwhile, the old secretary was got rid of, a new secretary was obtained, and a delay of three weeks or more took place ; and then the report came out in the peculiar form that the two sites which were situated within the electorate of a certain Minister received first and second nominations. I do not say that there is any connexion between this extraordinary state of affairs, and the refusal to produce the public records of the Commission. I deny that these records are the property of the Chairman. I know that 100 years ago it was the practice of Ministers of the Crown in Great. Britain, when they retired from office, to carry with them such records as they pleased. That is the reason why so many of the records of Great Britain are in an unsatisfactory condition, and why many important public documents are found among private papers instead of in the public archives. To contend, however, in these days of enlightenment, of shorthand writers and: typists, that the records of a public commission, prepared in the public time, and written on stationery supplied at public expense, by persons receiving payment from, the Commonwealth, are the personal property of the Chairman, is most peculiar. I do not desire to use strong language, but I say that no suggestion is more calculated to raise suspicion in men's minds. Some of the other matters which transpired in connexion with the report of the Commission afford further reason for wonderment. I will take the case of the Dalgety site. When the motion relating to the appointment of a Commission of Experts was being discussed in this Chamber, I moved that Dalgety should be included among the sites to be reported upon by the Commissioners. Upon a division being ] taken, however, I failed in my object by i five votes. At a later stage, on the same day, the then Vice-President of - the Executive Council assured the Senate that the Commission would visit Dalgety and investigate the claims of that site. What happened <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The Commission went to Bombala, and I ascertained from representations made to me by letter and telegram : that they refused to go on to Dalgety. I  communicated with the then Prime Minister - the Minister having charge of this particular work being in Western Australia - and I received a reply to the effect that the Commission would go to Dalgety. I met the Prime Minister shortly afterwards, and </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">I said - "Of course their visit will include the taking of evidence <inline font-style="italic">1"</inline> I admit that the reply which I received was somewhat sphinx like. It was - "I shall do nothing to prevent them from taking evidence." When the Commission reached Dalgety, however, they took no evidence. What was the use of the promise made in this Chamber, and repeated in the telegram of the Prime Minister, if it was intended that the Commission should only ride round in a coach, without asking any questions or taking any evidence? Why was the visit made, unless as a pretence? There are other peculiar circumstances connected with the report upon the Dalgety site. Some one with more interest or more influence than myself succeeded, after the report of the Commission had been completed and presented to Parliament, in securing a special expedition to Dalgety on the part of the Commission. For what reason was this done ? I do not know, and I have never heard a reason given. The report upon the Dalgety site was accompanied by a map which reflects mo credit upon those responsible for its compilation. Right through the proposed site at Dalgety runs- the finest stream for the purposes of water supply iri Australia - the Snowy River. If honorable senators will look at the map submitted by the Commission - this extraordinary secret tribunal, which fears to make its discussions and differences public ; and that there were differences of the most serious character amongst the Commissioners I positively affirm - they will find that the map in question contains no drawing of the Snowy River itself. Little subsidiary creeks or water-courses, which are probably dry for nine months in the year, are carefully drawn ; but the Snowy River is omitted from the plan. For the purposes of a city supply, water could be conducted from the Snowy River by means of a flume, which a few diggers could construct - a flume as simple as that to be found at the Cataract at Launceston, and yet we find no indication of this splendid stream which would afford a never failing supply. It is considered good form always to be pleasant, and it is always nice to meet with nice people, but some one must have courage enough to direct attention to the absence of truth, as well as to fawn over the truth when it occasionally appears. I am now directing attention to what seems to me to be the absence of a form of truth from the proceedings of the Commission. At the risk of appearing not only ungracious but disagreeable, I feel it my duty to offer these criticisms. It is always pleasant to receive an honest compliment, or to pay a compliment where it is honestly due. On the other hand, it is always unpleasant to have to direct attention to matters of a disagreeable character. I never have been, and I hope I never shall be, forgetful of my public duty to the extent of failing to refer to matters of an undesirable or improper character to which I think attention should be drawn. With regard to the Bill in its present form, I also desire to say a few words. As to the large area which it is sought to acquire, and which the Vice-President, of the Executive Council so nobly championed, I should like to point out that 1,000 square miles cannot possibly be required for building sites. The area must be utilized for some other purposes, probably for farming. It is generally understood that the leasing system will be adopted by the Commonwealth in connexion with the territory under its control. I admit that that is not laid down in the Bill ; but it has been so prominently referred to in the debates in both. Houses that ic would be mere affectation to ignore the fact that it is not intended to alienate any land within the Federal territory. If the Commonwealth had an area of 1,000 square miles the question would arise, " Where are you going to find tenants to occupy 1,000 square miles of farming leaseholds, whilst on every side of this Bellamyite settlement people can obtain freeholds under the land laws of New South Wales by paying a deposit of only 2s. per acre ? " No one knows better than the "VicePresident of the Executive Council that one of the most prominent characteristics of Britishers is the desire to own land. A Britisher will own a piece of land, even though his title be strangled by a mortgage, rather than take land on lease without a mortgage. Therefore, I contend that if we adopt the leasing system in connexion with the Federal territory, the larger the area the less likely shall we be to secure its useful occupation for farming purposes. I put this forward as a reason why it is undesirable to claim so large an area as 1,000 square miles. As to the legal question, regarding the proper interpretation of the Constitution, I do not in- | tend to occupy the attention of the. Senate. </para>
                <para class="block">I When we had no High Court, discussions upon that point might have been justifiable. Now, however, that that tribunal has been constituted, discussions upon such a subject, in an assembly consisting chiefly of laymen, would be mere beating of the air. I shall not trespass upon such delicate ground. What I have said has been said with a feeling of the obligation we are under. I hope that whatever be the fate of this Bill - and it seems to me to be more than doubtful; to be, indeed, a foregone conclusion that we are solemnly enacting some thing which is never to have the force of law - I hope at least that those who are charged by the people of Australia with the maintenance of the obligations of the Constitution will not place too much responsibility upon the individual electors of the Commonwealth, and have too little regard for the solemn obligations imposed upon those who are elected. </para>

He states that he has information upon which he can rely that it was intended to recommend another portion of the State of New South Wales as a site for the Federal Capital. It would be well for the Government to make some effort to ascertain how far that statement is correct. The Government would be perfectly justified, even if the Commission have the right to retain the minutes of their proceedings, in obtaining copies of them, in order that they, for their own information and satisfaction, and incidentally for the satisfaction of Parliament, may ascertain exactly how the decisions of the Commission were arrived at. </para>

                        <para>- It is most unusual for the minutes of a Royal Commission to be retained or held by its members as their own private property. A Commission is appointed by the Government to do a specific work. Certain men from different States were chosen in this case. It is .quite right that members of the Parliament should know exactly the views entertained by the men representing their individual States. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that the minutes should not be regarded as the private property of the Commissioners, but as the property of the Government. As State property they are documents to which we should have access. The Government should obtain possession of them. I do not look upon the Capital site question as having been definitely settled, and if that view be correct,, it would be well for the Government to make up their mind to have the matter thoroughly inquired into and investigated for their own satisfaction and for the satisfaction of the members of this Parliament. I recognise, as every honorable senator must do, that there is a very large majority in favour of the Bill as it stands, and that it would be utterly futile and useless to object to the adoption of the report and the third reading. Those of us who are opposed to some of its provisions have entered our protest as strongly as we could. But we must recognise that there must be finally in dealing with Bills, although some of them may come before us again. I should like before resuming my seat to remind the Senate of one or two facts that I think should be borne in mind in connexion with the settlement of the site. I take the opportunity of mentioning them now instead of saying anything when the motion for the third reading of the Bill is submitted. The Bombala site has been approved of by a large majority of honorable senators. The area to be taken and the legality of taking it have been discussed. Therefore, 1 put those matters on one side just now, simply saying that I recognise, as do honorable senators generally, that if the State of New South Wales is a willing party to any proposal that may emanate from this Parliament to take 1,000 square miles of territory, there is nothing more to be said. Because the State of New South Wales has the right to say - " We will give you 1,000 square miles," or whatever area may be determined upon, so long as it is done in a constitutional manner. There is a possibility of taking 1,000 square miles, but it cannot be done without the consent of New South Wales. With respect to the Bombala site, even the reports which have been placed before us show that its selection would make very serious demands upon the revenues, not only of the Commonwealth but of the States of Victoria and New South Wales. Bombala is situated at a considerable distance from a railway. The nearest railway station is Cooma, which is sixty miles- from Bombala, and the cost of constructing a railway from Cooma to Bombala has been estimated at £337,000. </para>

                        <para>- The building of such a line might be a good investment for New South Wales. If so, the railway would be made. But the expenditure would have to be incurred immediately. Furthermore, the site of the Capital would probably be some little distance from the town of Bombala. But I do not take that into consideration now, because the additional cost thereby involved would be small, and such as might be involved by the selection of any other site. The point is that immediate expenditure would be necessary. It has been urged all through, when we were discussing the sites, that we should consider the convenience of members in reference to means of access to and from the Capital. It is estimated that to build a line from Bombala to Bairnsdale would cost £1,181,500. I do not know the length of it! </para>

                        <para>.- We must wait for the construction of these railways for it to be convenient for Parliament to meet at Bombala. But some honorable senators are still more ambitious. They wish to see Eden a Commonwealth port, and to connect it with Bombala. To do that would mean the expenditure - I believe I am mentioning a very low estimate - of upwards of £500,000 for fifty-five or sixty miles of railway. The line would run through hills and mountains - a most difficult route. I am not an engineer, and cannot say whether the actual expenditure would probably be more than that estimate, but I know that it would not be much less than £500,000. Then, to make Twofold Bay an up-to-date port, we should have to provide wharfage accommodation and other conveniences. It has been estimated that another £1,200,000 would be required in that direction. </para>

                        <para>.- I know that; but, if we are to have a seaport for the Capital, it will have to be an up to date port, thoroughly equipped with all modern conveniences for the reception of shipping at all times. If only a quarter of the expenditure which I have mentioned would have to be incurred, the Bombala site would involve an expenditure which is not involved in connexion with any other site that has been brought under the consideration of the Senate. There is a strong feeling in the minds of the members of this Parliament that no expenditure of an extravagant character should be entered upon. Both in New South Wales and Victoria circumstances are such that it is absolutely necessary for the States Parliaments, whatever they may wish to do, to be very careful with regard to the expenditure of public money and going before the British public for the raising of loans for the construction of railways and other public works. I do not say that money for the purposes of the Federal Capital could not be borrowed, but under existing circumstances we could not profitably borrow any very large sum of money to construct any works in Australia to-day. When we have regard to that fact, and remember that the professed object of many members of this Parliament is that the Federal Capital shall not be a myth, but a reality. I say that to select a site upon which a city will not be built until many years hence is to keep the promise made to New South Wales in word, but to break it in deed. There is no object in selecting the Capital site unless we contemplate within a reasonable period proceeding with the erection of suitable buildings. There is no charm in saying that a particular area is to be the seat of government some fifty years hence. If the site is not to be in use until twenty or fifty years hence it will be better to wait until that time before making the selection. </para>

But that is not a reason why we should remain in this position longer than is necessary. It is far better that the Federal Parliament should have its own home, and be independent. Our Parliament House should be erected by ourselves, and paid for by ourselves. No one State should be expected to contribute to the expense of Federation in an undue proportion. All the States are equally interested, and all of them ouffht to be called upon to contribute in equal degree. In making these remarks I wish to emphasize that it appears to me to be quite clear that the amount of expenditure which will be involved in the site selected - that is assuming that the difficulties with the New South'Wales Government will be got over - means putting off the establishment of the Capital for many years. I trust that whatever our selection may be it will be one which will enable us forthwith to lay out our Capital, and begin the erection of suitable buildings in. which the Parliament may be housed. I have no sympathy with those who declare that the accommodation, of Parliament at the future seat of government will involve an expenditure of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000. We do not want a palatial pile of buildings such as those in which we assemble at the present time. There is no necessity to spend £500,000 or £600,000 in the erection of the Houses of Parliament. I venture to think that a building which would be adequate for our purposes could be erected for £100,000. An additional £100,000 ought to supply all the necessary accommodation for the officials who are connected with the management of the Commonwealth business. I urge honorable senators, many of whom will appear before the electors within the next few weeks, to endeavour to disabuse the public mind of the idea that we intend to incur an extravagant expenditure of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000. No such desire is entertained by any honorable senator. </para>

                    <para>- Last night I endeavoured unsuccessfully to obtain from the Vice-President of the Executive Council some idea as to whether the acquisition of a territory df 1,000 square miles would really carry out the intention of the Senate. I was informed that at least 1,500 square miles were required. Since looking at the map and inquiring into the question, it appears to me that an area of 1,000 square miles would give us about ten miles square in the vicinity of Bombala and a strip of country fifteen miles wide extending down to Twofold Bay. If we obtain that, we shall have an. oblong strip of country - a sort of no man's land - between the Federal Capital and the State of Victoria. Whether New South Wales will grant us 1,000 square miles is a question for subsequent negotiation. I think that the position which I took up on a previous occasion has been amply justified by every hour's discussion.' We are attempting to settle this matter before we are ready, whilst a number of matters have still to be considered and the most delicate negotiations have yet to be conducted. This is a question in which the electors may desire to have some voice, and as it will probably be shelved during the present session, I trust that every candidate will be asked by the electors to express his views upon it. As far as I can understand, we have to consider three interests - first, those of the citizens of the Commonwealth generally ; secondly, those of the mother State, in which the capital is to be established'; and thirdly, those of Victoria, which has a right to the temporary seat of government until the permanent seat has been determined. Our first consideration should be the general body of the people. In view of the enormous check which our progress has sustained by reason of the drought; of the falling off in our exports, of the exodus of our population, of the decrease in our birth rate, and of the diminished value of our stocks, I hold that the selection of a Federal Capital should not be " rushed." Of course, I know my New South Wales friends will say that that statement means that the electors will be asked to repudiate the obligation to give New South Wales the permanent seat of government. I do not suggest anything of the kind. I think that the people of the States will be loyal to the Constitution. But, because the seat of government must be in New South Wales, it does not follow that it should be established there at the earliest possible moment, and that the citizens of the Commonwealth ought not to be allowed to consider the enormous check which our progress has sustained. Although I voted for Bombala. I be- lieve that the acquisition of that site ; will prove most expensive. Of course ; a line of railway from Cooma to Bom- </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Ibala might very easily be constructed i for an expenditure of £300,000, and that would afford very reasonable access to the new Capital for representatives of New South Wales; but what about the representatives of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania? They would be compelled to spend hours and hours in travelling, unless the Victorian railway were» extended from Bairnsdale to the Capital. ' All these questions are questions for delicate negotiation. They require the very gravest consideration. Our financial position must be the foundation of the whole scheme. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted words of mine in which I declared that Melbourne might very well remain the temporary seat of government for ten or fifteen years. Seeing how disastrously our financial position has been affected during the past few years, I have no hesitation in affirming that it would be a good thing if, for fifteen or twenty years, we did not incur any very great expenditure upon a Federal Capital. I believe that it will take eight or ten years to restore us to the financial position which we occupied three years ago. Our losses of both sheep and cattle must have an injurious effect upon our finances for some years. When we have recovered our position, it will be time enough to seriously think about spending much money upon the Federal Capital project. Before concluding, I desire to say a word or two in reference to the rights of Victoria. Has that State no rights in this matter <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I was really astonished to hear senators from New South Wales argue that because the Commonwealth Parliament occupies the Victorian Parliamentary buildings rent free, we should bustle out of Melbourne as fast as possible.' Certainly this State has treated us very generously, but we are under no obligation to it. Its people are aware that Melbourne must be the temporary seat of government, and accordingly they have placed these buildings at our disposal. </para>
                <para class="block">But we must remember that as a result of the consideration which has been extended to us, they have been obliged to spend £50,000 or £60,000 in fitting up another building to accommodate their State Parliament. Therefore, they undoubtedly have moral rights in this matter. When they consented to the mother State being granted the permanent seat of government, one of those rights was that the temporary seat of government should not be removed from Melbourne until some good reason could be shown for it. Yet, from the moment that the Commonwealth was inaugurated, the representatives of New South Wales seemed to think it our imperative duty to at once select the Federal Capital. I should have thought it our duty to pass the necessary machinery measures for the government of the Commonwealth. I shall not divide the Senate upon this matter, because I accept the decision which was arrived at by the Committee last night. At the same time I protest against what has been done, and having regard to the interests of the citizens of Australia generally and their financial position in particular, if I am again returned to the. Senate, I shall do my best to see that a proper site for the Federal Capital is selected. </para>

I cannot fail to remark, however, that the tone of this morning's debate constitutes a very great improvement upon that which characterized the proceedings of last night. I am glad to see that our New South Wales friends are disposed to view our decision in a somewhat different light from that in which they previously saw it. I am satisfied that as time goes on they will come to agree that in the selection of Bombala a wise choice was made. I believe that the great majority of the people of Australia are this morning very well satisfied with the choice made by the Senate. </para>

Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> been in the position of Victorian senators, he would have | liked to see the Federal seat of government l retained in Melbourne as long as possible ; I and in my opinion there has been too much j hurling of charges at the representatives of the State in which the Federal Parliament meets. Bombala is a truly Australian site, and its choice will reflect credit on us in the future. If we can only secure a sufficient area to make the territory self supporting, our work of yesterday will be approved by generations to come. </para>

The honorable senator has never been in Western Australia, and he has not taken the trouble to visit Bombala which he now condemns. The honorable senator has seen Tumut, and has become so intoxicated with the charms of that place that he can see advantages nowhere else. I have nothing to gain personally by voting for Bombala, to which as a site for the Federal Capital there is not even a " good second." Honorable senators have travelled over the Bombala territory, and have had an opportunity of judging of its merits; and those who support the selection of Bombala are taking a proper step. </para>

                        <para>- They spent two days at Bombala, and travelling over a great extent of territory, had splendid i opportunities for observation. This part of Australia has never had justice done to it by either New South Wales or Victoria. Between the railway terminus at Cooma, in New South Wales, and the railway terminus at Bairnsdale, in Victoria, there is a large tract of country entirely undeveloped ; and, so far as I can judge, unless the Federal territory be fixed there, that country will, owing to the jealousy of the two States, remain undeveloped for a long time to come. It is rich land, to which neither one State nor the other has any more right than had the blackfellows who formerly roamed over it, if no more be done towards its development than has been done up to the present time. If it be made Federal territory it may reasonably be expected that a large area of fertile country will be brought under cultivation to the benefit of the whole of Australia. I congratulate the Senate on the choice of the Bombala site. </para>

                    <para>- I realize that honorable senators are in favour of Bombala, to the exclusion of every other site, and it is bad business " flogging a dead horse." But, seeing that the unusual course has been followed by honorable senators of making observations on the motion for the adoption of the report, I may as well occupy a moment or two in presenting my views. With sorrow a i id sadness I am forced to the conclusion that a great act of repudiation is about to be perpetrated by honorable senators - the repudiation of a solemn moral obligation to New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will possess his soul in patience - or as much of a soul as he has - he will hear my reasons for arriving at my conclusion. I regard what the Senate has done, and is at present determined to maintain, as an act of repudiation. When the bargain was made between the States it was granted as a concession to New South Wales, that the Federal Capital should be within its borders. Obviously that meant that the Federal Capital was to be in a sufficiently central position in New South Wales as to come within the New South Wales sphere of influence rather than within the sphere of Victorian influence. </para>

                <para>SenatorDAWSON. - I was giving reasons why I regard the action of the Senate as repudiation. Victoria, having received the concession that the Federal Parliament must temporarily meet in Melbourne, now wants to repudiate her bargain with New South Wales. There were two classes of senators who voted for the Bombala site. One class consisted of senators who really believe that Bombala is the most suitable place for the Federal Capital, and the other class consisted of Victorian senators, who believe that if Bombala be selected the seat of government will never be moved from Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- I could possibly say a little more on the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie, when I interjected something about the sand hills of Western Australia, was very pert and somewhat impertinent. The honorable senator put my interjection down to my ignorance, which he suggested was also responsible for my objection to Bombala. A further suggestion the honorable senator made was that I was intoxicated with the charms of Tumut, and so I am, becausel know Tumut and appreciate it. But to senators and members of the House of Representatives who charge me with having visited only one site, I reply that I do know that one site thoroughly, whereas they do not thoroughly know any site. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DeLargie</inline> states that the visiting senators spent two days at Bombala. Great heavens ! The honorable senators, by spending two. whole days, claim to know all about the 1,000 square miles or the 10,000 square miles they would prefer, and all about the resources of the territory to be able to contrast it with all the other suggested sites. My experience is that knowledge is acquired by continuous and intelligent observation, though it appears that some people are able to acquire it by intuition in two days. My knowledge of the Tumut district is the result of a visit of two months' duration. During the first week I was unable to move about much, but thenceforward I was continuously travelling day after day ; and it was after a month's travel that I began to realize fully the value of the territory and to become enamoured of it. There is not a member of this Parliament who can conscientiously say that on the occasion of the Parliamentary inspection of the sites he saw anything of the country surrounding Tumut. The same remark will apply to the inspection of all the other sites visited by honorable members on that occasion. When it is asserted that I have seen only one site, I feel constrained to say that I stand in a position superior to that occupied by any other honorable senator. I can say that I have properly inspected at least one site, and that is more than others can claim to have done. Those who took part in the Parliamentary inspection travelled at the rate at which the sparrow flies, and yet they assert that they saw the country. As to the suggestion that I am ignorant of Western Australia, I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie that I visited that State long before he went there. I went there as a prospector to assist in opening up the country in a way that makes it possible for those who represent that State to obtain a living, and the charge that I know nothing of the State comes ill from any honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>- I favour Tumut as against Bombala, because of the report of experienced and unbiased men drawn from various States, and appointed to make an expert examination of the sites. They had ample time to make a very careful inspection of the suggested sites, and no limit was placed upon their expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that Tumut is the only site that I have visited, but I know the country well, and it is because of my intimate knowledge of its characteristics that I feel so enthusiastic in regard to it. My knowledge of the features of the other sites is derived from the report supplied by the Commissioners, who are unmistakably opposed to the selection of Bombala. Whether they are right or not I am not absolutely prepared to say ; but judging from their report on Tumut, which I know to be accurate, I should imagine that their statements in regard to the. other sites may be fully relied upon. I have yet to learn from any enthusiastic Bombalaite that any part of their report on that site can be said to be inaccurate. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that I should. I have been in the neighbourhood of Bombala, although I have not actually visited the place, and I have heard much about it from people who have resided in the district. On the occasion that I visited Cooma I was very pleased to get out of it, and I am not at all anxious to return. I venture, in conclusion, to say that I feel satisfied that in the selection of Bombala the bargain made with New South Wales has been repudiated, for it means that there never will be a Capital city. Whilst we should give some consideration to the understanding arrived at between the two larger States of the Commonwealth, we must not overlook the smaller States. I was one of those who, prior to the Federal referendum in Queensland, took an active part in urging the people of that State to accept the Constitution Bill, and one of the strong points which I made on public platforms during the campaign was that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales, and not less than 100 miles from Sydney. It was never for a moment contemplated that a site would be selected which is, in name, New South Wales territory, but, in effect, belongs to Victoria. If it were open to us to select a site in any of the States, I should be able to point to a place in Queensland which is even more desirable than Tumut. If the compact with New South Wales had not to be considered, then, as a Queenslander, I should believe it my duty to vote for Armidale, but I consider it well that we should honorably carry out the obligation imposed upon us. </para>

                    <para>- Some honorable senators appear to be anxious that we should at once go to a division, and, but for certain statements which have just been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> I should not stand in the way of the gratification of that desire. The honorable senator took what he admitted to be an unusual course in speaking at length on the motion for the adoption of the report, and, as I have not yet addressed myself to this question, I intend to take this opportunity to say a few words in regard to it. I was anxious that a vote should be taken last night, and refrained from speaking during the second reading debate ; but when the honorable senator asserts that the selection of Bombala - a site for which I voted - is tantamount to repudiation of the bargain made with New South Wales, I feel that it, devolves upon every honorable senator who is opposed to the policy of repudiation to show that that statement is without foundation. Some honorable senators may have supported the selection of Bombala because of a desire to repudiate the bargain ; but my vote was due to no such consideration. I supported that site simply because I believe it to be the most truly national one, and because, after a careful study of the various reports which have been submitted to us, I consider it to be the best. I have not been to Bombala, but I have visited Tumut, Lyndhurst, Orange, Bathurst, and Albury, and, relying on the evidence before us, and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each particular site, I hold that Bombala is the most suitable place for the establishment of the Capital. I shall not detain the Senate by making a lengthy speech. I merely wish to show distinctly that I utterly repudiate the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson.</inline> I hurl back at him the statement that the people of the parent State voted for Federation only because they believed that the Capital would be under the influence of New South Wales, or, in other words, the influence of Sydney. I hold that the majority of the people of New South Wales will be quite satisfied with the choice we have made. </para>

                        <para>- I do not profess to be familiar with the State j but I believe that a great many people in New South Wales do not share the views entertained by residents of Sydney. I do not think that Sydney represents New South Wales, or Melbourne Victoria, and certainly neither New South Wales nor Victoria represents the whole Federation. I hold, therefore, that, apart altogether from any consideration as to the individual interests of Victoria or New South Wales, the representatives of other States in this Parliament have a right to vote for what they believe to be the best site. We have not departed from the Constitution'; we have selected a site which is in New South Wales territory, and how can it fairly be said that we have repudiated the bargain made with New South Wales 1 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> asserts that he has seen at least one of the sites, and that those who took part in the parliamentary tour of inspection did not have an opportunity to fairly examine any of them. He is so wrapped up in Tumut that he holds that it must be the best. In reply ,to the statements made by the honorable senator I think it is well to put before the Senate the opinion held by at least some of the people of New South Wales in regard to the climate of Tumut, which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> is the best in the world. </para>

                <para>The Albury site is 800 feet on the edge of the great inland plain and exposed to fierce hot winds arising therefrom, which also affect Tumut to some extent. The superiority of the western sites over Albury and Tumut in the matter of altitude is very marked, and, therefore, the advantages of the western sites in the matter of climate are unquestionable. Tumut is also subject to very bleak and cutting blasts during the winter and spring months owing to the proximity of the Snowy Mountains. Data from official sources for many years are available for the three western sites, whereas two returns of temperature from Tumut other than private ones are available, and these only for three years. While the Commissioners' report takes no cognizance of the humidity of the atmosphere at the various sites, it must be apparent that at Tumut, situated in a river valley, shut in by mountains, the humidity must be much greater than on the elevated western plateau - a climate conducive to the occurrence of fogs both in summer and winter. </para>

                        <para>- It is signed by Thomas A. Machattie, president of the western branch of the Federal Capital League. Does it not show that the rivalry between Tumut, Lyndhurst, Bathurst, and Orange is merely petty jealousy on the part of certain provinces in New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Does it not show that in New South Wales this great question of the choice of a site for the Federal Capital has been reduced to one of petty jealousy ? Does it not show that many of the people of that State are influenced more by feelings of provincialism than by anything else, in their view of the respective merits of Lyndhurst, Orange, Bathurst, and Tumut? When we. know these things, and when we | have listened to New South Wales representatives for the last couple of days talking ! of these splendid sites, and contending that  I  a site favoured b}' other honorable senators is | no good, is it not quite within the province of  I  representatives of other States, who favour | the selection of Bombala, to let the public ! know that Tumut is not favoured by every 1 one in New South Wales ? The Senate has  taken a truly national stand in selecting a site which, whilst being within New South "Wales territory, and thus in accordance with the Constitution, is more suitable for the future Capital of the Commonwealth than any other site which has been before us. I am of opinion that when the Bill, us amended, is sent to another place, honorable members there will consider very carefully what they are doing before they decide to reject Bombala. If they do reject Bombala I do not think that very much harm will have been done. We shall, at least have done this : We shall have reduced an admittedly very large question to small proportions: we shall have brought the sites suggested down to two; and the people of Australia at the Federal elections will have something definite before them to make a choice upon. The electors in every one of the States will, I have no doubt, avail themselves of every possible opportunity of securing detailed information with reference to these two sites. They will question candidates as to their opinions regarding them, and, therefore, it may not prove altogether a bad thing if the selection of Bombala by the Senate should mean that the question will not be decided this session. </para>

                    was extremely fortunate in not meeting one of those cyclones during his two months' sojourn at Tumut. When the honorable senator speaks in such a cocksure manner about Tumut I should like to ask him whether he grew cabbages while he was there to test the soil, whether he investigated the water supply, which since his visit has been displaced by a cyclone, whether he tested the quality of the building stone, and the other capabilities of the site? Unless the honorable senator was in a position to test the various capabilities of the site I should say that the opinion he offers as the result of a personal visit of two months is of no more value than the opinion I have formed of Bombala after a two days' visit to that site.

                    <para>- I desire to make a very few remarks on the question of the alleged bargain. It is stated that New South Wales made a bargain on coming into the Federation, and that she would not have come in if the concession had not been made to her of having the Capital within her territory. That is a misrepresentation of the facts and of the truth. Since Australia has been populated the centre of population has been in New South Wales, and has gradually been trending in a northerly direction.. When we entered into Federation there was no doubt at all as to where the Capital ought to be, but there was doubt whether the State of "Victoria would be willing to recognise the fact. That was the only matter in question, and before Federation could be brought about a concession had to be made to the people of Victoria of putting around Sydney the 100-railes limit provision in the Constitution.. That was the only concession made, and it was made to Victoria and not to New South Wales. The section of the Constitution simply recognises the right of New South Wales as the centre of the population of <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> ustralia to have the Capital site within her borders. </para>

These matters involve amendments in several clauses, but there are only three points upon which the two Houses are not at present in accord. I shall deal with them one at a time as they come on for consideration, but I ask the attention of the Committee now, that honorable senators may understand what the House of Representatives proposes. The House of Representatives is willing to accept our amendment in clause 39. with this alteration, that this authority for waiving the payment of this sum shall be officers authorized by the regulations to waive them.

                    <para>- As the clause originally stood, it did not provide for the case of a man incapacitated by an accident while on duty ; but only applied to cases of incapacitation on service. Many honorable senators expressed a desire that the clause should be amended in that direction, and after a good deal of discussion, another clause was drafted ; but it has not been approved of by the House of Representatives for some reason. It is now proposed to restore the original clause, with certain alterations. I think that it meets the wishes of the Senate in another way, and, therefore, I move - " </para>

                    <para>- This is rather a peculiar incident. It will be recollected that I gave notice of certain amendments to the clause. The first amendment was carried, but when I moved the second amendment the Minister suggested that a new clause had better be prepared. A new clause was prepared, and was by the courtesy and generosity of the Minister, inserted on my motion. The other House has objected to what we did, but, strange to say, it has amended the original clause in identically the same way as I proposed to do. I desire to ascertain the opinion of the Attorney-General on a very important point. It is proposed to substitute the word " widow " for the word " wife " ; and to retain the term "family," which is widely indefinite. We had used the phrase " children under sixteen years of age." Will the word " family " include the wife, or will it be necessary to insert the word "widow," leaving the word "wife" to stand? I take it that the Government have differentiated between "widow" and. "family," and, therefore, I think we should retain the word " wife." </para>

                    <para>- I supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> in his proposal for a Council of Defence. I did not quite like the composition of the body, and it was at my suggestion, I think, that he reduced the number of political members from four to two. What we contend for, and cannot get away from, is Ministerial responsibility. The second reason which has been given by the other House for not agreeing to our amendment is, I think, a very good one. According to the London press, the suggestion of Lord Esher, and many of the other Commissioners, which is most favoured, is the following one : - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Re-organize the War Office Council, and define more clearly its functions as an advisory and executive board, presided over by the Secretary of State, in whom, however, final responsibility to Parliament must be reserved. </para>
                <para class="block">If we had a Council of Defence including a member of the Opposition and a supporter of the Ministry in each House, as well as the Minister himself, they would be held to share his responsibility. It would be said at once that the member representing the Opposition would to some extent be responsible and be its mouth-piece. I am, therefore, inclined to think that we ought to have no Council unless the principle of Ministerial responsibility is maintained. I argued that in my opinion it would be maintained. I do not desire to get away from that principle, and, on the whole, I think it is only fair to give the General Officer Commanding a show, so that we may have an opportunity to see the result of his scheme. He has been placed in very disadvantageous circumstances. The military estimates have either been cut to pieces, or he has been told to take them back and remodel them, without being given a hint or suggestion. I think that when we have had a year's experience of his system we shall be in a better position to decide whether to continue that system or to institute a Council of Defence. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> was carried late one Friday evening after some of us had left. I had expressed my opposition to his proposal at a previous stage. I concur with the message of the other House in so far as it suggests that it is desirable for the Commonwealth to have a little further information - which will no doubt be shortly available from England - as to the re-organization of the military administration, before we add an entirely new departure and a novel experiment to the many novel departures and many experiments that we are now trying throughout our Defence service. I think that the Board of Advice which was provided for in the original clause will be a sufficiently wide departure to take from old methods for the present. In a case of this kind, involving, as it necessarily does, a very large amount of technical matter, it is very much better for us to hasten slowly than to do something, which we might find reason to regret, and which we could not alter except by another Bill, while the Board of Advice which is proposed by the Government could be altered by a regulation involving much less trouble, difficulty, and delay. I have pleasure in supporting the motion. </para>

                        <para>- It has been frequently remarked, and with truth, that the Minister is but a figure-head. The Defence Department has been under the control of three different Ministers during- the currency of the present Parliament, and no real responsibility has attached to any one of them. There has been no head to the Department, and, consequently, it has become thoroughly disorganized. It cannot be denied that drastic reforms are necessary. The appointment of a Council of Defence,, such as that contemplated, would not interfere with the responsibility of the Minister to Parliament. I previously instanced the case of the Public Service Commissioner in his relation to the public service, and I showed that there would be no reason to apprehend any interference with the responsibility of the Minister or the control exercised by Parliament over Defence matters. Therefore, I do not. consider that the reason advanced by the House of Representatives will hold good. "We are told that it is inexpedient to alter the existing system until more information is obtained as to the action taken upon recent proposals for the reorganization of the army in England. I would point out, however, that the principle underlying the reforms contemplated in Great Britain is embodied in the proposal for the establishment of a Council of Defence here. </para>

                        <para>- Not the whole of the report ; but we know that, in consequence of the disclosures made regarding the conduct of the recent war in South Africa, the English public are determined that reforms shall be instituted upon lines similar to those now proposed by us. Asimilar change is being made in the United States. Therefore, in view of what is being done in other countries, and in view of the necessity for drastic changes in our own administration, I think that the Senate should persist in its amendment. It is urged by the House of Representatives that the Board of Advice, as proposed in the Bill, would meet existing circumstances, and give time for full consideration. That Board would be appointed under regulations, and, so far as we can gather at present, would not carry out the desires of honorable senators. I see no reason why we should abandon our position, and I shall vote against the motion. </para>

                        <para>- Well, that would add to the number of Ministers, making a total of four. I know that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Dickson was decidedly a man of peace, and that he knew as much about war as I do, which is very little. I do not want to increase my knowledge in that particular. Then we had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> whose transition from the supervision of the delivery of letters to the control of Defence affairs was exceedingly rapid. That honorable and learned gentleman scarcely had time to settle himself in the Minister's chair in that Department before he was transferred to another. No single Minister has had even the most remote opportunity to make himself acquainted with our alleged system of defence. The result is that the administration has been left in the hands of Major-General Hutton. I protest against that system being continued. Chaos exists in the Department at present. We do not exactly know what the policy of the Government is, or whether it has any policy ; but we know that the public wish that our defence forces should consist of citizen soldiers. We know, furthermore, that Major-General Hutton is possessed of the idea that we should have permanent forces, and that he desires to establish a military caste. He wishes to bring Australia under the sway of militarism, similar to that which exists in Europe. The Government have drifted hither and thither without compass, or rudder, or policy, and have been merely hanging on, whilst the Commandant has been strenuously attempting to impose his policy upon the people very much against their will. Under these circumstances, the Senate made a proposal which would tend to bring about an improved state of affairs, but the House of Representatives has seen fit to cast it to the winds. It is urged that Ministerial responsibility would be interfered with. That is a pure, undiluted sham, because there is no such thing as Ministerial responsibility. The mention of it is perfectly farcical. It would be more correct to refer to Ministerial irresponsibility. With regard to the second reason, it may be pointed out that Great Britain, after long experience, and having committed many sad blunders, has come to the conclu-' sion that there is something wrong in the management of its army and navy. I regret very much to say that commercially, and from a military and naval point of view, the defences of Great Britain are absolutely rotten. After wasting thousands of lives and millions of treasure, the public of Great Britain have come to the conclusion that some reform is necessary. It is therefore proposed to establish a Council of Defence. They have tried the scheme we have in operation and found it wanting. "Why should we continue a system which has been discredited in every country which pretends to have a military organization ? The greatest military organization in the world is that of Germany. Germany has a Council of Defence, and in almost every other European country whose military organization is of importance the same system is adopted. Yet we, in the greenness of our youth, refuse to take advantage of the experience of the older countries. I shall repeat the vote which I gave previously, and shall oppose the passing of the Bill if this provision is not inserted. Without it the measure is absolutely useless. </para>

                    <para>- I supported the establishment of a Council of Defence for a number of reasons ; one of which is that I think that the present system of control, when there happens to be an autocrat in command, leads to acts of unfairness being committed. The occasion affords an opportunity to bring under the notice of the Committee a particular instance where, to my knowledge, an officer has received very unfair treatment at the hands of the General Officer Commanding. I do not say that the same treatment might not have been meted out to him by any other official who had been in the place of Major-General Hutton. But, from what I have gathered, I am satisfied that the present system has a tendency towards the perpetration of injustices. The present General Officer Commanding appears, when he has a "set " on a man to follow it up without sufficient reason, and without giving the man a chance, lt will be remembered that Colonel Wallack, of Tasmania, who is an officer of high repute, was in command on board the <inline font-style="italic">Manhattan,</inline> in Sydney, when troops were being despatched to South Africa. He was relieved of his command because some of his men did not appear to be under proper discipline, and returned in liquor after an orgy. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the instance gives support to the argument that when we have an autocrat at the head of our forces, it is right that there should be some check upon his action. A Council of Defence might have seen that justice was done to this officer. The injustice to Colonel Wallack was followed up by Major-General Hutton. At the time of the Easter encampment in Tasmania he should naturally have been ' placed in chief command j but another officer, considerably" his junior, was placed over his head. The only thing alleged against him was want of power to maintain discipline. Compare the treatment, of Colonel Wallack with that meted out to another officer. Take the case of Colonel Lyster. The report of the Royal Commission on the <inline font-style="italic">Drayton Grange</inline> scandal was in the hands of the Defence Department and of the General Officer Commanding. Colonel Lyster was proved to have been absolutely deficient in the power of discipline. Yet he has been appointed to the command of the South Australian Defence forces. But I believe that the change that has lately been made in the head of the Defence Department will tend to bring about a better condition of affairs. I hope that greater Ministerial control will be exercised. While I am still a great believer in a Council of Defence,  yet,seeingthat  the service  is in a state  of chaos, owing to the want of a Defence Act, and as we are within a day or two of the end of the session, I am not going to resist the action of the House of Representatives in regard to this provision. If we find that in the future complaints arise similar to those which have been previously made, and there is evidence that the establishment of a Council of Defence will remedy the grievances, we can take action next session to bring such a body into existence. I believe, and hope, that the new Minister will pay great attention to the universal demand of the people of Australia for the encouragement of our citizen soldiery and our rifle clubs. I am certain that he has more sympathy in that direction than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest had.

                    <para>. - Honorable senators will perceive from this message that the House of Representatives has agreed to our request to reduce the number of superintendents of public works at a salary of £600 each, from four to "two. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">It has, however, disagreed to all the requests which relate to officers of the Senate, whose salaries we desired to restore to the amounts which originally appeared upon the Estimates. Honorable senators will recollect that there are four officers upon the Senate staff who are interested in this matter, namely, the Clerk of Papers and Accountant, the Shorthand Writer and Typist, the housekeeper and doorkeeper, and the President's messenger. The House Committee desired that these officers should receive salaries equal to those which are enjoyed by officers of the House of Representatives who perform similar duties. In the case of two of our officers the request for increases was made by the Joint House Committee. In the case of the others, the recommendation that increases should be paid was made by the House Committee of the Senate only. The objections which have been urged by the other Chamber in opposition to our proposal are that, in the interests of economy, it is not expedient to grant these increases, and that the officers of the Senate do not perform the same quantity of work as do the officers of the House of Representatives. But I would point out that the Clerk of Papers and Accountant upon the Senate staff, who at present receives £380 a year, and whose salary we desire to raise to £420, has to perform the work which is done upon the staff of the House of Representatives by the Clerk of Papers and Accountant, who receives £420, and the Clerk of Records, whose salary is £350. He has also to perform a portion of the work which is done by the Assistant Clerk of Committees and Reading Clerk, whose salary is £300. Thus, one officer upon the Senate staff, at a salary of £3S0, has to perform the work of two and a half clerks upon the staff of the House of Representatives. Our Shorthand Writer and Typist, who is at present receiving £188 per annum, and whose salary we wish to increase to £200, is equivalent to the assistant reading clerk at £200, and is really called upon to do more work. Upon the House of Representatives' staff there is also a junior clerk who is in the receipt of £80 a year, and whose duty it is to help the assistant reading clerk. We have no such corresponding officer. Then I come to the case of the housekeeper and doorkeeper, who receives £205 per annum. We propose to increase his salary to £235, so as to place him upon an equality with the housekeeper and doorkeeper of the House of Representatives. He does exactly the same work and is employed precisely similar hours, because, since I we have handed over to the members of the inter-State press what was formerly a waiting-room, that portion of the building has to remain lighted as long as the Senate . is sitting. ; </para>

Then we desire that the ] salary of the President's messenger shall be ; increased from £188 to £204, which is the amount received by the Speaker's messenger. Practically the volume of work performed i by these officers is the same. There may be some slight difference, owing to the fact ; that the Senate does not sit quite so long as does the House of Representatives ; but for ' all practical purposes it is the same. </para>

                        <para>- No. Then owing | to five officers being employed on the staff of the other House, as against two upon the Senate staff, one of the former can be allowed off duty every alternate night. That, however, cannot be done in the case of the Senate officers. The House of Representatives has five officers to do the work which is performed by two officers upon the Senate staff. The Clerk of the Papers, and the Shorthand Writer and Typist, assist in the work of the Joint House Committee, and are under the control of the Usher of the Black Rod, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward.</inline> A considerable  quantity of work has to be done by that committee, and these officers assist <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward,</inline> in the performance of the duties connected therewith. Then, in the case of the House of Representatives a sum of £60 is provided for " adjustment of salaries " of its officers, whereas no such provision appears upon the Estimates in connexion with the Senate. That vote means that the House of Representatives can increase the I salaries of any of its officers if it considers it desirable so to do. The same item constantly recurs throughout the Estimates. In the Treasurer's Department, for example, a sum of £250 is provided for these adjustments. The Senate, however, has no means of adjusting the salaries of its officers even though they may be entitled to consideration. The President thought it better that a lump sum should be provided upon the Estimates, and that that sum should not be exceeded. I think the other Chamber ought to recognise that upon the ground of common fairness the Senate can claim that the salaries of these officers should be raised- to the amount indicated. As a member of the House Committee I moved in that direction, and the Treasurer very properly placed the increases upon the Estimates. When, however, these items were challenged in the other House, the Government divided upon them, and, unfortunately, were badly beaten. Later on when the Senate requested the House of Representatives to reinstate the increases proposed, the Treasurer did not call for a division. I asked him his reason for not doing so, and lie assured me that it was useless as the great majority of the Committee were opposed to him. </para>

                    <para>- I entirely agree with everything which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said, except with his concluding remarks. I thought that he intended to move in exactly an opposite direction. It is not necessary for me to state the case on behalf of the officers of the Senate who are chiefly concerned, because that has already been very well done by the Vice-President ; but this seems to me to be a matter as between the two Houses rather than one in respect of the claims of particular officers. I venture to think that as a matter of courtesy the House of Representatives ought to allow the Senate to manage its own interna] affairs. That is the almost universal practice in all countries where there are two Houses of Legislature. Nobody will for a moment suggest that the Senate is not as powerful or influential relatively to the House of Representatives as the House of Lords is to the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">House of Commons. On the contrary, we know from its Constitution that it is far more important, and that it wields far greater powers relatively to the other House than does the House of Lords to the House of Commons. Yet what is the practice which is followed in England ? In this connexion I wish to read the following extract from the report of a debate in Committee of Supply of the 17th June, 1870 :- </para>

                        in reply, said that the estimate for the House of Lords was prepared by a Committee of the House of Lords and sent to the Treasury, and it was generally accepted by them without dispute. It was undoubtedly within the competence of the Committee of Supply to modify and even reduce it -

                </quote>
                <para class="block">No one denies that. It is within the legal power of the House of Representatives to cut down the estimates of expenditure upon the Senate staff in the same way as it is within our power to reject the Appropriation Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stanfield</inline> went on to say - but a certain amount of respect was always paid to the estimate, and it had not been their habit to scan it very closely. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Gladstone</inline> said it was his duty to support the statement of the Secretary of the Treasury, because the question was one of a peculiar nature. It was not to be supposed that the Treasury would assume that control over the estimate of the House of Lords that it was their duty to exercise over all ot her estimates. Under the old usage, the House of Lords were accustomed to regulate their own expenditure ; but that House, in a spirit that did them great credit, had abandoned that privilege, and had consented that the expenditure should come under an annual vote. Under these circumstances, it would not be becoming for the Treasury to assume that sort of command over that estimate that they very properly exercised over ordinary estimates. </para>
                <para class="block">That seems to me to lay down the principle which ought to actuate the two branches of the Legislature in dealing with the estimates of the salaries of officers of either House. I venture to think that if the Senate attempted to cut down the salaries which the House of Representatives wished to pay to its officers, the members of that House would not consent to it. I trust that the Senate will look at this matter as one of some importance, because it seems to me that the position which is taken up by the other Chamber is this - " We are the sole judges of what shall be expended, and we intend to treat the Senate in exactly the same way as we treat any other Department." </para>

                        <para>- But the estimates which relate to the salaries of officers of the Senate appear to be regarded by the other Chamber in just the same way as an expenditure for the erection of a post-office. Had it desired to consult the interests of economy, surely it might have exercised its functions to a far larger extent than by cutting down the salaries of officers upon the Senate staff by £98. I do not want to speak strongly, although I feel strongly on the matter. I hope the Senate will vindicate its position. </para>

                    <para>- We have to realize that this is a question of the rights of the Senate, and not a question of the rights of the individual officers whose salaries are affected. The President has clearly shown that the amount of the salaries of the officers of the Senate should be left entirely within our discretion, and that there should be no attempt on the part of the other House to interfere with items of that character. It is a pity that with such a message the other House did not give some reasons for refusing to our requests. In the case of an ordinary Bill, when we propose an amendment, and the other House dissents, reasons are given for that dissent ; and when requests have been submitted, as in the present case, it would be a simple act of courtesy for the other House to state the grounds for their disagreement. It would conduce more to pleasant feeling between the two Houses if that course were adopted, instead of sending us the brief message - </para>

                <para>Senater PEARCE. - At any rate, the facts which have been laid before us to-day were not laid before the House of Representatives as they should have been, and the view that the Senate has no right to request amendments in an Appropriation Bill was not combated by the Ministry. Every honorable senator agrees that the doorkeeper of the Senate is entitled to a salary similar to that paid to the corresponding officer in another place. That is not merely because that salary is paid to the doorkeeper of the House of Representatives, but because the doorkeeper of the Senate is entitled to the salary proposed. In the House of Representatives that view of the matter was never taken ; it was never suggested that the other proposed increases should be refused and that of the doorkeeper granted. If that had been done I should have been prepared to vote as I voted on the previous occasion ; but when I find the House of Representatives rejecting the whole of the proposals without discussing their merits, the only course open to me is to join in what I hope will be the unanimous vote of the Senate - to send the whole of the requests back, determined to insist on them, even to the extent of blocking the Appropriation Bill. </para>

The Constitution certainly gives the House of Representatives precedence in matters of finance, hut it does not make that House absolute. To take the position that the House of Representatives is absolute appears to be straining its powers beyond the endurance of the Senate. So far as I can see, this is an attempt to snuff out the Senate, and if we submit now- </para>

                    (Queensland).- I do not think that the Senate ought to adopt the motion. If honorable senators will only reflect for a moment or two, they will realize that they are asked to take up an altogether untenable position. The Constitution gives the House of Representatives unreserved power over all the finances of the Commonwealth. There is no escape from that position.

                        <para>- The Constitution also provides that the Senate shall have power to request amendments in financial measures, so that it thus gives the two Houses full power over finance. The position now taken up by the Attorney-General, and apparently accepted by other honorable senators, is that the Senate has a right to control its own internal affairs. My contention is that the Senate, is only a portion of Parliament, that the finances of the whole Commonwealth are under the control of Parliament, and that to say that the House of Representatives has no power over the finances of the Senate is to assert that we are independent altogether, so far as our internal finances are concerned, of that branch of the Legislature. That position is not tenable, and we shall be merely making ourselves ridiculous by assigning this reason for our action. We shall merely be inviting the ridicule of another place if we assent to this position. I concurred in pressing the requests because of the extreme position taken up by several honorable members of another place, who said - " We are the absolute masters of finance. We shall do whatever we please. We refuse the right of the Senate to alter this Bill in any shape or form." I cannot agree with that position ; but we are now asked to take up an equally extreme position on the other side, by saying that the House of Representatives has no power to interfere with our internal affairs. I think that proposition is absurd in the last degree, that it will place us in a false position, and ought not to be agreed to by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- In my opinion the Senate would not act wisely in attaching reasons to our message. The reason for our action appears in the Constitution itself. We contend that it is a matter of courtesy, which the practice of other Parliaments has recognised, that our internal administration of our own department should not be interfered with. But we cannot attempt to advance that view of the position as a legal right, and I think that we should weaken our case if we attempted to do so. I would suggest with very great respect that it would be unwise to give any reason. I am not quite sure that our Standing Orders provide for reasons being assigned in connexion with those Bills which we have no power to amend. </para>

                    - After clause 28 insert the following clause : - "28a. Applications for patents maybe lodged at the Patent Office immediately after the Commissioner is appointed, notwithstanding that this Act has not then commenced, and all applications so lodged shall have priority according to the time when the3- were so lodged, and the lodging of an application under this section shall have the the effect as the lodging of an application after the commencement of this Act, but any patent granted pursuant to the application shall be dated as of the day of the commencement of this Act. Until forms are prescribed applications shall be in such form as the Commissioner directs.

                    (Western Australia). - I hope the Committee will not pass this clause without looking into its effects, because it is rather important. This Bill will come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation, but the States Patent Acts, will continue in operation until that date. The Commissioner under this Bill may be appointed a month or two months before the proclamation of the Act, and we shall be confronted with this contingency : We may have inventors lodging applications for patents two or three months before the Act is actually in operation. Then, when the Act is proclaimed, we shall have the Patent Office loaded up with applications which must be dealt with in the order of priority. Knowing the superior advantages of the Commonwealth Act over the various States Acts, particularly in the matter of fees, we can quite imagine that inventors will endeavour to lodge their applications under this Bill as soon as possible. But I would ask the Attorney-General what advantage there is in giving them this power to lodge their applications before the Act comes into force? I venture to prophesy that the clause will lead to a great deal of heartburning and a great deal of bungling. As a matter of fact, if a man patents an invention under any one of the States Acts, he can prevent any one else from pirating his invention. If, for instance, a man has. patented an invention in South Australia; under the State Patents Act, I cannot lodge an application for a patent for the same invention under this clause, because I must make a declaration that I am the actual inventor or his assignee.

                        <para>- There are advantages and disadvantages in inserting a clause of this kind. The object clearly is to enable inventors to have an opportunity of lodging applications perhaps a few weeks before they could do so if they had to wait until the Act is proclaimed. Of course an Act is entirely inoperative until it is proclaimed, but as soon as this Act is proclaimed this clause will take effect, and applications which are in the hands of the Commissioner will have priority. Under this clause an inventor desiring a patent will not need to run round to all the States Patents Offices. That is the state of things which we are endeavouring to remedy by this Bill. An inventor under this clause will be able, at the earliest possible moment, to lodge his application with the Commissioner. </para>

We are going to induce applicants for patents to rush in their applications, in order to secure the advantage of priority, whilst, at the same time, the States Patents Offices are still open. That is undesirable, and the Attorney-General can give no satisfactory reason for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> argument is sound, and we shall be inviting a conflict between the Commonwealth Patents Office before it is established, and the Patents Offices of the States which have been established <inline font-style="italic">fov</inline> years.

                    <para>- The amendments in clauses 35 and 37 relate to the subject of novelty. The House of Representatives prefers clause 35 as it was originally drafted with some alterations which I shall point out. It holds the view which I have expressed before, that it is not desirable that the Examiner should be called upon to report on novelty. It is a most intricate and delicate matter, on which the validity of patents more frequently turns than on anything else, and to say that the Examiner . shall report as to novelty is really a trap. But in clause 37 it is proposed that in the case of complete specifications, the Examiner, in addition to reporting whether an invention lias been already patented, shall report as to novelty.

                        <para>- The object of this amendment is to restore the provisions which were objected to by the Senate. I have already expressed my opinion strongly on this subject. I think it is very desirable to require a man who has obtained a patent to work it in Australia, instead of sitting down and importing the article, thus preventing anybody else from making it here. The amendment of the other House provides that an inventor shall be required to manufacture an article for which he has obtained a patent and supply it at a reasonable price to the public, and that after the expiration of four years he shall not import the article. I think it is a very good provision to make. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I only wish to point out to those honorable senators who think that we are nob sufficiently safeguarding local manufacturers the drastic powers which are conferred by this clause. It is provided that any person interested may, after the lapse of two years, present a petition alleging that the reasonable requirements of the public with respect to a patented invention have not been satisfied, and apply for the grant of a compulsory licence, or, in the alternative, for the revocation of the patent. That surely would afford sufficient protection to the public without such a provision as that just rejected. </para>

The Act provides that they must be appointed within nine months. That provision has been found to be inconvenient in working, and the Bill proposes to substitute eighteen months for nine months.

                        <para>- The honorable senator was kind enough to ask me some time ago whether I should be prepared before the Senate rose to answer the question which he has just put to me. I have communicated with the Prime Minister over the telephone, and the reply which I have received amounts to this : That he believes that the Government, when they receive the Bill in another place, will ask the House to agree to insert Bombala instead of Tumut. Failing that, he is not in a position to say exactly what course will be adopted It will depend upon circumstances and upon the feeling in the other branch of the Legislature. </para>
