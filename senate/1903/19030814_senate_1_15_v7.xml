                <para>That the Senate, at its rising, adjourn until Wednesday next at 2 o&#39;clock p.m. </para>
                <para class="block">I do so in order to discuss a matter of importance which has arisen under the Electoral Act with regard to the forthcoming-general election. It will be remembered that last year the Parliament passed a Bill which conferred the franchise on women, and a Bill, assented to on the 10th October last, which provided that the States should be divided into electorates, and that the elections should take place in the new divisions. At the beginning of this session I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> - </para>
                <para>Is the work of preparing the new electoral rolls sufficiently well advanced for the Government to be able to say that they will be ready without doubt in ample time for the elections that must be held towards the close of the year? </para>
                <para class="block">The answer which I received reads as follows: - </para>
                <para>My colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, informs me that every effort is being made to expedite this matter, and he is confident that the rolls will be ready. In New South Wales and South&#39; Australia the collection of names has been completed, and the Commissioners appointed for the purpose have issued their schemes of distribution into electoral divisions, these being exhibited at the various post-offices, and must, under the Act, await objections for a period of 30 days. Until the divisions are approved, the printing of the rolls must remain in abeyance. In Victoria the canvass by the police is practically concluded, and the Commissioner will proceed with the distribution into electoral divisions forthwith. In Queensland the police have finished the house to house canvas, but all the lists have not yet been received. In Tasmania and Western Australia the collection of the lists is being pushed forward with all possible despatch. </para>
                <para class="block">It is evident from the reply that the Government wished the Senate to understand that every possible effort was being made and would be made to carry out the law. Not only did they say, but there was every reason to assume, that they intended that the law should be carried out. But if we may believe what we read in the newspapers, the law is not likely to be carried out, and those who were primarily responsible for the enfranchisement of women - an act which has a very marked effect on the electoral divisions - are not prepared now to give effect to that portion of the Electoral Act requiring the creation of new electoral divisions. If the next general election for the House of Representatives is held in the old electoral divisions, the results will be very unsatisfactory, because the divisions will &#39; not contain that fail- average proportion of voters which it is the desire and the expectation of Parliament that they should contain. The position is a very grave one, and as the Act requires the assent of both Houses to schemes of redistribution, I think it will be the duty of the Senate, when the time comes, to devote some attention to the steps which are being taken by the Government.  </para>

                    <para>- I do not quite know what the honorable senator means, but, according to my view, it will be carried out in its entirety. I shall explain exactly what the position is. It will be remembered that the Electoral Act introduced a new method of dividing the electorates. In the States the methods, had been different. In some States there was a schedule of electorates to the Electoral Act, while, in other States, the Electoral Act empowered a commissioner to delimit the boundaries of electorates from time to time. In our Electoral Act we adopted the method of appointing a commissioner to delimit the boundaries. It provides that there shall be a certain period during which objections may be made, that finally the report shall be laid on the table of each House, and that when it is approved of by both Houses the electoral divisions shall come into force. If a report is not approved, then it may be disregarded and another commission issued, or it may be sent back to the Commissioner with a request to furnish a second report, and the boundaries cannot be fixed under the Act until his report has been approved of by both Houses. In each State a commissioner was appointed. He delimited the boundaries of the divisions, and the proper notice was given for objections to be made. Every step which the law prescribed was taken. When the reports of the Commissioners were received it appeared that, as regards three States, it was quite impossible that the boundaries could be accepted. New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland were particularly affected by the conditions existing at the time when the divisions were made. A drought, unparalleled in duration and in severity, had held possession of a large portion of the country districts of New </para>
                  </talk.start>
                  <para class="block">South Wales and Queensland, and of a portion of Victoria, for a long period before the distributions were made, and while they were being made. It has only been quite lately that the effects of the drought have begun to be lessened and the normal condition of things to be restored. The result of the drought, as disclosed by the inquiries of the Commissioners, and it was patent to everybody, was an abnormal changing of the population. A large number of persons left the drought-stricken parts of the country to go into, not only the large cities, but the towns and other parts of the country temporarily, but it is stated that they are returning. </para>

                    <para>- Some of them permanently, but others temporarily. It is impossible to know how much permanence there is in many cases. It was during the occurrence of these shifting conditions that the distribution of the States into electoral divisions was made. It must be obvious to everybody that it would be most unsatisfactory to have the boundaries of electorates fixed under those conditions, applying to normal conditions, which we hope the States will return to in the course of a year or so. It would simply mean that probably in the course of a year it would be necessary to have a new arrangement, involving a large expenditure and causing many difficulties in the distribution of seats. The Government found themselves faced with this position - that either they must ask Parliament to assent to boundaries which could not be permanent, must be unsatisfactory, and would lead to the disfranchisement of a large number of persons who. might be caught in the exodus back from the cities to their old electorates at the time when the elections were proceeding ; or revert temporarily to the old condition of things, accepting the old electoral boundaries and having the elections conducted on that basis. The Government felt that they had no- choice in the matter. They were obliged, if the law was to be administered fairly, to depart to a certain extent from the Act, that departure having been occasioned by the unhappy circumstance of a drought, over which the Government, notwithstanding some assertions to the contrary, had no control. </para>

He said, or hinted,, that in some extraordinary way this action of the Government is likely to affect thewomen&#39;s vote. It cannot do so any more than&#39; it affects any other vote. Thewomen&#39;s vote will be in exactly the same position as any other vote. It will be registered under the old electorates. </para>

                    <para>--If the honorable senator knows that, I cannot see the point of his objection. Of course the women&#39;s vote, like the men&#39;s vote, will be affected by the failure to make these new divisions. In a large number of instances the women&#39;s vote will be affected where women may have come with their husbands, their brothers, or their sons into the cities and are going back to, reside in their old electorates. The honorable senator seems to forget that there is something else besides the cities to be thought of in this country. We must have regard not only to the residents of the cities and their representation, but to the residents of the country also, and their representation. There is a view entertained by some honorable senators, that all that is to be known of the country of any State is what can be seen from the highest point of a city. But we have to regard the electorates in these States as a whole. We have the responsibility of seeing that people are, as far as possible, fairly represented in their electorates ; and we say that a condition of things has arisen, happily temporary, which has to be met by temporary expedients. As soon as the difficulty is over, and things have resumed their normal condition, there is no reason why the law, as we laid it down in the Electoral Act, should not be followed as was intended. In order to meet the difficulty, of course it will be necessary to have some legislation. The Government are asking the other House to dissent from certain of the electoral divisions made by the Commissioners. Under the law, the motion must be made by the Government either to assent to, or to disapprove of, the divisions. The Government have moved that the divisions in Tasmania and South Australia be approved of ; and similar action will be taken in the Senate as soon as possible. With regard to the other electoral divisions which are more particularly affected in the manner I have indicated, the- &#34;Government have already moved that they be disapproved of. If they are disapproved of in the House of Representatives, there will be uo necessity to take action in the Senate. In any case, where divisions are approved of in the House of Representatives, it will be necessary also to approve of them in the Senate before they can become divisions under the law. To sum up, the Government have done their very best to cany out the law, but circumstances have intervened which would make carrying it out absolutely unfair to the great body of electors in all those States that are affected by the drought. Therefore, the Government have thought it better to postpone the actual coming into operation of the provisions of the Electoral Act by providing for the present to adhere to the electorates as they were. When the normal condition of things is resumed, we shall provide for carrying out the machinery of the Electoral Act which we passed last session. </para>

The only trouble I see is that the delay which has taken place will cause a great deal of inconvenience, and there will be a great rush towards the latter end of the session unless the subject is dealt with very quickly in both- Houses. The Government will be blameable for any inconvenience consequent upon delay. </para>

                    <para>- The greater part of the Commonwealth has suffered most intensely from an unprecedented drought. I know towns in the droughty part of the Commonwealth that, so far as human beings are concerned, have almost disappeared. The town of Bourke on the Darling, where property was valuable and people were getting high rents for buildings, has suffered, so severely that property has gone to ruin and waste. Of course, things are recovering. I suppose that at the present time the River Darling and the country adjacent to it would carry all the Stock in Australia. But the town of Bourke, and similarly situated places, cannot get back to their old condition of prosperity all at once. The people had to fly away from the droughty parts with their women1 and children ; and some of them have such a horror of drought that they will not go back. I know many portions of Queensland where a butcher or a baker has not been seen &#39; for a year. You never see a butcher&#39;s cart or a baker&#39;s cart there now. Previously there was competition between the tradesmen. Such a thing is unprecedented, and I hope will never occur again. I quite agree that the cities are too large. Melbourne is too large. </para>

This quite clear, and everybody admits that this is the month of August. Everybody knows that the drought has practically gone. It is only when the drought has gone that the Government have found out the position ; and they are using the fact that there has been a drought to bring about a radical, unexpected, and unconstitutional change in the way in which the forthcoming general election is&#62; to be conducted. </para>

                  <para>- The honorable and learned senator is perhaps the most accomplished &#34;thrower of dust &#34; in- the Senate. He is usually able to make the best of a very bad cause. Everybody can see, whether they admit it or not, that the taking of the next general election on the old rolls is a distinct injustice to the women electors of the great States. In the three States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, where the proposed new divisions are to be rejected1, the population amounts to about 3,100,000. In the States where the divisions are to be- accepted, the&#39; total is only about 700,000&#39;. So that practically wherever there is a substantial and heavy women&#39;s vote the Government have decided to fall back upon the old electoral divisions. </para>

                    <para class="block">To correctly understand the agreement that is now submitted to the Senate, it is necessary to make some reference to the history of the past relations between the colonies of Australia and the Eastern Extension Company, and to the more recent relations with the proprietary known as the Pacific Cable Board. The various agreements made with the Eastern Extension Company date back as far as 1871, but I think it will not be necessary for me to go further back than 1899, in order to supply a historical background sufficient for the purpose of the present debate. I intend to condense my remarks as much as possible, because I hope- that the matter will be decided to-day, seeing that there is important business on the notice-paper, for the next few weeks. But, while condensing my remarks, I wish to particularly bring one or two matters under the notice of the Senate, and I shall be glad if honorable senators will, in order to expedite matters kindly give me their attention for the few minutes I propose to occupy. We find that in 1898 the construction of the Pacific Cable had been decided on, and the Eastern Extension Company, who previously had been doing all the outside telegraphic work for Australia, were naturally desirous as busi-ness men - because I do not think they pose as philanthropists - to make the best arrangement they could with the colonies in view of&#39; the competition which would arise as soon, as the Pacific Cable was completed. It is. not at all necessary to mince matters. It is clearly shown in the negotiations, and? in the agreements, that the object of the Eastern Extension Company in making; a fresh agreement was to enable the company to compete with the Pacific Cable. Im 1899 the representative of the Eastern Extension Company saw the Postmasters^General of most of the colonies, and the agreement which he proposed to ask the various: colonies to enter into was substantially the same as that embodied in the parliamentary papers as having been signed by South Australia, Western Australia, and subsequently by New South Wales. There was one difference, however, which lay in the fact that, in the draft agreement, as .submitted to the Postmasters-General in the first place, the- 20th article did not appear. That is the celebrated article which makes the contract terminable only by the mutual consent of the parties. In other words it is practically an interminable agreement. While these negotiations were going on - -and I mention this as - having some interest, perhaps, in connexion with another matter I shall have to refer to- - the Government of New South Wales, through their Agent-General, communicated to the Secretary for State for the Colonies, the terms of the proposed agreement. Thus Mr. Chamberlain in 1899 knew what the terms of the agreement were. </para>

                            <para>- No matter how the article came to be inserted, we have to deal with the fact that it is there, and that this agreement was in the first place signed on behalf of Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania. Subsequently, it seems that negotiations were opened with a view to obtaining the inclusion of Victoria and New South Wales in that agreement. On the 8th January, 1901 - that is to say, a few days after the establishment of the Commonwealth - a telegram signed by- the Postmasters-General of New South Wales and Victoria was sent to the Eastern Extension Company proposing to accept the draft agreement with some small modifications which had been suggested. There was also a telegram sent to some of the other States, including Queensland, informing them that it was the intention of the Postmasters-General of Victoria and New South Wales to accede to the agreement. Instructions were sent to the Agent-General to sign the agreement on behalf of New South Wales, but in the meantime the Government of Victoria had disallowed the action of the Postmaster-General of that State. Consequently no action was taken by the Victorian Government beyond that of the Postmaster-General in signing the. telegrams which I have mentioned. On the 16th January, 1901, the agreement was signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Copeland,</inline> the New South Wales Agent-General, on behalf of the Government of New South Wales. It has been said, and I heard it stated in Queensland, that this was an agreement which should not have been entered into by New South Wales, because it was signed after the date of the establishment of the Commonwealth; and it has been contended that it was open to the Commonwealth&#39; to repudiate the agreement. The Commonwealth Government have gone very carefully into the matter, and have come to the conclusion that it was an agreement that certainly could not be rescinded under the circumstances - that the Government of New South Wales had at the time f ull legal right to enter into the agreement. There can be no doubt as to the soundness of that legal position, because, although the Commonwealth had been established, the Post and Telegraph services had not then been transferred. </para>

            <para>- It is on exactly the same lines. I am putting that as an illustration which conveys to my mind clearly the legal right of the Government of New South Wales to take the action they did take. The Commonwealth had no power whatever to avoid the agreement that had been entered into. With regard to the moral question, it certainly does not come into this discussion, because we are standing in the shoes of New South Wales in this matter, and we certainly cannot take from the Eastern Extension Company any rights that they have acquired on the ground that we ourselves were not morally justified in the agreement we entered into. We stand for New South Wales in this matter, and every honorable senator must see that we cannot claim on account of any moral shortcomings of ours that we are entitled to break an agreement made with any person. If I sell my horse to a man for &#163;10, and spend the money, I cannot turn round afterwards and say that because the horse was a present to me from my father, and I promised I would never sell it, I did a moral wrong in selling it, and I should get my &#163;10 back. New South Wales had a legal right to do this. It was done for a certain consideration - a reduction of rates. The people of New South Wales, or at all events the cable users in New South Wales, enjoyed the reduction of rates, and we could not afterwards, standing in their place, say that there was something morally indefensible about the agreement, and that we therefore were not bound by it. I now come to the position in which the Commonwealth was placed at the time the Post and Telegraph Departments of the States were transferred to the Commonwealth. The position was that a binding agreement existed between the Eastern Extension Company and four of the States - New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. </para>

              <para>- I do not include New Zealand. When we took over the Post and Telegraph Departments of the States, four of the States had entered into this interminable agreement with the Eastern Extension Company, whilst two of them, Victoria and Queensland, <inline font-style="italic">were</inline> absolutely free to make any terms they chose. As soon as the Departments were transferred - and I think I may mention this, because it has appeared in the press, and is, I suppose, common property - a good deal of pressure was attempted to be brought to bear on the Commonwealth Government by cable users and by the press to induce them to sign an agreement which was the same as the agreement signed by the Postmaster-General of Victoria before Federation. The Government absolutely refused to do that, and I think it was a very good thing they did. The strength of the position which the Eastern Extension Company occupied in the negotiations lay in the fact that they had got an agreement with New South Wales, and the strength of the position which the Government occupied in the negotiations was that the company had not got an agreement with Victoria. The question of how this matter was to be dealt with by the Government was in their minds, and no doubt also in the mind of the Eastern Extension Company, for some time after the Departments were transferred. I now come to a period somewhat later, when the portion of the Pacific cable between Australia and New Zealand was completed, and we had to consider what would be our terminal Australian charge for business from New Zealand. We decided to fix the rate for the whole of Australia at one penny. I may mention that this was just after we had revised our domestic telegraph rates and had introduced a rate of practically one penny per word for all Australian telegrams. We decided in dealing with New Zealand business to fix a penny as the uniform terminal charge for business between that colony and Australia. Then the Eastern Extension Company came along and said, &#34; If you are going to fix a uniform rate of one penny for business for the Pacific cable we presume you will give the same to us.&#34; We said, &#34; No, you are maintaining differential rates between the various States of the Commonwealth.&#34; </para>

              <para>- Perhaps not. We said, &#34; While you are maintaining differential rates as against some of the States of the Commonwealth, you cannot complain if we maintain differential rates as between the Pacific cable and the Eastern Extension cable.&#34; We were clearly within our rights, and this was perhaps the first time that we in the Commonwealth were able to negotiate with the Eastern Extension Company with our hands perfectly free. If that position of affairs had been allowed to remain it would simply have meant that all the New Zealand business would have gone over the Pacific cable. </para>

              <para>- If the arrangement had been maintained probably the whole of the Australian business would have gone over the Pacific cable, because, speaking from memory, there had been a differential rate fixed in the States with the Eastern Extension Company. I think it was a penny in New South Wales, and twopence and threepence in other States. We proposed to make it one penny for the whole of the Commonwealth, so that, taken from Victoria, the Pacific cable rate would have been one penny lower than the Eastern Extension rate, and in the case of the other States it would have been twopence lower. The Eastern Extension Company then said, &#34;If you let us have the benefit of the uniform rate for New Zealand business we shall cease to charge a differential rate against Victoria and Queensland, with the understanding that the whole question will &#34;be considered with a view to entering into some agreement to apply to the whole of Australia.&#34; That arrangement is what is referred to in the agreement as the provisional arrangement, which took effect on 1st September, 1902. There was no agreement drawn up then, but from that -time the Eastern Extension Company ceased to charge a higher rate for Victoria and Queensland, and their charge was made uniform from all the States of the Commonwealth ; whilst the terminal rate with regard to New Zealand business was made equal as between the Pacific cable and the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cable. From that time, the 1st September, 1902, negotiations went on, to a certain extent in London and afterwards here, as to the terms on which the Eastern Extension Company would agree to release the Commonwealth from the agreements that had been entered into, previous to the taking over of the Post and Telegraph Departments, by the four States referred to. The negotiations were very protracted, and I think I can say that the Eastern Extension Company found in the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, a very able and a very astute negotiator. I do not think the company ever had more difficulty in completing an agreement than they have had in connexion With this one. </para>

              <para>- That may be so, but I think the Eastern Extension &#39; Company found, at all events, that our negotiator was quite equal to any one whose services they had command of at the time. I do not need to go into details. The proposals commenced with a suggestion for a long period. Fifty years was first proposed, then forty years, and later the proposal made was that the company should have an agreement with the whole of Australia, . extending over a period of twenty, years, in exchange for their interminable agreement with four of the States, as twenty years was the term for which they held certain rights in the Island of Cocos. The Prime Minister, on the other hand, took up the position that ten years, coinciding with the currency of the Braddon clause of the Constitution, would be a fair term. There the negotiations hung fire for a considerable time, and eventually it was agreed between the parties that the term should be practically twelve years. </para>

              <para>- I have said that that proposal was not accepted. There were two parties negotiating, and honorable senators perfectly understand that in such negotiations each party desires to get something which the other party desires to keep on the best terras possible. It was necessarily a matter of compromise. The Eastern Extension Company would not concede the demands of the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister would not concede their demands. They agreed eventually to ten years, with two years&#39; notice afterwards, and for ordinary purposes we may say that the term of the agreement is twelve years. </para>

              <para>- There need be no difficulty on that account. That is &#34;the agreement so far as the term is concerned. In other respects the agreement is practically an extension to Victoria and Queensland of the agreement which was binding previously on four of the States. The principal concessions, as they are considered, to the Eastern Extension Company, are the right to open offices and to have the use of a special wire. That was one of the terms of the binding agreement they had, that they should have the right to open offices in the capitals of the States that were parties to that agreement, and should have the use of a special wire. There is one fact which has apparently been overlooked in the discussion of this subject. Speaking of telegrams generally the charge is 5d a word. The Eastern Extension Company have the use of a special wire, but they have to maintain the operators and a staff to do the business, and pay us 5d. for every word which is transmitted. From the Pacific Cable Board we take the same amount per word, but for that money we transmit and deliver the messages. Should that be considered an advantage to the Eastern Extension Company- </para>

We said to the Pacific Cable Board - &#34; If you wish to have canvassers, the Postmaster-General will be happy to act as your agent, and to appoint canvassers for you.&#34; They sent a request, and we appointed canvassers for them for the Eastern States.

              <para>- From a monetary point of view, I believe that we are doing better. At all events, if the Pacific Cable Board consider that the Eastern Extension Company is enjoying an advantage they can get a similar concession. There is another provision which simply continues the stipulation in the former agreement - that they shall get their material in duty free, and shall not be charged income tax. We do not release them from the payment of the duties, but we have put in a stipulation to make good anything they may pay in those States in which they were formerly exempted from income tax ; and also to refund any Customs duties which they may pay. </para>

              <para>- No ; the agreement will terminate at the end of 12 years. There are one or two conditions which are entirely for the benefit of the Government as against the Eastern Extension Company. We have, for instance, secured lower rates to China and the East, and obtained a reduced rate on Government business. It appears that, under the agreement existing with the Eastern Extension Company, business over the Cape cable was taken at a lower rate than was provided originally in the agreements between the company and the States. The rates which stood at1s. 8d.and 2s. have been reduced to1s. 3d. and1s. 7&#189;d. under table A. We were not able to obtain the insertion of a clause which would enable us to acquire any of the cables, which, of course, we could not confiscate. They declined to insert a purchasing clause; but it is clearly provided that they cannot part with a cable to any other company without first making an offer of it to the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>-No. If there should be a movement as there is for the State to acquire these cables, the agreement will enable us to prevent them from passing out of the hands of the company. If, for any reason, they should wish to part &#39;with their cables they must first give the Commonwealth an opportunity of acquiring them. We do not in any respect stand in a worse position. The agreement applies to all the States, but for a limited period only, with the stipulations which I have mentioned, and which are entirely in favour of the Government. We get rid of an interminable agreement, so far as four States are concerned, and enter into an agreement which is to run for twelve years. That may seem a long period, but really it is a short one in the life of a nation. It is much better that we should be free from these entanglements. At the end of that period it will be open to the Government to make an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company, or with the Pacific Cable Board, or with both of them ; or, if it should seem best iu the interests of the people of Australia, to make no contract with either of them. </para>

              <para>- It is irregular and objectionable that a question should be partly discussed in the Senate and partly discussed in Committee. But I propose, with the consent of the Senate, to put the motion on the distinct understanding that it must not be taken as a precedent, and that it is distinctly irregular. A mistake was made in the preparation of the business-paper, and for several days the question was put down for consideration in Committee. It was only yesterday that I discovered that the only resolution arrived at by the Senate was that the matter should be considered, not that it should be considered in Committee, and -the error was rectified. Under these circumstances, I think it is only fair to those who wish the question to be considered in Committee to put the motion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Barrett</inline> proposes to move. I would ask honorable senators, however, not to discuss the merits of the case on that motion, because we really ought to have decided before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> made his speech in what, manner the question, should be considered. </para>

            <para>- Although it may prolong the discussion, the Government will be acting wisely, and, I believe, in the interests of not only the Senate, but the question itself, if they concur in my proposal. In my opinion the history of this company, their treatment of the general public before there was any competition in cable business, and their negotiations with the States as well as the Commonwealth Government, demand at our hands the fullest discussion. It would hardly be possible for any honorable senator,, on, a general motion in the Senate, to discuss the question on its merits. The Minister for Defence admits that it is a very long story, because the negotiations go back as far as. 1871. </para>

            <para>- This matter is so- very important, and can be looked at from so many aspects, that it is not possible for any honorable senator to deal with it and to secure the information to which we are entitled in one speech. I cannot see what objection the representatives of the Government can have to going into Committee, unless- they desire to rush the agreement through. As honorable senators have seen from the correspondence, there are several partners to the Pacific Cable who object to the Commonwealth ratifying the agreement until there has been a special conference. </para>

              <para>- In Committee we could discuss that aspect of the question. We could also ask the Minister for Defence what is the meaning of certain clauses in the agreement. But if the Senate does not go into Committee, how could any of us elicit information from the Government on any one point without losing our right to speak on other parts of the agreement ? If the Minister for Defence speaks in reply to a question, the whole debate will come to an end. The business of the country before both Houses has been of such an important character that we have not had an opportunity of looking into this agreement as we should have liked to do, nor of realizing the seriousness of the position. . The Government have adopted an extraordinary method of bringing the subject before the Senate. They could have brought it up in the form of a Bill, as they have done in the case of the naval agreement, so that marginal notes could have been supplied, and the measure would have gone&#39; through several stages, enabling us, at each stage, to get a proper idea of what we were doing. But this agreement comes before us in unusual type, and is wrapped up in such a quantity of correspondence concerning the Eastern Extension Company that I defy even any lawyer, by reading it through once, to comprehend the whole of its provisions. It is so complicated, and is printed in such small type, that it is very difficult to understand what it means. It is only fair to the Senate, and to the partners in the Pacific Cable scheme, that the question should be thoroughly discussed. We cannot do that under cover of two resolutions. If the question goes into Committee, I propose to ask the Minister for Defence what is the meaning of some of the clauses. I intend to ask him whether it was not published in the newspapers that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton was entering &#39;into an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company in the interests not only of. the Commonwealth, but also of the Pacific Cable. It was publicly stated that the agreement was to provide that there should be no cut-throat competition between the two cables. Is there anything in this agreement of that nature ? If we do not go into Committee I cannot elicit that information until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> speaks a second time, and then his replies to my questions may not be as clear as I should like them to be. In proposing that this agreement should be ratified in the form in which it is submitted, the Government run a great risk of having it thrown out. Indeed, from the tone adopted by some honorable senators, I think there is considerable risk in that direction. Some honorable senators deprecate going into Committee, because it will take a long time to discuss the subject then. Those honorable senators have always been pro - Eastern, if I may so describe them. They are in favour of the agreement, and are anxious to get it through with all possible haste, so that we may not realize the enormity of it. If there is nothing of an extraordinarily unjust character about the agreement, why does the Government decline to go into Committee where we may have a full discussion ? </para>

But, if we are going into Committee in order that amendments. may be made, I would point out that that would invalidate the agreement altogether. If that happened, the strong position which the Eastern Extension Company at present occupies would not be weakened in the least degree. It would be very much better for us to adopt the agreement now than to have interminable negotiations going on. If we make amendments we may lose the agreement. </para>

            <para>. - The view which has been put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> appears to me to be perfectly sound. The Government have been carrying on these negotiations since March, 1901. The negotiations were necessary to enable the Commonwealth to escape from very serious difficulties created by the extraordinary way in which the States had acted in regard to this subject. It is a legacy which we had to take over from the States. Having taking it over we had to make the best of it. We had on the one side our own Pacific cable. On the other side we had the obligations which the States had entered into, and which must have seriously interfered with the profitable working of our own cable. But there was the position. These rights existed, and we had to do the best we could to get over the acceptance of them. We negotiated, and as the result of negotiation we have brought up this agreement, which is the best possible arrangement that can be arrived at for the Government. The agreement represents the most careful negotiations and stringent endeavours to secure the best terms that could be got. If it is not adopted now, I do not see what can be done. We cannot amend it in Committee. It stands or falls. If it is not adopted the whole subject must be thrown open once more, and we shall be exposed practically for all time to competition with our own cable, which it is the very object of this agreement to get rid of. I quite see the force of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> says, that there ought to be the fullest inquiry, and it might be impossible to elicit all the information that is desired in an ordinary second reading debate. The Government, therefore, take up the position that, as they have nothing to conceal, and wish to supply not only honorable Senators but the whole public with the fullest information about the subject, they will not offer any opposition to going into Committee. The intention of the Government is to place the fullest information before the Senate. But how were we to know that honorable senators did not understand the agreement ? </para>

            <para>- It is quite possible that the Government have done the very best thing that could have been done in the very difficult circumstances in which they have been placed. But, looking at the document which has been placed before us, we find that the other members of the partnership into which we have entered are protesting against our entering into this agreement as it stands. It is due to our partners that the Senate should go into the subject carefully, and should thoroughly exhaust the information which is given, not only for the benefit of the Senate, but of the general public outside. It may be proved that the Government in the most difficult circumstances have done the very best thing that could have been done. But, as some of us know, the Eastern Extension Company is an expert at agreements, and has been throughout its long career. No one has ever scored against it, and I do not know whether we shall be able to score against it in this case ; but I think that we ought to go into Committee and to exhaust the subject thoroughly, because in a short time all the various partners in the British Empire scheme of the Pacific cable will be asking for information from the Commonwealth as to its views upon this most important matter. </para>

We are aware that a request was made by some of our partners in the Pacific cable that the matter should be discussed before this agreement was ratified, that request coming from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, amongst others. The Government think that the request for a conference with regard to a matter purely between ourselves as States, arises from a want of knowledge of the circumstances. I pointed out thai, the terms of the agreement entered into in the first place were communicated to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> in 1899 and he then expressed approval of them. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> for some reasons may want the Senate to go into Committee, though no doubt he came here with the fervent hope that that step would not be taken. There- seems to be extraordinary unanimity amongst the senators from South Australia in their desire to have this discussion stopped at the earliest possible moment. That is an attitude which I shall not support. I recognise that but for the form in which the original motion was put, and &#39;but for a feeling that there are some extraordinary circumstances, it would not have been necessary or desirable to go into Committee. It is because the Senate recognises that the matter is surrounded by so many circumstances which may fairly be called mysterious that there is a desire to go into Committee. While I think our going into Committee is an excellent plan, I do not pledge myself directly or indirectly to support a single amendment. I shall vote for going into Committee because there ought to be the most searching inquiry, and not necessarily to afford an opportunity of interfering with an arrangement which the Government have made, an arrangement, which I frankly say, was made under circumstances of great difficulty I am prepared to be convinced that the agreement is the best possible under the circumstances, though, of course, I may be convinced in an opposite direction.

            <para>- It must be admitted that the agreement entered into by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth with the Eastern Extension Company has relation to a difficult subject which presents many points for consideration. The question is complicated owing to the fact that the various colonies have made agreements with the Eastern Extension Company, so that to a certain extent the matter is prejudged, especially in the case of New South &#34;Wales. The attitude of that State seems to have been somewhat extraordinary. The Government of New South Wales simultaneously negotiated with the Eastern Extension Company and with the partners represented by the Pacific Cable Board, and subsequently signed agreements with both. The agreement with the Eastern Extension Company was signed by the New South Wales Government only sixteen days after they had signed the agreement with the Pacific Cable Board, and only three months before the Postal Department was taken over by the Commonwealth, this, of course, being subsequent to the consummation of federation. An agreement was arrived at by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> the Postma.sterGeneral of &#39;Victoria, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crick,</inline> the Postmaster-General of New South Wales ; and subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gurr,</inline> who succeeded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> signed, in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crick,</inline> the agreement with the Eastern Extension Company, which is still in force in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, who was Premier of Victoria, repudiated the action of his Postmaster-General as a- breach of an honorable agreement entered into with the various countries in respect to the Pacific cable. But, as I have said, the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne was the Premier, not only signed an agreement with the Pacific Extension Company, but -also signed an agreement with the Pacific Cable Board. It is unprofitable, however, to discuss these matters, because the damage, if any, has already been done. All we have to do is to consider every phase of the question, and, with our knowledge of past events, endeavour to make the best bargain possible for the Commonwealth.

          <para class="block">Defence have told us that the agreement before us is a splendid agreement for the Commonwealth, bearing in view the previous action by the States as colonies. .It is pointed out that, in the place of four perpetual agreements between the States and the Eastern Extension Company, we have an agreement which gives only twelve years to the Eastern Extension Company in which to exploit Australia and injure the Pacific cable business. I suppose that, the inference we have to draw is that the Eastern Extension Company had made a very bad bargain ; indeed, the Prime Minister, in an interjection, said that the agreement was so good that it almost made him suspicious. I think there is very good reason for suspicion. It is remarkable that a company who have shown such strenuous and continued opposition to the laying down of any line which would deprive them of a monopoly - who have shown such alacrity to sign an agreement-- </para>

          <para>Whether the Pacific Company succeeded or not in entering upon active operations, it had already conferred a considerable benefit upon the Australasian colonies by bringing the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company to a much more liberal frame of mind. </para>
          <para class="block">That was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> opinion at that time. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, speaking only last month, in referring to the .Eastern Extension Company said - </para>
          <para>They maintained the higher rate whilst they had an opportunity of doing so in the absence of competition ; and it is a fact which must be placed to the credit account of the Pacific cable that undoubtedly it was the expected competition of that cable which largely led to a reduction of rates on the part of the Eastern Extension Company. </para>
          <para class="block">It is clear, therefore, that the statements which appeared in the press are an absolute perversion of the truth ; and could only have been inserted with the object of leading members of Parliament, who might not take the trouble to look up blue-books to find out exactly the condition of affairs. The direct result of the construction of the Pacific cable has been an enormous saving to the people of Australia. The words transmitted from Australia to Europe in 1901 totalled 2,330,000. And it is therefore clear that on that business we have saved in consequence of the reduction from 9s. 4d. to 3s. per word, which has been solely due to the Pacific cable, a sura equal to &#163;738,000 annually. This is the sum saved to the people of Australia by the construction of the Pacific cable. The loss to Australia on the Pacific cable is &#163;30,000, as a consequence of the receipts being less than the expenditure, and we have therefore the net result of &#39; a saving to </para>
          <para class="block">Australia of &#163;700,000 as the direct consequence of the construction of the Pacific cable. In view of these figures no one can say that the Pacific cable is not justified. Is it not selfish on the part of the merchants who practically monopolise the cables, and to whom the cables are specially beneficial, that after getting the people of Australia, or the people of the three eastern States to build the Pacific cable and guarantee the expense, they should clamour for such privileges for a rival company as would render the Pacific cable a financial burden upon the people. </para>

          <para class="block">The company is capable of using enormous political influence. Its president is Lord Tweedmouth, a member of the House of Lords, and I am informed that its list of shareholders includes a very large number of members of the House of Commons, and of high officials. Even the Under-Secretaries have shown the greatest hostility to the Pacific Cable Board. I wish honorable senators to understand the enormous power which the Eastern Extension Company can wield, and that they will do anything not absolutely dishonest in order to attain their ends, and to keep their enormous monopoly. Finding that their scheme was unsuccessful, they altered their tactics. At the Jubilee Conference in 1897, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company put forward a proposal that they should obtain exclusive rights for Australia - I think that for downright impudence that is unsurpassed - on condition that they connected the colonies with the Cape, and laid a cable from the Cape to England. This scheme was put forward by the company as a substitute for the Pacific cable. The line to the Cape was built solely with the object of thwarting the Pacific cable scheme. We are therefore also indebted to the Pacific Cable Board for the cable which gives us direct connexion with South Africa. Directly after the J ubil.ee Conference was concluded, the Imperial Government were memorialised, and asked to have the proposed route of the Pacific cable surveyed. They acceded to the request, and put on a vessel to take the soundings The Colonial Governments waited patiently to hear the result of the survey, and a period of four years elapsed before it was found that the ship had been quietly and mysteriously withdrawn, and that the survey had only been started. No notification was ever made to the colonies of the withdrawal of the ship. Is that not an extraordinary position? Does it not indicate the extraordinary power which the Extension Company wields? </para>

              <para>- The British Government agreed, at ,the request of the Jubilee Conference, to send a boat to survey the route of the proposed cable, and after a start of the survey was made the boat was quietly taken off. It is a very suspicious thing that it was withdrawn in that mysterious way. The Extension Company asked for a subsidy of &#163;100,000 if they built a cable line <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Cape. When their request was refused they immediately started to lay a cable, and it was being laid before the Pacific Cable Board was established. Their only object was to block the Pacific cable. Whatever the result has been, they can take credit for the fact that they left no stone unturned to get an absolute monopoly of the business. </para>

              <para>- I nave had experience of submarine telegraphy, and I wish honorable senators to understand the character of this company. It is interesting to consider the enormous profits which they have made out of Australia and other countries in the East. The company represents&#39; a combination of three companies, with a capital of &#163;1,525,000. On amalgamation, by a well-known system of &#34; watering,&#34; &#163;472,000 was added, making the capital nominally &#163;1,997,500. On the sum they have paid only 5 per cent, dividends, and people naturally ask, what is 5 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Let us see what dividends they have really paid. They have paid on this sum not only 5 per cent, dividend, but also 2 per cent, bonus, which is equal to 7 per cent, on the watered capital, and 9 per cent, on the real capital. An examination of the published statements discloses that they have also expended out of the profits no less than &#163;1,571,540 on extensions and other re&#39; productive works, besides the amounts which they have paid into sinking funds. So that they have spent more than their original capital in laying down fresh lines out of clear profits, and there remains unexpended and undivided a fund of &#163;804,000. </para>

              <para>- I wish to show how they have exploited the people of Australia, and how they desire&#34; to continue to do so. We come to this interesting little summary of their operations. Starting 30 years ago, with a capital of &#163;1,525,000, they have paid in dividends and bonuses &#163;4,117,500; spent on extension, &#38;c., &#163;1,571,540; have an unexpended balance of &#163;804,193, and made net profits to the amount of &#163;6,493,233. That is the company which has been exploiting Australia up to the present time, and which we are expected to believe has been a benefactor and a pioneer. </para>

              <para>-Senators O&#39;Connor and Playford object to my going into these matters. I hope that I have not wearied the Senate in my endeavour to show, first, what a huge powerful monopoly the company possess ; secondly, how they have exploited the people by extracting from them a profit of &#163;6,500,000 ; thirdly, how they exhausted every effort to kill the Pacific cable project; fourthly, how the crushing rate of 9s. 4d. a word was only reduced as the direct result of the Pacific cable, and a net saving to the people of Australia of &#163;700,000 a year was effected thereby ; fifthly, how the Cape cable was only laid in order to block the Pacific cable, and to retain a monopoly : and sixthly, how their plaintive appeal as a poor injured company to whom we ought to be lenient, and as the pioneer cable company to the East, is merely throwing dust in our eyes. </para>

              <para>- They have a reserve fund larger than the total cost of their lines, so that even if they were not to make another penny profit the shareholders would be recouped the value of their shares. This gentle and benign company, which is so | simple and childlike in its demeanour, has,, according to the astute <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, &#34;fallen in&#34; over this agreement. We are asked to accept this triumph of diplomacy as an arrangement under which the balance of benefits is all on one side. We are told that we have dislodged the company from what would otherwise have been an impregnable position, and have placed them practically in a position of dependency upon us. On the probabilities of the case, knowing the remarkable astuteness of the company and its business aptitude - seeing that its officers know more about cabling and the requirements of its business than the Prime Minister does - is it likely that it would consent to this agreement if it were a benefit to the Pacific cable? It is not at all likely. Therefore, upon the probabilities, it would be much better for us not to consent to the agreement. But we cannot discuss the probabilities; and I want to point out first what we are said to gain by this proposed agreement, and, secondly, what the Eastern Extension Company will gain by it. Those are the principal points. </para>

              <para>-If I succeed in showing that it would be better for us to have no agreement rather than to accept this one, it will be quite sufficient. The Prime Minister claims, first, that an interminable agreement with certain of the States was established, and that we now have constituted an agreement which will last for twelve years- that is, till the 31st- October, 1915. His second claim is that the result df his negotiations has been a reduction of the cable rate to India to 2s. 6d. per word ; and, thirdly, he claims as an advantage the right to purchase the Eastern Extension line <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> the Cape, if the company is willing ,to sell it. Let us consider these supposed advantages. When the twelve years expire on the 31st October, 1915, what is to happen? Suppose we want to buy the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s line <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> the Cape. Are they bound to sell ? They are not. The agreement is not on a legitimate business footing. Is it likely that at the end of that time we shall be able to say to the company, &#34;You must close up altogether and leave- Australia.&#34; The most we shall bc able to do is to insist upon a fair division of business between th&#38; Eastern Extension cable and the Pacific cables </para>

              <para>- We cannot say that their cable business in Australia shall terminate. The most that we can claim is an equality of business with them. So that we are going to give them a continued advantage for twelve years, and the most we can then do is to claim an equality with them. The cable rates to India are put forward as a great advantage and a strong reason for the adoption of the agreement. But is i&#39;; likely, on the face of things, that the company could charge 4s. 1 Od. per word to India and&#39; only 3s. per word to England, when India is on the direct route, and not more than half the distance <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Of course they had to make a reduction in the Indian rates. Otherwise the position would be absolutely absurd. But they ought to have made a reduction to ls. 6d. a word in messages to India, instead of which they have reduced the rate to 2s. 6d., only &#60;&#62;d. less than the rate of Great Britain, which is more than twice the distance from Australia. As to the right to purchase the cable <inline font-style="italic">via&#34;</inline> the Cape, I consider that that is of no value whatever. If it had been said that at the end of a fixed time the Commonwealth had the right to come in and purchase on terms to be agreed upon by arbitration it would have been a valuable concession. But the only terms we have secured are &#39;that we can purchase if the company wish to sell. A joint stock company is the most indefinite thing in the world when you come to deal with it at close quarters. It is an aggregation of shareholders, who can transfer their stock in such a way that it is nominally in the same hands, whilst really the shareholders are a different body. A different set of shareholders may own the South African cable next week, but the line will still belong to the Eastern Extension Company. </para>

              <para>- That will not matter, because we have the Pacific cable in operation, and there will be no injustice from the rates which the Eastern Extension Company charges. These are the alleged advantages accruing from the agreement. I now want to point out what are the advantages which the Eastern Extension Company receives. It is a point which has never been understood up to the present. First of all, by clause 16, the Federal Government is not to give the Pacific cable any advantages that are not equally shared by the Eastern Extension Company. That is the principal thing. We are bound hand and foot, and it is impossible for us to secure any advantage for the. Pacific cable for twelve years. The second point is that we are bound to lay down at Commonwealth expense special lines for the exclusive use of the Eastern Extension Company for twelve years. Those lines will cost over &#163;30,000, and they must be maintained at our expense. Thirdly, the Eastern Extension Company is given power under clause 20 to break an -agreement entered into with the State of Western Australia, dated the 9th January, 1889, with reference to their station at Broome, if the Federal Ministry at any time consents, an arrangement which will render nearly 2,000 miles of telegraph line laid by Western Australia &#39;under an agreement with the company absolutely useless. </para>

              <para>- Inasmuch as in South Australia the bookkeeping provisions are likely to cease sooner than in the case of Western Australia, Western Australia has far more to lose. Fourthly, the Eastern Extension Company is to pay no Customs duties, no wharfage rates. no harbor rates and lighting charges, no income tax or rates. So that it is practically in a better position than any. of the States of the Commonwealth. The States have to pay customs duties on their imported goods, from which the Company is exempt. It is placed in a position practically above the law of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- But the Pacific cable belongs to the people. I have pointed out four advantages that the Eastern Extension Company have received ; and they will have a further advantage, owing to the fact that the lines they are now laying down are to be used exclusively for cabling. This is a great advantage from the point of view of those who use the cable, because messages can be sent with much greater celerity, and there is less probability of mutilation. If it be left to commercial men to send their cables either by the Pacific route, or by the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s lines, it will, for the reasons I have shown, be better to use the latter, because the ordinary lines are sometimes clogged with intercolonial messages. </para>

              <para>- My personal experience is that sometimes I have had to wait a quarter of an hour, or half an hour, because of other messages having priority. The new lines now being laid down by the Eastern Extension Company, will be kept clear, and will be worked by skilled operators. Directly the Eastern Extension Company obtained assent to the clause which provides that no advantage shall be given to the Pacific Company, they proposed an apparently innocent clause, which only showed their Machiavellian diplomacy. This clause provides that if there is a certain increase in the traffic over their lines the company will reduce the charge to 2s. 6d. per word ; and people regard that as not only reasonable, but very generous on the part of the company. Merchants, ship-owners, and others who have to send cable messages have not shown much patriotic Spirit in their support of concessions to the Eastern Extension Company as against the Pacific Cable Board ; and this clause makes it to their interest to send every message over the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s lines in order to. swell the messages to the number necessary to secure a reduction in the rate. The Eastern Extension Company practically say to merchants and others - &#34; You send all your messages over our lines, and we shall reduce the charge to 2s. 6d. per word &#34; ; and merchants regard it as clearly to their advantage to act on the suggestion. I consider this one of the most astute, most cunning clauses in the agreement. lt means that when the Eastern Extension Company have deprived the Pacific Cable Board of anything like their fair share of business, they will reduce the rate, and then the Pacific Cable Board will have to fix their rate at the same figure. In the meantime, however, the Eastern Extension Company will have practically monopolised the tariff. </para>

              <para>- The Marconi system is the only salvation for which Tasmania may hope. Then, in addition, we have to guarantee the Pacific Cable Board against loss, and pay thousands a year as a subsidy. In view of the fact that the Eastern Extension Company have exclusive rights in Tasmania, is it not reasonable that the Pacific Cable Board should have exclusive rights in Victoria and Queensland ? If this agreement be not ratified, it will be within our power to direct that every cable message from Victoria and! Queensland shall go <inline font-style="italic">via,</inline> the Pacific ; and that could be done without injustice to either of the States, or to any users of the cables. The rates over the Pacific cable are exactly the same, and must always be the same as those over the Eastern Extension cable ; but directly this agreement is ratified, we shall have given away all our rights for twelve years. It is admitted that this agreement for twelve years is not in the interests of the Pacific cable. </para>

The Minister for Defence stated that if the agreement be not signed, we shall have the right at any time to make differential terminal rates ; and that being so, we may secure that all the cabling from Victoria and Queensland shall go by the Pacific route without, as I say, doing any injury to either State. I do not desh&#39;e that more than one-half of the total business shall go by the Pacific cable, because I recognise the rights of the Eastern Extension Company, who have three lines as against one line of the Pacific Cable Board. If .we ratify the agreement, the Pacific cable, in my opinion, will not get more than one-third of the business for the next twelve years ; and then what will happen ?&#39; Even then we cannot demand more than one-half of the business ; so that the effect of the agreement is to allow the Eastern Extension Company to exploit us for twelve years, at the expiration of which we can only make an arrangement which it is open, for us to make at the present time. </para>

              <para>- &#34;Those agreements may go on for all time, because they cannot alter the fact that we can secure one-half of the business. If there were no interminable agreements - if the colonies had made no arrangements with the Eastern Extension Company - and we were now free to make any agreement we liked, no agreement would be made by this Parliament which would not give the Eastern Extension Company one-half of the business ; and that I regard as a very fair division. We have to look at this matter from a business point -of view. I am not one to blame the Eastern Extension Company for what they have done ; and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said, I should probably do the same if I were a member of the company. But we have to remember that this is an exceedingly astute company, and we must treat them on a purely business basis. We want an arrangement under which they shall not overreach us, and obtain benefits which, in all fairness, should be equally divided. At the conference it was, I believe, said that when the Pacific cable project was carried into effect it was possible and probable that the three eastern States would exclusively use that means of communication, leaving the western States to the Eastern Extension Company.

Now, if that is the position, the Eastern Extension Company may lower their rates whenever they please, and to whatever rate they please, and we are not in a position to give any advantages to the Pacific Cable Board which we do not also give to the Eastern Extension Company. It will be seen that the Eastern Extension Company get all the better of the deal. They can reduce their rates as they please, and we have no voice in the matter. </para>

              <para>- My honorable friend is a merchant, and he speaks about the people getting the benefit of a reduction of rates. I admit that cheap cables are of immense advantage to Australia, and will tend greatly to increase our commercial prosperity. That is why I say the Pacific cable is justified. But it must be remembered- that the group of individuals who specially benefit are the merchants and sharebrokers, and a reduction in the cost of cables may make a difference of thousands of pounds in the year to some big commercial company. What we desire is to have some agreement under which we could take half the business for the Pacific cable, and let the Eastern Extension Company have the other half. If we could secure that, the Pacific cable would become an advantage to the people, instead of a burden upon them. </para>

I was speaking to a cabler the other day, and he sent his boy down to a cable company to send a message to England. He said the message was to be sent by the Pacific cable, because he desired to assist the Pacific Cable Board. The message was sent, and the next day he sent a message to Holland. </para>

I have shown that a message sent by the Pacific cable to any part of Europe with the exception of Great Britain, may cost considerably more than it would cost if sent by the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cable. Again, business people are given another inducement to make use of the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cable, because where the volume of their business is sufficiently large, they are given a reduction in the rate to 2s. 6d. per word. </para>

              <para>- I do not know what the periods are, but I know that they are making special arrangements with merchants to induce them to send their cables by the company&#39;s line. Then even in the matter of forms ; those who make use of the cables can get as many of the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s forms as they please for nothing, whilst they have to pay4d. per 100 for the Pacific cable forms. There may not be much in this, but all these little hindrances prevent business going to the Pacific cable. Then the Eastern Extension Company offers great advantages in the matter of mutilations. If a cable message is sent by the Pacific cable it has to go over a line clogged with State and Inter-State telegrams to reach the landing station in Queensland. It will then go across by , the cable to Vancouver ; from there across Canada, and thence across the Atlantic cable to Great Britain. When the receiver gets it, he may find that there is some mutilation in the message ; and in order to discover what message was really sent, he has to lodge the cost of cabling back to find out the mistake and where it occurred. If the message is repeated in the same form, it is assumed that the fault is with the sender, and the receiver forfeits his deposit. If it is repeated in a different form, it is assumed that the mistake is made by the Cable Board, and the receiver then has to wait until inquiries are made to find out who is responsible for the mistake, whether the authorities in charge in Australia, Canada, or Great Britain. In the case of the Eastern Extension Company the message is sent by the one line. </para>

              <para>- Through certain transmitting agents, of course, but the one company is responsible ; and if a message is mutilated and it is repeated in a different form, it is assumed that the fault is with the Company, and the receiver&#39;s deposit is handed back to him at once ; whilst in the case of the Pacific cable, in which four Governments are interested, the inquiry as to who is responsible for a mistake involves a great deal of bother to receivers in having their deposits lying with the Pacific Cable Board for a considerable time. I refer to these matters to show where the advantages to merchants are. There is another advantage to be referred to. It is well-known that many cables transmitted by merchants are sent after banking hours, and unless they can get a bank guarantee, no cheque will be taken by the Government. The cost of the cable may be 9s. 6d., or any greater sum ; but as the Government will not take a cheque, the sender must put his cash on the counter if he desires his message to go by the Pacific cable. The Eastern Extension Company say - &#34; Give us your cheques or anything you like. Have an account with us, and we will send you a statement at the end of each month.&#34; These are all advantages which appeal to business people, and they show what may be done by a private firm as compared with a Government institution. There is no doubt, as I have pointed out, that the Eastern Extension Company are making special arrangements with business people, and while they are nominally charging the same rate as is charged for the Pacific cable, they are actually charging a lower rate. It is important to consider also that by their special lines they are absolutely independent of the Postmaster-General and his staff. It has been stated that Great Britain does exactly what we do in giving the Eastern Extension Company landing lines. That is quite true ; but it is also true that they charge the company &#163;5 per mile per annum for every line they have. If that be applied to Australia, it will be found that, as we have entered into an agreement to build 2,356 miles of special lines for this company, a charge of &#163;5 per mile per annum would amount to &#163;11,780 annually. The British Government send the messages on the landing lines themselves but, as I have said before, half-a-dozen or a dozen operators can work those lines, and. their employment involves very little expense. Here the Eastern Extension Company will be rendered independent of the Postmaster-General and his officials ; and, instead of charging them &#163;11,780 a year, which would be at the rate they pay in Great Britain, we merely save the wages of. a few telegraph operators. Great Britain, also makes terminal charges in the same way that we do. It is hardly necessary for me to say that I am actuated by no personal motive in speaking strongly against the Eastern Extension Company. I have none but the kindest recollections of any business connexion I have had with the company; I have met with only the greatest kindness and hospitality from every representative of thee company. I have never been in the employ of the company, but I have often been connected with these people in the way of business. I admit that the company has been; of great advantage to Australia in the early days ; and another thing which appeals tome in their favour is that in tropical regions they are the finest employers of labour I know of. Their treatment of their officials in places like Broome and Port Darwin supplies an object lesson which the Commonwealth might well be guided by. They give their clerks good salaries, provide them with various comforts necessary in a tropical climate, and they give them six months? leave every three years, and a first-class fare to England and back. They treat their officials well in every way. If we. walk across the road, in Broome, from the* company&#39;s office, we shall find Government clerks getting a wretched pittance of ten shillings a week as tropical allowance and&#39; leave of a fortnight a year, which does not. give them time even to get to Perth and back. This has nothing to do with the question before us, and though I think it is not necessary, I refer to it merely to show that I am not, actuated by any personal motives in what I have said. I contend that we should deal with this question on business lines, and purely in the interests of Australia, and we should not for twelve years absolutely place ourselves under the domination of this company. I desire now to say that even. if we consider this agreement an advantageous one, in view of the fact that our partners in the Pacific cable hold a different view, it is advisable that we should accede to their request for a conference. We must remember that we form only one of the parties to what we may call an international agreement. For the first time we have a partnership with Great Britain, Canada, and New Zealand, and we should be extremely careful that nothing we do as partners to the agreement in which we are mutually interested, shall be considered by the other partners to that agreement as being unfair to them, or as taking unfair advantage of the trust and confidence they have reposed in us. Their opinions are entitled to just as much respect as our own. The Prime Minister entered into this agreement honestly believing that it is in the best interests of Australia, but the other partners unanimously believe that it is not in the interests of the Pacific cable. They are entitled to hold that opinion, and the only fair, honest and straightforward way is for us to say - &#34;Before we ratify the agreement we are willing to hear what you have to submit.&#34; </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. Chamberlain,</inline>representing Great Britain, has regretted very much that the conference asked for was not appointed, but for some mysterious reason he has withdrawn his request. Let us consider the question from the British stand-point. It must be admitted that Great Britain acted in a m6st generous and statesmanlike manner in regard to the Pacific cable project when it departed from all its traditions of colonial policy. It had never previously given a contribution to or joined in an undertaking of this description. It is paying about &#163;600,000 towards a cable which unites two outlying portions of the Empire, and which does not go near its shores. It agreed to pay fiveeighteenths of the cost of maintenance, and to bear any loss which might accrue. The . cable is owned by the people, and if it is a commercial success it may be the pioneer of many similar ventures. If it is a success it will mark a new era in submarine telegraphy ; if not, the whole movement will fail. It is the first partnership agreement between Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and as a matter of national honour we should leave no room for a suspicion of overreaching or unfairness in the agreement which we propose to make with the Extension Company. Our national interests may suffer if we ratify the agreement in its present form. It is quite possible that at some time or other we may desire the&#62; co-operation of these countries in other joint undertakings. Is it likely that they will place sufficient trust and confidence in us again to co-operate with Australia in any other undertaking, if we now decline to grant the conference for which they ask ? </para>

              <para>- The Minister for Defence is absolutely wrong, and his statement is very misleading, because Canada and New Zealand are still clamouring for a conference. Any future undertaking in which we may require the co-operation of Canada and New Zealand will undoubtedly be looked upon with suspicion, unless we grant their request for a conference in this matter. We shall lose nothing by acceding to the request. All we do is to afford them an opportunity to lay before us their reasons, which we can accept if we like. There is no hurry to ratify the agreement. The representative of the Extension Company has not stipulated that it must be I done within a certain time. Suppose that a conference were held, and fresh information were obtained, we could then say, &#34; we shall alter the agreement,&#34; or &#34;we shall refuse to ratify the agreement.&#34; We are charged by our partners with breaking the spirit of the contract. I shall read a few extracts in which that accusation is made. In a despatch, dated 18th June, 1903, the Secretary of State for the Colonies writes : - </para>

            <para>The Governments of Canada and New Zealand hold that the agreement between the New South Wales Government and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, of which the agreement negotiated by your Ministers is in effect a recognition and an indorsement, involves an important deviation from the essential conditions which existed at the time of the completion of the contract for the construction and laying of the Pacific cable, and on the basis of which they entered into that contract, and I had hoped that the suggested Conference, by affording facilities for an exchange of views not possible in the ordinary course of correspondence, would have resulted in an adjustment satisfactory to all parties.

            <para>The situation appears to me to point conclusively to the necessity for a closer definition of the basis of the partnership in the Pacific cable, and a clearer statement of the mutual obligations of the partners, and no more convenient way of attaining this object suggests itself to me than the appointment of a conference authorized to deal finally with all the various matters of principle in dispute. I venture to hope that on reconsideration your Ministers will recognise that the continuance of the present state of things is fraught with prejudice to the interests of the Pacific cable itself, depending as they do so largely on the harmonious co-operation of all the partners, and I trust that I shall receive an early intimation of the readiness of your Ministers to fall in with my suggestion, and to nominate a representative with the necessary powers. </para>

            <para>Canadian Government protests against action your Government. Concession made by New South Wales to Eastern Telegraph Company regarded by Canada violation of spirit of agreement under which Pacific intentions of cable core was constructed. Action proposed now nothing less than extension objectionable concession for a period of years to other parts of Commonwealth. Canada assumed large share responsibility of Pacific intentions of cable core. Believed that all colonies, parties to contract, would do everything possible to direct business over a new line. Canadian Government much regret that departure from that understanding which has already occurred against their protest, and now urge upon Government of Commonwealth that no further extension granted to Eastern Extension Company. </para>

            <para>I have, after making careful inquiry, ascertained that, given the concessions proposed, the Eastern Extension Company will be in a far better position to increase its business, and it will have a command of business which otherwise it would not secure, and, correspondingly, the business of the Pacific cable will be reduced. It would be absurd for a moment to suppose that the Eastern Extension Company, by being granted direct connecting lines, the right to have their own offices, ana the direct control of their receiving and delivery business, obtains no advantage. I do not for a moment think it will be urged that from patriotic motives alone the company permitted an interminable contract to be reduced to ten years. The gain to the Eastern Company means loss to the Pacific cable, and that loss, and without anything to compensate them therefor, will mainly fall upon the mother country, Canada, and Hew Zealand. </para>

          <para class="block">So that we have all our partners complaining that we have violated the spirit of the agreement. Even if our partners are wrong in their view, as the Ministry contend they are, and we have got an agreement which is very detrimental to the interests of the Extension Company but which is beneficial to the interests of the Pacific Cable Board, by all the rules of international courtesy we ought to afford them an opportunity to meet us in conference and to point out where, in their opinion, we have violated the agreement. When the conference was concluded we could say &#34; we are still unconvinced and we -shall ratify the agreement.&#34; If they should point out reasons of which we are not aware why it was inadvisable to ratify the agreement, we should be in a position to take that course. To postpone tie ratification for a few months would do no injury to any one. No time for its ratification is stipulated, and it could be done as well six months hence as to-day. We may find that some alterations are advisable. The company may be so frightened at the agreement not being ratified that they may offer further concessions. I am positively certain that they will move heaven and earth to have this agreement ratified, inasmuch as it delivers the Commonwealth into their hands for the space of twelve years. We are not entitled to set cur opinions against the views of our partners in the Pacific cable. I hope that the Senate will accede to the unanimous request of our partners that a conference shall be held. I ask them to do so not only for the reason that we are interested in the Pacific cable, but because of any future joint co-operative movement that we may wish to enter into. There may be other parts of the British Empire with which it may be to our advantage to enter into some co-operative agreement. Is it well for us to vitiate the probabilities of the successful attainment of such an object by now entering into an arrangement with the Eastern Extension Company to which our partners are unanimously opposed ? It places Australia in a humiliating position - in a position of endeavouring by some kind of a <inline font-style="italic">ruse</inline> to get the better of the three partners- Canada, New Zealand and Great Britain - who are. interested with us in the Pacific cable. We can see from the despatches which have been brought before us, and which are very courteously but strongly written, that in the opinion of the Secretary of State we have violated the contract. Whether we have actually done so or not we should treat with courtesy and respect the views of our partners. In private life, when a man enters in a partnership in any line of business, he is not justified in signing an agreement with a rival company, which will injuriously affect the business of his partners. </para>

              <para>- I do not propose to follow the honorable senator through his long speech, a great deal of which consisted of historical retrospect that really had nothing to do with this matter. Whatever the Eastern Extension Company may have done in the past, whatever services it may have performed for Australia, or whatever charges may have been made, have nothing to do with this question. I think I was right in commencing with the year 1899. Nothing that occurred previous to that date appears to me to have any bearing upon the agreement before us. What I desired to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> and what I thought he would particularly address himself to, were his views on two points. Granting that it was undesirable that the States, previous to the transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth, should enter into these contracts with the Eastern Extension Company, by what means could we get rid of them? But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> did not touch that question, and when I challenged him he simply said - &#34; Let the interminable agreements remain.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> contemplates with equanimity the continuance of a state of things under which four States are bound by interminable agreements to the Eastern Extension Company, while the other States are free. He prefers that to any arrangement by which one uniform agreement can be made applicable to the whole Commonwealth. Looking at the question from the point of view of the Federation, it is most undesirable that the present conditions should continue. As time went on the more inconvenient would these agreements be found, until eventually the Commonwealth Government would probably have to enter into some agreement which would be far less advantageous than that now submitted for ratification. </para>

              <para>- The honorable and learned senator is talking about a different agreement. We are now dealing with the agreement which Tasmania, along with South Australia and Western Australia, entered into on the 14th April, 1900; and in order that these three States, and also. New South Wales, might not remain subject to all the conditions of that agreement, the Government signed the agreement now before us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is not prepared to admit that the Government have done a good thing in relieving the four States from the interminable agreements. Is it the view of the Senate that the agreements entered into by Tasmania, South Australia,, Western Australia, and subsequently by New South Wales, should be allowed to remain for all time ? If so, I can quite understand that honorable senators will not be disposed to ratify the agreement now before us, the principal object of which is to free those States from their present entanglements. </para>

              <para>- The agreement only has binding force for that time. The con-, cessions which were made to the Eastern Extension Company by the colonial agreements are to be continued under the new. agreement, and that cannot be helped. The Prime Minister has, however, stated that he is willing to give the same concessions to the Pacific Cable Board if -desired. If the Eastern Extension Company employ canvassers, or have officers of their own, and transmit their messages over special wires, then the Pacific Cable Board may do the same, so that the cables may compete on equal terms. </para>

              <para>- I did. The amendment was discussed, and defeated on the ground that it was one of the articles of the Convention. It is the practice at the present time, and always has been, for a telegram marked to go by a certain route to be sent by that route. As to the amendment, I can quite understand how the protests - if we choose to call them so - arose in New Zealand, Canada, and Great Britain, and how the request for a conference came to be made. New South Wales entered into the interminable agreement which has generally been disapproved of, and, as soon as the Postal and Telegraph Departments were transferred to the Commonwealth, a proposal was made that the Commonwealth Government should, on behalf of Victoria, sign the same agreement. The Government refused to adopt that proposal, and have refused all along. I have not the slightest doubt that as soon as it was known that the Federal Government had signed the agreement now before us, the bald fact that we had done so was cabled to our partners in the Pacific cable, .who naturally concluded that it was similar to that entered into by New South Wales. </para>

The Commonwealth Government represent all these parties, and we may speak of them as trustees for the Western States, to look after the interests of the Eastern Extension Company, and as trustees, so far as revenue is concerned, at all events, of the other States, that have a corresponding interest iri the success of the Pacific cable. We hold, therefore, an entirely different position from Canada and New Zealand. Canada and New Zealand may come to us and say that we should do so-and-so, speaking entirely in the interests of the Pacific Cable Board, but we cannot take that view. </para>

              <para>- The Commonwealth Government cannot take up that position, because, as representing&#39; three of the States as partners in the Pacific cable, and representing and acting for other States that are at the present time under agreements made with the Eastern Extension Company, in connexion with which their revenue to a great extent depends on the amount of business that goes over the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s lines, we are in an entirely different position from Canada and New Zealand. I say that our duty in this matter was to reconcile the difficulties that had arisen, and to do equal justice to all the States of. the Commonwealth. It was purely a domestic matter for the Commonwealth Government to settle, and not a matter to be settled in conference with parties whose interests were not the same as the interests of the Commonwealth, whose interests were entirely on one side and not at all on the other side in this matter. The Government, therefore, quite apart from all other considerations, were quite justified in taking action, because they had all the facts at their hands. Canada could not tell us anything we did not know. New Zealand could not tell us anything we did not know, nor could the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and why therefore should we hesitate, having all the facts at our hands, and being the proper body to act in the interests of both parties, if I may use that expression ? It was for us as the Commonwealth .Government to settle this matter, and we have settled it&#39; in a way which I think is equally fair to the Eastern Extension Company, the Pacific Cable Board, Board, and the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I wish to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> on his very able speech. I may say that I prefer the amendment of which I gave notice, because I think it places the position in a comprehensive and complete form, and would commend itself, if carried, to the members of the other Chamber. I am therefore glad to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> proposes, by leave, to adopt the terms I suggest. I cannot express my surprise in sufficiently vigorous language at the very great ingratitude shown by the Minister for Defence in his observations concerning Canada. I shall refer to the report of a speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming quite recently in Ottawa - a speech which, I think, will convince every member of the Senate who hears it, that the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is one which we must support. We have only at this stage been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Copeland</inline> has intimated that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has withdrawn his request for a conference. This debate will not conclude to-day, and I ask if the honorable and learned senator is willing, between now and Tuesday next, to send a cable to Canada, and another to New Zealand, asking them if they are prepared to withdraw their request for a conference ? The message would not cost very much, and we should be brought into complete touch with two of the parties who have protested most strongly against this agreement. </para>

I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> before the sitting closes, to answer that question. It is only fair to the Senate that what I suggest should be done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has sprung upon us this afternoon a cable from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Copeland.</inline></para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> did not quote the letter, he only referred to it. He says that it is a private letter, and that it cannot be brought before the Senate. That is not a fair way of doing business. If we had not probed into the matter we should not have known that this was a private letter or that it was dated 10th July. The honorable and learned senator led us to believe that he had just got word from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Copeland,</inline> and when he made use of those terms we thought he had received a cable. The impression left upon the minds of honorable senators was that a cable on the subject had been received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Copeland</inline> since this question was dealt by the House of Representatives. I think it very wrong on the part of the Government to act in this way ; but it is only in keeping with their general attitude upon this particular question. What is the reason for all this secrecy and haste ? How is it that secrecy characterizes all the negotiations with this company? What do we find when we turn to the correspondence laid upon the table ? Do we find a series of letters passing between the Government and the Eastern Extension Company <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> No, there is hardly anything of the kind there. I think there are only two letters from the Eastern Extension Company, one from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Warren,</inline> referring to Canada&#39;s protest, and stating that the company can canvass, and the other a letter written to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt in reference to the Prime Minister signing this agreement. The Prime Minister and members of the Government in dealing with a company such as this, whose practices are known, should have had everything in writing. The moment the Eastern Extension Company approached the members of the Government, and asked that an agreement might be made, the Prime Minister should have said - &#34; Let me know in writing what you propose. Do not let us have any backstairs influence.&#34; This company has too much backstairs influence and secrecy in its dealings. 1 hope honorable senators will not be influenced in any degree whatever by the fact that the Prime Minister has signed this agreement. We should dismiss from our minds any idea that if we do not- ratify the agreement the action we take will be a reflection upon the Prime Minister. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister will not resign. This matter, I think, shows the advantage of the position which the Senate is in. We can discuss these matters quite apart from party considerations. There is no question of the Government resigning involved. We pass our resolutions, and when they go to the other Chamber they are acted upon or not as honorable members there desire. Unfortunately, owing to the party system, a threat of the Government resigning sometimes influences Members of Parliament to vote in a direction in which they do not believe. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake&#39;s</inline> reference to Canada at this stage may well be met by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming&#39;s speech at a meeting of the British Empire League held at the old Bail way Committeeroom, House of Commons, Ottawa, on Tuesday, 19th May.

            <para>The reports of the discussion in the Senate and the telegrams which passed between the Commonwealth and the Dominion furnish painful reading, not only to every member of the League, but to hundreds of thousands who are not members. The matter in dispute affects the revenue derivable from the Pacific cable, but this is not the only consideration, important as it is. The financial question is trifling compared with the irritation and divergence of mind of the Governments of the people who have entered into partnership. The question is far wider than losses or profits of commercial enterprise. It is a matter which concerns the good faith and honour of closely-related. States. </para>

            <para>It is a matter which concerns the good faith and honour of closely related States ; and the difficulty, if not removed by the influence of wise and generous counsels, may seriously affect the prospect&#39;s of the British people, and the future of the Empire as a whole. It may, indeed, be regarded as the beginning of a family quarrel, the outcome of which no one can foretell. Much as the misunderstanding is to be deplored, it is the cause of rejoicing to the old enemy of the Pacific cable, if one may judge from press reports of the attitude of the chief officials of the Eastern &#39;Extension Company at their annual meeting, recently held in London. As the result of long plotting, that company have, at length, achieved a double victory. They have not only succeeded in taking from the Pacific cable its fair share of telegraph earnings, but they have managed by their machinations to get the owners of that undertaking at loggerheads. . . . The question which we may ask ourselves to-day is, how can the League serve Canada, &#39;serve Australia, serve the Empire by seeking to remove the difficulty <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> In what way and to what extent can we inaugurate the blessed service of peacemaking? I respectfully submit that a remedy is possible, but the circumstances demand prompt action. The most likely means of reaching a better understanding is for Canada to moke an advance to Australia by appointing a Commissioner, preferably a Cabinet Minister, to proceed at once to the Southern Commonwealth to confer fully and frankly with the Australian authorities on the whole subject. The Commissioner would learn on the spot by direct contact with the leading men of all shades of opinion much that could not be learned in any other way. As a delegate from Canada he would be listened to with th&#38; utmost respect, and. he would be able to assure the Australians that at no time has Canada been actuated by an}&#39; narrow or unfriendly spirit ; </para>

            <para>The Commissioner will, of course, take some means of pointing this out. Nothing will appeal more forcibly to the intelligence of Australians than such a striking fact. As far as my personal observation goes the people of Australia are much the same as the people of Canada; and I am quite sure that if the situation were reversed, if it could be shown that by any course of action Australia had in an}&#39; degree been the means of contributing to Our advantage to the extent of three and a half million dollars a year, Canada could only entertain the most kindly and grateful feelings towards Australia. Let us then rest satisfied with the conviction that a commission to our fellow subjects in the South will have no difficulty in winning their confidence and. friendship, and that any misunderstanding which now exists will be completely dispelled. </para>

              <para>- I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will be found supporting the question from the Empire stand-point. We differ as to the headship of its different parts. He prefers the monarchical system while I favor the elective system. We .both believe, however, in bringing about a state of affairs in which this congeries of States, monarchical or republican, shall be worked in most complete harmony with each other. Surely, in connexion with the&#39; first agreement between the Commonwealth and other States, we should try to cultivate the most friendly relations, and not allow a feeling of irritation and bitterness to grow up amongst kindred people. What chance shall we have of developing better commercial relations with those countries if we break faith with them now, as they say we are doing 1 In another part of his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming said there was no doubt that great difficulties had to be surmounted, and he was not prepared to utter a harsh word about the Commonwealth in that regard. Why should we show such anxiety to rush into the arms of the Eastern Extension Company when we may, if we have that desire, just as easily do so six months hence ? We have a right to allow the other partners to the agreement to be heard. The Prime Minister cannot complain if this amendment is carried. It does not say that the Parliament will refuse to ratify the agreement eventually, but merely that a conference should be held before the concurrence of the Senate is requested. Some persons may consider that it is a reflection upon the Prime Minister ; but I hold that in dealing with great public questions we should not be influenced by the personal feelings of members of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, although he is Prime Minister, is only an ordinary individual like ourselves or other members of the community. Surely, out of regard for his personal feelings, we are not going to perpetrate a great injustice, and to offend the people of Canada, the people of New Zealand, and a great number of people in Great Britain?It it is very true that Mr. Chamberlain at first does not appear to have offered any strong objection to the proposal. But it must be recollected that when the negotiations were begun, the South African war was in full progress. With 250,000 men fighting in South Africa, he had no time for considering such a project as the Pacific cable. What do we find on referring to the correspondence? We find that on the 22nd March, 1901, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Bertram Cox addressed from the Colonial Office to the Secretary to the Treasury a letter, in which this passage occurs : - </para>

              <para>- And probably if South Australia had adopted&#39; more business-like methods they would not have cost so much. Western Australia has also constructed a land line costing hundreds of thousands of pounds; but the Commonwealth Government allow a clause to be inserted in the - agreement with the Eastern Extension Company by which that line will become practically useless. It was a disgraceful thing that the agreement should, ever have been signed on behalf of New South Wales. It was discreditable that any representative of that State should have been able to surrender the rights of New South Wales to an extent which binds the Commonwealth. It. would never have been done if affairs had been conducted in an open and above-board manner. But they were not so conducted. They were conducted in a secret and shameless fashion, which will be to the everlasting disgrace of the roan who agreed to fall in with the views of the* company. The company is prepared by fair means or foul - by cajolery, by flattery, by entertaining persons&#39; at banquets, and even by bribery, I believe, to gain its ends. </para>

It has been so successful in certain respects that there is no other inference to be drawn than that it was prepared to spend money to gain its ends. I repeat that nobody would have been disadvantaged by the conference asked for by the partners to the Pacific Cable. The Commonwealth did not ask for this agreement in the first instance. It was asked for by the Eastern Extension Company. </para>

              <para>- I think that, although the honorable and learned senator was Postmaster-General, he took a back seat in these negotiations. The company approached the Prime Minister personally, and I am quoting his own words. Does any one believe that the company would approach the Commonwealth, for on agreement if they did .not consider that they would not be advantaged by it ? Hitherto they have done nothing but exploit the States by means of their &#39;monopoly. The Pacific Cable can do the business of the States just as well as the Eastern Extension Company. We can have a monopoly of the business in Queensland and in Victoria ; and the cable business from Melbourne is far more important than that of any other State, for the reason that Melbourne is the chief distributing port of Australia. It will be far better for us as a Commonwealth to run the risk of losing money by allowing the company to compete with the Pacific cable than to enter into this agreement which will last for .twelve years, and give them special consideration such as is proposed. &#39; I trust that the Senate will support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> in his demand for a conference. I hope to see the Victorian and Tasmanian senators especially eager in supporting him.&#39; Tasmania has been left out in the cold by the Prune Minister in his negotiations. </para>

A great deal is at stake. A conference will bring about better relations between the three parties who are in partnership with us - Canada, New Zealand, and Great Britain. The representatives of these countries will be able to hear what the representatives of Australia have to say, and the latter&#39;s arguments can be met, and, if possible, refuted by the representatives of the&#39; other side. Then there is the possible gain that the representatives of Canada, New Zealand, and Great Britain may be able to suggest to the Minister for Defence, if he be on the &#39;conference, a better agreement, which will protect the Commonwealth against this powerful company. </para>

There is&#39; .a great deal at stake. The parties to the Pacific cable have spent &#163;2,000,000, and have undertaken to pay something like &#163;75,000 per annum for 50 years in the interests of this cable, in addition to the cost of up-keep, and .so &#39;forth. If we ratify this agreement the Eastern Extension Company may make the losses on the Pacific cable so large that the contracting parties will be glad to sell it as old wire, or get rid of it in any way, as a huge burden ; and, the Pacific cable destroyed, we shall once more find ourselves in the octopus grasp of the Eastern Extension Company.- . </para>
