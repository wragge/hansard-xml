That course not being open to the present Administration, I can only fall back upon the one I am now adopting, and indicate in as brief terms as possible the measures which the Government propose to submit for consideration this session.

I should like to say that, in order to simplify the synopsis of measures now presented, they have been grouped according to subjects, and not to their relative importance. The statement is as follows : - </para>

                <para>The most complex series of measures to be submitted includes those affecting the Industrial interests of the Commonwealth. The pivot of several of these will be found in a Bill for the establishment of an Inter-State Commission, which, in addition to exercising the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, will also be authorized to undertake many of the valuable functions discharged in the United Kingdom by the Board of Trade, such as a general oversight of production and exchange, supplying information in respect to markets and openings for trade abroad, and for the improvement and extension of Australian industries within our borders. </para>
                <para>Among its duties will be those of a Federal Labour Bureau, comprising a study of unemployment and of a scheme for insurance against unemployment. </para>
                <para>The Commission will also assist in supervising the working of the existing Customs </para>
                <para class="block">Tariff in its operation upon the investment of Australian capital and labour in Australian industries, advising the removal of any inconsistencies in its schedules, and also with the further view of developing Preferential and other trade relations within the Empire. </para>
                <para>In the meantime any anomalies that may be discovered in the Customs Tariff Act lately passed by this Parliament, will be examined, classified, and dealt with in due course. </para>
                <para>Any divergencies between industrial conditions in the several States which occasion an unjust competition between Australian industries in different States will be adjusted by the Inter-State Commission, with, of course, due regard to all the interests affected, whether or not the unjustly competitive rates exist under the authority of local industrial tribunals. Correspondence is now proceeding with the State Governments in respect to the procedure to be followed in order to endow the Commission with this power. </para>
                <para>An Agricultural Bureau, associated with the Commission, will be established in order to employ the latest scientific means of co-ordinating and extending the good work of the State Departments. </para>
                <para>An active policy of Immigration will be undertaken, and will be expanded in the light of the knowledge made available by the Commission and the Bureau, and with, it is hoped, the co-operation of all the States. </para>
                <para>The appointment of a High Commissioner in London with a well-equipped office will be necessary for, among other purposes, our financial interests, the supervision of immigration, and co-operation with the Inter-State Commission in fostering trade and commerce. </para>
                <para class="block">In this connexion an endeavour will be made to cheapen the cable charges between Australia and the Mother Country, to extend the mail services, and to fully utilize in a Federal spirit the new facilities provided under the contract about to come into force. </para>
                <para>To permit a better discharge of the national responsibilities of the Commonwealth, your authorization will be sought for the acceptance of the Northern Territory. </para>
                <para>Among the first proposals of the Commonwealth Treasurer is that embodied in the Bill, of which notice has been given, for amendments of the Old-age Pensions Act. </para>
                <para>This measure, by temporarily suspending the requirements as to naturalization, will permit all old residents of Australia, otherwise qualified, to secure a pension by obtaining letters of naturalization prior to the end of the year. </para>
                <para>The second important feature of the measure is a reduction of the minimum qualifying period of residence in Australia from twenty-five years to twenty years  -  a concession which will, no doubt, be highly appreciated by the old residents whom it affects. </para>
                <para>Bills providing for the Compensation of Seamen, the Prohibition of Inequitable Rebates by Trusts and Combines, for the amendment of the Post and Telegraph Act 1 90 1, and the Patents Act, together with measures consolidating on a Federal basis the laws relating to Bills of Exchange, Bankruptcy, and Marine Insurance, all of great value to the business community, will be brought forward.- </para>
                <para>The negotiations in London, in 1907, concluded early last year, allowing the Coinage for the Commonwealth of an Australian Silver Currency, have been completed. In order to avoid further delay in securing the considerable profits thence accruing, a requisition for the new coinage has been despatched. </para>

                <para>Finance is in every year a vital question ; but it is no exaggeration to say that the obligations of the next eighteen months render it at present more important than at any period since Federation. </para>
                <para>This being the last session of the present Parliament, it is necessary, not only to make provision for the current financial year, but to forecast the near future, and its problems, in order that the outlook may be made clear to all before the coming general election. </para>

This was made abundantly clear by the admission of some of their members that the}&#39; did not regard the motion for a three weeks&#39; adjournment as at all unreasonable, even while they opposed it. Personally I should take no exception to any tactics that they may employ, but I think it is only right that the public should have an opportunity of noting that at the same time that a party is threatening obstruction it clamours loudly that the Government ought to press on immediately with business that it declares to be extremely urgent, but which it yet threatens to obstruct.&#34; </para>

It will be found that there was a difficulty in securing the attendance of sufficient Conservatives to keep a quorum. Out of thirty sitting days last session, some honorable senators opposite were absent seventeen days. I regret that I was not able to be here on the occasion of the last sitting of the Senate. The reason why I was absent was that I was attending the funeral of the late lamented Premier of South Australia, the Honorable Thomas Price. It amazed me to read such base insinuations coming from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen..</inline> I have considered it to be my duty as a senator, since I wa* elected, always to be in my place if possible. </para>

                        <para>- But there are questions as to which it will be my duty to enter an emphatic protest. I allude to such a proposition as that to squander/ perhaps,  .&#163;2,000,000  without consulting the people. If by blocking or doing anything that would be fair I could prevent the carrying of that proposal, then, my God ! it would be my duty to do it. That is my position. But I rose to call the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to his unfair tactics in making this -statement. I wish to remind him that he cannot - afford to play that game. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> now sits by his hide smiling. It is so nice for the honorable senator to have sitting by him the senator who used to fight him. In those days, the Labour Party used to stand between the two of them. But now here they are, sitting side by side, banded together, and have made a sacrifice of their pledges. The Labour Party must be abused, come what may. I say again to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that if nothing else will appeal to him, at least he will recognise that it does not pay for a Minister to indulge in this sort of abuse of a party the members of which have been more regular in attendance than have the members of any other party here. Who kept the old Deakin Government in office? Who assisted the late Government &#39;o pass the Tariff in both Houses ? We see the gallant colonel from New South Wales, v. ho was always a straight-out free-trader, supporting this new Government. Where does the honorable senator stand now? </para>
