          <para>- Certainly, and what is more, I will reply to any reply which is made, if it is as inaccurate as replies sometimes are here. I am suffering from a cold, and I hope that honorable senators will bear with me, and not render it necessary for me to shout in order that my remarks may be heard by, at least, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters., I shall first direct the attention of the Committee to a notorious case in Victoria, not in my own State at all, and that is the case of a petty officer, named Critten, employed at the Naval Depot, at Williamstown. He joined the Victorian navy, as a naval seaman, as far back as January, 1878. In August of the same year he was promoted to be a first-class executive petty officer. In September, 1883, while in the performance of his duty, he had the misfortune to be severely injured internally ; he was pronounced by a Medical Board to be unfit for heavy active work for the remainder of life. In February, 1887, he was given the position of naval storekeeper, with the understanding that he should retain it so long as he was fit to perform the duties - this, apart from the question of age - and, as storekeeper, he was gazetted twice in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline> He was gazetted by an Order in Council in November, 1906, and also in November, 1908. I am aware that contradiction has been given to my statement to that effect. It has been asserted that he never was in the service of the Commonwealth, and never was. gazetted. For the purpose of brevity, I would rather make a statement, and let the Committee judge of its value, but finding that statements unsupported are recklessly denied, I have armed myself with the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notices, which I have heard stated somewhere did not exist. I have done more, I wish the Committee to understand that I never bring cases hastily before the Chamber. Some days ago I brought forward the case of a man injured in a railway accident some days ago, and it was complained that the man had not taken certain action. I do not wish to refer to a previous debate. I am responsible for the man not having taken earlier action, simply because I was working out every thread of the roots of the tree, and ascertaining beyond the smallest possibility of contradiction, that every statement was accurate. I always pursue that course. Again, I want some honorable senators, and perhaps it would be as well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> to know that New South Wales cases, which I bring before the Senate, I handle almost exclusively. I take such an interest in the cases that I prepare all the documents, and type them for the accused persons if I consider that the law has been broken. It is of no earthly use for any one to allege that I do not understand the cases, because there is no man alive who knows more about them than I do. In nearly every case that I bring forward I possess the originals of all correspondence, or, at least, attested copies. I am going to read from attested copies of public documents in connexion with every one of the cases I intend to mention to-day. In order that the Committee may thoroughly understand the case of this unfortunate person Critten, I shall go back as far as 1887, and read the following memorandum :  - </para>

You, sir, would not allow me to read from the report of the debate, but I ask honorable senators to look up the statement contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> speech on this subject, and see how he denied that this man was mentioned in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and that he was ever in the service of the Commonwealth. The whole trouble &#39;about Critten&#39;s case is this : Some unauthorized person - I am right in using that term, because the Governor-General in Council has twice proclaimed the position - has denied to Critten the1 pay to which he is entitled. He has been disrated, and has been compelled, in order to obtain his wretched pittance  of 6s. per day, on which he has to bring up a family of nine children, _ to consent tacitly to a breach of his appointment. He has had to sign a pay sheet which specifies an inferior rating from that which the Governor-General gave to him. </para>

I do not care what the exigencies of the service may be ; no officer in the community, no matter how highly placed, is entitled to set aside the order of the Governor-General in Council, except for so long as may be necessary to report the case to that authority. Not even, the Minister has such power. I am sure that every lawyer will agree that that is a correct statement of the law. But this man - poor fellow, crippled for life, without any compensation, except the promise of employment - has been treated in this fashion.  His  accident occurred while he was in the employment of the State of Victoria. I have nothing to do with that phase, of the question. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, when Minister of Defence, ordered that he should be paid 7s. per day. For years, however, he has only been getting- 6s. per day.

I am addressing one or two honorable senators who have been Ministers of the Crown, and I think that . they will agree with me in saying that what the Minister proposed to do was improper. I was not the first member of Parliament to take this matter up. Victorian State members tried to get proper treatment for this man. I do not know how many have handled the case. But I was asked to look into it, and having got together all the correspondence, I wrote to the Minister about it.

In order to arrive at the simple question whether the man had  been gazetted by the Governor-General in Council ; whether he had been displaced ; whether his position in the pay-sheets had been altered, and he had been refused the pay to which he was entitled, the Minister proposed this cheerful independent Board. But these simple facts, it seems to me, could have been ascertained within a quarter of an hour. </para>

          <para>- This letter to me is dated 16th February, 1909, and Critten&#39;s application for the Board was later. In accordance with the Minister&#39;s invitation, he stated his case. I will read it. There is no application for a Board in it, and the ex-Minister of Defence should not make these misstatements which are not consonant with the dignity of the Senate, even if they are consonant with the dignity of an ex-Minister of Defence. After I received the letter addressed to me on the 16th February, I communicated with Critten, whom I have never seen. I do not know the man from Adam, but that does not affect_ the justice of his case. I am not pleading for one of the class described! by a distinguished member of another place as &#34; gilded spurred roosters,&#34; but for a man who is occupying so humble a position that he is being sweated at the rate of 6s. a day.

        <para>I am not now Storekeeper, neither have I the status or pay attached to that position. I have been for 31 years in the Naval Service (30^ years as a Petty Officer). My pay for the whole of that period has been at the fate of 6s. per diem, and I have been trying to bring up a family of nine children. In February, 1898, my rating as Storekeeper was altered from  a  1st Class to a Chief Petty Officer. At the expiration of five years from that date, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> 1.2.03, I was entitled as per Regulations to an additional 6d. per diem for Service. I have made repeated applications, both verbally and in writing, but up to the present time I have not been successful in obtaining that sum. </para>

      <para class="block">I have produced official documents which prove that these statements are true, }&#39;et the late Minister of Defence apparently could not do justice on his own authority. What was he there for ? Did he understand what were the functions of a responsible Minister? He did not deal with a simple matter of this kind, but handed it over to a Board consisting of three persons, one of whom was not under his jurisdiction in any shape or form, since he was not an officer of the Commonwealth, and another of whom has no more to do with the Naval Service than I have with the growing of cucumbers in Mars. I was hopeful that something would be done, and I replied to the letter of the 16th February in these terms. The letter was addressed to me at my own residence, and from my residence I replied as follows -  &#34; Greycairn,&#34; Woollahra, 6th March,1909. </para>
      <para>Dear sir, </para>
      <para>Replying to your letter, No. 946, of the 16th February, <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> the case of Naval Storekeeper Critten, I beg to say that Critten has, in accordance with the Minister&#39;s proposal, made formal application to the Naval Board, and will be glad to place the facts of his case before the Special Board suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> whom I beg to thank for his promised action. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, I have to express the opinion that, for a petty officer, with nine children to support, to be paid 6s. per diem is a public scandal, as is also the fact that, though he has been entitled to an addition of 6d. per diem for six years, <inline font-style="italic">vide</inline> regulations, he has never received the money. </para>
      <para>Further, it is a scandal that, though he has been twice gazetted as storekeeper, he has been illegally displaced from this position, and denied the pay attaching to it. </para>

          <para>- A good deal more than the 6d. per day which is owing to Critten. I have to deal now with the case of another injured man, John MacDonnell. In business life he was a first class bootmaker, and as a member of the Defence Force was a private in one of the militia regiments of New South Wales. I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to bear in mind that my complaint in this case is not in any way against him as Minister of Defence. But I do make complaint against certain officers of the Department, apparently the headquarters staff of New South Wales, for acting with gross impropriety in the matter. In order that there may be no mistake as to the circumstances under which a member of a city regiment was travelling hundreds of miles to the north of that city, I am able to produce copies of the military orders under which he was travelling. I must read them, because if  1  do not go into every detail, I shall be told that I do not know the facts of the case. I referred to this case a little time ago. Any delay in bringing the case forward is due to my insisting upon getting every particular. The most capable solicitor that ever prepared a brief for counsel could not have taken more trouble than I have done to get all. the facts, of this case. I have here a document dated 7th April, 1908, and addressed to Private &#34; McDonald.&#34; There is a mistake in the spelling of the name ; the man&#39;s name is really MacDonnell. Perhaps I shall make the case clearer if I say that this man, having failed to continue his employment in Sydney, was offered a billet in a north-western town, Gunnedah. </para>

After being treated at the military hospital, Liverpool, I was sent from there to the Sydney Hospital, and from thence to this address, where I have remained ever since. I am completely incapacitated, and wholly and totally unable&#39; to pursue my wonted avocation which is that of high class hand-sewn bootmaker. I have consulted Alfred Nathan, Esq., solicitor (Minter, Simp son, and Co., Hunter-street). He had enjoined upon me absolute rest and quiet for four months with a trip (an ocean voyage to the Home Country, Great Britain, and Ireland), which, unfortunately, for financial reasons, I am unable to undertake. </para>
      <para>Hoping that this, my application, may meet with your favorable consideration. </para>

      <para class="block">The military authorities in Sydney had no right to deal with his application, or to touch it, because he had been gazetted out of the force as incapacitated. They should have sent the application back to the man, and told him to address the Minister or the Secretary of the Department, from whom I know he would have received courteous treatment ; at any rate I have always experienced the greatest courtesy in that direction. I complain of the action of the military authorities in Sydney. By the way, I heard that one officer in a high position on the staff there, not the General, has described me to a non-commissioned officer as being &#34; an exceedingly dangerous person,&#34; and I know that I am to his peace of mind. At least, I hold my military position as the result of examination, and that is a great deal more than the other chap does, no matter how highly placed he is. MacDonnell, I repeat, sent in his application on the 15th December. On the 10th March later he wrote from the same address the following letter - </para>

      <para>That is not the well-known firm of Hughes  and Hughes, one member of which is Vice-President of the Executive Council of New South Wales, and the other ex-Lord Mayor of Sydney. It is a different firm. I thought it was the same firm at one time, and I do not wish that idea to get abroad. As this man was put to an expense of some&#163;100 for medical treatment he cannot have received anything over&#163;400, and he is ruined for life. My complaint, I repeat, is not against the Minister who was in charge of the Department when the thing occurred. It is not the affairof <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> at all, but the affair of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing and his officers, so that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> need not take to heart anything I am saying. All this occurred before his time. Apparently no letter was written during his tenure of office. What I say - and I cannot be contradicted on these documents -is that the military authorities in Sydney dealt with this matter improperly. First of all they should have returned the application to the man, pointing out that he was not a member of the Military Force, and, therefore, they had nothing to do with him, and that if he wanted compensation he must apply to the Minister or to the Civil Department, which, no doubt, would refer it <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> Military Department for report. Since then I have advised the man that he has nothing to do with the military headquarters in Sydney. He has made his application directly to the Ministerial office, and that is undoubtedly the proper position for him to take up. In the whole time, apparently, the matter was never referred to Melbourne, and that is what I am complaining of. If it was referred to Melbourne, then it is to blame ; but I do not think that it was so referred, and I make no charge against the head-quarters service here, neither the Ministerial branch, nor the military branch. But this is a distinct evidence of mal-administration in high quarters in the Defence Department, and it is one of the things which want correcting. There is only one other case with which I will deal, and it is more  for  the purpose of showing what the true facts are. Some time ago I made a statement here, and I was challenged with inaccuracies all the time I was speaking.I do not propose to state the case at all, but to read the Attorney-General&#39;s statement of the case, and perhaps that will satisfy my honorable friends on the opposite bench. </para>

          <para>- I have endeavoured to state the facts of these cases as briefly as possible, but hitherto all the satisfaction that I have been able to obtain has been in the nature of ridiculously inaccurate replies. Consequently I have taken the trouble to produce documentary proof of every statement that I have made. The case to which I now propose to refer originated during <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing&#39;s term of office as Minister of Defence, and was finally dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in one of his earliest acts of administration. What the latter actually did, was, I believe, perfectly correct, but what he wrote was a distinct insult - a most grievous insult - to one branch of our Citizen Forces. But, notwithstanding that, the decision at which he arrived was perfectly sound. I think honorable senators will admit that I have not dealt with any of these cases in a spirit of party antagonism, but that I have stated the facts as I would state them for the information of a jury. That is really what I am doing - putting the question before, the highest jury in Australia.

          <para>- No one said that he was not. But not even his most enthusiastic friend would accuse him of being a lawyer. At any rate, he is not paid to practice as a lawyer, but the Attorney-General and the Secretary to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department are. As I have said, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, then Minister of Defence, hit upon a brilliant scheme. The trouble about this officer was that he was alleged to have been the worse for liquor. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> min.nute says, it was a question whether the man was the worse for liquor or had had an overdose of quinine. If the papers were called for and read it would be seen from the evidence of witnesses - and they were not the best witnesses that the accused had - that it was an open question The man was not quite himself, and who could say how that was accounted for? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was right in the decision he came to. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing&#39;s idea was a brilliant one&#39;. He applied to the Premier of New South Wales for the services of a stipendiary magistrate, to see whether this officer had been swallowing whisky or quinine. If Gilbert and Sullivan ever happened upon anything funnier than that, I should like to know what it was. I have heard some of their funny business, but I never heard of anything more absolutely jocose than the appointment by the Premier of one of the States of the Commonwealth of a stipendiary magistrate to ascertain whether a chap swallowed whisky or quinine. &#39;The Prime Minister of New South Wales said, &#34; This is a task outside a magistrate&#39;s commission. He must be protected if he is to make these inquiries. He must have a legal status, and must be appointed a Royal Commission.&#34; Just when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing was retiring from office he was busily applying to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> of New South Wales, for the appointment of a Royal Commission to determine whether whisky or quinine had been swallowed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing&#39;s brilliant idea of an inquiry by a stipendiary magistrate never came off, and the Commonwealth consequently lost something in fun. The period during which under the Act a member of the Defence Forces can be prosecuted for an offence is limited to six months. After six months had passed, and nothing had occurred but this abortive  Colonel Campbell  investigation, I applied for the man&#39;s discharge. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> then came into office as Minister of Defence, and took a hand in the game. He dealt with this matter very promptly, and, to a certain point, very satisfactorily. He wrote-- </para>

The whole defence of the metropolitan area of Sydney is in the hands of volunteers commanded by  Colonel Campbell,  to whom I have referred. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> wrote - </para>

      <para class="block">So you may insult a volunteer officer. You may order him under arrest illegally, treat him illegally for six or eight months, and there is no hardship because he is only a volunteer. That is what I complain of. The late Minister of Defence did the right thing, but did it in the wrong way, and if  he would take back that insult to the volunteers of Australia it would be consonant with his position as a member of this Chamber, and with that which he held as Minister of Defence. I have occupied the attention of the Committee for very much longer than I was willing to do, but that I should go into these matters in detail was necessary, in view of what has happened to me before.  There is no statement I have uttered here which I have not proved by the production of official documents. It is impossible to tell me that I do not understand these matters. It is impossible to explain away these cases, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has endeavoured to do, in this off-hand way, with the object of whitewashing some people who were acting wrongfully. This delay, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says, was inevitable in the circumstances. Why? Because the officers of the Department did not do their duty. That is what caused the inevitable delay; the holding of an illegal inquiry, and the refusal for a fortnight to send on a document which should have gone to the Minister by the first post. That is what caused a &#39;lot of the &#34;inevitable delay,&#34; but it was of no consequence, apparently, because the sufferer was only a volunteer officer. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will understand that in the few remarks I shall address to the Committee I, in no sense, take the slightest exception to his bringing these matters before honorable senators. Indeed I may say that I think that one of the highest responsibilities which rests upon any member of Parliament is when he thinks an injustice has been done to seek for redress of that injustice&#39; here. But I would like to remind the honorable senator that the cases which he now brings before our attention, though not for the first time, are in their details absolutely new so fat as I am concerned. For that reason it will not be possible for me, nor do I think it necessary to attempt, in view of what I have to say, to follow the honorable senator through the details of the three cases he has referred to. With regard to the last case, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will be the first to admit that -it is practically closed so far as the Department is- concerned. That case was decided by the late Minister of Defence, and, so far as the Department is concerned, there is in that matter now no question awaiting consideration. With regard to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MacDonnell,</inline> the honorable senator was perfectly right when he expressed the opinion that the particulars in that cast&#39; had not been referred to the Central Office of the Department. They have there no information of that case officially, beyond a knowledge of the recent utterances of the honorable senator himself. All I can promise is that steps will be taken to place the Head Office of the Department in communication with those in whose hands the papers now are. </para>

I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that steps will be taken to ascertain what, if anything, has been done in connexion with this matter. The case of Critten, with which the honorable senator dealt at much greater length, extends, as the Committee are aware, over a long period of years, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> addressed himself to a great many details which it would be impossible for any one placed as I am, and hearing the facts referred to for the first time, to attempt to answer. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has said, the case was eventually referred to a Committee for investigation. The Committee has presented its report, which is now before the Minister for consideration and decision. </para>

        <para>I submit to the honorable senator that he might reasonably allow the matter to rest at that stage until my honorable colleague has had the opportunity of reading and considering that report, and his decision thereon is made known. He will then be in a position to see the report, and also be in possession of the Minister&#39;s decision. It would be idle and unnecessary, I think, to occupy the time of the Committee now in discussing the merits or demerits of the case, when it is in the condition I have stated. I therefore ask my honorable friend to allow the matter to rest at that stage, with the assurance that the report of the Committee will be placed at his disposal in the course of a very few days. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Colonel CAMERON</inline>(Tasmania) &#91;12.32&#93;. - I had no intention to take part in the discussion on this Bill, and, had  it not been for the remarks of my distinguished friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I should not have risen. On an occasion of this kind, I believe that almost any subject can be discussed. But in view of the very serious condition of things which confronts us, when we have to organize and discipline the Military Forces on which the existence of this great Commonwealth will depend to a very large extent - I deprecate, in every way I can, the discussion of trivial matters here. Speaking from experience, and as one of those who are, to a certain extent, responsible for disciplining the &#39; Military Forces, I unhesitatingly say that it is extremely hurtful to have grievances brought forward in this way before every means have been exhausted departmentally to put matters right. With this protest against the introduction of minor matters- matters of insignificance when all is said and done - I will say no more, except that it is to be regretted that the time of the Senate should be wasted. </para>

          <para>.- The Vice-President of the Executive Council has just approved &#169;f honorable senators bringing forward any grievances which they know to exist. I desire to refer to a state of affairs in the Military Offices in Adelaide, which I think ought to be remedied at the earliest possible date. These offices were built about sixty years ago, and are absolutely out-of-date. They are miserable little places, unfit to be occupied even by a dog or a pig, let alone by military officers. </para>

            <para>- I hope that some provision will be made on the Estimates for remedying this grievance. Another matter to which I think attention should be drawn is the treatment of rifle clubs. In 1902 South Australia had fifty-five rifle clubs, and although to-day it has more than double that number, they have only the same staff on the clerical division to look after that branch of the military service as they had in 1902. The late secretary to rifle clubs in the State, after having endeavoured for a considerable time to get some assistance or redress, threw up the position in disgust, and left the service. The present secretary, in addition to working the whole of every day, has, to my knowledge, had to go back almost every evening of the week for two or three hours, and, on some occasions, in order to cope with the work which devolves upon him, has even to go back to work on Sundays. That is, I think, another grievance which the military authorities, or the Home Affairs Department, should take an early opportunity to remedy. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HENDERSON</inline>(Western Austral &#91;12.40&#93;. - I was highly pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Story&#39;s</inline> remarks about the state of the military quarters in Adelaide. From a minute personal inspection, I can say that no more disgraceful accommodation is to be found in Australia than there. There are little dens in which I would not put a dog for which I had any respect. Of course, if I had a dog which I wanted to poison with a foetid atmosphere, I would place him in these military quarters, where a most insanitary condition of things exists. It is only fair that the Government should look into the matter, and at the earliest possible date take the necessary steps to provide sanitary accommodation for the men who are supposed to possess health and vigour, to attend to the requirements of the Military Forces. I trust that an improvement will very soon be effected. I am satisfied that were these men civilians, a very strong public protest would be made against the conditions in which they are compelled from day to day to carry on their labours, and work out their existence. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;12.42&#93;. - I am quite sure that my honorable and gallant friend,  Colonel Neild,  felt last evening that the matters he proposed to deal with were of grave and great importance. Otherwise, I am satisfied that he, as a supporter of the Government, would not have suggested deferring the completion of this Supply Bill for another day. I am also convinced that nothing but the paramount importance of these anticipated matters would have influenced the members of the Government here to defer still further the payment of the 500 postal servants, who are at the point of starvation, with whom we were threatened as a reason for pushing on this Bill yesterday. I make these remarks because our proceedings today illustrate the impropriety of the Minister trying to force a Supply Bill through the Chamber by intimations which are as absurd as I think them to be unfounded. I do not believe for a moment that there was the slightest apprehension in the mind of the Government that these men would not be paid when the money was due. Further, I deprecate it because that sort of thing is often thrown out - I do not think it ought to be - as a sort of taunt to the Labour party, and as something very unpleasant for them to&#39; hear, if they seek to discharge their duty as, I suppose, they considered they were doing yesterday, under the fear that they may be delaying working men in need in getting their pay. In view of what has taken place to-day, under the plea of my honorable friend, we should not hear again a statement made in order to deprive the Senate of its just and constitutional right to deal in the fullest possible manner with a Supply Bill. With regard to the details of the three cases which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has ventilated, I do not wish to say anything ; but about the results I desire to say a few words. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> in deprecating - I do not say as to these or any particular cases - the intervention of either Houses of Parliament in what are literally matters of discipline and procedure in the Defence Forces. </para>

            <para>- I must say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is entitled to credit for exhaustively putting his case before the body whose intervention he seeks. The third case was that of Critten. Again, I say nothing upon the merits of his case. I am not competent to express an opinion upon them. But, boiled down, the position appears to be that for five years Critten has received 6d. per day less than he thinks he ought to have received, and he is of opinion that the arrears due to him should be paid. That seems to me to be purely a departmental matter. Obviously, this Senate is not the best Court of Appeal to deal with the momentous question of whether he should be paid that additional 6d. per day or not. I quite agree that where injustice is being done by a public body, or by any person in a public office, Parliament is the ultimate tribunal in which redress ought to be sought. But that principle does not apply to matters of procedure and discipline in military affairs, and we shall absolutely shatter discipline if we encourage such an objectionable practice. I shall be glad to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild--</inline></para>

            <para>- They have been deserted by the Government. I am not aware that anybody knows more than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> about the Military Forces of the Commonwealth. I think that honorable senators ought to be informed what is the condition of our Defence Forces, and I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to give us his opinion upon that question. I hold very strongly - and I take the earliest opportunity of mentioning it - that the  main defence of Australia, assuming the supremacy of the Imperial Fleet, consists in  her land forces. Probably we shall have other opportunities of dealing with the question of our naval defence. To my mind, naval defence in the case of Australia is largely a matter of the protection of trade routes- - the trade of the British Empire in which we are so largely interested. </para>

What we have most to fear is the patrol of our coast by a hostile cruiser or two, which might, perhaps, endeavour to plant a few shells in some of our cities. Let me take the case of Sydney, as an example. No expeditionary force of any strength could possibly be landed there by any reasonably anticipated enemy. No such force could effect a landing, with any hope of remaining in occupation, on any settled part of our shores from Brisbane to- Adelaide. </para>

The people do not like soldiers to come into their neighbourhood. .They think the soldiers are only fit to go abroad and fight their battles. It is a most unfortunate mistake on their part, because soldiers in our days are not what they were fifty or sixty years ago. </para>

            <para>- There are one or two other references which I should like to make to this subject, because they are very suggestive, and apply very much to ourselves. I feel sure that they will be taken into consideration by the Minister of Defence, who is, no doubt, fully alive to the important points that I am endeavouring to make. . The passage to which I called the attention of the Senate  was as to the interest taken in the Army. Lord Roberts says that people in England think that the Territorial Army is not wanted, and that they look upon it as a plaything. I am afraid that what have been referred to as ceremonial parades are rather apt to lead people to the impression that our forces are a plaything. Lord Roberts is not greatly impressed with these parades. I will read a line or two from what he says about them. Only a day or two before he spoke, there was a march of the Territorial Army through the streets of London, which led to this remark from him - </para>

        <para>I am afraid that the spectacular element rather overshadows the real earnest interest which ought to be taken in the force as a body of fighting men. Lord Roberts goes on to say - </para>

          <para>While we are all sitting here and taking it all easily and comfortably the danger is coming near to us every day ; and unless you determine to make some inquiry, and not let the people believe they are living in safety, and that we have an army fit to deal with any enemy which may come here, we shall some day come to such utter grief that you will regret your inaction now. It is to me a perfect marvel how anybody can see what is going on all around us throughout Europe and be content with the condition of the army. </para>

You may double the strength of the Territorial Army, but so long as it is untrained, and so long as it has not got officers who know their duty, it is no use. You must have regular officers and regular non-commissioned officers. </para>

            <para>- I wish to deal with things as they are. Subject to the position to which I have called attention, the only danger that* is to be feared in Australia is an expeditionary force. Now, how many soldiers would require to be landed by an enemy in order to subdue Australia? In my humble judgment, such a thing is really out of the question as far as regards the settled portions of Australia. We know that in the Transvaal, with, a population of, I suppose, about 300,000 people, an army of about 250,000 soldiers was required. </para>

            <para>- I quite agree that if a nucleus force of 50,000 disciplined, trained, and well-equipped men, with all the proper munitions of war, were in readiness, and were well led, we in Australia could keep out 200,000 mcn. But how many ships should we require? We have to protect ourselves against raiding cruisers. We want, as I am happy to think I have always joined in advocating, a small squadron of ships of our own, which will be effective as an auxiliary for coastal defence, and, if we can manage it, for the purpose also of assisting in protecting our trade routes. Our trade is our life blood. </para>

            <para>- I am not an expert as some of my honorable friends are, but it is really amusing when scares are raised to notice the loose talk that is indulged in. Of course, an expeditionary force of comparatively small magnitude might effect a landing in the north, but its presence could only be maintained so long as it was supported by naval force exercising some control over its base of supply. Therefore, looking at the matter in the best way that I, as an humble, citizen of this country can look at it, I say that immense stress ought to be laid upon the value of our land forces, and that we ought not to be unduly diverted from that consideration by the creation of naval scares. We want ships to assist our land forces, and to maintain untarnished and undiminished the supremacy of the sea. But the main thing for us is an effective land force. </para>

            <para>- Probably a land tax would be sufficient to keep an enemy out altogether. Nothing is so calculated to frighten people from settlement as a big land tax. It is not a policy that I am asking for just now, because, as my honorable friends know quite well, we cannot expect anything of that kind vet. When danger does come, I am sure that every honorable senator, without party considerations of any sort, will be glad to assist in formulating a policy for the establishment of an effective system of defence for this country. But what I do ask for, especially in view of the remarks as to bayonets, made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who like Lord Roberts is perhaps a little pessimistic, is some assurance as to the numbers and efficiency of our land forces, and whether the Government are satisfied that in the event of any immediate emergency we might rest content. The best assurance would be the dissemination amongst the public of that confidence which Ministers themselves entertain, I hope, with regard to the efficiency of our forces. I am sure that they are perfectly alive to the situation, but we should like to know that they are satisfied that we have a sufficiency of trained officers commissioned and non-commissioned, and a sufficient force of trained men well equipped and provided with up-to-date munitions of war, so that should any emergency arise and a descent be attempted, it might be dealt with in the most effective manner possible. </para>

            <para>- I shall withdraw the expression if it hurts any one. There were three or four points mentioned in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> address which I shall briefly refer to. The honorable senator spoke in a most contemptuous manner of an extra sixpence on a day&#39;s pay of 6s. It would be interesting to know if the honorable and learned senator has the same contemptuous opinion of the extra shilling which follows the pound on a brief, although1s. as compared with&#163;1 is proportionately of less value than 6d. is as compared with 6s. In connexion with another case to which I referred the honorable senator asked of what use it was to bring the matter up here, seeing that the case was at an end. Following the lines of that argument, if a man is hung illegally and unlawfully, one must not say anything about it because the fellow is dead, and to refer to it would be a waste of time. With reference to MacDonnell&#39;s case, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> dilated vehemently about the impropriety of two compensations. I should like to ask whether the honorable senator has not professional knowledge that actions are sometimes successfully maintained against Railway Commissioners, notwithstanding the fact that those related to a person injured or killed may. have drawn money under an insurance policy. The fact that a man&#39;s life is insured does not. relieve Railway Commissioners or other general carriers of liability for compensation. In this case, the Commonwealth law provides for compensation entirely irrespective of the receipt of compensation from any extra source whatever. I think that on reconsideration <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will admit that he carried his view in this matter to an extreme that was hardly justifiable. On the general question there was very much in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said that must appeal to any one, expert or non-expert, who has any information on the subject of Australian defence. I might sum up, as I have often done before, the position so correctly put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> by saying that an armed mob does not make an army. You must have trained leaders . or you will only carry men to destruction as unhappily too often has occurred in the&#39; history of naval and military operations. </para>

            <para>- From the time that Major-General Hutton reorganized our forces up to the present we have been short of trained officers to the number of between  400  and  500.  The matter is one to which for years I attempted to direct attention in the press, because it is the most serious deficiency we have. There are thousands of men in the community who have had some military training, but who have left the service, and such men if brought back to the colours might be licked into fighting form in a very short time. But it is impossible to train a leader in the time within which men may be taught to obey commands. We know that an apprentice out of his indentures can speedily carry out instructions given him, but you cannot make him a foreman or place him in the position of overseer for many a year or until experience and senior training fits him for the giving of orders as well as for their execution. </para>

I shall ask the honorable senator a simple question, which I hope he will give me a direct answer. Is it or is it not a fact that the payment of the 500 employes to whom the honorable senator referred last night, was provided for under the last Appropriation Act; is their payment made fortnightly, and as a necessary corollary, is any payment due to them before the 14th of this month of July ?

It seemed last night that it would be almost a crime for which every member of the Committee might be impeached if the passing of the Supply Bill were delayed, but the Bill is still before the Committee and the 500 employes referred to have not yet been paid their wages which the Minister of Trade and Customs said were overdue yesterday. We should be told what is the exact position with regard to payments which the Government have to make to persons employed by the different Departments, and the means which the Government may have in hand to anticipate to the extent of a day or two the passing of the Supply Bill. Will the Minister be good enough to say directly when the payments, to which he referred were due. </para>

          <para>&#91;2.42&#93;. - The members of the Committee were entitled to the information I gave them. It is merely twisting arguments to suggest for a moment that I introduced the statement I made by way of a threat. Nothing directly or indirectly justifies such a suggestion. I stated facts which honorable senators were entitled to be made aware of. On the 30th June moneys appropriated up to that date had to be paid, and moneys unpaid on that date, of course, lapsed. There are hundreds of casual employes in the various Departments. I should say that 500 is an under-estimate of the number of casual employes in the Postal Department. I learned from my honorable colleague that these casual employes are dependent for payment upon moneys which, of course, under the Bill, would be appropriated <inline font-style="italic">fox</inline> the months of July and August. It was urged that the term covered by this Supply Bill should be reduced from two months to one month. I pointed out that that would involve considerable delay. It meant that the Bill would have to be returned to another place ; that there would possibly be a dispute between the two Houses, that even from the most satisfactory point of view, it would mean a re-casting of the measure. It was in view of the delay which would necessarily follow in the circumstances to which I have referred, that I said that men in the casual employ of the Government would be unable to secure payment for their services. That seems to me to be a reasonable statement to make, and one which should appeal to honorable senators. Every day&#39;s delay after the 30th June is unprovided for. </para>

            <para>- Of course not, but the honorable senator knows that I was contemplating a dispute which might bring about a delay, the extent of which no one could estimate. So far as payments up to the 30th June were concerned, they were already provided for by the appropriation up to that date. But as regards payments subsequent to that date, they, of course, could only be provided for by this Supply Bill. I am simply reminding honorable senators of something which was obvious in the circumstances. I got a general statement from the Post and Telegraph Department, but, as honorable senators know, it is quite impossible to obtain full particulars regarding the several Departments. When </para>

        <para class="block">I was informed that there were 500 casual employes in the Post and Telegraph Department who would be dependent upon the Bill for the payment for their services, it was fair and reasonable to inform honorable senators of the fact. I regret that the words I used in that spirit, and with that intention alone, should have been construed into a threat to the Senate. A Minister with even- a limited experience would be the last man to make a threat, because there &#39;is nothing to be gained thereby. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot help thinking that the Minister had some object&#34; in view in introducing this Bill as he did yesterday afternoon. It is quite apparent now, from the attitude which the party on this side are taking up in reference to the Bill, that there was a little move on by the Government, and that they expected the Opposition to fall into the trap laid for them. So far as I am able to judge, a very seamy side of party tactics* has been exposed by the attitude taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> when the Bill was introduced yesterday. Honorable senators on this side knew the position just as well as the Government did. We knew that a number of men were dependent upon the passage of the Bill for the payment of their salaries. But the Bill was not pushed along yesterday as it might have been. From the manner in which it was introduced, we had every reasonable ground to expect that it would be pushed through last night. </para>

            <para>- I protest against this sort of thing being attempted for party advantages. I hold that the action of the Government, both, last night and to-day, is clear evidence that they were trying to get a stigma cast upon the Labour party by reason of the delay in passing this Bill. The proof is that they knew, or ought to have known, that the men in Perth were awaiting payment. </para>

          <para>. - I have asked the Minister of Trade and Customs a simple question, and have been supplied with something in the nature of an answer by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I do not propose in the present state of things to ask the responsible Minister here a question which I think is important, and then to be satisfied with an answer from a member of the Opposition, nor do I think that that is a desirable state of things. If - in a matter of some importance I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> a simple question which demands, as a matter of courtesy, a direct answer, and I find him again resorting to ambiguities of language, to a mere repetition of arguments which barely touch the question, then my dissatisfaction will increase. If it is a fact, as I begin to gather from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said, rather than from anything which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said, that any delay in the passing of this Bill would operate injuriously as regards certain temporary employes in the Post and Telegraph Department, it was quite competent for the Minister, a moment ago, when I asked him the question, even if it was not desirable to do so yesterday, to give a direct and straight answer. It is the opinion of every honorable senator, I think, that a moment ago he entirely evaded my question. I am not going to be put aside by a mere collocation of words which have no direct meaning, and which have one object, and that is to hide something and evade giving an answer. The Minister cannot expect that any one will be satisfied with such treatment. With regard to the question of future Supply Bills, I want the matter to be cleared up. I ask the Minister whether, in the case of temporary employes running a risk with regard to the payment of their wages, he will so bring in a Supply Bill as to avoid that risk, and to obviate the possibility of such an argument being again used for party purposes. I ask him to elucidate that point still further. I desire to know if there is no money available, either by way of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance or in any other way, to meet the necessity of paying temporary hands. </para>

            <para>- I- thank the Minister for reminding me of a provision in the Constitution, but I will still, for a few moments, focus the attention of the Committee, not on all Supply Bills, but on the present one. If, when the Bill was introduced here, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knew that the circumstances were such that the Senate had no alternative, except on the one hand to indorse it <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> or, on the other hand, to accept the full responsibility of delaying payment to casual hands in the Post and Telegraph Department, such a position reflects no credit on this Government, but a considerable amount of discredit. They treated both the Senate and the temporary employes in a way which no Government ought to do. </para>

            <para>- I am not concerned so much with what happened last night as with the conditions in which the Bill was introduced here. It was introduced in circumstances which I hope will never be repeated. It. is intolerable and monstrous that the Senate should be put in a position in which it has to face the responsibility of having men thrown out of employment if it takes a certain course. The Government ought to arrange, and I believe they could have arranged, matters so as to avoid the possibility of such a position arising. </para>

          <para>. - There is one aspect of the telegram read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie which, I think, calls for a further reference. According to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> no money can possibly be due for payment under the Bill other than the amounts he referred to - a very large amount to Western Australia, and one or two other amounts of a like character. There are no amounts due to casual employes, at any rate, for several days. They are only paid weekly - I am not. sure that they are not paid fortnightly. </para>

The undertaking is being carried out by casual labourers, who are employed either by day labour or by a contractor. If they are employed by a contractor, no payment has become due during the present financial year, and the Treasurer had ample funds in his Treasurer&#39;s Advance to have permitted of their payment up till the 30th June last. He could have paid them up till that date, had he so desired. If the reason given for the discharge of these men is that no funds were available with which to pay them,I say that the Treasurer could have paid them up till last Wednesday had he chosen to do so, and that no further payment would have been due until next Wednesday. </para>

            <para>- The plea which has been advanced for the discharge of these men is that no funds were available. If that statement be correct, the entire responsibility rests with the Treasurer in failing to see that his liabilities were met up till the end of June. He could have paid these men out of his Treasurer&#39;s Advance - which I know, from personal knowledge, was ample - up till last Wednesday. These circumstances lend colour to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that the employes engaged in the work of undergrounding the telephone wires in Perth were discharged in order to suit the purposes of the Government. </para>

            <para>- I say that, on the face of it, it certainly looks like that. If the men had been dispensed with because the work had been completed, or because there had been an inrush of water into the tunnels, there would have been no ground for suspicion. But the reason given to them for dispensing with their services - it has been stated publicly in Perth - was that no money was available with which to pay them. That plea, taken in conjunction with the statement of the Government that they require Supply to be granted to enable them to make money available for the payment of these casual labourers, does certainly give rise to suspicion. Under such circumstances, &#39; what impression could be conveyed to the casual labourers in Perth other than that the cause of their discharge was to be found in the action of the Senate in not passing the Supply Bill yesterday ? </para>

            <para>- The probability is that quite a large number have been similarly treated; and, if so, they should be recompensed for the time which they have lost. The Government, having commenced the work of constructing underground tunnels for the reception of the telephone wires in Berth, must certainly contemplate carrying that work to its completion. Undoubtedly the sudden discharge of the men engaged upon that work must create suspicion in the mind of any reasonable man. I trust that the Government will make an inquiry into the matter, and that if it be found that the action of the Treasurer has prevented these men from earning a livelihood, steps will be taken to recompense them for the time which they have lost. </para>

            <para>- Honorable senators opposite apparently imagine that they are justified in making the vilest insinuations against the Government in reference to this matter. Yet the moment we protest against their action we are told that we are not justified in doing so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has chosen to give emphasis and colour to the insinuation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the Government have thrown a number of men out of employment merely to serve a party purpose. Having criticised the  Government for having done what he alleges - and they would have been deserving of criticism if they had done it - he calmly asks &#34; Will the Government make inquiries into the matter?&#34; What need would there be for inquiry if we had done what he suggests? The Minister of Trade and Customs has already told the Senate that the Government knew nothing about the discharge of the casual labourers to whom reference has been made, nor does anybody in the Postal Department.  </para>

            <para>- No, but I can say that the statement that the Government has&#34; done this thing for party purposes is too contemptible to be entitled to a moment&#39;s consideration from any honest or fair-minded man. Let me deal with a few of the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce. Senator Best</inline> pointed out yesterday that the financial year terminated on Wednesday. It was, therefore, possible for men to work for a week terminating to-morrow, and yet for it to be impossible to pay them because the vote on account of the work they were doing lapsed with the end of .the financial year. They might work on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, but the wages for them would cease to be available through their not having been paid on the 30th June. Honorable senators know that all votes lapse and fall back into the consolidated revenue on that date. Unless you have an intermediate payment of wages on the Wednesday, which is not a regular pay day, it follows that even that portion of the week&#39;s work for which provision was made on .the previous Estimates could not be paid for. The result is that this Bill is necessary, not only for the payment of wages for the whole week, but also for the payment of wages earned at the beginning of the week. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> absolutely denied that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> pointed out that it was necessary to get the Bill passed as near to the  30th  June as possible. Let me also refer to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> last night. Speaking to-day he said that he had not admitted that the Government had used expedition in bringing forward the Bill, but last night when I put a question to him, and was trying to show that the  Government  had dealt expeditiously with the measure, he said, &#34; I do not accuse them of any delay in introducing the Bill.&#34; </para>

            <para>- We had a right to expect that Parliament would assist us in getting Supply at the earliest possible moment. Last night we had hopes that the Bill would be put through before the adjournment, but we were disappointed. When the Ministerial statement was first introduced we were met with a reasonable request for  an adjournment  for a day. What would have happened if the Government had declined to entertain the application ? We should have been accused of want of courtesy to the Opposition. The Governmentfollowed the ordinary political usage, and granted the adjournment asked for. The Supply Bill was afterwards detained in the other House. It was discussed for three days. It reached the Senate yesterday. I say that there was no time lost. The Government have proceeded as expeditiously as possible with the measure. Blame is now sought to be placed on us, however, because of the position in which some workmen in Western Australia have been placed. But only yesterday, and even to-day, we laid the facts of the case before the Senate, telling honorable senators that this danger did exist. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> indeed blamed the Government for having  warned the Senate of this danger from delay. </para>

            <para>- That remark is very unfair, if it represents the views of the Opposition party as a whole. The position last night was this. The Opposition, through its leader, allowed us to&#39; suspend the Standing Orders and get on with the Bill. At the same time an arrangement was made that the Senate should not sit late. We know what that means. Sitting late in the Senate means sitting after half-past 10 or 11 o&#39;clock. The Government were anxious to complete the Bill last night, but as we saw that we could not do so, it seemed that an adjournment was reasonable. If any honorable senator towards the close of the sitting had said that he desired to speak at length on any subject we should have consented to an adjournment. </para>

        <para class="block">We have brought the Government scheme to the light. They have been guilty of working a party scheme for party purposes. How was it that honorable senators opposite induced a Labour senator to take his seat last night, and then when a friend and supporter of the Government got up they gave him an adjournment and allowed him to waste the greater part of to-day ? It is a shame and a disgrace. Apparently, the Government have some scheme, but admittedly they did not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest had been up to. He occupies an important position in the Government, and had to be sent for to the West to do the engineering necessary to bring about the fusion.

          <para>. - I have not previously taken part in the discussion on this Bill. But I wish now to emphasize the fact which has been made clear by the discussion which has already taken place that the party of which I am a member are in no way responsible for the blocking of Supply, if it has been blocked. Day after day, we have read the accusation in the press that the Labour party in the Federal Parliament has been guilty of obstruction. Yesterday afternoon the Minister of Trade and -Customs practically levelled a pistol at our heads, and said : &#34; Unless you pass this Supply Bill immediately, a certain number of Post Office employes will have to go without their money.&#34; Honorable senators on this side, in the discharge of their public duty, have protested against such a threat, and they are blamed for obstruction. The Bill was about to be passed last night, when it was blocked by a Government supporter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has exercised his right to bring before the notice of the Committee what he believes to be the grievances of certain citizens. He has stated their case in his own admirable way, but I desire that it should be carefully borne in mind that the honorable senator has been responsible to-day for prolonging the proceedings on this Bill, and has been instrumental in preventing it becoming law. A telegram has been received from Western Australia to-day. </para>

            <para>- I am referring to a telegram signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in reference to the dismissal of thirty men who were engaged on the undergrounding of telephone wires at Perth. I have some knowledge of the work at which these men were employed, because during the last recess, whilst in Perth1, knowing there was a scarcity of employment, and that it was necessary that the telephone wires should be placed underground, and that money had been voted for the purpose, I placed myself in communication with the then Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> suggesting that he should see the Treasurer, and provide funds with which the work might be commenced. I know that the job cannot yet have been completed. When I left Perth, two gangs, each comprising about eighteen general labourers, a bricklayer, a carpenter, and an overseer, were engaged upon the work. I have been here only six or seven weeks, and it is impossible- that in the interval all the telephone wires in the metropolitan area could have been .under-grounded. We learn that these men have been dismissed because the Treasurer has no &#39; money to pay them. They were paid either on the Saturday or the Wednesday. If their pay fell due last Wednesday, which was the 30th June, there was money available for the purpose. If it did not, it will fall due on Saturday, that is, to say, tomorrow, and there is no reason why money to meet it cannot be provided. It is evident that the authorities anticipated something, and I fail to see why the present Treasurer could not have looked to the interests of his constituents as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> and the late Treasurer did. </para>

            <para>- I did not say that it was due to the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest that these men were dismissed. But I do say that, as Treasurer, he should have looked after the matter just as his predecessor did. I should like to know whether there -are any other casual employes who have been peremptorily dismissed? If there are, I can only again repeat that the members of the Labour party are in no way responsible for the delay which has occurred in the passing of this Bill. The request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> yesterday did not in any way involve the blocking of Supply. It simply meant a reduction in the amount to be voted under this Bill. I should like to say that I see no reason why the Senate should continually be asked to play second fiddle to another place. We have been elected by the people on the same franchise as that on which members in another place were elected, and we have a right to review every line, and every ward, in every Bill that is brought before the Senate. Because we have ventured to exercise a right which is undoubtedly ours, we have been told in the press and elsewhere that we are blocking Supply, and obstructing the business of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> occupied the time of the Committee for three hours today. I do not know whether the Vice-President of the Executive Council endeavoured to exercise any control over the honorable senator as a supporter of the Government, but if he did, he certainly was not successful. I have nothing further to say now except that no matter what threats are made, I shall, as a member of the Senate, exercise my right to criticise any measure that is brought before it. </para>

          <para>. - I think we are altogether missing the point in this discussion, which is that there is no means by which the men who have been referred to can be paid except by the passing of this Bill. Personally, I knew that, but a good deal of complaint has been made against the Minister of Trade and Customs for mentioning the fact when introducing this Bill, and it is possible that some members of the Committee who have not had a long parliamentary experience were unacquainted with it. At any rate we all know the position now, and there can be no wisdom in continuing the discussion. In order to facilitate the payment of those men who are in trouble, and to prevent the dismissal of any others, it would be wise, I think, for the Senate to pass the Bill as quickly as possible. </para>

            <para>- Evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was not in his usual good humour, but in a most dangerous mood, and the Leader of the. Government, recognising that fact, felt that they must immediately yield to his request, else trouble might ensue. But that is not what I rose to say. I want to enlist the sympathy of the Government on behalf of other public servants. We all sympathize with the unfortunate men who, for some cause or other, have been thrown out of work. But the case I want to ventilate is more serious than the case of the men who have been thrown out of work for a day, or even a week, or perhaps <inline font-style="italic">even</inline> longer. It is a question affecting the health, and possibly the life, of a number of public officers who are employed at the telephone exchange at Adelaide. Some time ago it -was- decided to build a new exchange. The building is certainly not an architectural masterpiece. It is very ill-ventilated, and in its present condition it is absolutely insanitary. In summer time the weather is extremely hot, and no provision has been made for admitting fresh air. The work on which the telephone girls are engaged is of a very distressing or strenuous character, which frequently, even under favorable conditions, affects their nerves and health. I want the Government, if possible, to take some action before the building is taken over. </para>

I want to ascertain whether any suggestions were offered by the Superintendent of Public Buildings in Adelaide, and probably my question on that point will be answered after a certain debate has been concluded elsewhere. It is very evident that the whole object has been to safeguard valuable instruments in the telephone room, at the expense of the health of the operators. </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly the fault is largely due to the designer of the building; but I am under the impression that, some suggestions were offered by the Superintendent of Public Buildings in South Australia. Not long ago I inspected the building in his company. He pointed out that every precaution had been taken to avoid any possible danger to the machinery, the instruments, or the switchboard from fire. He pointed out that on account of the presence of a small timber yard on the western side of the building, it was absolutely necessary that there should not be a single opening on that side, in which certainly there should be some openings to admit a cool westerly breeze in the summer-time to ventilate the room. The roof is very low. I do not suppose it is more than 15 feet high. </para>

            <para>- Yes; but that is no reason why ventilators should not be put on the western side of the roof, as well as on the eastern side. The only reason for not doing so is to guard against the danger of a fire, which, if it occurred, would destroy the valuable switchboard that has cost so much. I am satisfied that unless some action is taken before the summer arrives, the girls will be falling out of the ranks on sick leave, not by one or two, but by the dozen. The service will become disorganized, and it will cost the Government very much more to employ temporary assist- ants - leaving out of consideration the interest which they ought to take in the health of their servants - than it would to make the building habitable at once. I ask the Minister to have an inquiry made, not by officers who were responsible for the construction of the building, but by an independent authority, and to ascertain whether it is really fit to be occupied in hot weather by a large number of young women engaged in a difficult occupation. </para>

          <para>. - I feel that the Government is entitled to some sympathy in the unfortunate position which it finds itself. One would like to think that a Government starting its business under such favorable auspices as that which we have now in power could begin without muddling. But unfortunately, so far as its financial business is concerned, it appears to have set out to muddle from the very beginning. Apparently, the Treasurer is responsible for the present situation. Every one knows that he is one of the greatest financial muddlers in Australia. It speaks very ill for the new Government that it could not find a man of greater business capacity, greater financial knowledge, and better methods, to fill the office. It must have been known to the Treasurer that money would be required to pay temporary employes on the 1st July. Either he knew that or he did not. If he did know it, it was his duty to introduce this Bill into the other House in time to have it passed before the 1st July.  </para>

And in introducing it here, the Minister of Trade and Customs told us it was absolutely necessary that we should pass it almost immediately. In doing that he was asking honorable senators to pass a Bill for the appropriation of nearly&#163;1,000,000 without any discussion. Was not that insulting every member of the Senate? Was it not insulting the people of the various States? Is that the fashion in which the Government intends to carry on its business? I can assure the Ministry and their supporters that unless the former conduct business in a better fashion, I&#39; shall make no allowance for them. </para>

            <para>- We are not discussing what the late Government did. It is dead and buried, and a tombstone has been&#39; erected to its memory. Certainly it did very much better work than its successors are ever likely to do. But the Deakin Government is alive, and therefore it is an object for the criticism of every honorable senator who chooses to assail it. I repeat that all the knowledge to which I have referred was available to the present Treasurer. He knew that after the  30th  June he would not have a single farthing which could be utilized for the payment of temporary employes. Yet the Senate did not get this Supply Bill until yesterday. Why was it not introduced here earlier? </para>

To-day we find that owing to the incapacity of the Government, and more especially of its Treasurer, a Commonwealth work in Perth has had to be stopped. I suppose the impression will be spread abroad - both in Western Australia and elsewhere - that the Labour party are responsible for this suspension of work. </para>

            <para>- I am not protesting half enough. The Government ought to be able to provide for all these contingencies, and if they have not the capacity to do so they are not fit to be in power. I do not say that the entire Ministry are to blame. It is the Treasurer who is responsible for this lamentable state of affairs. I am really sorry for the men who have been temporarily deprived of their employment. It is extremely regrettable that the work upon which they were engaged should have had to be suspended for a single hour owing to the gross carelessness, the stupidity, the muddleheadedness of the man who now occupies the position of Treasurer. </para>

            <para>- No. The theme under discussion is such a fertile one that it naturally suggests the proper figure of speech. I do not wish to delay the passing of this Bill. I merely desire to emphasize the fact that if there has been delay - and I do not say that there has - the Government, and not the Opposition, are responsible for it. Stupidity and lack of business capacity on their part are alone responsible for the present state of affairs. I trust that we shall have an exhibition of better management in the future. As the Treasurer acquires more experience - and he certainly needs it very badly - he may do better. I am not in the least surprised now that we are not to get the. Budget till the end of August. We have a man filling the office of Treasurer who has no more qualification for the position than I have for the office of Astronomer Royal. </para>

          <para>.- Seeing that honorable senators have been discussing this Bill for two days, and that&#39; most of the talk has emanated from the Opposition, I think I am justified in saying a few words upon it. The Bill reached another place a week to-day, and one day in each House should have been ample in which to pass it. But it was blocked in the other Chamber for four days, and was only introduced here yesterday. I have seen a Supply Bill passed through all its stages by the Senate in one sitting. If the Opposition had sympathized with the casual labourers of Perth, whose services have been dispensed with, they might have exhibited their sympathy in a very much more practical manner. Those men are now out of employment- </para>

            <para>- I did not. Throughout yesterday there was continuous talk upon it. Had the Government agreed to sit after the ordinary hour last night, the Opposition would have exclaimed, &#34;We do not desire an all-night sitting.&#39;&#39; Personally, I think that the Government acted unwisely in yielding to the request for an adjournment. I was prepared to remain here as long as was necessary to put the Bill through. Of course, I recognise that it is impossible to please everybody. The measure was brought forward in ample time to permit of it being passed days ago. </para>

            <para>- Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> still the  Chairman  of Committees? I think that he would like to be. &#39; The complaint is that certain employes of the Post Office have had to be dismissed in consequence of this Bill not being passed. The Treasurer has been blamed for this occurrence. He has been called evil names. But the blame does not rest with the Postmaster-General or with the Treasurer. I am not here to apologize for either of those Ministers, who are well able to take their own part, but I cannot allow men to be blamed for that for which they are not guilty. We were told in advance that delay would cause certain things to happen. The very people who caused that delay are now blaming the Government for it. In my opinion, a week was ample time for the putting through of a Supply Bill. The men would never have been dismissed if the measure had been passed within reasonable time. We all know that even if there were ^1,000,000 in the Treasury on the 30th June, every vote would lapse on that date, and the money would have to be revoted. </para>

          <para>. - The present debate arose out of a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to which no answer has yet been given. The question Was whether it was fair for the Minister practically to hold out a threat , to the Senate that if this Bill was not passed yesterday a number of casual employes of the Post and Telegraph Department would be thrown out of employment. Yesterday I said that if I thought it was my duty to take a certain course, I should take it, no matter what the consequences were. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Savers</inline> urges that we should put a Bill of this kind through at once, if delay may cause inconvenience to the public. Ido not agree with that view. We are sent to Parliament to look after the : finances, and we ought not to shirk our duty. If we are to be swayed by such a consideration, the Senate might as well be non-existent as far as relates to the criticism of the finances. Would it not be better to introduce Supply Bills in such a way as to allow time for discussion, and, if necessary, for this Chamber to prefer requests to another place without inconvenience being caused to those in the Commonwealth service? </para>

The Government will be well advised not to follow the example of previous Governments in treating the Senate with something akin to contempt. If they do, I, at any rate, will resent it. </para>

            <para>. - I desire to draw attention to an interjection which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Neild</inline> yesterday when I was speaking, to the effect that I had signed a requisition to the late Government asking them not to seek for a dissolution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> makes many jocular remarks, but yesterday he appeared to be in. dead earnest. A similar statement I had contradicted at the time it was made; and yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> repeated it, adding that he did not wish to expose me and my friends who occupy the Opposition benches. I wish to say now most emphatically that there is not the slightest foundation for the suggestion, except a very lively imagination on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> As a matter of fact, the party of which I am a member, were almost, so far as I know, unanimously in favour of a dissolution ; and I may add that during the recess I addressed a number of meetings, and at every one, I believe, I expressed the hope that the Government would seek a dissolution in certain eventualities. If I did not take this opportunity to contradict the statement made yesterday,. I should be placed in a false position, in view of my utterances during recess. I never signed a requisition or any other document which had for its object the prevention of a dissolution. </para>
