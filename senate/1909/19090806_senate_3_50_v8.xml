                        <para>- Arising, out of a statement in the press that during next week the Treasurer expects to be able to introduce the Budget in another place,  I desire to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, without notice, whether he has yet given any consideration to a suggestion that some method should be devised by which the Senate might have an. opportunity to discuss the proposals in the Budget contemporaneously with the discussion thereon elsewhere? No doubt he will remember that he promised to consider the matter when it was raised by me some time ago. </para>

I know that in the ordinary course we shall have an opportunity of discussing the Budget, but my question to the honorable senator was, whether the proposition which- has been voiced by himself should be adopted, and that is that some means should be provided by which the Senate would have an opportunity of discussing the various questions involved in the Budget contemporaneously with the discussion of them elsewhere? </para>

                        <para>- It is quite true that the consideration of this report is not strictly Government business, but it has been the practice here to place such an Order of the Day on the notice-paper as Government business. I think my honorable friend will concede that some urgent Government business has hitherto taken precedence, and necessarily will take precedence; but when any reasonable opportunity can be afforded, ha.ving due regard to Government business, no doubt facilities will then be granted for dealing with this Order of the Day. </para>

                            <para>- It has been the invariable custom to deal with the report of the Standing Orders Committee in this manner. It is perfectly true that the consideration of such a report is not strictly Government business, except in this sense - that they take charge of the Order of the Day in consequence of the  Chairman  of the Committee being the  President,  and therefore unable to take a position on the floor of the Chamber. It will be essentially necessary for the Senate to consider this report during the current session, as it deals with certain matters which have arisen out of legislation which was passed some time ago, and under which one-half of the members of the Senate will remain in office until the 30th June, 1910, instead of until the 31st December, 1909. </para>

                <para class="block">In this measure a very distinct departure has been made from the White Australia policy which has been laid down by the people of the &#34;Commonwealth. In the principal Act the proper stand was taken that Asiatics born in Australia should be entitled to an old-age pension, but under this Bill, whether born in Australia or not, if they have become naturalized and lived here for the prescribed time they will be equally entitled as white people to a pension. By engaging to pay naturalized Asiatics an old-age pension we shall bold <inline font-style="italic">out to</inline> them the strongest possible inducement to remain in the country. My experience is that, after naturalized Chinamen have lived in Australia for a certain period, they go back to China, but if they know that by remaining here they will be paid a pension of 10s. per week in their declining years, there will be very little likelihood of them leaving Australia. By creating a condition of this kind and holding out an inducement to these people to stay here we are taking a departure which is in distinct opposition to the public policy of Australia with regard! to such persons. Honorable members in another place talked about the humanity nnd the justice of the. thing. </para>

                        <para>- I very much regret to say that a member of the party with which I am associated was the leading spirit in securing the adoption of this amendment, which constitutes a distinct blot on the Bill and an invasion of the White Australia policy. The one thing that we desire in respect of coloured aliens is to get rid of them. If we cannot deport them, we certainly ought to offer them no inducement to remain here. I have often heard honorable senators opposite inquire, &#34;Why do the working men patronize Chinamen and Asiatics?&#34; and I must confess that I have frequently felt that there was a good deal of force in their contention. There is only one effective method by which we can get rid of these undesirables, namely, by discouraging their existence here in every shape and form, and by placing as many obstacles as possible in the way of them earning a livelihood. Do we not know that the furniture trade and that of market gardening are completely demoralized by the presence of Chinamen and other Asiatic aliens in Australia? </para>

                        <para>- I am not talking about English people who are resident in China. If my remarks would be in order, I might say a little about them. I have very pronounced opinions in regard to English people who leave their own country to become the subjects of another power; but it would not be proper for me to state them here and now. I venture to say that we should not lift so much as a finger in the way of encouraging Asiatic aliens to remain in Australia. Yet under this Bill we are doing the utmost that we can to induce hem to remain here, because there is notting that appeals so strongly to them as does the promise of a substantial payment in cash. If they are given that inducement to remain here, they will never leave us. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Only a few days ago I read in one of the newspapers a statement to the effect that to a Chinaman the possession of ,&#163;100 in China was equivalent to riches. Yet we propose to grant them <inline font-style="italic">&#163;26</inline> per annum by way of a pension, which, if capitalised, is equivalent to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500.</inline> We are to offer them that inducement to remain here. I have no desire to see Chinamen starve; but there is a mighty difference between relieving their poverty and placing them in a position to demand from the community a pension of 10s. per week during the remainder 6f their lives, after they have resided here for a certain period. Then we are faced with another danger. There are Asiatics who are subjects of the King. Last night I was told that these persons cannot get to Australia. But nobody believes- that statement. Whether or not they can come here depends very largely on r,he Government which is in power at the time. . It is true that every one of these aliens can be subjected to the language test; but, with the present Government in power, how do we know to what kind of test they will be subjected? I have known dozens of Indians who can speak very fair English. </para>

                        <para>- And more unauthorized coloured persons were excluded. The danger will exist, no matter what Government may be in power. We all know the cunning methods which are adopted by these undesirable coloured aliens to gain admission into a country, which, compared with their own, is a veritable Paradise. In spite of all the difficulties that are placed in their way, they continue to come here. If this Bill becomes law in its present form, an added inducement will be offered to those who are here to remain with us. It has been said that in granting old-age pensions, we should have no regard to race or colour. But I can never forget the coloured question in this or any other connexion. If there is one thing that we ought to endeavour to do, it is to make Australia white and afterwards to keep it white. We ought not to allow any consideration whatever to interfere with the carrying out of our legislation in that regard. The amendment which has been inserted in this Bill is a distinct attack upon that policy. It constitutes a departure from, and an invasion of, it. It ought not to be tolerated by this Parliament. I am sure that it will be resented by tens of thousands of worthy white residents of Australia, who have been refused pensions bv the very persons who now propose to grant them to Asiatics. We cannot find the money with which to grant pensions to our own women at sixty years of age, and yet we can open the doors of the Treasury to Chinamen, to Japanese, and to other coloured aliens who have come here and taken out letters of naturalization. Such a position is disgraceful, and ought not to be tolerated by a Parliament which is committed to the policy of a White Australia. </para>

There is not the slightest justification for his endeavour to impart to his proposal, or to the debate which preceded it, the slightest party complexion. The division list will show that both parties in this Chamber were divided upon the clause in question. As a matter of fact, the initial act&#39; in reference to that clause was taken in another place by a member of his own party. </para>

                        <para>- That circumstance, and the fact that the amendment was supported in this Chamber by Senators McGregor and Pearce, are sufficient evidence that the matter has absolutely no party complexion. Personally, I am not going to resist the proposal to recommit the clauses in question. It seems to me to be one upon which it is desirable further opportunity for discussion should be afforded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has presented one very strong argument which quite escaped my attention last night, namely, that the clause offers a further inducement to Asiatics - -who might otherwise be disposed to leave Australia - to remain here. I confess that that argument has made an impression upon my mind, and I suppose that it has also impressed other honorable senators. I think, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is unnecessarily alarmed upon the question of the influx of Asiatics into the Commonwealth. Without the slightest hesitancy, it may be affirmed that there is no legitimate entry of these persons into Australia worth speaking of. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite another matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has suggested that the language test to which coloured Asiatics are subject was being made so easy that they experienced no difficulty in passing it. Honorable senators have in their possession information regarding the number of coloured aliens who successfully passed that test, and they must recognise that there is no legitimate entry of these persons into Australia which is worth a moment&#39;s consideration. Regarding the number of illegitimate entries, we can only hazard a conjecture&#34;. &#39; We all know that the number of those who are admitted with the sanction of the Government is not sufficient to justify the language which has been employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> We are also aware that only a few months ago an Act was placed upon the statute-book which was designed to - and which, I think, did - effectively close at least one of the illegitimate channels through which coloured Asiatics were gaining admission to the Commonwealth. That that Act is a very beneficial one was shown by the action which was taken under it shortly after it became law. It would ill-become the present Government - if they thought that there were other illegitimate channels which might be effectively closed against these undesirables - to hesitate to introduce legislation having that object in view. I have no objection to the recommittal of the two clauses indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline>
                    Seeing that, as a civilized community, we cannot allow aliens to die upon our hands, it is obvious that we must provide for them in some way. To my mind, there are two ways of dealing with this matter open to us. The first is to grant coloured Asiatics in Australia old-age pensions, which will permit them to live apart from indigent whites, and the second way out of the difficulty is to provide them with homes in our charitable institutions It becomes a question for consideration - which is the more desirable way of dealing, with them ? Should we place these coloured aliens in our benevolent asylums or should&#39; we provide, as far as possible, for their maintenance outside institutions which are principally filled by people of British birth? In the interests of our White Australia policy, it is desirable to consider whether it is not preferable to give them a means of support outside rather than mix them up indiscriminately with white people in our asylums, as is now done.

                        <para>- We wish to alter the Bill as it now stands with respect to the amendments that have .been made in it. At the first glance it seems reasonable to say that as we have only a small number of Chinese or other Asiatics naturalized in Australia the expenditure entailed would not be very much. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has raised the point of view that we should not offer an inducement to these people to remain, but should make them inclined to go back to the country whence they came. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and the honorable senator very properly voted against the amendment on that &#39;ground. I trust that it is now the fixed policy of all classes of the community to keep Australia white. But we are not only dealing with naturalized Chinamen, as we thought yesterday, but with a very large number of Asiatics who, under the Bill as it stands, will be able to claim, not only the old-age, but the invalid pension. I refer especially to natives of India. A few years ago it became difficult to induce the kanaka to come to Australia to work in the sugar industry. He was getting shy, and was not easily caught. Thereupon those interested in the industry turned their attention to natives of India. Attempts were made, which fortunately were unsuccessful, to induce large numbers of coolies to come to Australia to be employed in tropical agriculture. I suppose that there are now about 7,000 or 8,000 in Australia. They are British subjects, just as we are. Only a day &#39;or two ago we were informed by the newspapers of an agitation on one of the northern .rivers of New South Wales because an Indian had been successful in obtaining in the land ballot the best selection offered in the district. Thereupon there was a hue and cry by the very people who were to some extent responsible for bringing Indians to this country. The trouble on the northern rivers shows that as soon as any section of this community feels the competition of the Asiatic races, they are convinced that these people should not be allowed to come in. These Indians are born traders. You find them hawking in various parts of Australia. You see a man going along dressed in a long nightshirt, with a turban on his head, riding one horse and leading another laden from the ears to the tail with bundles of goods. He sells commodities, not to his own countrymen, but to Europeans. I am sorry to say that, in many case&#39;s Europeans are willing purchasers from them, and thus offer them1 an inducement to re&#39;main in the country. They also enter into competition with the labourer. They are liked by those who employ them, who prefer them to any other class  of coloured labour. Why ? Because they do not work for wages. They always take contract work, and there is no responsibility with them. They have not to be looked after as the kanaka has. When any Asiatic is injured or becomes sick he has as much right under this Bill as any other person in Australia to claim an invalid pension. The fact that their ordinary standard of civilization is low, in itself offers an inducement for them to remain here. It is affluence to a coolie to get  10s.  per week. They can live for considerably less. By giving them this pension we shall offer a considerable inducement to them to remain here. Many would otherwise, perhaps, go away to their own country. </para>

                        <para>- Some go away after that age, if they have accumulated sufficient money. But age does not regulate the invalid pension. There is nothing that these men desire so much as to be able to go home with a hundred dr a couple of hundred pounds. They realize that the best thing they can do, having accumulated a little money, is to return to their own land, where their savings will go a long way. It costs them a great deal more to live here. Not only do they wish to go back, but we have actually had instances of cemeteries being dug up and the bones of Chinese extracted from the ground to be taken back to China. If Asiatics are able to get pensions from the Government it will be equivalent to putting a barrier round Australia to prevent them getting out. </para>

                    <para>. -While I have not the slightest objection to the recommittal of the Bill, I see no reason for reversing the vote I gave yesterday. I fail to see how our White Australia policy is affected by the amendment carried. Rightly or wrongly, Asiatics have in years gone by been permitted to come to Australia. Rightly or wrongly, they have been permitted to acquire rights of citizenship. The naturalized Chinaman has the same political power as a white citizen has. Once we recognise them as citizens we expect them to conform to our laws in respect to wages and so forth. In the furniture trade in Victoria there is to-da.y a wages board which insists that the same wage shall be paid to a Chinaman as to a white man. </para>

                        <para>- If so, that is due, not to the Act, but to the supervision exercised under it. Chinamen have to work the same number of hours as white men. When they become invalided or old they are treated just as is any other citizen. The doors of our hospitals are open to them. No one says, because they are Asiatics, that they shall not receive the same skilled attention as any other citizen. It would be inhuman to act otherwise. When they become incapable of performing any more work, the various benevolent institutions are open to them. In the mining centres in Victoria there are plenty of Chinese in the charitable institutions. They are treated just as kindly as are white men. I hope the same is the case in all parts of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Well, there are plenty of Europeans who can live on the smell of an oil rag. My experience is that as soon as a Chinaman gets On his feet he likes to have a few luxuries. He likes his pig, his fowl, and his drop of gin. We are told that the payment of a pension of I OS. per week wilt be an inducement to Chinamen to remain in Australia. As one who has visited China, I question that statement. First of all, it must be understood that the Chinese who come to Australia in contravention of our legislation are not old, but young and vigorous men. Why ? Because., being young, they are worth some thing to those who are able to bring them here. I have been given to understand that those who are successful in smuggling young Chinese into this country get &#163;100 per head for them. We are not likely to have any influx of old or invalid Chinese as a result of the new clause adopted yesterday. There is another aspect of the matter which should be considered. Rich or poor, the great desire of a Chinese is that his remains shall be buried in China. Any one who cares to visit one of the boats trading to the East .will find a number of old Chinese on board them. </para>

I saw seventy Chinese leaving by one of the boats trading to the East, and fifty of them were old men, whose passages to China were being paid by Chinese benevolent institutions in Victoria in order that their desire to spend their last days and be buried in the land of their birth should be gratified. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I heard the honorable senator say that he hoped the proposal would not be carried, although that would mean that the eloquent Christian, to whom he has referred, would be treated as if he were not a human being at all. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has reminded me, that dead Chinese arc carried back to China from Australia. Let me inform honorable senators that if a Chinese dies on board a vessel trading to China, his remains are never thrown overboard. The captain of one of these boats told me that the reason for that was that if it were known that a captain threw the remains of a dead Chinese overboard no Chinese would ever again travel by his boat. I repeat that I see no reason to alter the vote I gave yesterday. Since the Asiatics who are now in the Commonwealth arrived in Australia, we have passed legislation which, I hope, will prevent the admission of other aliens, and I do not share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> alarm that by paying pensions to invalid and aged Chinese we shall have an invasion of Asiatics, which will threaten the interests of the white people of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - The maintenance of the White Australia principle is, in my opinion, the most important consideration in dealing with this matter. That principle should be jealously guarded ora every occasion. The new clause, to which objection is taken, represents a step to defeat our White Australia legislation. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to dilate on the charitable aspect of the question, but those who are opposed to the new clause, which has been inserted in this Bill, do not suggest that Chinese or any other coloured people should be turned out of our charitable institutions. There is no reason why they should not continue to be relieved in them as at present. It is not the object of this measure to extend charity to any one. I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> in common with other honorable senators on this side, protested against the term charity being associated with the payment of old-age pensions. We shall extend charity to Chinese in the future as in the past, and that is as much as can reasonably be expected of us. We are dealing here with a very different question, and the new clause which has been carried offers a substantial inducement to Chinese to come to this country. </para>

                        <para>-- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is aware of the difficulty of administering the Immigration Restriction Act. We cannot distinguish Chinese who&#34; have a right to come to this country from those who have no such right. We know that our legislation is evaded in quite a number of ways, and, so far, we have been unable to prevent its evasion. On a pension of ios. a week a Chinaman in Australia would be able to save money. He could live on 5s. a week, and save the balance to enable him to live comfortably at the close of his life in China. </para>

                    <para>- I have no desire to be considered callous-hearted, but I contend that we. should do all we can to minimize the inducements offered to these people to come to Australia. My attitude towards the provision objected to has been that if these privileges are conferred on the coloured natives of one country they should be conferred on coloured people from every country. If they are to be given to Chinese, they should be given to Red Indians of North America, Kaffirs of South Africa, and Patagonians, if they choose &#39;to come here. Personally I am utterly opposed to offering inducements to any of these people to immigrate. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is mistaken ; I voted against it. But I also voted against differentiating between the coloured natives of one country and! of another. In times past those who favoured the introduction of coloured labour used to say that it could do no harm, because the coloured labourers came here without their women, and did not settle down and reproduce their kind. It was said that, after being a few years here, they would be anxious to return to their own country to get married and live a family life there. But if we are to hold out such inducements to the immigration of coloured people as are now proposed, we shall have to face n. considerable in lux of them, in spite of all our restrictive legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is as fully convinced as is any other member of the Senate that, in spite of all our restrictive legislation, these coloured people somehow contrive to get here. If we let it be known that if they come here they will be able, not only to make a good living, but to obtain pensions when they are invalided, or have become  too old to work, the inducement to them to come to Australia will be very much greater than it is at present. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite beside the question. They can obtain an invalid pension without being naturalized, and one-third of the Asiatics who come <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Australia are British subjects, who do not require to be naturalized. We have 7,000 or 8,000 Hindoos here who are natural born British subjects. Great Britain controls large areas of country in the Straits Settlements and other Asiatic territories, and coloured people coming to Australia from those places could prove that they were natural born British subjects, and entitled to these pensions. If these coloured people are given pensions, instead of following the natural desire to return to their own country, they will be induced to settle down in Australia. We know that 10s. a. week would represent a handsome income to some of these people. It is unnecessary to labour the great national question involved. We have only to remember the serious problem confronting the people of the United &#39;.States, as the result of tampering with the question in that country. They are faced with the greatest problem that any nation could be faced with. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the motion for the recommital of the Bill, chiefly because I consider that if we are unable to provide for out own aged people and invalids we should not go out of our way to make special provision for coloured people. We find that it will be impossible to bring into operation a reduction of the age qualification for women for at least two years, and in the circumstances I see no reason why we should go out of our way to confer benefits upon the people of other races. There is another reason for my objection, and that is the proposal for a treaty of reciprocity. In his zeal to make all mankind stand on the same plane, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is seeking to place the Japanese on precisely the same level as the old pioneer who has opened up the country for Japanese to come here and settle. Can he point to a single instance where a path in Australia has been made smooth, where a virgin wilderness has been made, so to speak, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> yield its treasures <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the race which is now enjoying it, where resources have ever been opened up by the hand of the alien whom he wants to place on the same level as the pioneer? </para>

                        <para>- The two matters are so much interwoven, sir, that I felt impelled to make a reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> but I quite understand the position which you take up. When the time comes to deal with the amendments we should bear in mind how the members of our own race are treated in the countries of those persons whom it is now sought to place on the same level as our own citizens. Take, for example, Japan. We know that the aim of that nation is to displace as much as possible the European in every business or calling. It is impossible tor Europeans to hold land in that country, and they are suffering under many disabilities which are not imposed upon Japanese in Australia. We are to be asked to place the subjects of the Mikado on precisely the same level as our own people, although he, through his Government, will not remove the disabilities which are at present imposed upon British subjects in his country. We can commit the error of being too liberal. I draw the attention of honorable senators to the necessity of looking after the interests of our own people, of providing as soon as possible for the women who must at present reach the age of sixty -five years before they can get a pension, and of encouraging, if possible, thrifty persons who have acquired a home worth more than ^100, and whom the Ministry say it is impossible to provide for at present. If, by saving a little in early life, a person has acquired a home worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;200,</inline> he is debarred from receiving the full amount of the old-age pension. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that when the question of recommitting these clauses has been fully debated and all phases of the proposed amendments have been discussed here, we shall speedily go to divisions and come to decisions. I deplore the tendency on the part of some honorable senators, probably unintentionally, to misrepresent the whole position. As I said yesterday, the question of a White Australia is not involved. It is merely a question of doing justice to coloured aliens who have resided in Australia for twenty years and are naturalized subjects of the King. It is beside the question for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> or any one else to talk about the state of our pioneers. In this Bill no benefit is proposed to be given, or is likely to be given, to coloured persons who may come to Australia hereafter, or who have come here during the last fifteen years. Honorable senators ought to recognise that fact. </para>

                        <para>- I was just coming to the question of the few thousand coloured persons who are supposed to be British subjects. In making that remark <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is endeavouring, or is likely to create the impression, that all of these 8,000 persons are over the age of sixty or sixty-five years, that they are all naturalized, or natural-born, and will be accepted as British, or that they have all come into Australia by a door which was open to them at the time. I think every one ought to disabuse his mind of such sophistry as that and consider the plain facts. I admit that in the future one or two aliens may be able to evade the vigilance of the officers administering the Old-age Pensions Act, but the same number of white persons will do exactly the same thing. An argument of that description should not be introduced by a fair-minded representative. </para>

                        <para>- According to my honorable friend, people in China, Japan, and India are going to flock in because it is proposed in this Bill to grant a privilege to certain coloured persons. I contend that those who are already naturalized according to the laws of our country are entitled to exactly the same privileges as persons of any other colour in Australia. I do not wish to be sentimental. I have already related an incident in my life which would compel me to- extend to Asiatics who are lawful British subjects, and who are now in Australia, the same privileges as I would be prepared to take for myself or any of my friends. Being in trouble on one occasion a Chinaman came to my assistance when there were plenty of opportunities for white persons to assist me, and when I offered to him a reward he said, &#39;&#39;If ever you see a countryman of mine in the same position, you do exactly the same to him.&#34; I have worked side by side, not with Asiatics,- but with Africans - who belonged to the same union as myself, who were prepared to pay the same contribution, and who, to my mind, were just as white as anybody else in Australia. </para>

I do not intend to support any proposal which would withhold from such persons the right to an old-age pension. We have heard a good deal to-day about the introduction of Asiatic British subjects. Honorable senators know very well that in the future such persons cannot legally enter the Commonwealth, and that if any persons should get in surreptitiously, and apply afterwards for an old-age pension, their offence would be discovered, and they would be punished and deported. Because it is probable that one or two coloured aliens may evade the vigilance of our officers, I shall not deny justice to those who are entitled to it equally with myself. I desire to refer now to the specious argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> that if we offer to a Chinaman, or a Japanese, or a Hindoo, a pension of IOS. a week - and, mind, it is not offered to such persons unless they are qualified by law to&#34; get a pension - it will induce them to remain in Australia. We are also told that it is in conflict with the White Australia policy, because, if a Chinaman or ether Asiatic has the prospect of getting I 05. a week ahead of him, he will not return to his own country, whereas otherwise he might depart. I do not think there is a great rush of aged Chinamen or ether persons to their native country, unless they have made a competency. </para>

                        <para>- I know that they all want to get back ; but they do not all get back, unless under very peculiar circumstances. Those who would be eligible for an old-age pension would die in Australia in any circumstances. Whether their remains are sent back to China by Chinese philanthropic associations or not is beside the question. Ail I ask for is justice to those who are now entitled to the same privileges as we are, and honorable senators ought not to withhold that boon simply because there is a possibility of the law being evaded by a few persons. </para>

I think that that contention is well founded.  I am further of opinion that any Asiatic who enters the Commonwealth in violation of its laws ought not to be entitled to an old-age pension. </para>

                    <para>. - There are involved in this matter questions of high statesmanship, and I think we shall be well advised if we take a broad and careful view of it. Those gentlemen who are the most consistent advocates of the policy of a White Australia ought to be most careful to justly safeguard it in all directions, so that they cannot be accused of being prepared to inflict injustice upon coloured persons who chance to be within our borders. A few minutes ago I was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> whether I could cite any instance in which Chinamen had rendered service to Australia. I am sure that honorable senators must recognise that Chinamen have rendered very great assistance to mining ventures. By engaging in the trade of market gardening probably they have been instrumental in saving scores of Australian lives. I do ask honorable senators to take a broad Imperial view of this matter, and not a provincial&#34; one. We should view it from the Empire stand-point. We have already enacted legislation which has caused the Empire a certain amount of trouble, and we should not further embarrass the Imperial authorities bv doing a pure act of injustice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> hit the nail upon the head when he based his appeal on behalf of these coloured aliens upon the principle of justice. We must all agree with Carlyle&#39;s declaration that &#34; Injustice pays itself with compound interest.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- And it is still my policy. The honorable senator, perhaps unintentionally, has repeated a slander which is often hurled at Labour members, and which he bitterly resents on other occasions, namely, that we advocate certain things merely because they are part of the policy of our party. He certainly ought to give those of us who differ from him on these questions credit for equal sincerity with himself. I resent the attempt which has been made most deliberately to construe our votes in such a way as to convex the impression that we are not equally sincere with them on the White Australia policy. I say that this question is not in any way connected with that policy. </para>

                            fell into practically the same error by declaring that we are willing to grant to the subjects of the Mikado what the Mikado will not grant to British subjects. That is not a fact. A subject of the Mikado is an alien, and, under the Bill, is disqualified from receiving a pension.

                        <para>- Yes, but ours was never a policy of vengeance and vindictiveness. While we may be quite convinced of the absolute necessity of keeping Asiatics out of Australia, yet, at the same time, in justice to those who are here, we should treat them in the same way as we treat other citizens. We have done so hitherto, and I hope that we always shall. This Bill, as it stands, proposes to do no more. The statement has been made that a number of Indians may be induced to come in. In the first place, of those Indians who are in Australia now only a very small proportion could be eligible for the pension. As for those who will come in, they will meet with an obstacle which, in m&#39;v opinion, will be insuperable. They have to answer certain questions, and there is a penalty against wrongful replies. Their answers have also to be backed up by other evidence. Amongst the questions to be put is one as to the date of arrival in the Commonwealth, and another as to the ship by .which they came. The answers to those questions &#39;it is within the power of the authorities to verify or disprove. For instance, if an Indian says that he came to Australia by the <inline font-style="italic">Marmora.</inline> the fact can be proved or disproved by turning up the list of arrivals by the <inline font-style="italic">Marmora</inline> on the date mentioned. If it be found that the Indian in question was a stowaway, the very fact of his applying for an old-age pension, and affording means of proof of his manner of arrival, would render him liable to prosecution under the Immigration Restriction Act, and would lead to his deportation. He could get neither the invalid nor the old-age pension until he showed that he came here legitimately. It is true that he may have  come to Australia before Federation. But even then there were State Acts in operation which were very much on the lines of the Federal Act. If an Indian furnished proof that he came here illegitimately at any time within the last thirty years, he would be liable to prosecution. </para>

                    <para>.- This debate has been very interesting and instructive. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is to be congratulated on giving us an opportunity of ventilating the subject. He submitted, with considerable force, that the amendment made in the Bill really amounted to an attack upon the White Australia policy. He argued that to give a Chinaman a pension of ios. per week might induce him to stay in Australia instead of going back to China to see his father. To that extent I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> argument to be correct. But the crux of the whole matter appears to lie in the case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> brought so clearly before us. We have to deal with this matter as one of justice. . Had there been time, I could have turned up some strong remarks by English Judges on the question of dealing justly with aliens entering Great Britain and being admitted to citizenship there. We are now dealing with men who come to Australia, as aliens, and afterwards become naturalized subjects of the King. I consider that we are bound to extend to them the same justice that we extend to other subjects of the King. Being naturalized, they are British subjects, and to discriminate between British subjects would, in my opinion, be a mistake. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that we should be creating an injustice. If we are to consider matters Imperially, it would be a step in the wrong direction to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> Throughout the world a reputation has been created for British justice, and if we were to discriminate in this matter we should place upon our statute-book a blot which we should afterwards regret. I quite agree however, that a Chinaman, a Japanese, or an Indian can live much more cheaply than an Englishman or an Australian, and therefore if we give to an Australian a pension of ios. per week, 5s. would be sufficient to give to an Asiatic. But to make an amendment in that direction would he discriminating, and if we are to do justice let it be done all round. </para>

                <para class="block">Then follows an enumeration of other classes. The amending clause which we passed yesterday struck out the words &#34; Asiatics, except those born in Australia.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposes to strike out of the amending Bill that portion of the clause which struck out of the main Act the words &#34; Asiatics, except those born in Australia.&#34; The result would be that the parent Act would remain unaffected. As to the proposal itself, I say at once that the argument addressed to us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> that the effect of the amendment made in the Bill would be to cause Asiatics to remain in Australia, has had a great influence on my mind. I have listened carefully to the debate this morning. It has been most interesting and instructive. Despite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> remark that Asiatics in Australia are affected by sentiment, and not by cash, it seems to me that there is always a point where cash will balance sentiment. We all know something of the characteristics of Chinamen when money is concerned, and I am rather inclined to think that many of them who at present are spurred by sentiment, might, if the Bill were passed in its present form, be swayed the other way, and refrain from returning to their own country. </para>

                    <para>-I was very much surprised to find this provision in the Bill, as it came to us from another place. But I was still more surprised to discover the source from which it emanated. I opposed the proposal yesterday for three reasons; first of all because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said, it would be unjust to some  of our own people, since it might defer assistance to them. We are told that we should do justice, and I say that we should do justice to our own people before we consider the people of other races. I also opposed the proposal because I was afraid that it would help to load this legislation too much. If we are not extremely careful it will break down by its Own weight. We must use common sense in considering even humane legislation, and I am afraid that if we overload this measure the people who have to find the money may begin to think that it will be too expensive and may call for some revision of it. I am opposed to the proposal also because despite what some honorable senators opposite say I believe it to be a violation of the White Australia policy. We should do nothing that would lead the world at large to think that we a&#93; e weakening on that principle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that I did not seem to understand the reasons for the adoption of the White Australia policy, and that I took the conservative view that it is a policy of vengeance. I hope the honorable senator does not really think so meanly of me. I have always supported the White Australia policy, because my travels throughout the world have led me to believe that it is absolutely necessary for the safety of this country. If there is one thing which, more than another, brings the Commonwealth closely into touch with Americans, and on which they support the action of the Commonwealth, it is the White Australia policy we have adopted. Wherever I went in America, people said to me, &#34; You are sound on that point; stick to it.&#34; One has only to visit America to note the disastrous results which have arisen from the fact that such a policy was not adopted there. On the Pacific coast 90 per cent, of the salmon fishing is in the hands of Japanese. On the Northern Pacific and other great railroads,  two-thirds of the porters are Japanese or Chinese, and these people are cutting out American workmen every day. If one who did not believe in the White Australia policy visited America, he would come back here a confirmed believer in it. It is a weakening of that policy to give these coloured people the same privileges as our own. I am in favour of treating people of these races who are here with justice; but there is no reason why we should give them every privilege which we confer upon our own people. </para>

If a white man and a coloured man came to him for employment, he would not treat them as on the same level; he would give the white man employment, and would turn the black man from his door. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> said we should take the Empire view ; but it is too late to do that. We have already decided, for just and proper reasons, and in the interests of our own safety, to adopt the White Australia policy. We recognise that if we are to have a prosperous community in Australia it must be composed of people who will stand on something like the same social and industrial level. If we weaken on that policy and offer inducements for the immigration of alien races, we shall sooner  or later work mischief. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> proposal and protest as strongly as I can against these provisions having been included in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - When we considered this matter yesterday we were without information which has been given to-day. As I looked at the proposal when it was first submitted, it occurred to me that there are very few Chinese naturalized in Australia, and that for the most part they are men in business and possessed of property. The ordinary Chinaman who competes with white workers in the labour market is not naturalized. I believe that the number to whom the provision would apply would be very small, and in ten years&#39; time there would be none of them  left,  since under the law no more Chinese can be naturalized in Australia. The matter at the time seemed hardly worth talking about, but the argument submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and others this morning shows that there is danger that Asiatics who are British subjects will come here. </para>

It is impossible for us to efficiently patrol the Gulf, and vessels employed in the pearling industry would be able to land these people between Normanton and Burketown, and in the Northern Territory, at places where there would be no police and no authority- to interfere with them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and I voted in the same way in the first division taken on this provision yesterday, and I should not have voted as I did in the second division had I known what I know to-day.

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;12.25&#93;. - I desire to say only a very few words on the amendment. I had not an opportunity of hearing the debate which took place in Committee yesterday, when the new clause which has been objected to was submitted, but I have listened to the debate to-day. It appears to me that the only question which we- need consider at present is whether we shall permit the words &#39; 1 Asiatics (except those born in Australia) &#34; to remain in section 16 of the principal Act, which sets forth the persons who are to be disqualified from receiving pensions. We are faced with the question whether we should permit Asiatics who have become naturalized to participate in the benefits of our old-age pension legislation. In the first part of section 16 of the Act. aliens are strictly prohibited from receiving pensions, and, therefore, the only members of the Chinese race, which has been so much referred to, who would be entitled to pensions would be those who had become naturalized subjects of the King. It is true that provision has been made that naturalization may take place within twelve months, and so some persons who might be considered undesirable might become naturalized. I wish to impress upon honorable senators the fact that if we naturalize an alien, as a matter of abstract justice we have no right whatever to deny him any of the privileges which we have promised to give him in virtue of this naturalization. We have no right to say to him, &#34; You have abandoned whatever rights you had as a subject of your own country, and we shall give you&#39; only a portion of the rights we give to our own people.&#34; The broad ground on which this matter should be dealt with is that there should be no distinction between naturalized and natural-bom subjects.- A naturalized subject is entitled to every privilege and right which a natural-born subject can claim. If that be the case, is it fair to discriminate in respect of these coloured people ? I contend that once we have admitted one who was the subject of another  nation into our own nation, and made him a member of the national family, he should be under no disability as compared with natural-born subjects of the King. I fully sympathize with the strong desire expressed that we should do nothing which would weaken the White Australia policy; but I remind honorable senators that what is here proposed would not have that effect. Under our laws we have permitted the naturalization of aliens, and those who have been naturalized should be treated just the same as are natural-born British subjects. It has been pointed out that our legislation has been framed to prevent the influx of coloured races. That legislation remains in force, and we need be under no apprehension that any undue number of these coloured people will be a burden on the fund to the detriment of people of our own race. I ask honorable senators even now to pause and consider whether the carrying of the amendment would not be rather an act of injustice than an act of justice to the policy of the country as it exists to-day.

                    <para>. - If we adopt the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> we shall not be doing anything which this Parliament has not frequently done, and which it has been and can be shown there were excellent reasons for doing. As the last  speaker  has pointed out, when these people are naturalized they ought to get every privilege which a British subject can or does get. But Parliament in its wisdom thought that it was not wise to give to coloured people who were naturalized in all cases the same privileges as white people. Let us take the &#34;Sugar Bounty Act. Naturalized Asiatics, or even a natural born British subject, if he is a coloured native of India, cannot obtain a bounty under that law. Even though he owns the land on which the cane was grown, and employs no one else but white men in working it, he cannot get a bounty. Parliament, I contend, was amply justified in adopting that attitude, for this reason, that if we were prepared to give a bounty to coloured people on the condition that they should be naturalized, or even that they should own the land, we should have had such an influx of those people into the sugar industry that all white men would have been excluded. </para>

                <para>It will be seen that a coloured man, although a naturalized subject of the King, who owns and occupies land, even if he employs none but white labour in the production of the cane, cannot get a bounty. Parliament enacted that provision because it wanted to make sure that the great sugar industry should be a white industry, and the provision was regarded as the only means by which that object could be achieved. </para>

Prior to the passing of that Act some of these persons did get a bounty, but Parliament in its wisdom placed a restriction upon them. When he was speaking a little while ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> pointed out that all men of our race and country are subject to most violent treatment in Japan or China or other countries, and that some white men, after having been naturalized and devoted a life time to service and work on behalf of Japanese and Chinese, have been treated with the utmost indignity. Honorable senators have only to go into the Library to find works by men who had lived a lifetime in Japan which bear out my assertion. </para>

                        <para>- I have no vindictive feeling towards the Japanese or the Chinese. What I want is to see them in their own country living under the best conditions, and enjoying the fullest measure of liberty and well-being. It would be bad for China, and it would be especially bad for us, if we allowed them to come in, or if, being here, we held out any inducement to them to stay here. A little while ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> accused me of having said that the opponents of this amendment are insincere. I never said anything of the kind, and I shall offer to him my uncorrected <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> proof to-morrow to show that I did not cast the slightest slur upon any one&#39;s sincerity. I think that if we do not adopt this amendment, we shall make a mistake. But because persons are liable to make a mistake that is no reason why I should accuse them of insincerity, and I should be very sorry to do so. I am trying to point out that, in my opinion, it would be a mistake to pass the Bill as it is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> very cogently said that the argument which has chief weight with him is that by offering a pension to these persons we probably should induce them to remain longer in this country than otherwise they would be likely to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out, and very rightly too, that sentiment is very often stronger than financial motive. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> very justly observed, a point can be reached when the financial consideration balances the sentimental one. In my opinion, a point can easily be reached when the financial consideration will outweigh the sentimental one. A pension of 10s. per week would be positive wealth to these Asiatics. And being assured of a life of ease here, even if they finally intended to go back, they would stop here until the last minute, drawing that sum per week, out of which they could save a good deal, according to their method of calculation, for the benefit of relatives in China. Why should we subsidize them for that purpose? I am sure that every honorable senator on this side, and I hope that most of the honorable senators on the other side, want to get these people out of the country as soon as possible. I intend to support trie amendment, so that we can at least assure ourselves of the fact that no undue inducement will be held out to these people to remain here longer than they otherwise would do.. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to remind those who are in favour of this amendment that the main charge  against White Australians in connexion with our White Australia policy is that it is inhuman, lt is continually hurled against us that we are not fraternal, that we are cruel and brutal in our determination to keep our coloured brethren from this splendid continent. We have urged, I think with justice, that there are strong economical grounds, for our legislation, and that we have no feeling of antipathy to the Chinese or the Japanese, or any other coloured men. We would be glad to see them happy and comfortable, but we hope that it will be in their own country. We have made provision for some of these people who we think now should not come to this country, although they certainly came here under the encouragement of our laws. If we feel no personal antipathy to them, but are influenced simply by economic considerations, we ought to treat justly those who are here, and who were encouraged to come by our laws, and to whom we have extended the rights of citizenship - we should say that these, at any rate, so long as they live shall receive such kindly treatment as we extend to our own citizens. </para>

The proposal in the Bill is to grant an old-age pension to those whom we consider aliens, but whom we permitted to come here and become citizens as well as to natural-born citizens. In any case the provision can only operate for a very few years. We should remove the reproach that we are brutal and cruel to these coloured people. </para>

                        <para>- No. Last night it was urged very strongly that we should extend the provisions of the Bill even to the inmates of benevolent  asylums  hut we did not find it expedient to do so. We mav have been wrong in coming to that decision, but, at any rate, we should see that doors outside such institutions are not closed on these fellow - citizens of ours. These persons, if they have honestly observed our laws have co-operated with us in building up this country, and we ought to treat them just as  kindly  and considerately as we do our own people. We ought  to lay down in our legislation the principle of which we so often prate, that we would not even allow a dog to die in agony. </para>

                        <para>- Not much, except by way of illustration. But seeing that we would not allow even a dog to die in agony, we ought certainly not to permit a man, simply because he happens to be a member of a race with which we do not fraternize, to die in agony. In order that we may be strong in preaching the maintenance of a White Australia, and that we may be able to show that that policy is not prompted by racial antipathy, but by sound economic principles, I think that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> should be resisted. </para>

                            is based upon the ground of humanity. Since we have granted coloured Asiatics within the Commonwealth certain rights he contends that we should confer upon them full citizenship rights.

                            sup-&#187; ported - and which provides that irrespective of whether coloured persons are natural-born subjects of the King or naturalized subjects, there are certain rights which they cannot claim. For instance, the sugar bounty cannot be claimed bv these people. It was pointed out to the Administration in question that a Chinaman was leasing land and employing white labour on his plantation&#39; in order that he might be able to claim the sugar bounty.

                        <para>- It was. The Chinaman was simply the lessee of the property. The Deakin Government declined to grant to these aliens all the rights of citizenship. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has argued that we ought not to allow coloured Asiatics to die in agony. We do not propose to do that. Such persons are usually provided for in our benevolent asylums. What we believe is that we ought not to hold out any inducement to them to remain here, when otherwise they might return to their- native land. At the present time there is a strong agitation in progress on one of the northern rivers of New &#39;South Wales, because a Hindoo has succeeded in securing by ballot the best selection which was available, in opposition to all the white applicants. As soon as the people there recognised that Hindoos were just as likely as themselves to succeed in acquiring the best areas available, they thought it was time that their &#34;black brother,&#34; to whom reference has been made, was excluded. </para>

                        <para>- I do not regard them as brothers at all. In the course of his remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> declared that I had charged him with being opposed to the White Australia policy. I did nothing of the sort. While he was speaking I interjected that that policy was the policy of the party with which he is associated. I suppose that he supported that policy before he was elected to the Senate. It must have been the policy in which he believes, or he would not have signed the pledge which is exacted from candidates by the Labour party. After having signed that pledge, he fulfilled upon the floor of this chamber the promise which he had given to the electors of Western Australia and to the Labour party. That is the position. I was fighting for a White Australia Jong before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> took any part in the battle. That is no credit to me. It is simply due to the fact that I am an older man. </para>

                        <para>- In spite o&#39;f the law which operates in Queensland, the Government of that State has had to resort to a subterfuge to keep the Chinese off certain gold-fields. Hitherto the practice has been to proclaim a gold-field for a certain period, at the end of which Chinamen were entitled to enter and work upon it. The method which has been devised to get rid of them is to keep on issuing a new proclamation immediately upon the expiry of the old one. That is what is being done there to-day. The same practice has been adopted in reference to Hindoos, who constitute the worst class of coloured labour that has ever set foot in Australia. Those who were responsible for their introduction, realize the accuracy of my statement to-day. The Hindoos are born traders. They are able to engage in all sorts of distributing occupations, and that is why they have such a bad name everywhere they are well known. They are not known to any great extent in Victoria. </para>

                    <para>. - The point which really seems to affect this question is that which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> and some honorable senators opposite &#34;with whom I am in perfect agreement. The issue is one of abstract justice, as opposed to considerations of policy. Now, the Commonwealth has adopted a certain definite policy in regard to maintaining a White Australia, in the carrying out of which small matters of abstract justice have not been permitted to stand in the way. The question of policy is, to my mind, the bigger one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has cited an instance under the Sugar Bounties Act, which shows how vigorously that policy is insisted upon, even though absolute injustice may be inflicted under it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not referring to that instance, but to the case of a British subject who was originally a man-of-warsman. He came to Australia many years ago, he married here, and today exercises a vote, not only in municipal but also in State elections. . Except for the shade of his complexion, he is just the same as every white man. He employs white labour only on his sugar plantation, and yet he is not permitted to participate in the sugar bounty. That is a case in which an absolute injustice is being done under our White Australia policy. In the same way our Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act does not place everybody upon an equal footing. As a matter of fact, it does not even place our own men and women upon the same footing. Yet Commonwealth statistics show that women live longer in Australia than do men, and according to that line of reasoning, the latter ought to be eligible to receive pensions before, and not after, the former. Consequently, I say that a good deal of sacrifice of abstract justice has to be made on account of considerations of policy. </para>

                        <para>- I have given one illustration of the injustice that may be done in individual cases when we are carrying out a general policy. Another one which I may cite occurred when it was decided to deport kanakas from Queensland. I do not say that a great number were not properly deported, but in individual cases men who had lived in this country, and had wives and families here, were compelled to go away.- In those instances, mere abstract justice in one or two individual cases had to give way before the more important question of carrying out the general policy of the country. The real issue is, whether the amount of injustice that may be done is sufficient to warrant us in abrogating our policy to a certain extent. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I agree with ray honorable friend. If coloured people know that when they reach a certain age they will receive pensions, it seems perfectly clear that we offer them an inducement to remain here rather than to go back to their native country, where the\ would not get pensions. Cases have occurred where Chinese have come into Australia with faked papers, or papers which have been bought from men who have gone back to China. Chinamen have paid as much as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;80</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> to come to Australia. If they are content to do that, surely there would be a greater inducement for them to come if they knew that they would receive pensions on reaching a certain age. There are two distinct directions in which the granting of pensions to coloured people will affect our national policy. It will tend to keep men here who would otherwise clear out, and it will induce Asiatics to obtain falsified papers with the object of coming to Australia. It must be remembered also that this Bill, when passed, will not be immutable. It can be altered. If we find that injustice is being done, and we have reason to believe that an alteration would not affect the national policy -of Australia, there is nothing to prevent Parliament from altering the law, and putting it on a broader basis. At present, we have no information as to the number of coloured people likely to be affected by this measure. We do not know whether a large number of Asiatics will be affected or not. We have been told that there are many coloured people in Australia who are just as good as white men. But that is not a sufficient reason for deliberately adopting the principle of granting pensions to Asiatics who have been naturalized, unless we have evidence as to the amount of injustice that will be done by not granting pensions to them. Another point that has struck me is that, if I understand the naturalization laws at all, a coloured man who becomes naturalized in Great Britain is a British subject throughout the Empire. Take the case of a Japanese who goes to Great Britain, and becomes naturalized there. Suppose that he chooses to emigrate to Australia. , </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with much surprise and more regret to the statement of .the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that he proposes to go back on his vote yesterday on account of a consideration which I can only describe as of a very minute character. The legislation which stands on our statute-book in regard to immigration restriction constitutes in itself a reason for Asiatics remaining in the country. It is a premium on residence in Australia, and from that point of view the Exclusion Act itself was a mistake. But I wish to appeal to honorable senators, not only on local grounds, but on broader and larger grounds, affecting the whole Empire. To use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> words, I appeal to them in the interests of justice, which is dear to all British born people. I hold in my hand one or two cuttings which I should like to quote. Honorable senators are aware that there was for some time considerable uncertainty and difficulty in England with regard to the way in which our exclusion legislation should be dealt with. But it has been definitely announced that Great Britain will support our laws. They have been recognised by the Imperial authorities. The Royal assent has been given to them. The Imperial Government have now gone further, and have made a sort of appeal to us that, as they are doing all they can to support us, we at least ought to do nothing to increase their difficulties. On the 31st July last year  Colonel Seely,  the Parliamentary UnderSecretary for the Colonies, speaking in the House of Commons on a motion of adjournment, admitted that the Asiatic question in the Colonies was overwhelmingly important. He said - </para>

                    <para>The whole future of the Empire depended upon the present steps, and a false move might shatter it. Great Britain ought not to adopt a superior tone towards the Colonies, with whom the question was more acute than here. </para>

                    <para>We were bound to admit, Colonel Seely said, that the self-governing Colonies could exclude whom they would, and we could not interfere, but certain principles might be laid down. If immigrants were admitted they must sooner or later be given civil rights. They must be admitted free or not at all. If the self-governing Colonies sought to exclude British subjects owing to economic reasons, to prevent wages being cut or because climatic conditions or social antipathy causing riots, they ought at any rate* to treat with the utmost generosity the coloured immigrants already there. The Imperial Government asked for that treatment for them and had been met by Canada in the friendliest spirit. He was confident that the Governments of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa would show the same spirit, realizing as they would the necessity of mutual forbearance. </para>

                <para class="block">The appeal which  Colonel Seely  made to the Government of Australia on that occasion I bring to the notice of my honorable friend the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I think it far outweighs in broad and deep significance any possible risk that may be run from the slight tendency to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has drawn attention.

                    <para>Besides closer union and co-operation with the self-governing Colonies, another object was the retention and development of the dependent Empire, India, which will probably always be the greatest of our Possessions. Holding that we should interest the self-governing States in the dependent Empire&#39;s affairs, Lord Milner instanced the attitude of the Colonies towards the coloured races as one of the dangers due to Colonial acquaintance with the dependent Empire being so limited. </para>

                <para class="block">I direct attention to that statement, and suggest that some of the speeches to which we listened yesterday and to-day are due to a non-recognition of the essentials that go to unity of the Empire, and of the desirability of our being prepared to give way on slight matters in recognition of the way in which we have been met. We are not expected by the Imperial Government to undo our White Australia legislation. They have placed the power of the Empire at the back of it. But they ask us to recognise the Empire&#39;s difficulties, and to facilitate in any way  we can the great work they have to do in governing an Empire such as. because of its complexity, the world never before saw. </para>

                        <para>- Decidedly. I am putting it now on the ground of policy. I have already put it as a matter of justice. I have said that the justice of the proposal should be its strongest recommendation to support, but I ask honorable senators not to forget the possibilities and probabilities of the future. I ask them not to forget that, although the Chinese may now be considered a backward race, in a few years&#39; time it is probable that they will not be so backward. I doubt whether  they  will ever become as powerful and progressive as are the Japanese, but I am sure that they will become stronger and more progressive than they are to-day. There should be nothing in our treatment of Chinese, or other Asiatics, to which they can reasonably object. We have a perfect right to say who shall inhabit Australia, but when people have been admitted to this country and have become citizens of the Empire, we have no right to treat them as inferior to ourselves. A great writer observed some time ago that there was no- test of the civilization of a people like that of the way in which  they  treated the strangers in their midst. I ask honorable senators to take a big view of this matter, and not to be influenced by the insignificant considerations <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has put before them today. I see bv the statistics of New South Wales that even since the last census, there has been an outflow of Chinese from that State to the extent of about 400 per year. That has been the excess of departure&#39;s over arrivals. </para>

I am sorry the honorable senator is not now present, because I should like to tell him that it is not too late. He was really referring to the position as it existed many years ago, and which we are not now asked to consider, because the position we have taken up in the matter of the exclusion of coloured races has been recognised, and is sustained by the might of the British Empire. But we are asked to do what is fair and reasonable in small matters. That is all that I ask the Committee to do. It was with that object in view that I moved my amendment yesterday. I have always been prepared to give credit and honour where they are due. For years, I have had correspondence with the various Governments in Australia about the treatment of shipwrecked coloured men, and I recognise with thankfulness that when a Labour Government was in power, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> as Minister of External Affairs, issued a minute of instruction to all Customs House officers throughout Australia that in case of any shipwreck, the utmost care should be given to coloured people, and that they must not, because of the terms of our immigration restriction legislation, be subjected to any offensive unpleasantness. . </para>

                    <para>. - It has been said that the proposal now before the Committee for reconsideration would, in some way, affect the principle of a White Australia. Whatever opinions we may hold on the merits of the proposal, I venture to say that it would not in the slightest degree affect that principle. The views expressed by some honorable senators opposite in support of the contention that a naturalized Asiatic should be given the same advantages as a natural-born British subject of the white race, are creditable to their sense both of humanity and justice. The arguments they have addressed to the Committee have been such that I freely confess they have caused my judgment to waver, and though I intend to adhere to the vote I gave last night, I shall do so with some indecision. One reason why I intend to adhere to the judgment I formed last night is that I have felt compelled to make a distinction in regard to our own people. I have felt that a distinction should be drawn between the European. British, or Australia-born woman, who, as a widow, has by her own unaided efforts, brought up a family properly, and a widower who has done the same thing. I have felt that if the man should be entitled to an old-age pension at sixty, the woman in such a case might very well be paid the pension at fifty-five or fifty. </para>

                        <para>- I voted against the proposal made, but, having been compelled to recognise such a distinction, I say that we are entitled to consider our position with regard to the naturalized Asiatics amongst us. We are entitled to say to the naturalized Asiatics what we have said to a deserving class of women : &#34; We are not cutting you out altogether, but are giving you an intimation that, although at present we are unable to extend the benefits of this legislation to you, should our finances become more elastic, and the question arise for reconsideration, we shall be able to consider the justice of your claim.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Pulsford is a strong Imperialist, and has a very strong sense of justice. He considers it somewhat of a reflection from an Imperial and national point of view that we should not give a naturalized Asiatic the same privileges as we are prepared to give to our own people. I do not take that view. If complaint were made on the subject by the authorities in China or Japan, the answer would be a a very strong one. It would be: &#34;We are not permanently shutting out our naturalized Asiatic subjects, whether they came originally from China or Japan. If they are to be excluded at all, they are to be excluded, not by reason of their colour or skin, but by reason of the state of our finances, and the fact &#39;that we have treated a number of our own people quite as severely.&#34; I ask honorable senators to contrast that position with the position of Europeans or Britishers who may have been naturalized in Japan or China. If the Governments of those countries were to resent our decision on this occasion, <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> could retort by asking, &#34; Have you ever contemplated making similar provision for persons who may become Japanese or Chinese subjects?&#34; They, have made no attempt in that direction. We shall always be in a position to candidly say to the Japanese authorities, &#34; Our legislation is no insult to or reflection upon your race. The state of .our finances did not permit us to do all that we desired.&#34; I believe that under more favorable conditions this Parliament will give earnest consideration to a claim of this kind. For these reasons, I adhere to the vote I gave last night. </para>

                    <para>. - The fact that this discussion has resulted in the conversion of a few honorable senators is a strong justification for the time which has been occupied. I feel quite sure that if this question is regarded from&#39; a broad Australian stand-point, it will be recognised that whatever we may do in the future, at the present moment and under existing circumstances it would be a very grave mistake to extend our pension-list in the direction proposed. We have been told that it cannot be extended in other directions, owing to the want of funds. We have been unable to grant a pension in much more deserving cases. Seeing that we have been unable to confer a boon in the most deserving cases which have been brought under our attention, I cannot understand why we should hesitate to deal in exactly the same way with the least deserving cases. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">We are assured that it is necessary to be economical. If that is so, let us be consistent, and say that we have already placed on the pension-list as many persons as we can afford to provide for, and that, therefore, it cannot at present be further enlarged. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has dealt with this question from the Imperial stand-point. If the opinion of Lord Milner should carry as much weight as he seems to think it should, I ask him to consider the opinion of a much greater man. and that is Herbert Spencer, the great political economist. He dealt with this question practically from the stand-point of to-day. As a Britisher, who was asked to tender advice to the Japanese, he advised them, for the sake of their nationality and their welfare, to extend as few privileges as possible to the Europeans. He pointed out the national danger to the Japanese if they acted contrary to his advice. He urged that once the Europeans were allowed to obtain a grip upon their country it would be a case of good-bye to their national independence. He assured the Japanese that their national safety would depend to a great extent upon the keeping of their country to themselves. </para>

                        <para>- They can live on much less than can other persons, and, therefore,- they contribute in a much smaller ratio to the public revenue. Our various asylums and hospitals are open to these persons. We do not seek to take away from them any privilege which they now enjoy. What we contend is that no additional privilege should be granted to them. That I hold is the proper attitude to take up if we are in earnest about our White Australia policy. The maintenance of that policy is a foremost plank in the Labour platform, so that whenever a question of this kind is submitted for our consideration it should receive our determined opposition. </para>

I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> if he would propose to repeal the law which prevents Chinese from going upon the gold-fields of Western Australia. I do not believe that he would propose to do anything of the kind. It is inconsistent with our restrictive legislation to put the Chinese on the same basis as our own people. </para>

                        <para>- I said that from my point of view those speakers were honest. I am not going to asperse those who may differ from me. I am satisfied that, if the Bill be retained in its present form, it will not interfere with the White Australia policy which h.v been adopted by the Commonwealth. When a man becomes a naturalized subject, he ought to have conferred upon him full rights of citizenship. If I were to go to France and become naturalized, I should expect to exercise the same rights of citizenship as a natura l-born Frenchman. We know perfectly well that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higginson,</inline> who took a great interest in the South Sea Islands, particularly in the New Hebrides, became a naturalized Frenchman and enjoyed the same rights of citizenship &#39; as the natural born Frenchman. I repeat that when a person becomes a naturalized subject he ought to be treated in all respects as one of ourselves. In the course of his remarks <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> -referred to America, and to the great danger which obtains there. I hold that America and Australia occupy entirely different positions. There is no analogy between them. In America slaves were imported from South Africa for many decades. Have we ever done anything of that kind ? </para>

As an old Queenslander, I say that when the census was taken there, after forty-one years&#39; experience of indented labour, only forty-one half-caste whites were accounted for, though there were  141  children of aborigines and South Sea Islanders. </para>

                        <para>- The natives of South Africa include, by descent, the American negroes, whereas we Australians are of European origin. &#39;We are not Australians in the sense that are the aboriginal natives. I think that the views entertained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> deserve every consideration at our hands. We are part of the British Empire, and we ought not to embarrass . the Imperial authorities by legislation of this kind. To argue that, because of the accident of colour a naturalized subject ought to be treated as if he were not a human being, is ridiculous. When a man becomes naturalized, he should enjoy the full rights of citizenship. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to deal with the merits or demerits of the question from the stand-point of a White Australia, because that aspect of it has been very fully discussed. I merely wish to make a brief reference to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> &#39; to whose eloquent address I listened very attentively. He certainly made a splendid speech, but, unconsciously, he misled the Committee in regard to some figures which he quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register of New South Wales.</inline> In this connexion he stated that about 400 Chinese had gone away from that State yearly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> and myself asked him where they had gone, but he did not reply. Apparently he desired the Committee to believe that they had left Australia. But the publication from which he quoted does not bear out that contention. It simply shows that in 1907 the excess of departures of Chinese from New South Wales over arrivals was 553. There is nothing to the effect that these Chinese returned to China. </para>

For that purpose, it  will be necessary for me to move the suspension of the Standing Orders. Honorable senators will understand that there are certain claims that cannot be dealt with by the proper authorities until this Bill be- comes law. It is with a view of saving a few days, and extending as early as possible the operation of the measure to those who will be benefited under it, that I move - </para>

                    <para>. - During the passage of this Bill through Committee, I have been quiescent ; and I now desire to place upon record my reasons far not interposing in the debate. The Old-age Pensions Act is only just coming into operation, and we do not know exactly what the financial burden will be. My desire was that we should keep the Act as it is at present, with the exception of the alterations which the Government have proposed, in order that we might see exactly how it works. No doubt we shall have to amend it in the future. Possibly we shall be able to extend its operation, and eventually pass a consolidated measure. The amendments that have been proposed by various senators would, I think, taken together, have brought up the total expenditure under the Old-age Pensions Act to something like&#163;3,000,000 per annum. It seems to me that that would be a burden which would be too great for us to undertake immediately. For that reason, I have opposed the various amendments submitted, and so far as I could, have assisted&#34; to keep the Bill intact, so that we ought get some experience of the working of the Act ; and later, as the result of that experience, might amend it in any way that seemed desirable. </para>
