It is desirable that the Bill should be passed at as early a date as possible, to permit the works covered by it to be proceeded with.

                            <para>- Honorable senators are aware that under the provisions of our Audit Act, any amounts appropriated for the service of the year which have not been expended on the 30th June lapse, and it is necessary to obtain re-votes. It is desirable, therefore, that we should, as early as possible, place the various Departments in a position to proceed with works which have been authorized, and it is for that reason that I have asked the Senate to permit me to carry this Bill over more than one stage to-day. I shall be only too pleased if, having looked into it, honorable senators will be content to go further than the second reading. I need only point out now that the schedule to the Bill is the schedule appearing from page 273 onwards in the Estimates-in-Chief, which have not only been in print and in the possession of honorable senators for some time, but have been discussed here during the last week. The Bill covers the necessary appropriation for new works and buildings for the present financial year. It is a measure regarding &#34;which I hardly think it necessary to say very much at this stage, for the reason that from our past experience of similar measures, inquiries concerning the proposed votes are more conveniently dealt with in Committee. I shall be prepared, in Committee, to furnish all the information at my disposal which may be sought by honorable senators. In the meantime, I reiterate, in moving the second reading, that if honorable senators desire an adjournment of the debate, I shall be prepared to fall in with their wishes. Should they be prepared to continue the consideration of the Bill, I shall hail that as a further evidence of a desire on the part of the Senate to expedite public business. </para>

                        <para>. - I think there is no reason why we should not go on with the second reading of the Bill to-day. Honorable senators on this side are prepared to give the Minister every assistance to put the Bill through today. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said, we have had the Es timates before us since the introduction <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> the Budget in another place, but I do think that the honorable senator should have had the Bill circulated amongst honorable senators. It would have been more convenient and more in proper form. It would have been a very simple thing to arrange, because the Bill is in print, and has been passed in another place. It is somewhat lax, if not discourteous, on the part of the Minister to ask honorable senators to take the second reading before the Bill has been circulated. As I see that the Bill is now being circulated, I shall not further refer to that aspect of the matter. </para>

At the present time, the Commonwealth is leasing premises there for Customs purposes, and for these premises it is paying a rental of &#163;175 per annum. Now, the Commonwealth already owns a sufficient area at Broken Hill to permit of the erection of a Customs building, and the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;600</inline> provided for on these Estimates will, it is anticipated, cover the cost of its construction, so that by the proposed expenditure we shall effect a saving of &#163;175 per annum. </para>

If that vessel is not rendering good service to the Commonwealth it is idle for us to sanction any further expenditure upon it. I do not know whether it is rendering such service to Australia, but I have seen numerous complaints in the press in reference to the work which it is doing. I shall be glad to have the assurance of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the trawler is rendering the Commonwealth good service by opening up and exploring new fishing grounds. If the vessel is doing that I shall not cavil at the amount which is provided on these Estimates for the purpose of providing it with a launch. </para>

                        <para>. - The reports so far available in regard to the work which is being performed by the trawler are of a most encouraging nature. It is not pretended even by those who are working the vessel that its work hitherto has been of an exhaustive character. It has rather been experimental. But all the reports to hand justify us in proceeding with the work which the vessel was built to undertake, and which, if successfully performed, will far more than repay the Commonwealth for its outlay. It has been found necessary, however, to provide the vessel with a small launch. </para>

The general policy of the Government is to provide these things as far as possible from our own resources, and I do not anticipate that that policy will be departed from on the present occasion. In Sydney there would not be the slightest difficulty in turning out launches of this size as fast as any one cared to order them. </para>

                        <para>.- The work of the trawler has interested me, and so far as my inquiries go it appears to have been done in an exceedingly satisfactory manner. I have read what has appeared in the press, but I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that I attach more importance to the inquiries that I have personally made than to predicate absolute accuracy for the press reports. I believe that the trawler is doing very good work. I rose, however, principally to state to the Committee what I have already told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> privately, that in the course of my investigations I discovered that no one on board the trawler signs articles. I believe that some record is kept of the crew, but it is not the usual kind of record that is kept on board ships. Whether that state of  things is right or not I do not know, but the subject might be inquired into. It may or may not be desirable that the crew of this Commonwealth vessel should sign articles as is done on other ships, but, at all events, it is desirable to have a proper record, in case, for instance, an accident should occur to any person on board leading to his disappearance. I do not know whether there is any objection to the men signing on in the usual way, but possibly the Minister will be able to tell us whether he has made inquiries into the matter. </para>

I was informed that some legal question is involved, but the whole question as to what is the best course to pursue is now under review. Consideration is being given to the question whether it may be necessary, seeing that the trawler is a Government vessel, to follow the usual procedure, or whether some other form of record of the crew should be kept.

                        <para>. - When the trawler visited Port Adelaide a week or two ago I went on board and had a conversation with the gentleman who conducts the scientific part of the work. I gathered that the vessel is a very fine one. . He was loud in his praise of its sea-going qualities. I consider that the work is being done very methodically and completely. A careful record is kept of what is gathered in by the trawler, the exact place where it  is obtained,  the weight of the fish, and even specimens of the, water in which the fish were captured are preserved. Everything seemed to me to lie done in a very satisfactory fashion. I was very glad, indeed, to have an opportunity of inspecting the boat. I believe that the investigations carried out&#39; will be of great benefit to the Commonwealth and to the fishing industry. </para>

                        <para>.- I am given to understand that some time ago, when the trawler came ih to the port of Melbourne with a fairly large quantity of fish on board, a considerable quantity of that excellent food was not distributed,, but went bad and had to be thrown away. I do not know whether that would meet with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> approval.&#39; Probably he would prefer that the fish should&#39; be thrown away than that it should come into competition with private enterprise. On a number of occasions a portion of the catch was given away, but a larger quantity was withheld, designedly, 1 suppose, with the view of distributing it to public institutions : but that course was not invariably followed, and the fish, in those- instances, had to be condemned as unfit for consumption. </para>

During the winter months, if the weather is too bad for the trawler to pursue her work in southern waters, she could be sent to northerly latitudes. As to the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> relating to the signing on of the crew, I should have thought that, as the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council was drawn to the subject privately, he would have made himself sufficiently acquainted with the subject to be able to let us know what was the constitutional or legal point engaging the attention of the Attorney-General. Seeing that the Public Service Commissioner was the officer responsible for engaging the members of the crew, I should think that they ought to come under the operation of the Public Service Act. Whatever the legal points in doubt may be, they should&#39; be communicated to the Senate. Of course, I do not expect the Minister to be capable of replying immediately to every question which is sprung upon him. But, since the matter has been privately brought to his notice, he should be able to throw some light on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- No&#39;; it-is the ring of fishmongers, and these, I believe, belong to one nationality. I do not object to them on that ground, but it appears to me that not only are Britishers driven out of the wholesale and retail trade, but that even the fish caught by ordinary white men do not get a fair show in the market. I want to draw the attention of the Government to this matter, as it concerns the food supply of the people. I think that it comes rightly under their purview. We have one trawler at sea, but why should we not have as many trawlers - even a hundred, if necessary - as would supply the whole population with fish? </para>

                            <para>- It appears to me to be reducing procedure to a screaming farce, if we can discuss the trawler but not the fish. We might as well shut up shop, turn off the gas, and disappear. I have no doubt that what I was talking about was exceedingly unpleasant to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> who is a strong believer in private &#39; enterprise. I have nothing further to say on the subject. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not aware that we have yet received any reports regarding the work of the trawler. I desire to know whether it is to make very short experiments in the waters of the States, or whether the work in a particular place is to be completed before the trawler is taken to other waters. It seems to me that we are amusing some States by lending them the trawler for a short period without requiring the work in a particular water to be completed before it is taken elsewhere. In my opinion, the exploratory work in Tasmanian waters should have been completed and reported upon before the trawler was sent to South Australia. </para>

                        <para>-23l- - f am satisfied that the trawler has done fairly good work ; though it might have been kept more closely occupied. What is done with the fish caught is not a matter that we ought to consider. The trawler is sent out to prospect for fishing-grounds, just as men are sent into the country to prospect for reefs. I think that a steam-launch should have been provided when the trawler was built. A trawler might a&#187; well be without a propeller as without a steam-launch. When prospecting is carried on, instead of four men being employed to take a boat into creeks and corners, the launch will be sent, and it will draw no more water than would a boat. </para>

The honorable senator implied that I should have been furnished with information on the thousand and one subjects over which honorable senators have ranged in discussing the innocent vote for a launch for the trawler. I ask the Committee not to judge of my capacity to answer questions by the capacity of honorable senators generally to ask them. The questions raised on this vote have ranged from what ought to be the future policy in regard to fish rings to the one hundred and one other matters which have been referred to, and it could not be assumed that I should be in a position to answer all those questions. The departmental authorities are extremely obliged to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> for having brought up the matter to which he has referred. Let me say first of all that articles are not in existence. The reason for that, I believe, is that the ship is not a registered one. It has been decided now to avoid the difficulty, which I have no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> thought might crop up through the absence of articles or an agreement, to draft an agreement which the men will be invited to sign. <inline font-style="italic">Amongst</inline> other questions asked was one bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> in connexion with a quantity of fish brought in by the trawler and destroyed as unsound.

                            <para>- When two sets ot experts differ in such, a matter I am not going to take it upon myself, when I have had no opportunity to judge, &#39;to say that one was right and the other wrong. In answer to the question as to where the trawler is to be worked, let me say that i! is to be worked in all waters which invite inspection. As to the period of the year at which the trawler will visit different parts of Australia, let rae say that that is to be decided mainly by weather considerations. The trawler was withdrawn from Tasmanian waters a little time ago because the climatic conditions rendered it unprofitable to continue trawling operations on the Tasmanian coast. The vessel has not completed her work in Tasmanian waters. As a matter of fact, she has only commenced her work there, but it was obviously a wasteful proceeding for the trawler to stay on that coast when the weather conditions were unsuitable for trawling operations. </para>

So far as the movements of the trawler are concerned, I should say that if the best use is to be made of the vessel some plan of future operations should be sketched out. I think- that those who were responsible for sending the vessel to trawl in Tasmanian waters in the winter season may be charged with bungling. I should have thought that during the winter season the vessel would have been employed in northern latitudes where good weather might have been anticipated. </para>

                            <para>- The information &#91; have from mariners is that during the winter season the sea is invariably rough in southern latitudes. It might reasonably have been expected that the trawler would be sent to those parts of the coast where it might be worked continuously. As the vessel has been engaged during most of the winter season in southern latitudes, I suppose it will be sent to the northern latitudes during the &#34;willy-willy&#34; season. We cannot look for good results from the operations of the trawler in bad weather, and her future operations should be arranged on some plan drawn up in accordance with common sense, and under which it will be possible to say where the vessel will be operating during particular seasons of the year. </para>

The answer given to the question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> was not satisfactory to me, and that is my excuse for putting the question again. I wish to know what really is the purpose for which the launch is to be provided. Is it intended that it should be a kind of pleasure boat for picnicking along some of our rivers? I think that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> could not have been serious in suggesting that it is required for prospecting the rivers if Australia for fish, unless what is meant -&#62;)- prospecting for fish is that the launch is necessary to enable us to discover where fish are actually to be seen in the water. Any one travelling by vessels plying on the north-west coast of Australia will, when going into Derby and some other ports on that coast, be able to see fish in millions. </para>

The reason I overlooked it was that when the item first came under discussion I explained the purpose for which the launch is required. It is to be used for work in waters into which the trawler cannot go. It is also required for trawling where delicate gear is employed. The statement put forward by the officer in charge of trawling operations is that its use will save considerable labour and enable the work of the trawler to be carried out not only more expeditiously but more satisfactorily. The. launch is also required for landing in bar harbors, and for other purposes to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> very graphically directed attention. I venture to add that there is hardly a modern boat of any size, and certainly of the size of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour,</inline> that has not in its equipment such a launch as that which it is proposed to purchase for the trawler. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to ask a general question which I admit might more appropriately have been asked on the second reading. I cannot find any provision in these Estimates for new lighthouses. We are at present considering a Bill dealing with the subject of lighthouses, and I assume .that it is intended to spend some money in that connexion during the current financial year. I also desire to know whether, in preparing these Estimates, the Government consulted the Tasmanian authorities in regard to the amount which it is desirable to spend upon the erection of new quarantine stations in that State, and in regard to where those stations are to be located? I am chiefly concerned with the quarantine station on the River Tamar. It has been suggested that a new quarantine station is to be built about  30  miles from Launceston and about  10  miles from Low Head. If that be so, in my opinion, the Government are making a mistake. If the quarantine station for the port of Launceston be located  30  miles down the Tamar River it is obvious that the work of medical inspection will be carried out at considerable and avoidable expense. It would be well for such inspection to be conducted as close to the residence of the medical officer as possible. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has completely anticipated me in the remarks that I had intended to make. &#34;Upon two previous occasions I rose to ask where the new quarantine stations for which provision is made on these Estimates are to be established. I understand that one of them is to be located on the Tamar River. Some time ago I put a question to the Government in regard to the clearing of vessels at Launceston. I was then informed that the medical inspection of ships must: take place at the mouth of the Tamar River before they were permitted to proceed to Launceston. I assume, therefore, that it is intended that the inspection shall take place not far distant from Low Head instead of 30 miles up the river, as at present. I notice that the vote which we are asked to sanction for the purpose of providing these new quarantine stations is &#163;1,000, of which &#163;200 is a re-vote. Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council tell the Committee how much of this sum it is intended to spend in Tasmania, and where the new quarantine stations are to be situated? </para>

If he will look at the Estimates-in-Chief he will observe that under the Department of Home Affairs. Parliament is asked to approve a preliminary vote for the purpose of enabling the Government to make the necessary inquiries prior to deciding what new lights are required along the Australian coast. The proposed new quarantine stations occupy a very similar position. At the present moment <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris,</inline> who has been intrusted with the administration of the Quarantine Act, has under consideration the whole question of what new quarantine stations shall be erected, and also where they shall be located. The sum of &#163;1.000 provided upon these Estimates will enable him to secure sites which are at present available, but that it will represent the total amount required in that connexion is very improbable. At the same time, the whole question of what quarantine stations should be continued, and of where new stations are required, is under review. The sole object of the proposed vote to which attention has been drawn is to make provision for new quarantine stations during the current year. </para>

I desire to know w.hat forts in New South Wales it is proposed to re-arm, and also whether this Bill will authorize the ordering of new guns and of shields for those guns. If so, how -many guns will it empower the Government to order, and how many shields for those guns as well as how many shields for existing guns? At present the Committee do not know whether the &#163;60,000 to which I have alluded covers the particular item to which I am now referring. It seems to me that the Government do not propose to give any substantial impetus to the proposal to re-arm certain forts in New South Wales, because the only items relating to fixed defences in that State - apart from the general item to which I have referred- are &#34; Stockton, - Site for battery, &#163;120;&#34; &#34;Port Kembla - Land for defence purposes, &#163;750 ;&#34; &#34; Chowder Bay - Acquisition of land for defence purposes, &#163;1,250; &#34;.and &#34; Emplacements and works for fixed defence.% guns, and lights - towards cost, &#163;2,000.&#34; I know that the officers of the Department have recommended that the forts of Newcastle - of which Stockton is one - should be re-armed this year. </para>

                            <para>- But that expenditure is to be spread over the whole Commonwealth. I desire to know, whether - if we agree to this Bill - the Government will be authorized to complete the re-armament of the forts at Newcastle? Will the amounts which we are asked to vote be sufficient to provide emplacements for the new guns? In regard to the forts at Sydney I am aware that some new guns have been mounted there, but a considerable number of obsolete weapons are also in use. This is notably the&#39; case at the South Head Batteries. There, the greater number of the guns are out of date. Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council tell me how many new guns this Bill will provide for New South Wales? I - am sure that the officers of the Department will supply him with the desired information, because I know that it was available before the Fisher Government were removed from office. </para>

                            <para>- Concerning the item of &#163;60,000 to which the honorable senator has alluded, I have no hesitation in saying that it includes provision for the mountings of two new guns at Newcastle. In reference to the item &#34; Emplacements and works for fixed defences, guns, and lights - towards cost, &#163;2.000.&#34; I wish to say that it is proposed to construct the following works at a total cost of ,&#163;10,000. of which the Committee is now asked to sanction the appropriation of &#163;2,000 : - Port Jackson, to provide electric light, Director&#39;s Station at Middle Head, &#163;100 ; Newcastle, construct fort and caretaker&#39;s quarters at Stockton &#163;6,000 ; reconstruct two gun emplacements at Port Scratchley, &#163;3,500; provide emplacement for two electric lights, .&#163;275. As to item No. 21, the amount is provided to enable the Commonwealth to purchase from private owners certain land which forms portion of an area required for the construction of a battery for the defence of Newcastle. The sum of .&#163;750, item No. 20, is required for the acquisition of land for the construction of a battery for the protection of Port Kembla, which is adjacent- to an important coal-mining centre of New South Wales. The land, which is 29 acres 1 rood 15! perches in area, is being acquired from the State Government at &#163;25 per acre. As to the .&#163;1,250 for the acquisition of land at Chowder Bay, I have been informed that, in view of the advice of the Attorney-General, the proprietors of lot 288 are entitled tq access along certain roads, and since the Department has no right to prevent the use of the roads bv the proprietors, it would appear to be requisite to acquire lot 288; and. thereby secure absolute control by right of proprietorship over the whole area, including the roads reserved by the State under the original subdivision of the land. Responsible- officers- have expressed the opinion that, in the interests of the Commonwealth, it is desirable to acquire the property, as thereby the Defence lands in the vicinity will be held without severance. </para>

                            <para>-Itakeitthatshieldswillbe provided for the guns that are to be acquired. I notice that, under this subdivision, there is an item, No. 17, of &#163;5,000. for gun-park and harness-rooms for the Australian Field Artillery. There is also a vote for a drill-hall for the Field Artillery at Wagga Wagga. On those two items, I desire to say a few words with respect to the Field Artillery generally. I cannot see in this schedule any vote for providing additional ammunition waggons, although I am given to understand that provision for that purpose may be included in the general vote at the end of the Bill - special Defence material for the Field Artillery,&#163;10,200. I venture to say that the Minister of Defence is quite cognisant of the fact that that vote is not sufficient to provide the Field Artillery of Australia with the waggons that they require, together with saddlery. I am not sure as to the amount of the vote on the last occasion; but  1  think that the contract with Robertson Brothers ran into &#163;25,000; although that sum only gave one ammunition waggon for each field gun in Australia. My information shows that that is altogether inadequate. We have not sufficient transport for our Field Artillery. There seems to be no particular item in the New South Wales subdivision for this purpose, apart from those I have mentioned. Nor is there any provision for the adequate equipment of the Field Artillery with respect to horses. That is regrettable. I do not say that the Government should launch out into wild-cat schemes involving huge expenditure ; but, if we can show that expenditure in this direction is necessary in the interests of the efficiency of the Forces, and would also tend to economy, it would appear to be quite justified. The Minister of Defence had in his possession, when he compiled  these Estimates, the report of the Committee on the question of &#34; Ownership of horses, &#38;c, for Military purposes,&#34; presented by command, on the 21st July, and ordered to be printed on 5th August, 1909.I propose to quote the gist of that report, in order to show that there was justification for the Minister of Defence making further provision than he has done for the Field Artillery, in order that it may become efficient for the work which it has to do. The Departmental Committee to which I refer consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Hutchison, M,P. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Major Harold</inline> A. Grimwade, and <inline font-weight="bold">Major H.</inline> W. Dangar, Director of Artillery. The Secretary was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> W. Skevington.

These advantages and opportunities do not  exist at the present time, and from experience in all other countries, it is apparent that all officers to become efficient for Field Artillery must devote as much time as possible in training with a permanent unit. Furthermore, it cannot be expected that a supply of sufficient instructors can be maintained unless they receive such special training as can only be obtained in a permanent unit. It is admitted that the Militia Field Artillery rank and file are, without question, men of high type and intelligence, but unless they can be handled properly they are practically of no value. </para>
                    <para>If these proposed permanent units are not allotted as a battery to any definite position in the Defence Scheme, they will form a very serviceable nucleus of the Ammunition Column to be raised in time of war. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is a very sweeping statement, but it is made by officers of very high standing, upon whom we can rely. I think we ought to have a quorum present. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> If honorable senators, who are the trustees of the public purse in this matter, will bear with me, I want to show them that the Committee from whose report I am quoting demonstrate how the suggestions which they make can be adopted with economical advantage. Our time may very well be employed in getting at the facts. In their third paragraph, they state that the establishment of permanent units in the various States should cost, for up-keep, &#163;23,906. The total number of horses required is 1,352, including officers&#39; horses, and sufficient for six-horse teams. The Committee add - </para>
                    <para>It will be necessary to provide depots for the accommodation of horses and men in localities convenient to the places where the horses will be most required. In the larger States these depots will give facilities for manoeuvre ground for troops of all arms. The size will vary in accordance with the number of horses to be maintained. The total cost of land for these depots is estimated at  &#163;15,000. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Committee go into details and show that the adoption of their scheme with reference to horses would involve a capital expenditure of &#163;55,860. But they also point out that the annual expenditure for hiring remounts, under the scheme of training proposed by the late Government, would be &#163;37,518. </para>

The Committee estimate that the revenue derived from this source would be &#163;19,713. They also say that we could abolish the present cadre system, and save &#163;3,380 in that direction, making a total saving of &#163;23,093. This would make the actual net expenditure &#163;15,966, or an annual saving over the hiring system of &#163;21,552. </para>

                    <para>That the hiring-out system shall be adopted in each State of all horses other than those used by the permanent unit, and 10 per cent to be kept at depot for relief purposes. The horses will be stable-fed, groomed, shod, and worked by the hirers. A charge by the Defence Department will be made for every horse hired out at the rate of not less than 7s. 6d. per week, or  &#163;1910s.  per annum. The horses will be available for drills by the Defence Department when required. This will not interfere with the hiring scheme so much as might be expected, as the hirer&#39;s interest will be carefully considered by the Defence Department, inasmuch as the parades, except during Camp, take place principally on Saturdays after  2  p.m., and on holidays, when the hirers&#39; businesses are closed. It will be so arranged that there will be at all times in each State a certain number of horses on hand at the various depots, which  will be used as relief horses to take the place of any requiring medical attendance, rest. <inline font-style="italic">&#38;c.</inline> Besides the revenue to he earned from the hiring-out system amongst private employers - who have expressed their willingness to assist the scheme - there is a considerable amount of Government work now done by contract which can be catered for by the Defence Department&#39;s horses. There will be available for hire one thousand and eleven (1,011) horses, whose total earnings at 7s. 6d. per week each, will be&#163;19,713. It is proposed  that no horse belonging to the Defence Department shall be hired to any person unless such person can satisfy an officer that the hirer has good stabling, good feed, and that the horse will be properly cared for. A regular inspection will be made to see that the horses are in good health, free from lameness, and in good condition. Any horse showing signs of sickness or over-work will be spelled at the various depots, and a horse from a unit will take its place until the horse is fit for work. </para>
                    <para>The above remarks apply only to the earning powers of the horses. In Victoria alone, if the Maribyrnong Estate land, which can be acquired&#39;, is approved of, there will be a considerable acreage of good land capable of growing fodder, lucerne, &#38;c, which will assist the up-keep of the horses, and thus go to the profit side of the proposed scheme. Important considerations, apart from enhanced efficiency, to be noted, are that the ownership of the horses means a considerable annual saving in money as against the old system of hiring. Further, should trouble arise, there will in all probability be a vast shortage of horses in the number required by the Imperial Government, thus rendering purchase in time of emergency difficult and expensive. One cannot overestimate the added efficiency to this important arm of the service - an arm which has in past history been a .decider of many hard-fought battles and a dictator of peace. </para>
                    <para>The Committee are of the opinion that the question of breeding horses is worthy of the immediate attention of the Government. Horse-breeding has been carried on for a long period in South Australia, on a limited scale, in connexion with the Post and Telegraph services, and has been found  very  satisfactory and profitable. </para>
                    <para>Attached is a report supplied by the Deputy Postmaster-General of South Australia. </para>
                    <para>The Committee feel satisfied, from extensive information gathered, that the establishment of a horse-breeding station, if only for renewals, would still further decrease the annual expenditure on the proposed scheme. </para>
                    <para class="block">The only objection which can be offered from the other side to this scheme is that the revenue has been over-estimated. My contention is that, even though the cost should be more in the long run, it would be a better and cheaper system than the present one. Now we do not get value for our money. We get inefficient horses, and that, as honorable senators must recognise, means inefficient .batteries. We may have the most highly-trained men, but if. in a time of emergency, they are furnished with untrained horses, our batteries will be useless. Under the system recommended by the committee, however, the batteries would be efficient, and the time which is now lost in training horses could be devoted to&#39; the training of men. I do not know if there is any Ministerial reply to be made to the report. If it has been rejected by the Minister of Defence, </para>
                    <para class="block">I should like to know whether he took that course because he considered the revenue to be over-estimated. Did he reject the report because of the capital expenditure which is proposed? Does he mean to suggest that the Government cannot afford to find &#163;59,000 this year to make the Commonwealth&#39;s Horse Artillery efficient? Do they say : &#34; We shall continue to be satisfied with an inefficient field artillery&#34;? Are we to spend only &#163;12,000 or ,&#163;13,000 in hiring horses which are not, and never can be made, efficient - horses which, if a war were to. break out to-morrow, we might not be able to secure? </para>

It should also be borne in mind that at the time of their arrival the war in South Africa had degenerated into a guerilla warfare. In all the great battles the horses belonging to the permanent troops were used. It was only in the latter stages of the war - that is, after the first supply of horses had begun to drop out - that the military authorities had to impress the London omnibus horses, and others. </para>

When I was in the Defence Department I read the speech in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane</inline> said that the results achieved had been eminently satisfactory, and that he proposed to extend the system. He mentioned that no difficulty had been found in getting private employers and others to agree to hire the horses&#39;. But a better example is furnished by Germany. There, also, the horses for horsing the field artillery are not kept at the depot but are hired out. The report of our departmental committee is based on German lines, just as is the English  experiment with the Territorial Forces. In the speech I &#39;referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane</inline> alluded to the example and experience of Germany in that regard. &#39;  </para>

                            <para>- Under our present system we may get horses which have never been harnessed to a gun. But under the proposed system we should get horses every week which had been trained to a gun. A horse is an intelligent, adaptable animal, and once a lesson has been learned it is not forgotten for a long while. There is no keener branch of the defence force than the field artillery. It is composed of the finest and most intelligent men, who are all very keen on their work. They admit &#34;that it fills them with disgust to be put on unsuitable and untrained horses every time they go on parade. They recognise that the training which they are now getting is not the training which they require for active service. The responsibility for taking no action oh this report rests with the Government. There was another report in regard to the clothing of the troops. But no provision is made&#39; to carry out its recommendations. The late Postmaster-General, and myself, appointed a departmental committee to go into the question. It consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> A. Pethebridge, acting secretary to the Defence Department ; Lieutenant-Colonel J. D. Legge, quartermaster-general .; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> E. Bright,  Deputy  Postmaster-General, Victoria ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Mason, accountant at the General Post Office, Melbourne. I do not propose to quote the whole of the report, but merely to read the recommendations which appear on page 3. </para>

I compare the prices in New South Wales, where wages are regulated by a Wages Board, with those in Tasmania, where there are no Wages Boards. The price of a jacket of khaki cloth for the light-horse uniform is- 23s. 3d. to 25s. in New South Wales, and the price for the same garment in Tasmania is 28s. od. The price for pantaloons of khaki cord is from 21s. to 22s. <inline font-style="italic">66.</inline> in New South Wales, and 24s. 9d. in Tasmania. Puttees are supplied for from 3s. 6d. to <inline font-style="italic">4s.</inline> 6d. in New South Wales, and they cost 5s. 6d. in Tasmania. Caps for field service are supplied in New South Wales at from 2s. nd. to 3s. od&#39;The Tasmanian manufacturers can beat the New South &#39;Wales manufacturers in caps, for they supply them at 2s. 9&#39;d. </para>

                            <para>- If that be so, it is. because the Defence Department has prescribed that Victorian Wages Board rates shall in future be paid in carrying out contracts for the Department. The prices to which I am referring ruled when the employers were sweating their employes, as proved by the report of the Royal Commission to which I have referred. In the case of infantry uniforms, the price of the tunic of scarlet serge in New South Wales is 22s. 9d., and in Tasmania 26s. 9d. to 28s. 9d. The price for trousers of khaki cloth in New South Wales is 15s. to 15s.1d. These garments are supplied in Tasmania for from 12s. 5d. to 12s. 9d. I think that it will be found that on the average the Tasmanian prices are from 10 to 15 per cent higher than the New South Wales prices. In the case of artillery uniforms, the price for the tunic of blue cloth is 29s. to 34s. 6d. in New South Wales, and it is 34s. in Tasmania. Trousers cost 14s. 6d. <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> 15s. 6d. in New South Wales, and 20s. 3d. in Tasmania, In the case of Post and Telegraph uniforms the price of summer coats is 13s. 9d. in New South Wales, and 18s. 5d. in Tasmania. Winter coats cost 15s. 8d. in New South Wales, and 19s.10d. in Tasmania. </para>

I am asking the Minister how the Government account for this omission. The report on the horsing of the forces is signed by Majors Grimwade and Dangar, who are important officers of the Department, and it should be worthy of consideration. The other report is also signed by important officials of the Public Service, and I think that the Minister should tell the Committee why the Government have decided not to adopt the recommendations contained in either of these reports. </para>

                            <para>- Both the reports referred to are now, and have been for some time, under the consideration of my honorable colleague in connexion with the whole question of the future of our Military Forces.  1  can tell honorable senators further, that, whatever may be the decision arrived at on these matters, it is not anticipated that we shall require to apply to Parliament for any appropriation in connexion with them during the present financial year. Having said so much for the Department, speaking for myself may I say, with regard to the report on the horsing of the Forces that it can only be said to suggest reasons for further inquiry. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, that it is signed by two competent military gentlemen. I have not the slightest intention to  cast any reflection upon them; but if you ask a military man to report as to the desirability of giving him better facilities for  military  purposes, you need ;be under no misapprehension as to the character of the report he will submit. He will naturally desire, to be provided with the best facilities for carrying out his work, and he is not usually disposed to give sufficient attention to the business side of the matter. I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> whether he thinks that the report on the horsing .of the Forces to which he has referred represents the last word that can be said on the subject. I say that it marks merely a starting point for inquiry.  The .gentlemen making the report assume that we might hire out horses here at the price for which horses are hired out in Great Britain. The horses hired out regularly in Great Britain at 7s. 6d. per week would cost anything from &#163;50 to &#163;100  each. In Australia&#39; the price of suitable horses for military purposes would bc from &#163;30 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50.</inline> I think it is assumed that the price would be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30,</inline> and I ask honorable senators whether any man in Australia is likely to pay &#163;20 a year for the hire of a horse that could be purchased  outright  for .&#163;30. No member of the Committee would pay 66 per cent, of the total value of a horse as a yearly rental for the hire of the animal, especially in view of the fact that it must be hired under a condition prescribing that it shall not be used for heavy draught; that it must be stabled, fed, and shod under military regulations and supervision, and be available to the military authorities whenever required. The whole financial basis of the scheme falls to pieces when it is looked at from a business point of view. I do not wish to say that because the financial basis is faulty the proposal must be put out of court without further consideration. I admit, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that it is eminently desirable that we should have a sufficient number of trained horses for the use of the Military Forces. I claim some little knowledge of horses and horse-breeding, and, having read the report very  carefully. I think that the authors of it have confused the desirability of the military authorities owning and training their horses with the question of breeding them. The two questions are quite distinct and should be treated as distinct business propositions. The authors of the report by mixing them up have, to my mind, lessened the value of some of the suggestions they make. </para>

While it is desirable that we should have always available a sufficient number of trained horses, it is not necessary in order to secure them that the Commonwealth should be committed to breeding its own horses for military purposes. </para>

I have said that the matters referred to in the reports have for some time been under the consideration. of the Minister in connexion with the policy affecting the future of the whole of our Military Forces ; but that whatever decision may be arrived at in regard to these particular matters it is not probable that the Government will invite Parliament to make any appropriation in respect of them during the present financial year. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to know whether any provision is made for repairing the existing jetty at Point Nepean or building a new jetty there.  There is a jetty there at present which is used as an alternative landing place in rough weather. Honorable senators may be aware that in time of war our forts would be manned by militia artillery, as we have not a sufficient number of permanent artillery for the purpose. So far as the forts on the Nepean side are concerned, the militia artillery would have to be taken by train to Queenscliff and thence across by boat to the Nepean side. In rough weather it is found impossible at times to land troops at the regular landing place near the Heads, and they used to be landed at a pier further inside the harbor. The pier is now out of repair, and when Minister of Defence, after a visit of inspection, I promised, on the representations of responsible officers who pointed out the vast importance of providing a suitable landing place on the Nepean side in the event of war, that the existing means of landing troops there would be improved. It is a very important work, and one which  would involve an expenditure of less than  &#163;500.  But I do not see any mention of it in these Estimates. Is it concealed in any other item? If not, why has not provision been made for it ? It is idle for us to have men unless we are able to land them at our forts in any weather. I know that the officers of the Department will tell the Minister that it frequently happens, that members of the Permanent Forces cannot be landed at the jetty at Nepean. </para>

In reply, I wish to say that it is not. No provision has been made for it upon these Estimates, and I have no specific information in regard to it. I would suggest to my honorable friend that it is not a difficult matter to point to an isolated work here and there, which it is necessary to undertake. There must be thousands of such works throughout the Commonwealth. But the more urgent of them should certainly be dealt with first ; and in this instance, I presume it is thought that there are more urgent works demanding our attention than that to which the honorable senator has alluded. At the same time, I shall certainly see that his remarks are brought under the notice of the Minister of Defence. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire information in regard to the progress which has been made towards the establishment of a cordite factory. Under the heading of &#34; Victoria,&#34; I note the following item, &#34; Maribyrnong site, buildings and engineering works for cordite factory - towards cost,  &#163;13,801.&#34;  This work, which has been hanging (ire for some time, is, I think, the most necessary of all for defence purposes. It is essential that the Commonwealth should be in a position to manufacture ammunition as fast as it would be required in case of emergency. I should like the Vice-President of the Executive Council to give the Committee some idea of the quantity of ammunition in reserve. My own idea is that we should always have in .reserve  250,000  rifles, with  500  rounds of ammunition for each. It must be recollected that, in case of national emergency, all our able-bodied citizens would be called upon to shoulders rifle. But I have considerable doubt as to whether even a fair proportion of the rifles that would be required under such circumstances is available; and, also as to whether we have a sufficient reserve of ammunition. From what I have been able to gather, I believe that we have not sufficient rifles with which to arm our troops. That position is not at all creditable to the Defence Department. We all know that when war does break out, it will come upon us suddenly, and that our sea communications may be cut, so that we may not be able to obtain weapons from abroad. Whilst we are awaiting the establishment of an ammunition factory and a small-arms factory, it is essential that the Defence Department should be informed that, at whatever cost, sufficient rifles must be made available with which to arm every able-bodied citizen of the Commonwealth, and that sufficient ammunition must be held in reserve to furnish those rifles with an adequate SUPp v. </para>

In addition, the small arms ammunition factory at Footscray is capable of turning out small arms ammunition at a quicker rate than we anticipate we shall require it to be manufactured. It is not intended to import more rifles for the reason that, under the contract entered into for the establishment of a small arms factory at Lithgow, there is an undertaking to manufacture rifles within twelve months. </para>

The expenditure of &#163;500 upon the item &#34; New naval station on River Yarra,&#34; is intended to cover the cost of establishing the naval station there, which is to take the place of the present naval dep&#244;t at Williamstown. </para>

                        <para>. - Under the heading of &#34; Queensland,&#34; I wish to draw attention to the item &#34; Emplacements and works for fixed defences, guns, and lights, &#163;100.&#34; I have it on the best authority that all the guns mounted at Thursday Island are obsolete and, therefore, utterly worthless from the stand-point of their ability to protect the chief gateway ,of Australia. As honorable senators are aware, Thursday Island is located at the north-eastern extremity of Australia, at the entrance to the channel lying between the Great Barrier Reef and the mainland. That reef extends practically along the whole coastline of Queensland. It is very important that the fort which guards one of the principal gate-ways to Australia should be kept in a thoroughly up-to-date condition. Thursday Island is the nearest point to the eastern countries from which danger to Australia is to be apprehended, and any foreign power which obtained possession of it would be able to control the whole of Queensland. By sending a powerful battleship to the southern end of the channel lying inside the Great Barrier Reef it would be possible to bottle-up every ship voyaging along the Queensland coast. Whilst it is right that we should place the defences of our principal harbors in order, it is of even more importance that the defences of the principal gateway to the Commonwealth should be put in a similar condition. Tt has been stated that, owing to the number of Japanese engaged in the pearl shelling industry, the Japanese Government are in possession of complete plans of our reefs, harbors, &#38;c. </para>

The explosion was supposed to have been caused during a drunken spree amongst the garrison, or by coloured men who were assumed to be interested in the destruction of the fortifications. Has any definite information been obtained as to how the explosion occurred? I believe that the Queensland Government offered a reward for the discovery of the perpetrators. Was it really a serious occurrence, and has anything been found out about it since? </para>

                            <para>- The position of affairs thee is peculiar, and shows how necessary it is for the State and Federal authorities to act together when public works are being undertaken. My information is that the Marine Board of Brisbane are cutting a new channel at the mouth of the river, which will practically make the Lytton fort useless. The boats coming into the channel will, I am told, be under fire for a very short while when the new cutting is completed. If that be so, the question arises whether it is worth while to spend more money on the Lytton fort, and whether the guns should not be shifted to another place. Has that consideration been kept in mind? Have the departmental officers made up their mind as to whether it is advisable to spend more money at Lytton ? Obviously we do not desire to spend even&#39; &#163;100 on a fort that will be useless. We do not maintain forts for ornamental purposes. As to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said, I wish to add that the position as to Thursday Island is one of very great seriousness. The garrison there consists of about eighty men. On the same island are some 800 Japanese and other coloured aliens. In fact, there are at Thursday Island more Japanese, many of whom have probably seen military service, than there are armed Britishers. During the Japanese-Russian war, I am assured that the Japanese residents at Thursday Island received full reports of victories of their countrymen, transmitted in cypher messages, before the information was published in the Australian press. Those who have read Japanese military history can have no doubt that amongst the population there are many Japanese officers, members of the Intelligence Corps, and also officers of the active forces. The Japanese have officers, not only in the Commonwealth, but in all parts of the East. In the event of hostilities between Great Britain and an Eastern power, one of the first acts against Australia would probably be the seizure of Thursday Island. There are sufficient coloured aliens there now to overcome the garrison. Thursday Island is a most vital point in- our defences, and the whole position in regard to it is a grave one. </para>

But my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> will understand that matters which involve future policy cannot be dealt with now. I must ask him to wait until the Minister of Defence discloses his policy, as he will shortly do in &#39;the other House. </para>

                            <para>- No provision is made on these Estimates for new guns there. There are many points on the Australian coast which are extremely important, but there is a great deal of leeway to make up, and it is obviously impossible to do all that is requisite in one year. These Estimates are to be taken, not as meeting all the requirements, but as a reasonable step towards making up leeway. </para>

                            <para>- L agree with the honorable senator, lt is now, I believe, proposed to buy from the State Government some land upon which to build new offices. While  1  admit the need for the work, I am of opinion that the land on which it is proposed to erect the offices is inconvenient, and not likely to serve the purposes required. It is a piece facing the road running from King William-street to Frome-road, down by the river, arid close to the present parade ground. It is a triangular piece. I enter my &#39; protest against the land being purchased and used for the purpose in view. The schedule contains an item of ,&#163;180 for drill-halls. Now, it is impossible for the men to drill properly on the present parade ground. At the head-quarters in Adelaide there ought to be an ample drill-hall, and also proper offices for the staff. It is proposed to cover with buildings the piece of. land to which I allude, and in that case a drill-hall will have to be provided in some other part. That in itself will be a great mistake. I believe that another piece of ground was some time ago under offer to the Commonwealth Government for this purpose. As a business transaction the acquisition of that piece would, in my opinion, have proved a good speculation. But whether that be so or not, the site which it is now proposed to use is altogether unsuitable. It would be a mistake to put the offices there. If the purchase has not been actually completed,  1  ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> whether he will consult the Minister of Defence, and induce him to make a personal inspection. If he did, I am sure he would be convinced that a mistake had been made. </para>

                        <para>. - I emphasize what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> The present military offices in Adelaide are fit for nothing. I am surprised at the small amount of money put on the Estimates for this purpose. Of course, the sum of .^,450 may be merely for the purchase qf the land for new buildings. If not. it is quite inadequate. But I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> that the whole question should be reconsidered. I corroborate what he has said as to the unsuitableness of the site. Better sites could certainly be obtained. Even if the Commonwealth Government have paid for the land in question, it &#34;would be better foi them to use it for some other purpose than to erect the military offices there. I take it that the. Ordnance Department would have to be moved to the new site when the offices were shifted. That would mean heavy cartage. The site is a good distance from a railway station, and the ground is hilly. The cartage alone would be expensive. </para>

                        <para>. - When I was Minister of Defence, I inspected the military offices in Adelaide, and I must confess that I felt ashamed to think that the Commonwealth was housing its officers in such a wretched building and under such miserable conditions. But the proposal now made is not a businesslike one. It will simply lead to another re-shuffle in the course of a few years. The Commonwealth has a little parade ground which is shut in by the river, public reserves, public buildings, and the North Adelaide-road. The existing buildings are altogether inadequate, and, therefore, it is proposed to purchase a small triangular block in the situation referred to&#34; on which to build. If that course is taken the Commonwealth will have to utilize every inch of the site in order to get sufficient head-quarters for the present establishment. But what will it be called upon to do when a big establishment has to be provided for ? It will have to erect a tall building like a skyscraper, which is most Unsuitable for military purposes or to build elsewhere. The position in Adelaide is so serious that the best thing which the Government can do is to build straight away on a new site. The Minister certainly should no&#39;t come to a conclusion until he has inspected the ground. On the occasion of mv visit I was shown the various depots. I saw the depot for the army service corps, and the depot for the field artillery. Certainly the latter had sufficient room, but their dep&#244;t was away from the parade ground and head-quarters. As regards the army medical equipment, that branch had a temporary lease of buildings belonging to the Agricultural Society, and a portion of the land with a building had been leased bv that Society to some other body. Our lease was granted on the condition that at a Hay&#39;s notice t&#62;e military authorities could remove. I saw a valuable army medical equipment in a most unsuitable building, because it was built for quite a different purpose. In Adelaide there was a pom-pom section, and in order to house the gun a verandah had to be covered in with a few sheets of galvanized iron. Then the State Medical Department boarded up the doorway in order to provide a &#34; dossing-ground &#34; for a number of indigent persons. The result was that the army medical corps had to reach their store by the grace of the pom-pom section. The officer in charge of the latter refused to give the medical men the keys of his establishment, because, as he said, if anything should be lost or stolen he would be held responsible. On the other hand, the officers of the medical corps could not get to their equipment without his permission. What a beautiful system? The military authorities in South Australia were not to blame for the position, because they had to get in wherever they could. I found that the offices were little buildings without proper ventilation. Four or five clerks had to work under a low ceiling, and in a temperature ranging to over 80 degrees, and that was not during a hot day either. In fact, the accommodation was only large enough for one clerk. The accommodation allotted to the militia officers consisted of a verandah, which had been boarded up and fitted with a door. One could touch the galvanized iron ceiling easily. That is how the Commonwealth encourages the officers on a boiling Saturday afternoon or a hot summer&#39;s night to do work in connexion with the corps. The position, however, will not be improved bv what the Government propose to do. It will simply be a hotch-potch. The offices will still be scattered all over the place, because it will not be possible to find room for the medical equipment on this small block of land. The most which can be done will be to provide room for the officers, but when alterations are being made why not provide not only for the head-quarters staff, but also for the corps establishments and the storage of equipments? The conclusion I came to as the result of my visit was that the Department would have to dispose of the land and secure another site near the city. &#39; There is, however, an alternative. In close proximity to the head-quarters there is a Destitute Asylum. It would pay the Commonwealth if it could induce the State to surrender the area containing the present head-quarters, the police buildings, and the destitute asylum, raze those buildings to the ground, and dispose of the material, and on the compact area thus secured erect buildings to accommodate the army service corps, the field artillery, and the whole of our equipments. If that course were taken we should have a fine parade ground, and the buildings could be- extended whenever necessary. That seems to me a businesslike proposition. It will be unwise to spend a single penny in building on the triangular site. </para>

A little time ago my colleagues and I made some representations to the Minister of Home Affairs, and we were informed that negotiations were pending between the Commonwealth and the State with a view to compulsorily acquiring a site. At a later stage I again interviewed the Minister, and submitted a few questions to him, and he promised to send a memorandum to me, but it has not yet arrived. I desire to know if there is any immediate prospect of the work being started. I hope that native material will be used in its construction. The last building erected for the Commonwealth in Fremantle was a post-office. Tenders were called for erecting the building in brick, with cement facings or Donnybrook stone. I am pleased that the latter&#39; was adopted, as we thus obtained a more substantial building. </para>

                        <para>. - The remarks I made in regard to the Adelaide head-quarters apply in a less degree to the Perth head-quarters. The latter is a more modern building, with larger accommodation at present, but the available land is being rapidly covered with buildings. I would recommend the Minister to ascertain if a more suitable site cannot be obtained in Perth. Western Australia represents a third of this continent, and in the very near future it must contain a very large population. It has, I think, the smallest area in the Commonwealth for a head-quarters site. With its present small force of 3,000 or 4,000 men all told, the buildings are sufficient and can be enlarged to a certain extent, but the time will soon come when, they will be inadequate. There is no parade ground. I would strongly advise the Minister to instruct his officers to keep a lookout for an additional site. I am disappointed at not finding on these Estimates an item for the acquisition of a site at Fremantle for a naval dep6t. When I was Minister there was a report presented by Captain Creswell, who had seen various sites. I think that Captain Tickell has since visited Fremantle to make a further report. I had hoped that the Works Estimates for this year would have included an item. for the acquisition of a site for a naval depot in each State, because that will he necessary if we are to have a local squadron. It will be needed in connexion with the Naval Militia and the ships permanently in commission. If the acquisition of a site is deferred until that course becomes a matter of urgent- necessity, the Commonwealth will have to pay through the nose. I recommend the Minister during the current year to act upon the report in his possession - I know that various sites have been recommended - and if he does I am satisfied that the Commonwealth will save a considerable sum. </para>

                        <para>.- I am very glad that this matter has been brought forward. A little time ago a deputation of Western Australian senators waited upon the Minister of Defence and pointed out to him how useful the Fremantle workshops would be as an adjunct to any naval scheme of defence. The Minister said that he would authorize Captain Tickell, who was then in Western Australia, to inquire into the matter. Captain Tickell went from Albany to Fremantle, inspected the workshops there, and the site where the new dock is being erected. I have received a copy of his report. He, no doubt, made exhaustive inquiries, but on one or two points I venture to differ from his conclusions. He does not think that the workshops at Fremantle could be used for the repair of </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Avar vessels. He points out that in the past trading vessels have always been sent to ports in the eastern States for repairs. The reason for that has been that in the past there has been no dock on the Western Australian coast sufficiently large to accommodate oversea vessels. At the present time the Western Australian Government are engaged in the construction of such a dock, and it will be completed in the near future. They are also erecting a large slip, which might be used for the repair of large vessels. In his report Captain Tickell refers to the machinery at present in the Fremantle workshops, to the fact that iron and steel are not stocked except to a very limited extent, that there is a deficiency both in quantity and assortment, and that this applies also <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> open market in both Perth and Fremantle. When the deputation waited on the Minister &#171;f Defence, they pointed out to him that, although the machinery at present in the workshops in Fremantle is not sufficient for executing repairs to war vessels, the plant could be brought up-to-date by the expenditure of a little money. That has evidently been overlooked by Captain Tickell in his  report.  The report states that there are men and material in the railway workshops. There are boilermakers, engine-fitters, and other craftsmen who could be despatched at short notice from Midland Junction to Fremantle, a distance of 22 miles, when it was necessary to carry out the work of repairs. Apparently all that is necessary is the  spending of a little money to increase the plant at present in Fremantle. I&#34; do not raise this question in any parochial_spirit ; but when it is remembered that there is not a single place along the 2,000 miles of the coastline of Western Australia where a war vessel or a trading vessel of considerable dimensions could put in for repairs, the necessity for establishing a repairing base in that ;State must be obvious. I do not mean to say that we should subdivide our ship-building programme - that we should build one vessel in Sydney, another in Melbourne, and a third at Fremantle - but I do contend that in every State we should establish a base where vessels might run in for necessary repairs. Despite the somewhat unfavorable report presented by Captain Tickell I believe that, with the expenditure of very little money, &#39;Fremantle might be made such a base, and I hope that the head of the Defence Department will give the suggestion further consideration. </para>

It is reported that the fencing is urgently required to keep the public from trespassing on the fort and adjacent land. With respect to the other item referred to, the total estimated cost of the works proposed is &#163;8,000, and of this amount ,&#163;6,000 is now asked for. I have here a lengthy report on the proposed works which the honorable senator may see later. </para>

                        <para>. - I notice that provision is made in the schedule for many works connected with the Post and Telegraph Department in South Australia that are urgently required ; but I see no provision made for any improvement in connexion with the postal arrangements at -Murray Bridge. I should be glad if Ministers would look into the complaint which has been repeatedly made, as to the inadequacy and inconvenience of the arrangements for carrying on the business of the post-office at that place. The work of the office is at present carried on in the railway station. It was at one time proposed that, as the local State school had become altogether too small to meet present requirements, the building might be taken over by the Commonwealth and used as a post-office. That would probably have been a very good arrangement to make. Another post-office which I should like to mention, and to which there is no reference in the schedule, is that at Balaklava. The building used as a post-office there is about the most disgraceful building that disfigures any town in South Australia. Balaklava is a growing and a prosperous town. In proof of that statement, I may say that in the last year two of the principal banks have erected very fine buildings there in which to carry on their business. The present building has been in existence for perhaps thirty years. There is a sitting-room in it 11 feet square, out of which 4 doors open. The dining-room is a little larger, but there are 2 bed-rooms, each 11 feet by 9 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> feet; and the kitchen is a galvanized iron shed with a stove placed in it. There is not a sound room in the building, and the cracks in it let in the daylight. The miserable condition of the place has been complained of over and over again. In 1900 the letters passing through this post-office numbered 139,743. In 1908 the number had grown to 296,496, whilst for the first half of the current financial year the number has mounted up  to no less than  160,314.  Notwithstanding this wonderful increase in the volume of business, there has been no improvement in the accommodation provided. The number of telegrams handled in  1906  was  7,126,  and the number handled last year was  8,606,  an increase of  1,580  in two years. The telephone revenue shows a satisfactory rate of increase; but I should like to mention that while it used to be said that little boys should be seen and not heard, a man using the telephone at this office is not seen, but everything he says can be heard. I wish that Ministers would look into these matters. The condition of affairs at Balaklava has some bearing upon the management of the Department. A man may be offered promotion in the Department, and in view of the volume of business transacted it might be suggested that he should be transferred to Balaklava ; but if he has a family he is unable to take advantage of such an offer of promotion because the accommodation at the office is so limited. I do not know whether the Government desire to discourage the increase of population in South Australia, but certainly they offer no inducement in the opposite direction to a man who wishes to conduct a post-office there. Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council see whether something cannot be done with a view to modifying this evil? I intend to interview the Postmaster-General upon the subject. Some alteration of the present system must be effected. It is not fair to the Department that an officer should be housed in miserable quarters, nor is it fair to the public that they should be subjected to the inconvenience to which they have to submit at the present time. </para>

                        <para>. - Under the heading of &#34;Western Australia&#34; there is an item of  &#163;5,000  upon these Estimates for the purchase of sites for post-offices. I should like the Vice-President of the Executive Council to say whether he is satisfied with the system which is at present adopted in connexion with the acquisition of land for Common wealth purposes. In several instances which have come to my knowledge, the prices paid by the Commonwealth for land have been quite exorbitant. Recently, in Tasmania, the amount asked for the purchase of a rifle range was an outrageous one. I understand, too, that no less than  &#163;100  per acre was demanded for the purchase of land at Eucla. The sum of  &#163;5,000  seems a large one for us to vote in connexion with the purchase of postal sites, and if the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act is not working satisfactorily it is high time that we amended it with a view to enabling the Government to acquire land at reasonable prices in lieu of the exorbitant prices which it has hitherto been required to pay. It would be interesting to the Committee to learn whether the Commonwealth is getting a fair deal. </para>

                        <para>. - Whether or not the Commonwealth is getting a fair deal in this matter is, after all, merely a question of opinion. One man may think that it is, whilst another may hold a different opinion. But I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that there are two methods by which the Commonwealth may acquire land. The first is by purchase, and the second by acquisition under our Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act. It frequently happens that officers of the Department think it advisable that the Commonwealth should pay a trifle more for land than it is honestly worth, rather than that it should be compelled to incur the cost which would be incidental to the acquisition of the land under the Act which I have mentioned. It then becomes a question for a business man to balance the advantages of adopting the course which I have outlined against its disadvantages. But after allowing for the difficulties which assert themselves whenever the Government enter the market as a purchaser of land, I believe that our officers are getting for the Commonwealth as good value as is possible. </para>

This matter has been before the Department for a considerable time. I have interviewed the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of South Australia in reference to it, as- has also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Livingstone.</inline> I understand that there are about 10 or 11 miles of telegraph wire required to make the necessary connexion. The former Deakin Government asked the settlers interested to guarantee the Department against loss if the undertaking were carried out. That guarantee was forthcoming, and as a result the Government received ,&#163;24 in cash. But, notwithstanding that, they have done nothing whatever towards carrying out the work. I think that Snowtown has now been connected by telephone. But for a considerable time that work was hung up in the same way. The reason &#39; assigned was the difficulty of obtaining the necessary, funds. The  Deputy  Postmaster-General of South Australia informed me that the work would prove a remunerative one, but his difficulty was that he had not the &#163;6 which were required to make the requisite connexion. In one instance the Government could not carry out the work because they lacked <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6,</inline> and in the other they did not undertake it notwithstanding that they held a guarantee from the settlers of .&#163;24. Surely it is absurd that a  Deputy  Postmaster-General should be placed in the position that was occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Waddy.</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">The reply which I received was that definite information would be given when the Budget had been delivered. At the beginning of the present session I again put a similar question. The reply that I received was, &#34; You will be informed when the Budget speech is delivered.&#34; I see that .&#163;10,000 is allocated for the purpose of wireless- telegraphy on the present schedule. &#39; It is only a small amount, tout I should like to see it spent. The time is ripe for the erection of stations for this purpose. Had we had wireless telegraphy stations on the Australian coast it is possible that we might have been able to discover the whereabouts of the vessel which it would seem is now unfortunately drifting in some part of the Indian cr Southern Ocean. It has been said by engineers that possibly the engineers on the <inline font-style="italic">Waratah</inline> would have been able to rig up a wireless telegraphy arrangement by means of which we could have received messages had there been receiving stations on the coast. But apart from that consideration, it is quite evident that delay cannot any longer be excused. I hope that the Government will give serious attention to the matter, and will not simply place &#163;10,000 on the Estimates with the intention of doing nothing. </para>

A vote for that purpose has been on the Estimates for some years. The time has now arrived when the Government should make up their minds as to what system they intend to adopt. Hitherto they have been in a state of uncertainty. The Orient Steam- ship Company are waiting to erect a wireless telegraphy system on their vessels, but cannot act until they know what system the Commonwealth intends to adopt. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government have made protestations to the effect that they are fully alive to the lack of equipment which is hampering the Defence Force, and we are told that in this Bill they are making due and proper provision for that purpose. I have before me the Appropriation (Works and Buildings Act) for  1907-8,  and I propose to compare the expenditure in that year with that provided for in the present Bill. In  1907-8  the amount appropriated was  , &#163;186,050.  The amount appropriated in this Bill for the same purpose is  &#163;121,000.  This is the division in which, if any provision is being made for the equipment of the Forces we should find the details. Yet we find the Government spending this year  &#163;41,000  less than was spent in  1907-8. </para>

                            <para>- It is admitted by the Government themselves that the Forces are lacking in equipment, and it was stated in  1907-8  that an attempt was then being made to bring the equipment up to date. Let me compare the items. No one can say that the accoutrements and equipment of our Forces are up to date. We have practically no transport equipment. If cur troops had to take the field to-morrow we should have to commandeer all sorts of unsuitable vehicles. </para>

                            <para>- I am assuming an honest interpretation. Only  &#163;14,000  is proposed to foe spent on accoutrements. For waggons, harness, saddlery, and equipment for the field artillery &#163;10,200 is proposed to be spent. In 1907-8 the expenditure was &#163;29,000. The field artillery is by no means properly equipped. More waggons are needed, more harness, and more equipment of every kind. The Government propose to spend  &#163;6,000  on camp equipment. In 1907-8 we voted &#163;8,000. Yet at the last Easter encampment a number of members of rifle clubs in various States offered to go into camp and could not be accommodated. I myself approached some of the rifle associations and persuaded them to induce their members to go into camp. They were agreeable, but it was found that a difficulty arose because we had not sufficient tents, frying pans, and billy cans for them. Yet this Government say that they are taking steps to equip the Military Forces. On account of miscellaneous expenditure the Government ask for an increase. Last year the money voted for this purpose was only a little over what was sufficient to pay for contracts entered into. On Martini Lee-Enfield Rifles the expenditure in 1907-8 was &#163;20,000. This year it is proposed to spend &#163;4,250. On bayonets in 1907-8 we spent &#163;18.750. It is true that it is proposed to spend &#163;20,000 this year ; but the total expenditure on this provision in 1907-8 was &#163;104,050 less &#163;24,050, which was unspent in the previous year, leaving a net total of about &#163;80,000. as compared with &#163;78,150, which is the amount set down for special Defence material in the schedule now before us; and on the remaining division &#163;52,000 was voted as compared with &#163;121,000on this occasion. From these figures honorable senators will recognise, I think, that the Government&#39;s claim that they are making an extensive provision of equipment is not borne out by the facts. </para>

At thes same time,  the Government feel that, sooner or later, it is desirable that the Commonwealth should acquire offices in London. This amount has been placed on the Estimates, not in regard to a specific area, or to specific negotiations, but in order that, should a site be brought under their attention, the Government may be armed with the authority of Parliament for entering into negotiations with the owner. At the same time, I wish it to be distinctly understood that in no sense will this vote commit the Government to any arrangement without Parliament first being consulted. </para>

I do not think that this vote will authorize the expenditure of any money for the renting of offices in London. </para>

                    <para>. - When the debate on the Budget was adjourned on Friday last, I was contrasting the proposals mentioned in the Ministerial statement with the provision made in the Budget for carrying them out. I say that apparently the Government do not intend to make the necessary financial arrangements to give effect to the proposals they have made. I wish now to speak of the provision made for the payment of old-age pensions, and the methods adopted in the administration of the Act. To-day the Vice-President of the Executive Council gave an answer to a question put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> with respect to the&#39; extraordinary delay in. dealing with applications for pensions presented in Western Australia. Whilst I admit that the answer disclosed some progress, I would still ask honorable senators whether they can regard  it as satisfactory ? We all appreciate the difficulties in the way, but the methods adopted by the Government for overcoming them cannot commend themselves to the Senate, or any other body of intelligent men. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act came into operation on 1st July last. We are now in the month of September, and during the whole of the interval the officers charged with the administration of the Act in Western Australia have been able to deal with only 358 applications out of a total of nearly 1,700. It is difficult to imagine a more clumsy method of administration than that under which Commonwealth officials require all this time to deal with 350 applications for old-age pensions. In the answer given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to-day we were invited to believe that the delay has arisen because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding Western Australian applications. It is said that because many of the applicants have resided at some time or another in Queensland, or in some of the other eastern States, delay in the settlement of their claims has been inevitable. But surely there should now be no difficulty in communicating with every branch of the public Departments throughout Australia in one day. The officials have the use of our telegraphic and telephonic systems. I understand that these services are fairly well equipped, and, if they are not, something should be done to bring them up to the requirements of the public. A great deal of dissatisfaction has arisen from the delay in dealing with applications in Western Australia, and the conclusions arrived at in connexion with some of them require to be reconsidered. I hope it is not the intention of the Government to attempt to save money from the provision set apart for the payment of old-age pensions by delaying their payment, or by reducing the amounts paid as pensions in certain cases. I am, however, disposed to think that there is something in the suggestion, and I might mention some particular cases in support of that view. I mentioned one or two cases the other day, and I intend now to mention the case of an old man who has been a sailor, and a ship&#39;s captain. I do not blame the Government for what has been done in this case, but that some one is to blame there can be no doubt; and I wish the Government to find out who is responsible for the decision that has been arrived at, and to have the matter rectified at once. The man to whom I refer is seventy years of age, and has resided in Australia for most of that time. He is the owner of a boat and lives on the sea.  His  boat is his only home; he sleeps and has his food on it, &#39; and to insist that he should sleep ashore would be like sentencing him to twelve months in gaol. In answer to questions he admitted that the value of his boat is about &#163;25, and I am informed that because he owns it and lives in the way I have described, the officials have decided to reduce his pension by about1s. 6d. per week. I feel sure that the Government will not consent to the adoption of measures of that kind with a view to saving money to enable them to give effect to proposals outlined in the Ministerial statement. Between 1,200 and 1,300 applications for old-age pensions have yet to be dealt with in Western Australia. If the Government have not a sufficient staff of officers employed to deal with them promptly, there are many men who might be employed for the purpose, and only those who are prepared to do what is fair to our old people should be so employed. If the work were carried out expeditiously as it ought to be, with the staff of officers at the disposal of the Government, the balance of the Western Australian applications should be dealt with during the next seven or eight days. I propose to refer briefly to another matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> addressed himself at some length. Honorable senators who represent Western Australia have noticed that there is no reference whatever in the Budget to a work which has occupied a great deal of the attention of the people of that State since the accomplishment of Federation. I refer to the proposed railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. It is true that a statement was made in another, place that a survey of the line has been made. But the Government have not explained how it is possible to utilize a railway survey for the conveyance of people and goods from one place to another. It would appear that the Government have enforced silence upon <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest in regard to this matter. </para>

I maintain that a railway ought to be viewed from the same stand -point as an hotelkeeper views his elevator. He does not pause to consider whether the installation of an elevator will pay. He instals it for the convenience of his customers. Now, a &#39;railway is simply a means of horizontal locomotion. Why should we not build this transcontinental line for the purpose of developing the country through which it will pass? However, I am not anxious to prolong this discussion. I wished to direct attention to the absence of any reference in the Budget to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. I also desired to say a few words on the question of old-age pensions; Having done both these things, I think that I have discharged my duty. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Personally, I am prepared to sanction the construction of that line out of loan money. I have sufficient confidence in the project to believe that within a very short period of its completion, it would prove a remunerative undertaking, but above all else it would be a connecting link between Western Australia and the eastern States, which would make Federation a reality. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has done a gross injustice to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. The latter gentleman throughout his public career has done everything in his power to insure the construction of that line, and it is unfair to question his sincerity in the matter. It&#39; is easy to attack him for not having done that which it was impossible for him to do- in the time at his disposal since the survey of the line was completed. Ever since this session opened, honorable senators opposite have been accusing the Government of insincerity in regard to the public works which they have outlined. Yet they have done their utmost to prevent those works from being carried out without the Commonwealth resorting to a borrowing policy. I do not credit them with being in earnest in this connexion. No reasonable man can believe that we can construct the transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, that we can take over and develop the Northern Territory, and build  a Federal Capital, without resorting to a  loan policy. I believe that this country can only he developed to its proper capacity by that means. I am not frightened by such a project.. As long as we can borrow at a fair rate of interest, and spend the money in the interests of the Commonwealth at large, it will be beneficial to the whole of the States to do so. I recognise that the States themselves have done their share in the development of this country.. They have spent immense sums of money. They would never have been the success they undoubtedly are at present except they had borrowed.. I believe that, as a people, we are the richest and the happiest on the face of the earth. We should never have attained to such a state of prosperity had not the States boldly tackled the difficulties facing them by raising money. and this they have done, at fair rates of interest. Their policy in that respect has been abundantly justified, from a commercial point of view, by the investments1 they have made. </para>

                        <para>- There is no necessity to do so. But if honorable senators tell me that they would not borrow money unless they could see ways of spending it that would be remunerative from a commercial point of view, I reply that by so doing they would set back the prosperity of this country for many years. I cannot understand how such views can be entertained by gentlemen who, I am sure, are as anxious as I am to promote the interest* of the Commonwealth. But, the shibboleth of &#34;no borrowing&#34; has been dinned into their ears &#39; to such an extent that they have ceased to reason on the subject. Yet if they had continued to hold the Government benches, they would have had to borrow money. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard members of the caucus party object, and have read in the newspapers which represent their views, time after time, objections to Commonwealth borrowing. They object to raising any money by that means except where they can say that the investment would pay at once. I wish to say a word or two as to defence, but I realize that until the return of the representative of the Government from England it would scarcely be prudent for me to advocate a large expenditure of money for this purpose. I trust, however, that the Government will seriously consider the immediate requirements of Australia from a military and naval point of view. Personally, I attach very great importance to the establishment of a school of education for military and naval officers. Such a school is absolutely necessary if we are to undertake seriously the responsibility of defending this country. There are large numbers of young men who would be only too pleased to devote their lives to the service of their country in a naval or military capacity if they could secure the means of education in some such training school as the West Point Academy of America, or the military colleges of England, Germany, or France. Almost every great military leader of distinction, from Napoleon down to Grant and Sherman - with the exception, perhaps, of Wellington - was educated at a military college. General Sherman, who was one of the  ablest of American soldiers, once said he could scarcely imagine any country becoming a great military power that did not have its officers educated in a military establishment. </para>

                        <para>- There are exceptions to all rules. In Australia, we have many able officers commandking our troops-. Many of them have served in the British Army. Those who have sons, and desire that they should follow in their footsteps, would be glad to have them educated at a military college if such an establishment were founded in this country. There are hundreds of families in Australia whose sons would willingly train themselves for service in the Military Forces if we afforded facilities. At the present moment our army is under-officered to the extent of at least 30 per cent ; and as for the navy, we have not a single institution in Australia at which a man could learn the simple A B C of the service. Is it sensible of us to spend large sums of money on military and naval defence while we take no steps to found educational establishments for the training of officers? I also desire to urge upon the Government that we ought to have established a repair- &#39; ing dockyard. This is one of the first necessities in connexion with defence. We ought to have the means by which any ship coming to Australia could be effectively and promptly repaired. I look upon the present time as one of the most serious in Australian history. When the news was flashed from England that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition both considered that there was ground for uneasiness. I realized that, although our shores have been protected by the Mother Country for over a century, we must now set our house in order in view of the grave factors with which we are confronted. The reasons which actuate the Mother Country in enlarging her means of defence apply equally to Australia. When we recall what the Old Country has done in an Imperial sense; when we remember the blessings which she has brought to all civilized races under her sway ; when we recollect how the empires of old, instead of showering blessings upon the communities they conquered, acted as tyrants, and narrowed down every privilege ; when we recall what Spain, Italy, and other countries did in that regard, I think that the time has come when all Australians must acknowledge that it is their duty to make sacrifices, and probably severe sacrifices, if we desire to retain the privileges and advantages hitherto found under the British flag. I trust that our people will rise to the occasion. The Government should show that they also, as custodians of the interests of the public, are prepared to rise to the occasion and to do promptly whatever may be necessary to defend the interests of the British Empire. </para>

At that time, there was no one who could coolly, and, if I may use the term, unselfishly define what we should or should not do. We understood that the power of England was being threatened. We learned that the supremacy of the Navy upon which the British people depended was challenged. We learned that a great military and naval power was working day and night to construct ships to wrest from England her control of the seas. When that news was cabled to us, we felt that it was our duty to give credence to the statements of the representatives of the people of the Old Country. We realized that such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour,</inline> cold-blooded and strong-headed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> one of the ablest men in England, would not have spoken as they did in the House of Commons unless they had felt that danger to the might of England was threatened. </para>

                        <para>- Those men represented the English people in Parliament. Does the honorable senator think that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> were to suddenly cable to the British Government the news that Australia was in danger, British people would stop to consider whether it was wise to do this thing or that thing? No; they would rise as one people and say at once, &#34; We must act, and act &#34;promptly, to prevent such a calamity from happening to a country like Australia, a country which, so far, has done little to defend herself, but which is prepared to do so when the necessity arises.&#34; I hurl back with scorn the suggestion that the two great parliamentary leaders in England are so weak and so dominated by selfishness that they would give publicity to news simply for the purpose of achieving political gain. </para>

I did not enthuse in the sense of subscribing any money, or of immediately acceding to the proposal, because I believed that the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> should come as a gift from the whole people of the Commonwealth. But for any one to tell me that they did not respond to the views of the English people in what they then believed to be an hour of danger, is to tell me that we, in Australia, are not dominated by English sentiment. </para>

                        <para>-I believe that the factor which actuates our honorable friends opposite is a purely political one. I am pleased to think that there is very little of that factor animating the unionists themselves. In my opinion, the people of Australia are absolutely loyal. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was loyal when he sent his message to the Old Country, but, in my judgment, he did not rise to the occasion. Since that time he has had a very feeble following. He has received very little of that real encouragement which should be extended by the followers of a leader. Why ? Is the danger to-day any less than it was when the cable news was received? I do not think so. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that in the case of Canberra there will be a sufficient supply of pure water to meet the requirements of a population of 200,000. There is no probability of the capital of Australia containing so large a population during the next century. If honorable senators are really in earnest on this subject the question of water supply need not trouble them or their children, or their children&#39;s children. </para>

                        <para>- I appeal to honorable senators if I did not mention the caucus. I am as strongly against it as ever I was, and I intend to fight it at the elections. 1 shall not mince matters then, because I believe that the&#39; caucus is the greatest curse to Australia. It is neither more nor less than a political autocracy. The caucus has no direct authority from the people. It stands between the people and their Parliament. Honorable senators opposite must obey the caucus, and are not directly responsible to the people as they ought to be, in accordance with the constitutional practice to which we have been accustomed for hundreds of years. I have said that . I shall be prepared to fight the caucus as vigorously as I can. </para>

                    <para>. - When the present Government took office we were assured that at last we had a strong Government with a united and strong following of their own, in a position to really control the affairs of the country, and to assume responsibility for definite action without waiting for the permission of any other section in Parliament. We were led to believe that the Fusion Government would be strong enough to restore to the Commonwealth what is euphoniously referred to as &#34; responsible government.&#34; We were invited to believe that they would propose no shilly shallying policy, but would devote their attention to putting the affairs of Australia on a footing so sound that it could not be questioned by anybody. We were told that it was necessary that a strong Government should be established at such an important juncture in our history, when the permanent financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States required to be determined. But what are the financial proposals of the Government? After being in labour for so long, this strong Government has given birth to an abortion - a miserable monstrosity. I am fully justified in stigmatizing in this way the financial proposals of this Fusion Government, which we were told would restore responsible government in Australia. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth we are face to face with a deficit, and the Government calmly propose that to meet it we should pay a visit to Uncle Cohen and his pawn shop. Though other means of meeting the deficit might easily have been availed of, the Government ask us to authorize them to pay a visit to Uncle Cohen, and put the resources of&#34; Australia. further &#34; up the spout.&#34; We have had six borrowing authorities in Australia, and their accumulated indebtedness now amounts in round figures to &#163;250,000,000. In view of the fact that the works on which this borrowed money has been expended do not return anything like the amount the taxpayers of Australia have to pay in interest, it is of no use for any one to say that the whole of the money borrowed by the States has been expended on reproductive works. It has not. Looking through the Budget figures, I find that not only do the Government make no provision for necessary expenditure beyond the proposed borrowing expedient, but that they propose to continue the starvation of Commonwealth services in a degree never before contemplated. Hitherto we have been told that defence is our greatest responsibility, but the present Government make no adequate provision for it. The late Labour Government, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> proposed for new works and new services in connexion with the Defence Department an additional expenditure of &#163;1,150,000 for the current financial year. The present Government propose a total increase of expenditure on the Defence Department of only &#163;557,000. In addition to the increased expenditure of &#163;1,150,000 which the Fisher Government proposed for new works and services in connexion with the Defence Department, they proposed an increased expenditure of some &#163;300,000 to render the existing services more efficient, making a total increased expenditure of about &#163;1,500,000. They proposed, as a matter of fact, to make some reasonable provision to meet the requirements of Australian defence. The present Government have some idea of spending an additional amount on naval defence, but we are unable to discuss the matter, because we are not acquainted with their proposals. I think that every one must admit that the proposed increase of &#163;557,000 in defence expenditure would not be sufficient even to place the existing service upon a really effective footing. Of the total proposed increased expenditure of&#163;557,000, &#163;163,000 is for the new cadet scheme. I do not cavil at that, because I believe the money would be well spent in the way proposed. But if that amount be deducted from the total increase proposed very little is left for the main body of our Defence Force. While it is desirable, and even necessary, that our youth should undergo a course of physical training, and when they are more matured a course of military drill, we cannot rely upon a cadet force to sup- . ply our immediate needs in the matter of defence. I need not refer at greater length to the proposals of the present Government in connexion with defence, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who has given a great deal of attention to the question, has put the views of the party to which I belong wry fully before the Senate. I would, however, urge upon the Government the absolute necessity of placing the existing forces on an effective footing, and of providing a full reserve of arms and ammunition with which to arm the people of Australia in case of need. I deprecate strongly the adoption of any penurious policy in connexion with our national defence. </para>

I repeat that an expenditure of about  &#163;1,500,000  is necessary to place the Postal Department on a satisfactory basis, but the Government have not made&#39; provision for the expenditure of a single shilling in that connexion. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator had better ask his leader. It was the Government of which the present Prime Minister was the head which appointed that Commission. Probably the Minister of Trade and Customs can tell him why it was appointed. &#39; But no matter why it was appointed; there should be no going back when once the first step has been taken to institute a reform &#62;n any Department. For years the officers of the Postal Department have been pointing out the iniquity of the system which is in vogue under which certain favoured individuals receive services which arc enormously in excess of those for which they pay. For instance, under the existing system, a man receiving a service which is worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> per year is called upon to pay no more than is the individual who is supplied with a service which is worth only &#163;5 per year. To declare that every person shall pay for the services rendered to him just in proportion to their value is an eminently sane proposition. We know that certain firms in this city do not pay the Department more than a tithe of the cost of the services which they receive. </para>

                        <para>- It is an argument in favour of persons being called upon to pay in proportion to the value of the services rendered to them. If that system were adopted, instead of having a deficit in this Department we should probably have a surplus, and in addition we should be able to extend telephonic facilities very considerably. My sympathies are entirely with the residents of our back country who are denied the advantages that are conferred by such facilities. But at the present time the more we extend the telephone service the more we lose upon it. </para>

If the Department were properly organized the more its services were extended the more we would be able to cheapen those services. But owing to existing conditions a great many persons are deprived of the conveniences which they ought to enjoy. &#39; The present Government desire to perpetuate this state of things. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. Of course, I do not know whether the honorable senator is receiving a large or a small service, but under the scheme which was formulated by the Fisher Government the larger users of the telephone would have paid just in proportion to the amount of benefit they received, and to the work which the Department did for them. At present, however, the small man who uses the telephone to a trifling extent is called upon to pay just as much as is the large user. It is an absolutely iniquitous system, and I am astonished at a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> defending it. </para>

                        <para>- That is all humbug, and the honorable senator does not know what he is talking about. The facts are as I stated them, and it will be within the province of any honorable senator to get up afterwards and put a contrary view of the case if he can. I am content to allow the facts to speak for themselves. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> cannot deny that we are losing a large amount of money on the telephone system at present. Is it a fair thing that the general taxpayers, who are mainly poor people, should contribute large sums of money to .make good the deficiency on a service which is used mainly by rich people? Because it is not the poor people who enjoy the telephone service most. If one goes through the residential parts of Melbourne and Sydney one sees that it is not the poor men&#39;s houses that are connected by telephone. </para>

                        <para>- I am absolutely sure o.f it. Look at the row that was kicked up in Melbourne when the Fusion Government took office. The rich people thought that at last they had in office a Government which could be squeezed, and they made an immense noise about the telephone rates. They objected to being charged for services in accordance with value received. It is time that this Parliament made up its mind that the telephone service shall be placed upon a business-like footing. Every service rendered to every individual should be paid for according to its full value, and the general taxpayer should not be called upon to make good any deficiency. I do not want to see any profit made out of the post and telephone services ; but the Department should be put on such a footing that it will pay its way, and we should be able to extend such conveniences to a much greater extent. Under the present system that can never be done. Even admitting the figures of the Minister of Trade and Customs, there is at least a shortage of . <inline font-style="italic">&#163;</inline> 1,000, 000  which ought to be made up this year on the telephone service, in order to put it on a business footing. If we add that to the  &#163;2,000,000  for the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> we have  &#163;3,000,000  for which this Government has made no provision. </para>

                        <para>- Some nations live long, and others are comparatively short-lived ; but whether our life as a nation be long or short, it is the duty of Australia to make herself as independent, as self-supporting, and as self-respecting as possible. We have borrowed too much already. We have spent borrowed money on ephemeral works. We have not paid back a shilling, although the buildings are all .gone. We have borrowed to put up telephone and telegraph poles. The poles have been eaten by white ants, and we still owe the money. Do honorable senators approve of that system? </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Parliament has also made humanitarian provision for paying old-age pensions. Everybody approves of that legislation, or professes to do so. But there is no justification for posing as being sympathetic to persons who are permanently incapacitated unless we are prepared to put our hands in our pockets and pay the cost of the system. What provision has this Government made for invalid pensions? &#39; Not a single farthing. It is estimated that such pensions would, from the start, cost about &#163;250,000 a year. The Government has ignored that obligation. Furthermore, although honorable senators opposite profess themselves to be in favour of old-age pensions, they ignore the fact that the party to which I belong had to drive them into that belief. We were denounced for years because we advocated old age pensions. </para>

                        <para>- I am stating facts which are within everybody&#39;s knowledge. I regret that no provision for such a beneficent and philanthropic object as invalid pensions has not been provided by the Government. I do not believe that this Parliament would have refused the money, and it is regrettable that the Government&#39; had not the courage to assume the responsibility. The Government are submitting to Parliament proposals for taking over the Northern Territory ; they have not made a single penny of provision for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to do so. I contend that the Commonwealth on assuming responsibility for all the debt on account of the Territory, should be left absolutely unhampered in its plans for future development, just as every State was left unhampered with respect to the development of its land when self-government was granted. If we are hampered, we shall not have proper control. Again, the Government have provided only  &#163;5,000  for the settlement of the Federal Capital site question. </para>

                        <para>- It is not nearly enough. If the Government had asked for &#163;100,000, that would not have been too much if they really meant business. I do not profess to be in the secrets of the Government, and do not know whether they are in earnest or not ; but I have strong reasons for believing that a few members of the present Cabinet would like the matter to be shelved for another ten years ; and  1  believe that  1  am looking hard at one of those Ministers when I say so. </para>

                        <para>- When we were discussing the Lighthouses Bill a day or two ago, the Minister stated that in various parts of Australia a good many lighthouses were required. Will he tell me now that adequate provision is made for supplying them ? No, he cannot do so, because he knows that it would not be a fact. Therefore, I am quite  justified  in stating that no adequate provision is made for dealing with this important matter, either. The appointment of a High Commissioner will, I believe, cause another shortage of &#163;10,000, because, although it is provided in a Bill before an other place that the position is to carry a salary of  &#163;3,000  with a provision of &#163;2,000 for a residence, yet no provision has been made to maintain a High Commissioner in London if one is appointed. I do not think that we can reasonably expect to have a High Commissioner&#39;s office fully equipped and carried cut efficiently at less than &#163;1 0,000 a year. Will the representative of the Government point out to me where in the Estimates adequate provision is made for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- The Government do not think it necessary to provide any money when they can always run to their &#34; uncle.&#34; But that is not the way in which I want to see the affairs of the Commonwealth conducted. The institution of an Agricultural Bureau is also proposed, but that is  not  provided for in the Estimates. If the Government are sincere and earnest in all these propositions, why do they not make the necessary provision ? Are all these services to be carried out for nothing? What is the use of the Government saying that they are desirous of passing legislation in favour of this, that, and the other, if they do not make proper -provision for carrying out their desire? There are at least 100 other items of omission which I could point out if I had time, but I do not wish to delay the Senate unnecessarily by referring to all of them in detail. I should say that, instead of a shortage  of  &#163;1,200,000 which the Government admit, the shortage would approach  &#163;5,000,000  if all the services I hare named were adequately provided for. There is no such provision made. Yet in spite of that fact the Government propose that in order to make good the services of the year we should borrow &#163;1, 200,000. I need hardly say that a proposition of that sort does not meet with my approval. In fact it will receive my strongest opposition, because I believe that there is no necessity for a young country  to  resort to borrowing. We are enjoying  a  period of prosperity which is perhaps unexampled in our history, and the outlook for the future is fairly prosperous. At this juncture especially there is no possible excuse for the Government going to the pawn office for  &#163;1,200,000  to cover current expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government were sincere in all their professions in regard to the services they want to institute - and I have enumerated some of the sums involved - the deficiency in their revenue would be nearly that much instead of  &#163;1,200,000.  In my estimate of  &#163;5,000,000  I include  &#163;2,000,000  for a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and at least  &#163;1,000,000  to put the postal, telegraphic and telephonic services in a state of efficiency. That, I think, the honorable gentleman will have to admit is necessary. These two items, to start with, total  &#163;3,000,000.  There are innumerable other things which I have referred to, and which will cost a great deal. The payment of invalid pensions will require from  &#163;250,000to &#163;300,000.  If the Government were sincere when the Bill was passed, surely they intended to give effect to its provisions. </para>

                        <para>- It is the Government who want us to pawn our properties for the purpose. The late Deakin Government and the late Fisher Government, between them, made a provision of about  &#163;650,000  for the payment of old-age pensions, so that the total receipts for this year will be supplemented by that amount. Although  &#163;650,000  is brought forward from the previous year, yet the Government coolly propose to borrow  &#163;1,200,000  in order to cover the year&#39;s expenditure. What sort of a position shall we be in by-and-by if we start in that way? This country is well able to bear all the taxation required in order to meet the current expenditure, and it would be infinitely more self-respecting and statesmanlike to levy additional taxation than to borrow. The latter is a Micawber-like policy, which will not meet with the approval or respect of anybody. There is not a single farthing set down on the Estimates for the development of the Northern Territory; but as we are told that the agreement for its transfer to the Commonwealth is not likely to be accepted - I do not know whether the authority is good or not - probably it does not matter. </para>

                        <para>- Not upon the terms on which we are asked to accept its transfer. At any rate, I assume that in the future it will be acquired by the Common- wealth on some terms which may be arranged; but we have no information from the Government as to how the transfer should be financed, or as to what provision will be made for developing the Territory. It is also coolly proposed that the Commonwealth should undertake the building of two transcontinental railways, one from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, and the other from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. No provision - not even, a reference - is made in the Budget to meet any of these future requirements, so that we do not know the ideas of the Government in respect of them. I believe that we shall have to meet very much larger requirements in the future in connexion with obligations which already exist. Old-age pensions, and probably invalid pensions, will require a great deal more money. Yet we look in vain to the Government for either light or leading on these very important matters. I listened with a great deal of pleasure to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline> eloquent denunciation of the caucus. Yet I believe that he approves of the secret caucus of Premiers which met lately in order to settle the affairs of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- We do not know what views a single member of the caucus expressed or what arguments were brought forward. They arrived at a certain resolution which the Government have chucked upon the table of the Senate and asked it to swallow. I do not intend to swallow anything of the kind. I desire to point out why I think the Parliament would not be wise in adopting the suggestion of the &#39;Conference, because, although some of the Premiers have openly boasted that they have settled the matter, I insist upon treating their resolution as a mere suggestion. That is all that it is, and that is how it should be regarded by this Parliament. In plain language, the whole result of that secret caucus of Premiers has been that they now ask the Commonwealth Parliament to agree to an amendment of the Constitution which will insure to the States a return of 25s. per head of their population for all time from the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth. I shall not discuss the merits or demerits of the proposal, except in regard to the suggestion that the payment should be continued in perpetuity. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators know that it is a very difficult matter to alter the Constitution. If a vote of the majority of the electors were all that was required to secure an alteration of the. Constitution, my objection to the proposal would be very much minimized. Honorable senators know that there must be a majority vote, not only of the electors, but of the States, to carry a proposed alteration of the Constitution ; and if the agreement were embodied in the Constitution, three of the smallest of the States, with about one-sixth of the total population of the Commonwealth, could prevent any revision of it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what they have said, but what they have said or left unsaid does not influence me in the slightest degree. I say that I consider it absolutely demoralizing that one authority should be responsible for raising money, whilst another should have the spending of it without responsibility. Honorable senators opposite must agree that such a state of affairs can only lead to extravagance and recklessness in government. How can they suggest that the Commonwealth should be responsible for raising  25s.  per head of the population for all time in order that the State Governments may have the pleasure of spending that revenue? If the present Commonwealth Tariff is to have the effect which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and others of us who believe in a Protectionist policy expect that it will have, our revenue from Customs and Excise must decrease rather than increase. </para>

                        <para>- That is according to the American experience. It is anticipated that our revenue from Customs and Excise during the current financial year will amount in round figures to  &#163;10,800,000.  If the Tariff continues to have the effect which we may. reasonably anticipate in view of its Protective character, a large proportion of the goods on which duty is now paid will be manufactured in future in Australia, and will pay no duty, and as a consequence our revenue under the Tariff must decrease. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite beside the question. No one is asking the State Governments to give up the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. If the State Premiers did not desire that the poor people of Australia should bear the burden of indirect taxation for all time, there is no reason why they should demand the return of any particular amount of Customs and Excise revenue. I have said that, with the exception of the resort to Customs and Excise, the whole field of taxation is open to them. But it is evident that their desire is to saddle the general taxpayers, who are the poor people of Australia, with an unconscionable burden of indirect taxation for all time. I do not approve of that. I do not think that the poor people of Australia should be saddled with any such burden to please the Premiers of the States. I have said that the revenue from the operation of our Tariff is more likely to decrease than to increase and I think that the experience of other Protectionist countries proves that. I find, on looking through the figures that it is anticipated that we shall receive a revenue from Customs and Excise during the current financial year equal to &#163;2 6s.10d. per head of our population. Let us consider the revenue derived from Customs and Excise in other countries possessing a protective Tariff. As a Protectionist, I sincerely hope that we shall always have a really effective protective Tariff in operation in Australia. If our Tariff is to have the effect which protective Tariffs have had in other countries, we cannot hope to continue to receive as large a revenue per head of our population from Customs and Excise as we are now receiving. In the United States of America, where the Tariff in force is more highly protective than ours, the total revenue received from Customs and Excise amounts to &#163;1 9s. per head of the population. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, for a population of over 80,000,000. In Canada, with a population approximating to our own, and with a decidedly Protectionist Tariff in operation, the total revenue from Customs and Excise amounts to &#163;1 19s. 2d. per head. In the United Kingdom, with a so-called Free Trade policy, but with what is a purely revenue tariff, the revenue derived from Customs and Excise amounts to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 9s. 8d. per head of the population. In Germany, with a distinctly Protectionist Tariff, the revenue from Customs and Excise amounts to16s. per head of the population. Yet, in the face of these facts, it is actually proposed in Australia that the Commonwealth, in addition to providing for its own requirements, should pay &#163;1 5s. per head of their population to the States in perpetuity. It is an absolutely monstrous proposal. Let us examine it from another point of view. The Premier of New South Wales says that that State is going to be robbed, that she is asked to make enormous sacrifices under the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> cheers that statement. Is it not an astonishing fact that in the State which is to be called upon to make these enormous sacrifices, the total amount of revenue raised from Customs and Excise in the year immediately preceding the accomplishment of Federation, was only &#163;i 5s. 7d. per head nf the population? Out of that revenue, the State Government had to bear the enormous cost of the services which have since been taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter what other revenue the State Government had ; the fact remains that the total revenue from Customs and Excise in New South Wales, in the year immediately preceding Federation, amounted to only &#163;1 5s. 7d. per head of the population. Now, although that State has been relieved  of  the enormous expenditure necessary for the upkeep of the services since transferred to the Commonwealth, we are invited to believe that it is consenting to a sacrifice in agreeing to a contribution of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 5s. per hoad from the Commonwealth. </para>

We have relieved that State of the cost of collecting that Customs and Excise revenue, which in itself represents a considerable sum.

                        <para>- Yet we are told that under the agreement arrived at by the Premiers&#39; Conference, New South Wales will be called upon to make an enormous sacrifice.&#39; It is a monstrous proposition under the guise of which an attempt is being made to saddle the people of Australia with a heavy indebtedness for all time. According to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> the average return from Customs and Excise throughout Australia during the year immediately prior to Federation was &#163;2 is. per head. I believe that that sum represents quite as much as our people should be called upon to bear in the form of indirect taxation. Under similar circumstances, therefore, we should have only 16s. per head with which to carry on the services of the Commonwealth - an amount that would not be nearly sufficient. To carry on those services we should be obliged to resort to other methods of taxation. But unless the Premiers of the States desire to fasten this undue burden upon the backs of the poor for all time there is no reason why we should return to the States any fixed sum whatever. For my part I shall never consent to any such proposal. </para>

                        <para>- How are we to meet our obligations unless the Government propose in accordance with the desire of the State Premiers to double the taxation upon the backs of the poor? I believe that the amount of _ indirect taxation to which our people are subjected should more nearly  approximate that of other countries. Why should they be singled out for undue burdens in this connexion ? A protective Tariff does not imply that we shall have a large Customs and Excise revenue. Its only use is to foster existing native industries, and to assist in the creation of new ones. What will the agreement of the Premiers&#39; Conference mean if effect be given to it? It will mean that when we have a population of 10,000,000 we shall be required to hand back to the States <inline font-style="italic">&#163;\z,</inline> 500,000 per annum. But as we shall need fully 25s. per head to meet our own requirements it is obvious that we shall have to raise no less a sum than ^25,000,000. Such a proposition is a monstrous one. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the people ot Australia ought not to be called upon to bear an undue burden of indirect taxation in order that we may be enabled to return to anybody 25s. per head. The whole object underlying the agreement is a desire to relieve the&#39; wealthy classes of their proper share of taxation and to make the poorer sections of the community shoulder the burden for all time. As a poor man, I say that it would not matter to me whether I had to pay this money to a foreigner or to a wealthy loafer who sat alongside me. Only a few minutes ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger asked why 25s. per head should not be returned to the States, seeing that they have to pay interest upon their indebtedness.&#39; But I would point out to him that the money representing their indebtedness was avowedly spent on reproductive public works. </para>

                        <para>- I say that a protective Tariff ultimately has the effect of cheapening the cost of&#39; goods, and that it will not return a large revenue. That statement is incontrovertible. It necessarily follows that the amount of Customs and Excise revenue, collected by the Commonwealth, will continually decrease. But no allowance whatever has been made for that circumstance in the agreement which has been arrived at between the Prime Minister and the State Premiers. We are constantly being told that the great need of Australia is population. But if we are to encourage population we ought not to tax the poor unfortunate baby the moment it is born-. Every infant born in the country has to bear a burden of indirect taxation through Customs and Excise. We have an enormous number of wealthy people in Australia who should be compelled to pay their share. We find that the added value given to property every year, by the expenditure of public money, amounts to at least ,&#163;20,000,000. The rich pocket that value, which&#39; is produced by public effort and by society generally. Now, it is coolly proposed to make the poor people pay interest on those enormous values. I do not propose to&#39; agree to any such proposal. I do not criticise the scheme of the Government as a five years&#39; 01 a ten years&#39; project to get over a temporary difficulty. I object to saddling such a burden upon the people in perpetuity. I believe that this Parliament should have ample opportunities to conduct its affairs in the future in a &#39;free vav. The Constitution as it now stands, intrusts the Parliament of the Commonwealth with full power to make its own arrangements in the light of ten years&#39; experience. The proposal to which we are now asked <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> accede, means that this Parliament must give up that right, and not &#62;niv s so. but that it shall tie the hands of all future Parliaments. I do not intend, as far as my vote goes, to agree to anything of the kind. In my opinion, future Parliaments should be left free to <inline font-style="italic">govern</inline> Australia, and to raise taxation according to their wisdom, having regard to the needs of the country for the time being. Believing also that the arrangement that has been made is simply with the object of saddling a burden of taxation on the poor people for all time, and allowing the wealthy to escape their just obligation, I regard that as an additional reason for opposing an amendment of the Constitution such as has been suggested. Whatever arrangement may be made to tide over a certain number of years, I certainly will be no party to tie the hands of this Parliament for all time. </para>
