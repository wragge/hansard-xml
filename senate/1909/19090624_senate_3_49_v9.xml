                        <para>. - I desire to make an intimation to the Senate. As honorable senators are possibly aware from the press, a motion has' been tabled in the- House of Representatives which constitutes a challenge to the Government. Our practice in such circumstances has been to adjourn until such time as the challenge has been determined one way or the other; Ordinarily the Government would have felt under an obligation to follow the beaten track, but we recognise that there is now before the Senate 'a motion which in itself affords an opportunity for any criticism which any honorable senator may desire to direct towards either the Government or its policy. </para>

                            <para>- I probably would be out of order in replying to the interjection in the course of the announcement I am making. As the motion before the Senate affords to honorable senators an opportunity of offering such criticism as they may desire to direct towards the Government and its policy, and as it seems quite reasonable to assume that they will wish to avail themselves of the opportunity, it is better that the debate in the Senate "should take place simultaneously with the one proceeding in the other House rather than that after the latter debate has terminated public time should be consumed by a debate which probably might be similar in character in this House. For that reason, and with a desire to economise' time and to proceed with public business, I propose'" to invite the Senate to dispose of the motion before it, and when that debate has terminated, presuming that it is done before the debate in the other House is concluded! to ask the Senate to adjourn. I desire to conclude with this intimation, that iri accordance with the principle underlying a well-established practice there can be no Government business transacted here while the motion in the other House remains undetermined. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, now, whether he will rectify straight away the omission made with regard to supplying members of the Senate with copies of the Ministerial statement with which the members of another place and the representatives of the press were supplied yesterday ? I think that a gross slight was inflicted upon, the Senate, and that we should not proceed to discuss the statement until we are supplied with copies. It is essential that we should know what is tn it before we discuss it. </para>

I wish to ask him whether he will take into early consideration the question of binding -together al] the statutory rules which are now, and have been for a considerable time past, circulated in leaflets amongst honorable senators. I asked this question during the term of office of the late Government, and obtained a promise that the suggestion would be carried out. I believe thar steps have been taken to that end. But may I be allowed to point out that it would be extremely convenient not only to every member of Parliament, but to members of the public also, that these statutory rules should be bound together and indexed. We all know that much of our legislation is affected by the statutory rules to which I refer. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, without notice, a question relating to the Tariff. I noticed in the newspaper the other day that the Minister was making inquiries as to the number of anomalies existing in the Tariff. I desire to ask him whether he has completed his inquiries, and, if so, whether he can give the Senate the assurance that a Bill for the rectification of Tariff anomalies will be introduced as soon as possible in the interests of manufacturers seriously affected ? </para>

                        <para>. - I take advantage of this opportunity to make as few remarks as I possibly can in the circumstances, because, in my opinion, the statement made by the representative of the Government in the Senate is of such a non-committal character that it is almost impossible to lay hold of it anywhere. It is as slippery as an eel. Whenever I attempt to get hold of a definite statement in it, it eludes me like a myth. But there are certain peculiarities about it. It is a written, typewritten, or printed document; there is no possibility of getting away from it, or getting at it, or, as I am reminded, of getting a copy of it. It would appear that the Government as at present constituted, must put everything in black and white. </para>

It might easily be imagined that the first part is intended to represent the Deakin section of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- It is Deakinesque, no doubt. It deals with the industrial life of the Commonwealth of Australia. The second part is the Cook part; it deals with defence, and the third is the Forrest part dealing with finance. Honorable senators will see how nicely it all works in. One portion of the statement is supposed to rope in all the members who have in the past followed or are likely in the future to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> The second part, of course, represents what was at one time the Opposition, both in the House of Representatives and in this Chamber; that is to say, the defence section. I think that the defence of Australia, from an Australian point of view, has fallen into very feeble hands when it has got into those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook and Senators Millen, Gray, and Walker. </para>

                            <para>- The next section of the Ministerial statement deals with finance, and whom does it represent as a statement before the public? It represents what was the Corner Party in another branch of the Legislature of the Commonwealth. So far as I am aware we never had that party represented in the Senate. There has always been the Labour Party and the other party in the Senate, but in another place they had three parties opposed to the Labour Party, and when they came together they had to frame a policy to satisfy the three sections. Whether they have succeeded or not, time will tell. With respect to the first portion of the Ministerial statement which relates to the industrial life of the Commonwealth, I think that those who are toiling under difficulties and disadvantages in the different States will have to continue to do so for many years to come. </para>

So far as Tasmania is concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> need not say much. He is a Liberal now. Of course, he has always been a Liberal, and he is the same kind of Liberal to-day that he has been always. Honorable senators will understand what I mean when I say that. He is now associated with the other Liberals with whom he should have been associated years ago - with the black and tan Liberal Party. What do the Government propose to do? </para>

Their attitude irresistibly reminds me of a man holding up a bunch of carrots before a donkey as a temptation to greater exertion. They are holding a prize before the electors of Australia, and telling them to follow it as long as they can, and that if they do so they will get something when they catch it. But the electors who are able to catch anything-  that has been done by the Honorable Alfred Deakin will have to be much smarter than ordinary citizens. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and they will build on it, too. They will build safely and securely, and the people know that their trust will be well kept by the representatives of labour in the State and Federal Parliaments. If honorable senators will turn up the Constitution, section 100 to section  104,  they will find what the Inter-State Commission was intended for. I do not know that it would not have been a wise thing if it had been appointed long ago, but it has nothing to do with the adjustment of the industrial affairs of Australia. According to this statement, the Government have communicated with the States to give them authority; but, so far as I can find, there is nothing in the Constitution which would make such control of industrial matters legal, even with their consent. </para>

If industrial conditions in Tasmania, or Western Australia, or Victoria differed from those existing in any other State, and the Inter-State Commission were established and appealed to, no matter what the States might say, if a case were brought before the High Court without an amendment of the Constitution having been made, it would certainly decide that the Inter-State Commission had no legal or constitutional authority to act in what was purely a State matter. </para>

                            <para>- It would be like putting sulphuric acid into magnesia - it would blind everything in the vicinity. As the Inter-State Commission would have no power to do the things which are indicated by the Government, what is the use of them trying to hoodwink the people? When a proposal was brought before the Parliament and the people by the late Government, that the Constitution should be amended for the purpose of giving this Parliament the power to do those things, there was an appeal of a substantial character advanced. The people are getting tired of this kind of paltering with' legislation and with their feelings and aspirations, and the time is coming when the present Ministers will be no longer in a position to' hoodwink the public as they have done. Then they propose to establish bureaux. For what purpose? </para>

We had a look round, to see what we could do, and we made our propositions according to the information we obtained. </para>

I intend to give the real reasons why the late Government were put off the Treasury bench, and honorable senators on the other side will not be able to deny my statement. At the present time I only want to ridicule the idea of the Commonwealth Government establishing bureaux of any description - labour, agricultural, or other. They are not taking the right steps to develop Australia to make institutions of that description effective. </para>

                            <para>- I am not in a hurry, and I am sure that the Minister ought to be grateful even for that. I am making the most I can out of the material at my disposal. It is very like the picture in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Star</inline> the other day. It showed the  Hon.  Alfred Deakin and the  Hon.  Joseph Cook, with three legs, trying to build a wall. I now come to the other section of the Ministerial statement. Who, in this branch of the Legislature, is going to father the defence proposals of the Government? They are going to do great things. They have a defence scheme, and have sent a representative to a Conference to be held very shortly in Great Britain. To my mind, out of the Cabinet they could not have selected a more' unpopular or less effective representative. </para>

Why did not the Minister of Defence for Australia go Home too ? Is it because his knowledge of defence matters is of such intrinsic value that it was necessary for him to stay in Australia ? Were there no other members of the Cabinet who could have occupied his position while he was in Great Britain? No; but, as I have already suggested, who would watch the slippery Prime Minister if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> were away ? That is exactly the position as it appears to me. </para>

                            <para>- It was a great reflection on the honorable senator's ability and knowledge that he was not included in the Cabinet, and sent to represent Australia at the Defence Conference. The unanimous acknowledgment of that statement by honorable senators ought to please <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> great though his vanity may be. Inquiries have been made here to-day as to the instructions given to the representative of the Government who has just gone to England. No one knows yet what the instructions were. Apparently they were secret instructions, and I suppose that  Colonel Foxton  is going to a secret Conference, and no one will ever know what takes place. We do not know whether the instructions represented the views of the Corner party, the Cook party, or the Deakin party; or whether they were a hybridized conglomeration that no one could understand. </para>

                            <para>- The Conference will be held, and I suppose we* must expect great results from it. But the Government are already committed. They have despatched a cablegram to the Imperial Government, stating that they are prepared to present to Great Britain a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> or something equivalent to it. They did that while Parliament was not sitting, and without consulting Parliament in reference to it. I am not going to say that there are not enough foolish representatives or misrepresentatives of the people in the Federal Parliament, to commit themselves to an absurdity of this description, while we ourselves are absolutely defenceless. New Zealand has offered a Dreadnought; and what an astonishment it will be to the people of Great Britain and to  His  Gracious Majesty the King when they know that the people of New Zealand already owe  £69, 000,000,  and have not a. warship of their own, nor any adequate defence in the whole Dominion, and when they find, nevertheless, that these people have the cheek - I will even call it the impertinence - to propose to give something to somebody else. The position is exactly the same in Australia. We owe the financial institutions of Great Britain between£240,000,000 and£250,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has become very thin-skinned since he began to rub shoulders with the members of the Employers' Union, and apparently he does not quite know where he is. There is no necessity to test the loyalty of the people of Australia. That has been tested long ago. There are evidences in abundance, that it would be the great desire, not only of the British people and the British Government, but of the Admiralty itself, that Australia and all the outlying Dominions should take steps to provide for their own protection, instead of offering to Great Britain something which will very likely in ten or twelve years be useless. What are we doing? We are offering Great Britain a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and Great Britain will have to lend us the money with which to build it; she will have to build it; she will have to man it; and she will have to  pay for the maintenance of it. She cannot find the men to man it in Australia, because we have not men trained here; nor are we likely to have men trained for the naval service as long as we continue as we are doing at present. Now, the late Government had a- definite policy for the protection of Australia, and for the assistance of the Empire in that direction. They w.ere prepared to pay for the service out of the revenue of Australia, and the people of Australia were quite prepared to find the money. Up to the present time we have not paid more than 5s. 3d. per head for our own defence, whilst almost every other country in the world pays four times that amount. The people of Great Britain pay five times as much. Yet honorable senators supporting the Government wish to keep on in our present path, and to give  away  a  couple  of millions in a direction that will create a .burden for us but will afford no relief to the heavily taxed people of Great Britain, who will have to maintain and man the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> afterwards. Lord Tweedmouth himself, when First Lord of the Admiralty, said that the best thing that Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia could do was to build torpedo boats, submarines, and similar vessels to endeavour to protect themselves and to assist Great Britain in that way. In face of the evidence that that is the right thing to do, the policy of the present Government is both foolhardy and foolish in every respect. Then they propose to build docks at different places. </para>

                            <para>- It wants docking, scraping, and treating in various other ways before it will be of  any  use to this ^country, and the sooner the honorable senator tackles the job and does something of that description, the better it will be for the Government. I see from the Ministerial statement that docks and ship-yards are to be established. Where are they going to put the  ship-vards,  and what are they for ? T. doubt whether there is a member of the Government who knows the difference between a dock-yard, a  ship-vard,  and a foundry. Indeed, they do not know the difference between a flat-iron and a blacksmith's anvil. </para>

                            <para>- I am not making professions of knowledge. I am making statements which it will be for honorable senators opposite to refute if they can. One ship-yard in Australia would be sufficient to build all the vessels we shall want for many years to come, and would be a very effective place for that kind of work. From the defence point of view, all the dock-yard accommodation that is required in this country is in the form of decks for the repair and maintenance of the mercantile marine, and not for our defence. We want very little accommodation for that purpose. The policy of the late Government included all that was necessary in that respect. Then we come- to the corner party section - the Forrest-Irvine-Quick section - I cannot think of all their names. </para>

If any one can, out of this Ministerial statement, tell me what the financial proposals of the Government are, I shall give him credit for great wisdom and discrimination. I cannot ascertain. Something is going to be done in the distant future, and there is a hazy reference to it. </para>

                            <para>- No one knows what it is. Not long ago the Prime Minister and many of his supporters declared that the time had arrived when there ought to be a separation between the financial affairs of the States and of the Commonwealth. But the Government are still keeping the two mixed up. The late Government had a definite financial policy, which was just both to the Commonwealth and the States. Let me remind honorable senators that when, the Convention which brought the Commonwealth into existence was sitting, the Customs and Excise revenue of all Australia was ,£6,000,000. One-quarter was supposed to go to the Commonwealth, and three-quarters, under the Constitution, had to be paid to the States. That is to say, the Commonwealth was to retain ,£1,500,000, and £4,500,000 was to go to the States. After nine years the late Government were prepared to give to the States out of the Commonwealth revenue a minimum of -£5.000,000, with £250,000 in addition for Western Australia, making the latter sum a disappearing amount under a sliding scale. That was the lowest sum that the States were to get, and they were to be paid  that amount <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> That was definite, and we had not to wait for a Premiers' Conference to dictate anything. Then after the expenses of the Government of the Commonwealth were taken out of the Commonwealth's share of the revenue anything left was also to be divided <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amongst the States. Is there any such definiteness in the policy of the present Government? I cannot find it if there is. I shall not attempt to find what is not there, but I propose to tell honorable senators why, in my opinion, and in the opinion of a great majority of the people of Australia, the late Government was defeated." It was because they had definite propositions to put before the country with respect to the raising of revenue, and with respect to the ultimate settlement of people, not only of Australians but of people from other parts of the world, on the lands- of Australia. The late Government in their proposals included: a progressive tax on the unimproved value of land. Where is the opposition to that coming from? Is it not from the financial institutions, and the large and wealthy land-holders of Australia, backed up by the Employers' Union and the Chambers of Commerce? They have got the present Government in the hollow of their hand, and will keep them there or snuff them out as they think fit. That is exactly the position the present Government is in. And it is because the late Government were not prepared to submit to the dictation of any section of the community that it was not thought desirable they should hold the reins of government any longer. Then we are told that there are great proposals in the wind ; the taking over of the Northern Territory, the building of the Federal Capital, and the cost of the Western Australian railway " when the construction is authorized." There is a doubt about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was not strong enough or could net exert sufficient influence to have that proviso omitted from the Ministerial statement. All these great expenses are to be incurred, but it is said that in view of the expenditure necessary within the next financial year some new system of financing will have' to be adopted. And what is the suggestion? That we should go on to the money market and borrow money for what the Government call reproductive works. So long as I have the privilege of representing South Australia in the Federal Parliament, I shall always strenuously oppose any borrowing policy for anything of that kind. There will have to be some definiteness about it. Are the people of Australia not in a position now to pay for the improvements required in the telegraphic and telephonic services, and to remedy the defects existing in our postal arrangements ? If within the last nine years the Commonwealth Government had spent the money on these services which they had the power to spend, instead of giving it back to the States to be squandered, they would all have been up to date. Because we did not do that it is proposed that we should adopt a borrowing policy to right what we permitted to go wrong, and what, to a great extent, had been allowed to go wrong before we took over the Post and Telegraph Departments of the States. So long as I am a member of the Senate a borrowing policy for any such purpose will have my opposition. In common with the members of the party with whom I am associated, I am prepared to do all I possibly can to put these services into an effective condition, but the people of Australia will have to bear the necessary expense, and must maintain them out -of their own pockets. There is to be no borrowing for works of a perishable nature. We are not going to do the same as they did in some of the States when they bought guns, which now lie buried in the sand, although the money borrowed to purchase them is still owing, and interest on it has still to be paid. </para>

Thousands of them are now in New Zealand. We are not going to have borrowing in the Commonwealth for a policy' of that description. It may be necessary in the future history of the Commonwealth to borrow money, but it will be for conversion, and not for the construction of public works that perish in time, and without provision for redemption. </para>

                        came into power the Governments of the Dominion were so liberal as to make it unnecessary that a Labour Party should grow up there, but as they become Conservative no doubt the necessity for a Labour Party in New Zealand will arise in the near future. If it had not been for such illustrious personages as Senators Gray, Walker, Pulsford, and Neild, who turned Conservative at the first breath,' there would have been no necessity for a Labour Party in Australia. But the Labour Party has arisen out of the necessities of Australia, and it is going to remain and to grow. I think it would be a waste of breath to endeavour to criticise any further such an ambiguous statement as has been put before the people of Australia by the present Government. I will, therefore, conclude by again congratulating them on the fusion that has been effected. I am delighted to see such old and doughty opponents as Senators Millen and Best sitting cheek by jowl. How long they will agree in brotherly amity is impossible for me, or for any one else, to say, and how long Senators Gray and Walker will live in the embraces of Senators Trenwith and Keating, is a puzzle which the Sphinx could scarcely solve.

                                is like the innocent child who sleeps peacefully on the breast of any foster mother. It would be impossible to tell who was the honorable senator's real political mother from any votes he has given or any speech he has delivered in the Senate. Whether the honorable senator is a Liberal, a Conservative, a Radical, or a nondescript, I am unable to say. I would ask some honorable senator who has a better knowledge of these things to make an attempt to do so after I have finished. So far' as the Opposition is concerned, any measures that are in the best interests of Australia will receive our ardent and faithful support, and anything we consider to the detriment of the interests of the Commonwealth will receive our most serious and strenuous opposition. With the best wishes for my friends in the Government, I shall be satisfied with what I have already  said.

How differently that reads from the statement which the honorable senator made eight years ago, from that well-worn  bit of carpet opposite where I stand, when he uttered those memorable words that must always live to the condemnation, of himself and his colleagues, " The Labour Party are up for sale.'"' They would be up for sale to-day if there were any takers, but there-are none. In the few things I have to say, I shall begin by making a few observations for the benefit of my friends Senators Millen and Best.

                            <para>- I do not know, and it does not matter, where the military seniority lies. In this Chamber, intellectual superiority is of much greater consequence. The Senate has again and again decided that Governments should bc represented here by at least two salaried Ministers - that is, Ministers designated by the Constitution. But* to-day that condition of affairs does not exist. In. this Chamber we have one Minister known to the Constitution, and another who is unknown to it. The leader of the Opposition -seeing that he has been in the position of " fifth wheel of the coach " upon two occasions - might very well hold his speech, because when he was not a Minister he was very pleased to support my motions in favour of securing fuller representation of the Government in the Senate. I need scarcely point out that this Chamber contains half the number of members that is to be found in another place. Yet, whilst in that Chamber there are no less than six Ministers designated by the Constitution, there has never been more than one here. If my honorable friends opposite had remained in office, I should have brought - as the business-paper shows- exactly the same complaint against them that I am now urging in regard to the representation in this Chamber of the existing Government. As a man who takes some interest in constitutional methods, I cannot be otherwise than eminently satisfied that members of the Commonwealth Parliament have now been practically reduced to two parties. </para>

That the forces in Federal politics have now been reduced to practically two parties augurs very much better for the successful working of the parliamentary machine than has been the case hitherto. In the past, there has always been some party hanging on the wing of some other party with a view to political - some honorable senator might say personal - advantage. But we now have only two parties iri the Commonwealth Parliament, and that fact must appeal to the good sense of any one who is interested in parliamentary procedure from a constitutional stand-point.

                            <para>- I think that " absorption " is the correct word to describe what has recently taken place. The eminent Victorian, with the assistance of ten others, has practically absorbed all the other members of Parliament, who entertain views at all similar to their own. That absorption does not appeal to me. I go further, and say that, from my own knowledge of unions of the kind in Australia - a knowledge which extends- over twenty-five or thirty years - the results have not been of a character satisfactory to their well-wishers. What the future may have in store for the present arrangement I do not know. But I do know that, owing to the changes which have recently occurred, one is compelled to take up some position . of d'efiniteness in respect of the two parties now in Parliament. The fact that honorable senators have changed their seats is an indication that with the change which has been brought about in another place there has been a corresponding change here. </para>

I regret that carelessness upon my part should have caused him any inconvenience. We must all recognise that, for the present at any rate, political lines in this Parliament are marked out in no indistinct manner. Those who do not belong to the Labour Party, and who are not prepared' to embrace the bonds which it holds out to every member of Parliament, must take up an attitude of antagonism to it. During the past few weeks, as we all know, throughout Australia frantic cries have been raised by the ejected from the " tart shop " - if I may use a phrase which has-  become almost historic. But why . these wails? Did not the members of the Labour Party dig the very pit into which they have fallen? Were they not their own ejectors from office ? Did they not know when they accepted office, they could retain it only with the support of the Deakin party, and did they not at once attempt to undermine that party in the constituencies? They were content to live by the support of the Deakin party, but they were anxious, nay, urgent, to <inline font-style="italic">cut</inline> the political throats of that party in the constituencies. They made the support of the Deakin party an impossibility, and having reaped the reward of their energies- </para>

                            <para>- There is no' doubt that they wailed throughout Australia with a degree of honesty that was worthy bf the honorable senator's most complete efforts. If ever there was an instance of boomerang politics, we find it in the present position. Having alienated the support of the Deakin party - having been struck by the boomerang that they were aiming at that party in the constituencies - they now lament the success of their efforts. </para>

I think that he and some of his friends did their utmost to outrage the good sense of the community so far as they decently could. There was not a newspaper in Australia - with the exception of a few anti-British rags - which did what the honorable senator and his friends did, namely, oppose the granting of assistance by this great Commonwealth, not to the Mother Country, because I decline to regard that assistance as a. gift to Britain, but to the Empire. It was a gift to the Empire, and should stand as such. </para>

                            <para>- I own that I cannot read the thousands of newspapers published in Australia, but I do know that the vast majority of them supported the proposal that the Commonwealth should take its proper place in sharing Empire responsibilities. It is not those who howl the loudest at public meetings who most faithfully reflect the wishes of Australia. When the next appeal to the electors is made - I care not what Ministry may be in office - they will, I feel sure, declare that it is the duty of Australia to assist in bearing the burden of the defence of the Empire. How can the Commonwealth better serve its own interests than by assisting in the defence of the Empire as a whole? The Empire may be, and is, doubtless, prepared to meet all emergencies, but if it is to be a mere question of sectional defence - of a few ships here and a few cockle boats there, of a few battalions here and a few cadets somewhere else- </para>

                            <para>- I do not happen to be a solicitor, or I might be described as a "charger." The leader of the Opposition took great exception to the fact that the present Ministry contained seven lawyers. I have not counted the number of lawyers in the Cabinet, but I know that a lawyer has about three chances to one as against a layman of securing a place in any colonial Ministry. My honorable friends' plaintive ejaculations on the  subject of lawyers in the Cabinet brought to my mind the words put into the mouth of Jack Cade-" Let's kill all the lawyers." I do not know whether his idea was that the Cabinet would be better without lawyers. I admit that there is rather a plethora of them, but I do not know that the displacement of a lawyer in the" interests of my honorable friend would make the present Cabinet very much better than it is. The honorable senator did not tell us very much about what he would have done had he been allowed to remain behind the counter of the "tart shop." As a matter of fact, he must recollect that the members of the Government of which he was one, were not responsible Ministers within the meaning of any constitutional term. They were in this Senate and in another place not as constitutional Ministers, who were responsible to the Crown and to the people, but as the agents of the caucus with the door locked. That is the position. I do not attempt to deny that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> sought to achieve many meritorious results. I do not for an instant disagree with all that they did, or all that they proposed to do; but I do say, that not one member of the Ministry sat here or elsewhere as a responsible Minister within the meaning of any constitutional authority-. They were merely here, I repeat, as the agents of the caucus. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that they will prove to be the agents of the whole community. I have here a most extraordinarily lengthy document. If it were only printed in the large type which dignifies Vice-Regal addresses, I do not know how many pages it would occupy. I listened to nearly all of it yesterday, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was reading it. While it might be a subject of much interest to myself personally to dilate upon its very numerous paragraphs, I would not think of attempting to mention more than a very few of them. There are some paragraphs which appeal to me, I own. On the other hand, there are some about which I am not so enthusiastic. If it is meant for anything more than a political placard, as descriptive of a policy ; if it is intended as an in'dication of what is going to be done during the present session, we shall have to work -overtime all the six months before us. I hope that we shall deal with some of the subjects. One of the first paragraphs which catch my attention relates to amendments of the Old-Age Pensions Act. It is proposed to reduce the period of residence in Australia from twenty-five to twenty years. The present Act, .with a twenty -i five years' residence provision, was brought into being with the support of the gentlemen who are now  His  Majesty's Opposition. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour. Party have not caught up the position which, as Royal Commissioner for New South Wales, I took up many years ago, when I advocated fifteen years' residence. So that in no shape or way can I be in opposition to a proposal which only seeks to approach the standard I laid down in a report, dated 1898. When the question of the period of residence in New South Wales was before its Parliament in connexion with a Bill which was initiated as the result of my efforts, how did the Labour Party there act? With the exception of four, every member of that party voted against my attempt to amend the Act so as to give the chance of a pension to men whose regular vocations took them outside New South Wales for more than twenty-four months in twenty-five years. Mir. Thomas Brown, who sits in another place, was one of those who voted with me ; but, with the exception of the four, all the other members of the Labour Party of New South Wales voted against my: motion to enable the payment of old-age pensions to those who had served Australia faithfully and well, even if they had not resided every month of twenty-three years out of twenty-five. Now that Federation is happily about to extend the system throughout-Australia, no doubt it is a fitting time for the Labour Party in the Senate to show their condemnation of the action of their comrades in New South Wales. Then we have a clause about State insurance. For the last ten years or more I have been making a solitary endeavour in the direction of State insurance for workers. The present, however, is a two-penny half-penny proposal. It only proposes something for seamen ; it should include all the workers of Australia, male and female alike. I have battled in that direction for the last eleven years, and I hope to live to see, at the hands of either this Government or some other, an enactment of the  principle  of the State, at bare cost, insuring the life, the limbs and the health of every worker in the community. It is cheaper, better, and less open to conflict and industrial misunderstanding than any such methods as are indicated in this document. </para>

                            <para>- I may say a few things before I sit down, and some of them would be worthy of orchestral, accompaniment. We are told that there is another group of proposals. Bless my soul, we have had a number of, not only groups of proposals, but independent proposals. But while these proposals have been more or less nebulous, there has been going on in connexion with our Defence Force, such a series of scandals, such a series of objectionable doings that had the late Government remained in office I should most assuredly have stood here to demand the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate them. I shall mention som« of these things, and read some documents in connexion with them before I sit down. Necessarily, they are not matters with which I have the remotest personal concern, but  they  are matters which, as one chosen by the people of New South Wales to do my best in the representation of the State here, it is my duty to bring forward. 'I shall bring forward one very remarkable case which is wholly connected with Victoria, and which, therefore, has no possible personal interest to myself as a politician or a man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was alleged to be a most successful Minister of Defence. I believe that he achieved a measure of success in that direction by blindly following the recommendations of an officer who was never discovered to possess any special merits until he arrived in Melbourne. Recently we had a magnificent effort in the defence of Australia promulgated by regulation of the Governor-General in Council. My honorable friend was ministerially responsible for perfecting the defence of Australia by abolishing the wearing of mess jackets once in three or four weeks, and the printing of crossed swords opposite to the names of citizen soldiers to indicate active service. </para>

While the mess jacket has been ordered off and the crossed swords have been abolished, the one great achievement of the late Administration in the matter of Australian defence was the issue of a regulation that box-spurs were not to be worn. </para>

                            <para>- I am not saying anything about them. It might be well to abolish them because feathers spoil with the wet, and look much better in ladies'. hats. But box-spurs were abolished in order to popularize the service and make-  it attractive to young officers who, by the way, do not wear them. A man must be a major, at least, before he can wear box spurs, and they are worn by senior officers in almost every defence force in the world, except amongst savages, and even some savages wear "shirt collars and spurs" on special occasions. This splendid result, therefore, was achieved in order that junior officers who do not wear box-spurs might be relieved of the expenditure of 6s. 6d. on their account ! </para>

                            <para>- They are one of the best recognised badges of rank worn bv senior officers. It is of no use to tinker with little things while leaving essentials unattended to. I have just been informed that a copy of the latest edition of the Officers' List is not to be obtained from the Library. I may remark that it is very difficult to get these Government publications. Some time ago I invited the Senate to pass a resolution requiring the delivery of all Government publications to members of this Parliament. The resolution was passed unanimously, but it has never been complied with" by the Departments. They issue documents repeatedly which members of Parliament do not obtain. There are many books and papers which are issued from the Government Printing Office, and which do not find their way into the hands of honorable senators in spite of the resolution passed. I have mentioned this matter more than once, and have become tired of mentioning it. The fault does not lie with the officers of this Parliament. Now I intend to speak on some matters that have happened lately in connexion with the Defence Department. I desire to show positively, from official documents, that while proposals of a nebulous character have been put forward in the interests of infant soldiers - that is to say, soldiers under twenty-one years of age - there has been, ,if not a deliberate effort to injure the existing forces, at least an effort to make membership of the forces hateful to the members. Let me take first of all one case that I referred to as happening in this State in connexion with the Naval Forces. for thirty-one years a citizen of Victoria has served in the Naval Forces of the State and of the Commonwealth. He has been twice gazetted by the Governor-General in Council to the position of storekeeper in the Naval Forces. For thirty-one years he has dis charged his duties so faithfully that there is not a mark against him. But he has been ruined for life, as far as active manual labour is concerned, by a terrible accident that  befel  him in the discharge of his duty. The name of the man I speak of is  Critten.  I' am not personally interested in his case. I am simply concerned with it as a matter of public interest. I ha-ve not seen the man. He has not told me a word about his case. What has happened  to him is this: He has been, by some persons other than the Governor-General, disrated, as far as they could disrate him, 'from his position as storekeeper, and refused the increase of pay that Parliament voted from time, to time. For years he has been entitled to an increase. The money has been voted by. Parliament, but he has not received it. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. There are plenty of persons who will bring forward a matter and then think that they have discharged their duty. They will write a letter, and then go off to play billiards, dropping the whole thing. But I do not do business in that way. If I think that a matter is worth fighting, I will fight it to the last ditch. I am fighting this, and have been fighting it for the last nine or ten months, though I do not say that I was the first to introduce it to the notice of the ex-Minister of Defence. </para>

I have not all the papers with me. I did not bring them all over from Sydney. It is sufficient for my purpose at the moment to state the facts as I am now doing.

What he was prepared to do was to submit the case to a Board composed of a Public Service Inspector, a Police Magistrate - and I wonder what in thunder a Police Magistrate has to do with the administration of the naval affairs of the Commonwealth - together with a representative of the Defence Department, unconnected with the Victorian Naval Forces. This was a very startling statement, that the Minister could not trust any one connected with the Naval Department in Victoria to be concerned with this inquiry, but must bring in two laymen and a militaryperson. </para>

                            <para>- What I have said is quite sufficient to show that the Minister at the head of the Department would not discharge the responsible duties which he was sworn to discharge, but wanted to trade them off to a Police Magistrate, an official in the Civil branch, and a military, man. I will take another case. Perhaps the ex-Minister does not know anything, about this, but it is one that must receive the attention of the present Minister, and the ex-Minister must have been badly served if he did not know the facts. If he acknowledges that he was badly served in this respect, it is only another evidence of the unsatisfactory condition of affairs existing in the Defence Department. Last Easter twelve-months, a member of one of the .Militia regiments in New South Wales, travelling under military orders by train to attend a camp at Liverpool, near Sydney, was injured in what is known as the Murrundi railway accident. This man has been permanently incapacitated from earning his livelihood as a shoemaker. He is not one of the wearers of box-spurs, but was an humble private in the regiment. In consequence of his injuries, he was discharged from the military service as medically unfit. This matter has been before me for a good many months. </para>

                            <para>- I have no objection whatever to mentioning the name. The name is John McDonnell. He was travelling under authority with the members of the regiment of which the honorable the  President  was an officer of no small distinction in years gone by. This poor chap having been mangled up and rendered practically a cripple for life, applied under section 57 of the Act, under the very amendment which I had the great satisfaction of causing to be inserted in the Defence Bill, for compensation. What was the answer of the Department? It took them from the 15th October to some time in February to give him an answer, and then they told him that because the Railways Commissioners had paid him some compensation for his injuries - necessarily as a citizen and not as a soldier, because the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales have nothing whatever to do with Commonwealth obligations to soldiers - he was told point blank by some people in office in Sydney that he Had no claim. Lf <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> out of his good nature and sympathy for suffering, had given the man a cheque for £20,000 that would not have absolved the Commonwealth and the Defence Department from paying the compensation which the law ordered. No one can deny that. </para>

If I live long enough, I am going to see that this man has justice. I shall help in that direction if I can, or do it single-handed if necessary. That man must be given the compensation which the Defence Act insists shall be given to those citizen soldiers of the Commonwealth who are injured in the discharge of their duties. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman absolutely did the right thing at least once; but if I were quoting an American phrase I should say that he did it in so cussed a manner that it was just about as bad as not doing it at all. The facts are these : An officer in a regiment in New South Wales was' accused of having been drunk on duty, it being alleged that he committed the awful enormity on a fearfully wet night. The night was so wet and hideous that the State Commandant, Brigadier-General Gordon, sent telephonic messages all round to stop the proceedings that were under way, and to order all the men back under canvas as quickly as possible. On that particular wild night it is alleged that this officer committed the heinous offence of drinking one glass of whisky, and he was accused of being drunk on duty. </para>

                            <para>- I was not there. But I know that the officer in question is capable of consuming more than one glass of liquor without it showing any effect upon him, just as may be said of a great many honorable senators. He was placed under arrest, and kept under arrest for six months. The real offence against the man was that he had risen from the ranks, and he had been the victim of his superior officer in certain monetary transactions for the superior officer's benefit. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend, after a most brilliant feat of silence, has achieved the distinction of making a remark that is entirely worthy of his mental calibre. I say that this officer prejudged the case before he heard it. There is nothing very funny about that. I do not say that he prejudged it afterwards, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> seems to think that it would have been possible for him to do. This officer held an inquiry in a, most extraordinary way. At half-past i o'clock in the day the officer under arrest was ordered to attend at 4 o'clock and have all his witnesses with him. Just imagine his getting his witnesses from the four winds of heaven all round a great city like Sydney or Melbourne. Of course,- he could not do it. He protested, but the inquiry went on. The only 'staff officer and professional soldier called as a witness gave evidence which was certainly not in support of the charge. The local constable on the beat was called in, and gave evidence absolutely in favour of the accused. A prominent officer of the Sydney Gas Company gave evidence that the man had not a trace of liquor about him'. One of the most highly respected citizens of Sydney, a professional gentleman, who does not practice his profession because he possesses independent means, which perhaps renders him less noticeable in the public eye than if he pursued his profession, gave evidence that the officer in question was not the worse for liquor, and the officer himself made the statement that, as he was in the habit of doing, he had taken heavy doses of quinine to prevent a recurrence of a fever contracted in South Africa, where he received a wound in respect of which he receives today an Imperial pension. </para>

I have never interfered, and I hope that I shall never interfere, in a matter of military discipline, where obedience to orders and the good conduct of the force is concerned. But where I see the law flagrantly broken. I think it mv duty to intervene, and I did intervene in this case. I insisted that the papers should be sent to the Attorney-General for the purpose of ascertaining whether the officer who conducted the inquiry was entitled to do so. The Attorney-General, over the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> writing on his behalf, upheld my contention that the officer who held the inquiry was not empowered to do so. I Hold in my hand the minute of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who at the time was Minister of Defence, upon the case. He says - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Attorney-General decided that the officer who held the inquiry had no right to do so, and that the position, therefore, was as if no inquiry had been held. With the concurrence of two King's counsel, one of New South Wales and one of another State, I then took the point that the six months' limit permitted by the Act had expired, and that, as the officer in question had not been prosecuted, he was entitled to be released from arrest. Arrest, in the case of a citizen soldier, I may explain, means that he cannot fulfil the duties of the office to which he has been appointed by the Governor-General in Council. He cannot command his company, he cannot wear his uniform, he must not be found on any military precincts ; in short, in no shape or form is he permitted!: to discharge any of the duties attaching to his position. It does not require much explanation on my part to convince honorable senators that to deprive a man occupying a public position of his office, to strip him of the rights of that office, and to prevent him performing the duties attaching to it, is to degrade him. What else can it be? Would it not be degrading for any honorable senator to be ordered out of this Chamber and to be refused admission to it for six months? </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable senator should go outside, and, to quote an historical utterance by a high constitutional authority, "bark with the other dogs." I have waggon-loads of correspondence dealing with defence matters, but I will not trouble the Senate with it upon the present occasion. As a matter of fact, I was seriously thinking of building a fireproof room at my residence for the purpose of storing records of the Defence Department's misdeeds. At present, however, I do not propose to pursue this ugly question of defence any further. During the time that I imagine will be afforded by an adjournment of the Senate, I intend to deal with some of these matters by preparing for publication certain chapters 'or essays on " What may happen to a citizen soldier in Australia, ' ' because we cannot expect to secure the citizen force which this Parliament demands the force that is indicated in the declarations of Ministerial policy - unless  Ave  have cleaner and more honest administration. By that I do not mean more honest administration in the matter of pounds, shillings, and pence, but more honest administration in regard to efficiency and the carrying out of the military and naval law. Had the opportunity presented itself, I should have mentioned some of these matters in discussing the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. It is certainly necessary that some one should bring them under the notice of the Senate, although it is a painful thing for any man to do. Personally, I have no more disagreement with the late Minister of Defence than I had with his predecessor, and it is necessarily obnoxious to me to have to bring these matters forward. </para>

                            <para>- Something that fell from my honorable friend in connexion with this Critten case reminded me that his idea of a miscellaneous Committee was not altogether original; that his predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, had an equally brilliant scheme in connexion with the case of alleged intoxication, which I have related here. After it had been discovered that the inquiry held was illegal, and that the Defence authorities bacl been, acting foolishly, he achieved a brilliant idea. He addressed to the Premier of New South Wales a letter asking for the' services of a stipendiary magistrate to determine the momentous question of whether a volunteer officer was the worse for a glass of whisky or an overdose of quinine, and the latter, according to the correspondence, replied pointing out that such an inquiry would be outside the commission of a stipendiary magistrate, and that, in order to protect him if he made an inquiry, it was necessary that he should be appointed' a Royal Commission. That is a momentous instance of conflict between the Commonwealth and the State. </para>

                            <para>- I have said over and over again :hat the question to be considered was whether the petty officer was occupying the position to which he was gazetted. ' I have made that statement so plainly that if my honorable friend has not caught my meaning, I do not think that it is the fault of my words. I once heard a speaker say, " I can supply speeches, but I cannot supply brains to understand them." When I have spoken so clearly, I really cannot understand my honorable friend continuing to allege that I have said something which undoubtedly <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show that 1 did not say.. Let that pass. I come back to the main question. We have had, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> not an attack but a speech upon a proposal for the printing of a document. He did not object to the printing of the Ministerial statement read here yesterday ? He did not even object to its contents ; but he complained, wilh a pathetic feebleness, that there are some persons offering Government proposals instead of, I presume, their predecessors. My honorable friend is, I believe, recognised by every one here as a manly man, and the best sign of' a manly man is to take ill fortune and good fortune with the same happy grace. I would not like to see my honorable friend considered a bad loser. I would like to see him recognised, as he has hitherto  shown himself to be. a good loser, and if other occupants are in " the tart-shop," to be patient. </para>

                            <para>- This is the first time I have heard of it. A great many years ago, Captain Wilks was an officer of my regiment, and what he did I am not concerned with now. If he did anything improper, my honorable friend may be quite sure that I pulled him up for it. In his present demeanour, my honorable friend has not shown himself to be a good loser. In his speech this afternoon, he has shown a desire to feebly cavil at that which his successors offer to the country. I have shown, by my attitude, that I do not profess to be an enthusiast in respect of all that has been done lately. Goodness knows, I have not shown myself to be a strong party man. I have played, if a man can do so, the role of candid friend ; but I am in this position, that I must choose between the other side of the House and this side to the extent of where I am to sit, and what my general  line  of action must be. My general line of action must be with this side. I hope that my honorable friends will permit the printing of this document ; but if they do not, it will not matter twopence, because the business of " the tart-shop " will still be carried on by its occupants, for the present at any rate. The matter which is under discussion here, has to be fought elsewhere; it is being fought elsewhere, and finally, it has to be fought in the constituencies. </para>

I recognise his good will ; and if I doubt his power, it is no possible reflection upon his intentions. I hope that this document will be printed. I hope that, notwithstanding the necessary sadness that envelops the minds of some honorable senators on the other side, they will not carry out all their intentions of blocking business ; but that in the few months which have to pass before an appeal is made to the constituencies, there may be such corrections of existing legislation, and such efforts in the direction of new laws as are necessary for the well-being of the people of each division of the Commonwealth, and which are necessary to enable the Common- wealth to pursue its course with that dignity and that public usefulness which is essential to its honour. </para>

                            <para>- In the first place, 1 disclaim any responsibility for what took place prior to my term of office ; and most of the questions which the honorable senator brought forward were legacies left to me by my predecessor. There is one little misapprehension into which, not only the honorable and gallant senator, but also a number of other officers fell, and that is in regard to the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Military Forces List.</inline> The document I hold in my hand contains the regimental list and the gradation list of the Commonwealth Military Forces. In certain circumstances, it was the practice to place a crossed sword opposite to the name of every officer who had seen active service. If any one will refer to the <inline font-style="italic">List</inline> he will find that it is made up in two parts, the first part comprising the regimental list, and the second part the gradation list. When I mention that the first part deals with the position of every officer in a regiment, honorable senators will realize that it is continually changing, because every month additions have to be made or names removed. In the past, it was the practice to print the whole of this list quarterly. The gradation list applies to the whole force, and only needs to be printed yearly. When I took charge of the Department, it occurred to me that it was an absolute waste of public money to print all these pages of small type quarterly, when an annual print would do. I therefore suggested that the Department should print the regimental list quarterly, and the whole book annually. It is only in the quarterly list that the crossed swords appear opposite the names of the permanent officers only. Prior to my time, in the quarterly list a crossed sword only appeared opposite to the names of the permanent officers who had seen active service. The crossed swords were not opposite the names of militia officers who had seen active service. But in die gradation list they appeared indifferently against the name of every officer who had seen active service. Following out my instruction, the regimental list was printed as it had always appeared before - that is to say, with the crossed swords opposite the names of the permanent officers who had seen active service. I was not aware at the time I 'ordered this list to be printed that any distinction was made, but as soon, as the first newly-printed list appeared an outcry was raised bv the militia officers, who seemed1 to think that a difference was being made for the first time between them and the permanent officers. That difference always had been made. But on learning of the facts of the case, I immediately issued instructions that whan the next list was printed the crossed swords should appear opposite the names of both militia and permanent officers who had seen active service. So that, instead of being guilty of what the honorable senator has charged me with, it was I who altered the former practice and brought about the change. I managed to save some amount of expenditure on printing the lists, and by the orders which I issued I also rectified the anomaly which had existed in the past. In the last list issued the crossed swords appear opposite the names of all officers who have seen active service. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; !the crossed swords- always did appear opposite the names of militia officers in the yearly lists, but now they will appear in the quarterly lists also. So much for that charge. I come now to the  Critten  case. This also was a legacy left over, not only by my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, but by every previous Minister of Defence. Critten,  as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has correctly stated, was a storekeeper in the Naval Forces in Victoria. He met with an accident bv which he was ruptured, and was retired from the forces. After he had somewhat recovered -and, be it observed, after he had received compensation from the Victorian State Government - he applied to be given some light occupation in the Defence Department. The Minister of Defence in the State of ViC.toriathis occurred before Federation, of course - allowed him to come back into the service, but not into the active forces. The man could not come into the forces again in the regular way, because he could not pass the medical examination. They gave him a position in the naval stores branch. That was the position which he occupied when he came over to the Common- wealth. He was not actually in the Naval Forces." He had not been gazetted in the Naval Forces. He was not eligible to be gazetted, because he could not pass the medical examination. This man, ever since the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Commonwealth, has been approaching members of Parliament, and using influences of all kinds, with the object of getting back into the gazetted forces. He approached every one of my predecessors. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will take the trouble to look at the papers on this question, he will find that every Minister of "Defence has had the case before him. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is mistaken. The position of storekeeper was gazetted, but this man has never been gazetted since his accident as a member of the Naval Forces. Indeed, he cannot be admitted into them unless some Minister likes to suspend the regulations regarding medical examination. As I have said, however,  Critten  has been kept on year after year in the position which he occupies. When I became Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathews,</inline> the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, came to see me about the case. I had not been many days in the office then, but I at once promised to look into the matter. I went through the whole file very carefully, and consulted with the Secretary of the Department and with the officer in charge of the Naval Forces. I saw that I could not legally reinstate Critter to his former position. </para>

                            <para>- That Board, which is still sitting, I think, was not appointed for that purpose, as the honorable senator will find if he inquires further. I pointed out to  Critten's  friends that if they were well advised they would leave him where he was. But they continually pressed the case, and demanded his re-admission. To my thinking, the man and his friends were very ill-advised in demanding that there should be a Board of Inquiry. But I consulted with the officers, and" ultimately agreed that a Board should be appointed, although I did not consider that its appointment would be in the interests of  Critten  because I could not understand how, on the evidence, they could possibly report in his favour. The friends of the man said that he could not get justice from the officers of the Naval Forces. Therefore, the officers themselves made the suggestion that they should not be represented on the Board. Captain Cresswell himself said to me that, for his own part, he did not desire that any naval officer should take part in the inquiry, because, if that were the case,  Critten  would imply that the officers were prejudiced against him. It was therefore at his own request, and in consequence of the urging of his friends, that the Board was appointed. It has not yet furnished its report. Those are the facts of the case. What could I do? I could not reinstate the man in flagrant defiance of the regulations. It has been too often urged against administration that political influence is used with the object of dodging through the regulations. But, though I could not reinstate the man, I was quite willing to allow him to remain where he was so long as he was able to carry out the  light  duties which he was given to do. I am  sorry  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> does not remain in the chamber to hear my reply. I think that after the charges which he has made he ought at least to listen to the other side. But it is rather characteristic of the honorable senator to make charges and to run away when the answer is being given. I now . come to the case of the man who was arrested on the charge of drunkenness. It is quite true, as stated, that he was charged with being drunk on duty, which, of course, is a most heinous crime. He was a. Militia officer, and was arrested about six months before I came into office. For six months, my predecessor had had the case before him, but did not deal with it. When I came into office, I found that there had been a Court of Inquiry to look into the case under the regulations. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Court of Inquiry was held, and it is quite true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has stated, that one man who took part in it had already expressed an opinion upon the case. When the Court recorded its finding, the officer appealed to me against it. On going through the evidence, I saw that the Court of Inquiry was wrongly constituted. I considered that it was not a fair thing that the man should be made to suffer under those circumstances. </para>

                    <para class="block">I expressed no opinion upon the case at all. I simply quashed the proceedings and put the man back where he was before the charge was made against him. What else could I do? I could not give him compensation. All that I could do was to quash proceedings, and reinstate him as captain in his regiment, directing that no mark should be recorded against him for what had occurred. I was not responsible for the man being six months under arrest, because the circumstances occurred 1*fore I came into office. With regard to McDonald's case, the explanation is easy; and I am certain that honorable senators who know anything about departmental methods will understand -it. The fault I find with the Defence Department is that too much is sent on to the Central Office.  1  think that more power should be given to the State Administrations. One of the things that causes dislocation is that if a State Administration wants to spend they have, to refer the matter to the Minister. This is a case in which a man was injured whilst on duty. He made his claim for compensation. In the first place, the case went to the colonel of his regiment. The colonel recommended an inquiry. The inquiry was held. These inquiries, I may explain, do not record any finding. They simply send on an account of the proceedings to the Commandant, who reads it over, and formulates a .recommendation to the Head-Office,  in Melbourne. In this case, the Commandant, acting upon his own judgment, did not think that there was any just claim for compensation. The consequence was that the matter never came before me at all- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has said that if the case was not brought under my notice, it shows a lack of cohesion in the Department. But any man who is acquainted with the first principles of business must be aware that the Minister of a Department cannot run round the Commonwealth hunting out grievances. If this man knew the regulations - and pretty well every man in the Defence Department does know them - he would be aware that he had the right of appeal from his superior officers to the Minister. I venture to say that there is no officer in the Commonwealth who would dare, in defiance of the regulations , t:&gt; block an appeal to the Minister. But this man did not exercise his right of appeal. He never made any request to me, and therefore I never heard of his case. If I had been in office for the next five years, I might not have heard of it. In view of the fact that the man did not make any request to me, the whole charge levelled against me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is shown to be ridiculous. </para>

I wish he would make them now. If they are not more formidable than those which he has brought out to-day, I shall sleep unconcernedly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is fond of putting himself forward as practically the father of old-age pensions in this country. But, on the- 3rd June, 1908, when the Deakin Government brought forward the Surplus Revenue Bill for the purpose of finding money for the payment of old-age pensions, I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was .paired against the measure which afforded the only method by which the pensions could be paid. </para>

                            <para>- They were inseparably connected. Every honorable senator must recognise to-day that, had it not been for the passing of the Surplus Revenue Bill, we should not be in a position to pay old-age pensions next month. That is an absolute fact. I propose now to deal with the Ministerial statement, and I would say that the opening sentence summarizes it. It includes a reference to "a most complex series of measures." I do not know about the measures, but this statement is comprised of certainly the most complex series of paragraphs it has ever been my misfortune to have to puzzle over. </para>

The first proposal is for the appointment of, an Inter-State Commission. This InterState Commission is not merely to carry out the duties laid down in the Constitution, but is to have some other functions. We are told, for instance, that it is to perform such a function as "a general oversight of production and exchange." I do not know that we shall do much to stimulate production and exchange by merely exercising a general oversight. If that were all that were necessary we might leave the work to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> and the Statistical Bureau. I never yet heard that the compilation of statistics did very much to stimulate production and exchange. </para>

                            <para>-It may suit the Government to put forward that sort of thing to create a glorious hope of something to be done in the future, but I venture to say that if that proposal is put side by side with our proposal for a progressive land tax, and the people of Australia are asked to say which they prefer, they will be in no doubt. If we put before the people a proposal for the appointment of a nebulous body in the far distant future that is to study unemployment and a scheme for insurance against it and side by side with that a proposal for a tax on the unimproved values of land that will break up the land monopoly, give employment, and, to a certain extent, abolish unemployment, I have no doubt as to which of these proposals the people would cast their votes for. </para>

                            <para>- Whilst they were carrying out that policy they dealt in New Zealand with the unemployed question in a more practical way than it was dealt with in any Australian State. It is only since they ceased to bring forward progressive legislation that the unemployed are beginning again to assemble in the streets of New Zealand cities. Then we find that this Commission is going to supervise - the working of the existing Customs Tariff in its operation upon the investment of Australian capital and labour in Australian industries, advising the removal of any inconsistencies in its schedules, and also with the further view of developing preferential and other trade relations within the Empire. </para>

                    <para>I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> made the most vigorous, and certainly the most definite, speech that was ever made in this Chamber on the question of preferential trade. The honorable senator has sitting to-night on his left hand a supporter in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who from his point of view delivered if not quite as able, at least as earnest a speech on the same subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> proposal for preferential trade was that we should raise a wall against foreign countries and remove a brick for the Mother Country. The wall was to be one brick lower for the Mother Country. I can remember the vigour with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> denounced <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> idea of preferential trade, and how he ridiculed and constantly voted against it throughout the consideration of the Tariff, as did others who are now sitting with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Yes, there is this difference, that on the question of preferential trade, to which I am referring, in common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, I supported the 5 per cent. preference proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> on every occasion, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> did not support it on anyone occasion. Further, so far as my position is concerned, no statement made by a Labour Government, or any other Government, could interfere with my fiscal principles. Are we to understand that this statement to which I have referred represents only that section of the present Government and their followers who thought, talked, and voted, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> did when the Tariff was before us ? Are we to understand that there are only ten in another place, and only three in this Chamber, who believe in this portion of a programme put forward as representing the views of the whole Government, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others who think with him have abandoned their principles for those held by the three who have advocated preferential trade in this Chamber before? Although I was one of three, and I think we did not at any time number more than three free-trade Labour, members in this Chamber, I never found the other members of the party sinking their protectionist ideas for mine. </para>

                            <para>- I made no secret of the fact that, although I was a free-trader, I was never a revenue-tariffist. I would sooner at any time support a duty which would prohibit importations than a duty which would allow importations with the object of collecting taxation upon them. I said so when we were dealing with the Tariff, and in carrying out that view on certain occasions I voted for higher duties than even the present Minister of Customs voted for. I contend that this statement is an attempt by the Government, under the guise of saying that they are going to do something for  preferential trade, when they know that they are not agreed upon it, and that their followers are not agreed upon it, to shelter themselves behind the Inter-State Commission. In other words, the Inter-State Commission is put up in order to make it appear that in some marvellous way, and by some feat of legerdemain, it is going to influence the views of the Government and their followers. I venture to say that if we are going to have preferential trade from the present Government and their following as represented in the Senate, it will be more in line with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> idea than with that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has the larger following in this Government. I now come to the way in which the Government propose to deal with the question of the New Protection. I quote from the statement - </para>

It .would not matter to me that the Tasmanian rate had been fixed by a local Wages Board, or that the cost of living, or the purchasing power of wages, in the two States differed. What would concern me, and what I should have to look at, would be the wages cost of my production, no matter what conditions determined the wages in Tasmania and in Victoria. The competition would be to me an unjust com  petition, if there were any differentiation in the direction of lower wages than I would have to pay. </para>

                            <para>- I shall show the honorable senator how that is suggested. We have Wages Boards established in several of the States already. Only a little time ago in New South Wales, under the local Industrial Disputes Act, a request was made for an increase of wages. Evidence was brought forward by employes to justify the increase demanded. The employers then stated their case, and what was their defence ? Did they bring evidence to show that the wages asked for in the State were unjust. No. They simply brought forward the Wages Board rate payable in that particular industry in Victoria, and showed  that it was lower than the Wages Board rate which the employes were asking in New South Wales. I think that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Simpson, who, in giving his award, said that he would not grant the rate asked for by the employes, notwithstanding that they had made out a strong case, because to do so would subject New South Wales manufacturers to unfair competition. Consequently, he awarded the Victorian rate of wages. This illustration is sufficient to evidence the way in which State Wages Boards operate. Compare the result with the decision which has been arrived at by the Federal Arbitration Court. In the Harvester Excise case <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins laid it down as a guiding principle that in arriving at his determination of what constituted a " fair and reasonable wage," he would not be influenced by the determination of any State industrial authority whatever. In order to give effect to the New Protection, the late Government proposed to establish a Federal tribunal, which would not be merely a Court of Appeal from a State tribunal, but which would be absolutely independent of such tribunals, and which could- as it did in the harvester case - lay down what it regarded as proper wages conditions, not only throughout Australia, but in different portions of one State. We saw the result of the exercise of its jurisdiction in the shearers' dispute, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor laid down three different rates and prescribed varying rates as between New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. In giving judgment in the harvester case, too, Justice O'Connor said that he had determined the case upon Victorian evidence, but if any other State felt that - by reason of local living conditions - the wages which he had awarded did not comply with the standard that he had set up, he was willing either upon the application of any union or of any employer affected, to hear an application for a revision of the rates either in respect of the whole State or of any part of it. </para>

                            <para>- What is. the difference between the two propositions? Quite recently in this State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a'Beckett was asked to say what was meant by " a minimum wage" under the Wages Boards system of Victoria. He was asked to fix a wage which would allow a man to marry and maintain a family. But what happened? In his judgment he said that as he read the Factories Act of Victoria and the Wages Boards provisions of that Act, he was not authorized to take into consideration either a man's wife or his family; that he was empowered only to consider what was a living wage for the man himself. Let honorable senators compare that decision with the interpretation placed upon the Federal law by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, who declared that he was empowered to decide what was a fair and reasonable wage to pay a man who had to support a wife and family in an average degree of comfort, and to make provision for. old age, sickness, and privation. This Government has now declared that it will throw overboard the standard fixed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and the decision which he has registered. It will not endeavour to secure an amendment of the Constitution with a view to enabling us to have a tribunal such as we desire, but it wilT legalize the determinations of State tribunals, one of which during the past few weeks has affirmed that it has no power to take into consideration a man's wife and family. </para>

Have we any hope that the Legislative Councils of the States will pass a measure which will1 clothe State industrial tribunals with the powers which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has de- dared are possessed by the Federal Arbitration Court? Not only will they refuse to do so, but in this State the Premier has declined to do so. After the case which I have cited was decided by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a! Beckett, the Tanners and Leather Workers' Union approached <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> and asked him to introduce an amending Act which would provide for the payment of " a fair and reasonable wage" - thus using the very words which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins employed in the harvester case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> declined to accede to the request. The present Government is supported by the Employers' Federation and by the Manufacturers' Association of Victoria.

                            <para>- I say that the Employers' Federation of this State has always fought factories legislation, and has at all times declared itself against it. Just prior to the amalgamation of political parties which has recently taken place - prior to Senators Trenwith and Dobson joining hands, and to Senators Pulsford and Best becoming political partners - there was an amalgamation in this State between the Employers' Federation and the Manufacturers' Association, and those bodies agreed that for the purpose of giving effect to the New Protection they were prepared to accept the determination of the State Wages Boards. I do not wonder at that. What was the alternative with which they were confronted? They knew perfectly well that there was a Government in power which intended to register throughout Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins's declaration as to what was a fair and reasonable wage. To remove the late Administration from office and to promote the fusion of political parties which has taken place in this Parliament, they agreed to amalgamate their forces. They have succeeded in installing in office a Government which will give its adherence to a proposition that " a fair and reasonable wage " ought not to take into consideration a man's wife and family. We know that on a former occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> declared that a man's wife and family were luxuries. </para>

                            <para>- No; because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, in laying down the rule to which I have referred, merely followed the lines of a previous decision given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor. The latter permitted evidence to be tendered regarding the cost of the maintenance of a man's wife and family, and thus admitted the principle which was afterwards so eloquently stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. These two Justices of the High Court have laid down an entirely different principle from that which is recognised in the Factories Act of Victoria, according to the dictum of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a'Beckett. If it be merely a question of bad law - as is suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> - why does not the Premier of this State make it good law ? I am satisfied that we shall not get anything better from the Parliament of Victoria, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> knows perfectly well that, even if he could get an amending measure through the Legislative Assembly, it would not be approved by the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council of this State is the pet legislative body of the Employers' Federation; and that Federation is in favour of sweating. The proof of my statement is to be found in the fact that the Employers' Federation has fought tooth and nail/ against every instalment of Wages Board legislation in this State, and fought bitterly both with money and literature. </para>

                            <para>- It is absolutely correct. The present Government propose to ask the Federal Parliament - which passed the harvester legislation and established a Court, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins made that magnificent declaration as to what was to be the right of the workers of this country - to go back upon what we have done and accept what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a'Beckett says is the only declaration he can give. So far as my voice can reach them, I want the people of Australia to know that behind this mass of words lies that intention ; that, stripped of all its sophistry, that is what the federalization of Wages Boards means, and that this Government are going to make marriage impossible for the workers. </para>

Talk about the sanctity of the marriage tie ! Nothing leads more to the destruction of its sanctity than do low wages. Having regard to the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a'Beckett, the Government are open to the charge that they want this Parliament to legalize a system which does not recognise marriage. </para>

                            <para>- In some States there are no Wages Boards. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is an advocate of Wages Boards, why has he been dumb for so many years on the question in Tasmania? Why is it that in that State they never talked of establishing a Wages Board until they saw the ogre of a Federal Court coming to them? It was not until then that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans,</inline> who, by the way, was deposed from the Premiership by a caucus, announced that the Government intended to move in the matter. He had a parliamentary majority for years, and did not act. It was not until the Commonwealth was placed under the Labour Government that he intimated his intention to institute Wages Boards in his State. Not that he believed in them; not that he thought that they were necessary; but in order that the Federal Parliament should have no justification for setting up industrial tribunals in the State. He was childish and simple when he said that the object of the legislation was to render it unnecessary for the Commonwealth to make an in-road upon State rights. </para>

In Western Australia the boot industry has been practically wiped out by competition from Victoria, but not because that State pays high wages. I. cannot leave this interesting paragraph without referring to the last two lines, which I think any Federalist ought to be ashamed to have penned, though, of course, I can understand a .State writer penning them - </para>

                            <para>- It is provided in the Constitution that additional power can be sought, not by correspondence with the States, but by an appeal to the people of Australia. If the latter prefer that the States Parliaments should deal with industrial matters, they have a perfect right to make that preference, and can refuse to give us the additional power which we seek. But the present Government do not propose to make an appeal to the people of Australia. They only propose to appeal to a section of the people, and that section is the property-owning people, because in every case except where the Legislative Council is a nominee body, the State Parliament is dominated by a House which represents only one-seventh of the people of the State. The Government propose to ask Legislative Councils elected on a property qualification to give this Parliament . the power to legislate on industrial matters, when, under the </para>

We did not propose to go cap-in-hand to any State Premier, and ask him to allow this Parliament to legislate on industrial matters. We proposed to take the sense of the whole people of this 'Commonwealth.

In the last two lines of this interesting paragraph the Government propose to ask this Parliament to surrender powers which have been intrusted to it by the people of Australia. The last Government did not propose that this Parliament should part with any one of -its powers. If a State Parliament wishes to endow the Federal Parliament with industrial power it can do so, as it could have done at any time within the last eight years. Has not there been need for taking that departure? Have there not been times when the establishment of Wages Boards have been called for, and when public meetings with that object in view have been held? We have never heard of a State Parliament proposing to hand over to this Parliament any one of its legislative powers. The present Government want to place this Parliament in a humiliating position - in the position of a suppliant to Legislative Councils composed of property owners. In the Constitution, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> with others, helped to frame, and which, I think, he should fight to maintain, the people of Australia gave this Parliament the .right to appeal to them at any time for additional legislative power. But it is not proposed by this Government to ask the Parliament to exercise that right. </para>

The State of Victoria during the years of Federation has enjoyed most prosperous seasons. In eight years there has only been one failure of the harvest. The producers- have realized top prices for their commodities.  But what is Victoria's record in the matter of population? In the eight years there was an excess of births over deaths of 106,000. Yet in that period, notwithstanding the bountiful harvests and the high prices, Victoria lost 54,000 adults by the excess of emigration over immigration. The State of Tasmania has an equally bad record. Whilst the population is increasing by excess of births over deaths, Tasmania is losing her adult population. There are more people going out of the State than are entering it. What is the use of attempting an immigration policy when this sort of thing is going on? What are the causes?' </para>

Why is land cheaper in Queensland and in Western Australia? It is cheaper because there is less land monopoly there than there is in thisState. There are thousands of acres in the Western District of Victoria upon which the whole population of this State could be settled. Take the Tweed River district in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> new chief, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> recently visited that district, and he declared from what he saw that we could settle the whole population of Australia there. Why is there not a larger population in the Tweed River district? The reason why our farmers leave Victoria is because land is too dear, and it is made too dear by being held in large estates. </para>

                        <para>. - The proposed policy of immigration will be not only nugatory, but positively harmful, unless something is done to open up the lands for the people who are here, and for those who will come. It is of no use for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to say that people are. leaving one State to go to other States where land is cheaper: The fact is that the increase of population in Victoria for the last eight years was under 1 per cent., and in the whole Commonwealth the increase of population for the last eight years was only 1.89 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We have had this miserable rate of increase side by side with immigration policies propounded by States Governments. Furthermore, everybody recognises that Australia cannot develop without the development of our primary industries. Our progress must originate from the landed industries in the first instance. What are the States Governments doing to open up and settle the land ? They have closer settlement policies. In the State of Victoria, in the eight years to which I have referred, £1,500,000 has been spent in repurchasing about 200,000 acres, and in two years of that time, from 1906 to 1908, the big estates of Victoria, that is, the estates over 1,000 acres in extent, have increased to the extent of 117,000 acres. One has only to visit country towns to find out what is going on. Land monopoly is increasing everywhere, at a faster rate than Closer Settlement Acts are distributing land. I was born in the State of South Australia, in one of the most prosperous farming districts, where the harvest has not failed for the last fourteen years. I was away in Western Australia for twenty-five years. When I went back there were fewer farmers than there were twenty-five years before. That is not only the case in that one district. I know of other districts in the rich fertile areas of South Australia where the  population is shrinking, and the number of farmers decreasing. The policy of closer settlement merely aggravates the evil of dear land. It is created by an artificial scarcity of land. The number of competitors becomes greater than the amount of land in the market is sufficient' to supply, and into the market comes another buyer with unlimited cash - the Government - and sends up the already artificially inflated price of land to a higher level still. This is well known to any one who has followed the operation of the Closer Settlement Act in Victoria. Agricultural land has been repurchased in this State at such high prices that the Govern-" ment cannot get it off their hands, because people could not get a living from it if they paid for it the price at which it was bought by the Government. This evil must be remedied before we can have an immigration policy- The present Government do not propose to do anything to touch that question. The proposed Board of Trade is not to be clothed with power to break up big estates, or to buy estates, and yet the Government propose to spend money on the prosecution of an active immigration policy. I say that a policy of immigration in the face of these facts would be merely a policy to depreciate the value of labour by the introduction of labour to an already overstocked labour market. So far. as the land is concerned, unless we break up the land monopoly, there will be no additional avenues for the employment of labour thrown open, and if we do not propose to open up new avenues of employment, we shall be simply introducing labour to an overstocked labour market by encouraging immigration. </para>

                            <para>- I have had all the Tariff I want at the present time. But 1 can remember that on several occasions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> directed his remarks particularly to me when he complained that the Tariff was not yet what it ought to be. Not only is the Government policy of industrial legislation a faulty one, and one which will strike directly at the marriage tie by making marriage difficult or impossible for the workmen of Australia, but it proposes to increase the evils of competition by an active policy of immigration to bring additional workers to Australia. I quite recognise that we must have an immigration policy for Australia if we are to continue to hold the country. We must have people settled upon our lands, or we shall not be able to retain them. The merino sheep is exceedingly useful for bringing in money, but it is a very poor soldier. If we are to hold Australia, we must have some millions more of population than we have at present. The problem for every one is hew to increase the population of Australia. I say we cannot do so without dealing with the land question. The Labour Government recognised that. We associated together, as three main features of our programme, a land policy, are immigration, and a defence policy. They stand or fall together. One cannot be effectively dealt with by itself. We cannot adequately defend Australia without increasing our population, and we cannot increase our population without dealing with the land question. </para>

                            <para>- We have not taken over the Northern Territory yet; but if we had done so, I should still say that we must settle the empty spaces in the south as well as in the north. We shall be neglecting our duty as the National Parliament intrusted with" the defence of the country if we do not open up the areas of the Western District of Victoria and the Tweed District in New South Wales that are now lying practically unused, or used only for the breeding of sheep, and -.see that they are put to the uses to which they might be put. Though many efforts at closer settlement have failed, where estates have been thrown* open on anything like decent terms the improved results, as compared with those  obtained  under the system- of land monopoly, are most marked.

                        <para>Land repurchased for closer settlement since the passing of the Act in 1893 to 1908 amounted to 251,476 acres. The land was allotted to 921 persons. Average holding - trifle over 273 acres. Formerly kept only few persons and an average of about one sheep to the acre. There is now a population of 3,058 (including children), also 58,996 sheep, 3,560 cattle, and 3,406 horses; 36,838 acres were reaped last year, with a return of 467,751 bushels of wheat. </para>

                    <para>That indicates that this land, which was previously used only for sheep, is suitable for closer settlement. I know of estates on which only one or two people were employed, and on which after they were cut up hundreds were employed, and the land carried! more sheep than it did when the estates were used as sheep runs. What has been accomplished there at very great cost to the State might be accomplished a hundredfold by the imposition of a progressive land tax, which would cause the holders of large estates to put them to profitable use, or to cut them up and distribute them to small holders.. They could cut them up, as did the Black Brothers at Terang, and let them to tenant farmers, or sell the lots to small farmers. This would lead to vastly increased production, and more traffic for the railways, and people coming here would know that there was land on which they might settle. It is a very poor immigration advertisement to the people of Great Britain to say that in Victoria there was an increase of r06,00c babies; but, at the -same time, the State could not retain its adult population, and lost 54,000 more than it gained. I know! what the present Government say in this connexion. They say that we should leave the land question for the States to deal with: " We shall get the. people here. It is the duty of the States to settle them upon the land." I point out that in almost every State of the Commonwealth, legislation to deal with this question would have to pass in each State Parliament a House that represents the big property-holders. Such legislation must go through the House of landlords, the very men who hold the big estates. We find that that is the case if we look at the Western District of Victoria. To go over the list of large landowners in that district is like reading the roll of the Victorian Legislative Council. </para>

                            <para>- That is the view that they take, and it would not be human nature to expect men to pass legislation to immolate themselves. Do honorable senators believe that the landlords in the Legislative Council of Tasmania are going to pass legislation to break up the land monopoly in that State? It is impossible to think it. In any case, the States Parliaments have had this problem on their hands fifty years before the establishment of the Federation, and for eight years since its establishment. During that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has .been writing letters to the States Premiers, telling them that the Commonwealth Government was prepared to undertake an immigration policy, and the Premiers of only two of the States, Western Australia and Queensland, deigned to make any reply. So we have absolute proof that, so far as the States Parliaments are concerned, they are not likely to do more in the future than they have done in the past to deal with the land question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, is proposing to introduce a land tax ; but the most sanguine man here does not think that the Victorian Legislature will pass a land tax. </para>

This cable was received bv the late Government only two days after our communication suggesting the holding of a Conference on defence matters had been despatched. The probability is that the two messages were crossing the ocean at the same time. It will be seen, therefore, that we took action in the matter of requesting the Imperial Government to convene a Conference without any knowledge that the Canadian Government had done the same thing. The reply which the present Ministry received from the British Government thanked them for their offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> but did not accept that offer. It merely expressed pleasure at the opportunity which its members would be afforded of meeting our delegate at the forthcoming Imperial Defence Conference. </para>

                        <para>The new Commonwealth Government has begun its administration with a foolish action which is also a tactical mistake. The offer to the Imperial Government of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or its equivalent, subject to a definite explanation of what that equivalent may be, is little less than an ill-timed absurdity. . </para>
                        <para> Yet now - although the last excuse for urgency was removed when the Imperial Government accepted the New Zealand offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> in a reluctant manner, and said that there was no need whatever to hurry over it - the Commonwealth Ministry has reversed the wise policy of the Fisher Government in this respect..... There is no question that if a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> offer were made a test question at a general election the panic screamers would be in a hopeless minority ; and as such an election is so near at hand, the Deakin-Cook Cabinet are playing straight into the hands of the Socialists. </para>

                            <para>- I have always proclaimed myself as a State Socialist, and I glory in the fact as a sane man. It has been said 'by no less an authority than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that the late Government did not understand the technical side of this question. He spoke in a contemptuous fashion of the "cockle boats" that we had ordered. In this connexion it is interesting to recall that when these torpedo destroyers were first ordered some of our friends opposite fell into a most ludicrous mistake. The destroyers are of what is known as the River class, and consequently the spectacle was witnessed of the present Minister of Defence, in attempting to ridicule the idea, inquiring. "What are they going to do with these River destroyers? Are they going to put them on the Yarra or on the Murrumbidgee?" He evidently thought that they were for use only upon rivers. </para>

                            <para>- Upon advice which had been procured by the previous Deakin Government, and which was at our disposal in the Defence Department. Acting upon that advice, the last Deakin Administration was prepared to commit Parliament to an expenditure quite as large as that which we proposed. But I am in a position to quote even stronger authorities in support of our action. The British Admiralty authorities, the Admiral on the Australian statiotn, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Poore, and the Governor of South Australia, Rear-Admiral Bosanquet, have all declared that one of the most valuable forms of defence which Australia can offer the Mother Country is the maintenance of a well-equipped flotilla of torpedo boat destroyers and submarines which will be in a position to co-operate with the battleships of the Empire if the latter should ever be called to these seas. </para>

I notice, from cables which have recently appeared in the newspapers, that only a few davs ago the delegates to the Imperial Press Conference visited the yards in which boats of this type are being built, and expressed great satisfaction with them. </para>

                            <para>- There is no navy in the world engaged in building operations which is not constructing torpedo boat destroyers of the River type. The British naval authorities are building more vessels of that class than of any other. The advice tendered to the Tate Government was that with the money at our disposal this class of ship constituted our most effective form of defence. Whilst the speed of destroyers of the River class is not so great as that of vessels of the Tartar class, in Australian waters, which are somewhat rougher than are the seas in other parts of the world, the former will be superior to any other type of torpedo boat afloat. In rough seas vessels of the River class can steam faster than can boats of the Tartar class, which have a reputed speed of 38 knots per hour. </para>

                        <para>The only practicable method, and, moreover, the best method is, Lord Milner maintains, for the Dominions to build up naval and military forces of their own. Though this policy may appear to involve waste in the multiplication of separate establishments, it will - assuming common principles of organization - produce the maximum of collective strength in the end. The recent announcement of the progress made in the development of the naval scheme of the Commonwealth Government, and of the impending visit of Canadian Ministers in order to consult with the Admiralty, justify a hope that Imperial Naval co-operation on these lines  will  no longer be thwarted by the reluctance of the Admiralty to have British Navies growing up outside ils own control in time of peace. From the telegram published this morning their appears to be some prospect of Australia taking part in the proposed consultation, in which case matters should be well advanced before the next session of the Imperial Conference which falls due in  1911. </para>

At any rate, wherever it had to be decided, Great Britain, as being responsible for the naval defence of the Empire, could not, and would not, leave Australia unprotected. If we can relieve the Old Country of the necessity and the anxiety of the naval defence of our shores, and enable her to concentrate the whole of her efforts wherever they may be wanted, then we shall be doing the duty which is nearest to us, and rendering the most effective co-operation we can in Imperial defence. </para>

                            <para>- We never will, unless we have boats in which to train the men. Our Australian seamen have passed practically into the British Navy out of our control. The only seamen we have are 800 men in the permanent force, who have been trained in obsolete boats like the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus,</inline> and have never fired a gun less than twenty years old. It would simply be madness to talk about manning a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> with men who had received that sort of training. So the Government propose to go to the Mother Country to borrow the money to build the ship, and to man it afterwards with Britishers, and then they call that an Australian <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Some men went into the squadron at Sydney After they had been in England for two years, going through a gunnery course, a request came from the Admiral that they should be allowed to remain two years longer in order to go through a higher course of gunnery. Before going to England, they had done two years on the Australian station ; next they did two years in a gunnery school in England, and then, in order to perfect themselves in the higher classes, they had to go through another course of two years. Therefore It takes six years to turn out men fit to man the guns on a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I agree with the statement of Admiral  Poore,  that the best service we can render to the Empire is to start a flotilla of destroyers, and to train our men to man them. Admiral Bosanquet made a similar statement in South Australia. Admiral Beresford said we could render a better service to the British Empire than by presenting a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and that was by cultivating in our own people a spirit for naval defence, and having a local navy. </para>

The provision of three torpedo destroyers is an insignificant start. They are so insignificant that they excited the ridicule of those who are now talking Imperial defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H. Reid exhausted their vocabulary in ridiculing the idea of the Labour Government ordering the construction of those boats, but to-day they are posing as those, who are in favour of an Australian defence scheme, and are prepared to do their duty to the Empire. They denounced the Fisher Government because they had dared to spend. ,£250,000 in ordering the first three boats for an Australian Navy. </para>

I do not take second place to any honorable senator in recognising this essential fact that we cannot bring our policy into effect without the protection of the British flag. Nor can our White Australia legislation be carried out except it has behind it the might of Great Britain. I  recognise  that any service we mav render will safeguard the Empire, but <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> differ entirely with those who say that we can render that service best by presenting a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> built with borrowed money to a country which has not yet commenced to borrow money for providing its own <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> while we leave the duty at our hands undone. From the <inline font-style="italic">Globe,</inline> of the 17th April last, I propose to quote a passage from a leading article on this very question - </para>

                            <para>- The statement of British Ministers goes to show the ability of Great Britain to cope with any two fleets in. the world at (his time. What are we doing at present in regard to naval defence? There is a Naval Agreement in force under which we compel Great Britain to keep certain ships on the Australian' Station, in return for which we pay a subsidy of ,£200,000 a year. The party that sits on this side of the Chamber is absolutely free from any responsibility for that agreement. We voted against its ratification. Now, what does it mean? 'It costs Great Britain every year - I have seen the returns when I was in the Defence Department - £600,000 to keep those vessels on our shores. Therefore, under that agreement, we are costing Great Britain £400,000 net per annum, and we are keeping in our waters a i-umber of ships, many of them obsolete, and which, if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Fisher got his hand upon them, would be put on the scrap-heap straight away. We are keeping upon those ships 3,000 trained British seamen. Should we not render better service to Great Britain if we said to her, " We will save you this expenditure of £400,000 per year, and will release these 3,000 trained British seamen, thus allowing you to spend that money and to use those seamen in keeping up Dreadnoughts, or in rendering whatever other service you please ; while we will provide on the Australian coast a navy competent to look after our coastal defence. ' ' That was our proposition, and I say that that policy was not only sounder, but represented a better Imperialistic policy than does the proposal of the present Government. It is a far more practicable policy; and it is a tangible one. The policy of the present Government is thoroughly unsound. There is nothing in it. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that there is no country in the world that hate stronger punitive fleets than Great Britain. That is to say, there is no country that has such fleets which can be sent to the uttermost ends of the earth for expeditionary purposes. There is no country in the world which is so strong upon the sea as Great Britain is. Yet Great Britain maintains all the year round upon her shores torpedo-boats and destroyers, which never leave those coasts. There is a young officer at present serving with our forces who has just gone through a twelve-months' course of training in the Imperial Navy. He was on the torpedo-boat service during part of that time. He told me that on Christmas eve, when he and other officers expected to be spending their time with their friends ashore, orders were suddenly received from the Admiralty in accordance with which the flotilla was forthwith sent out to patrol the North Sea. There is not a night in the year when these fleets are not patrolling the North Sea, and Great Britain never sends them from her coasts. She keeps them there all the year round. </para>

This is what he said, as reported in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 10th June -  " In regard to Naval Defence," continued Colonel Foxton, "every Australian has an aspiration to see his country make a beginning in the construction of a local Navy. In the fullness of time Australia may be able to boast that she has a Navy which must be taken into account by other nations. That, as I have said, is a national aspiration. " In the building up of that Navy," Colonel Foxton went on to say, " dependent we must be for very many years on the British Navy. We must do all things with a view to cooperation, so to speak, with the Navy of Great Britain in regard to organization, interchange of officers, construction of vessels, and armament. .  There are reasons, however, why a subsidy should be continued, and I would not for a moment reduce the present amount which we pay. I would rather increase it." </para><para class="block">Here is a man who has been chosen by this Government to represent its opinion and Australian opinion, and who is in favour of increasing the present naval subsidy ! </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I am not to be led away from my point. The <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> newspaper also asked me for my views on  Colonel Foxton's  statement. Referring to the remark about Australian " aspirations," I said that what we wanted was more respiration. It seemed to me that we were in danger of asphyxiation. We have had plenty of "aspiration" in the past; it is plenty of respiration that we want now. After these views had been expressed by  Colonel Foxton,  so violently in opposition to. the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> we had the next day Ministers coming forward with a statement that  Colonel Foxton's  views were not those of the Government, but were those of  Colonel Foxton  only. Before he left for England it was stated that  Colonel Foxton  was to be supplied with a brand new set of ideas, representing the views of the Cabinet. After he had been supplied with those views he duly left for England. I presume that he is now properly equipped with a brand new set of ideas, which have taken the place of his old ones, so that he will be able to express the views of the present Government and the people of Australia. I ask the Senate to bear in mind that this Conference is going to be a secret one. There will be no published record of it. In all probability we shall never know what  Colonel Foxton  said there as to the views of the Government. We shall probably never know what  Colonel Foxton  said as to the views of Australia on this defence question. It is deplorable that the Government should have sent to England a man so hopelessly out of touch with Australian opinion on every one of these vital points. Now we come to the military side of the question. The statement proceeds - </para>

As a matter of fact, however, the Deakin Government's proposal left the cadets entirely alone, and dealt only with the militia system.

The scheme of the Deakin Government was the most impracticable and foolish scheme ever put before any country. True, the youths would become trained as time went on, but at the outset they would be entirely untrained, though they would have to take the place of the existing militia system. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> scheme of the Deakin Government made absolutely no provision for the training of cadets.

                            <para>- It is, but the Fisher Government did not propose to steal it either. I can tell the honorable senator of one proposition we made. There are certain people who have become enriched as the result of Australian production, and who do not pay a single penny towards the taxation of Australia. These are people who own land in Australia and live elsewhere. The «Fisher Government proposed to impose an all-round land tax of rd. in the <inline font-style="italic">£i</inline> on those people, and to make them contribute to the expenses of the government of the country that is keeping them. </para>

On the other hand, they propose to borrow money, and make the people who are living in the country pay additional taxation. That is their financial policy. Did it need a genius to come forward with such a policy? Did it require a fusion to strike that brilliant financial idea? Why, it is as easy as falling off a log. I might not be able to make 5s. by my industry or my aptitude for business, but, if I were the biggest fool in the country, I could go down to the nearest pawnshop and raise 5s. on my watch. </para><interjection>

I am pointing out that this is the " new departure," the brilliant scheme of finance which this Government was brought into existence to initiate at a time when the financial position in Australia is most acute. According to the statement itself, the next eighteen months is going to be the most acute period financially the Commonwealth has ever had to face, and to meet it the present Government have evolved the brilliant idea of pawning their watch, and they call it a " new departure." </para>

Every man, woman, and child in Australia is pledged to the extent of £60 of borrowed money, and so I may well say we have borrowed nearly enough. </para>

I want to say that I am not an opponent of borrowing <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> if a good cause and sufficient justification can be advanced. People borrow in conducting their private business. But I see no justification for borrowing at present, and there are other means of financing the Commonwealth during the ensuing eighteen months. We are going to give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain, or some other alternative, and that will involve us in an expenditure of £2,000,000. So far as the Government are concerned, it is only necessary that Great Britain should say " Yes " to their offer, and they must find £2,000,000. </para>

How does the Commonwealth Government propose to find the money necessary to pay the interest on the £2,000,000? Let honorable senators bear in mind that if they do not give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> the existing financial obligations of the Commonwealth involve the raising of more revenue within the next twelve months. If they do not give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> a torpedo boat, or even the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline> to the Old Country the Government must find more money in the next twelve months. We proposed to find it by the imposition of a progressive land tax. </para>

However, I will put this simple question to honorable senators, which will clear up all doubts on the matter. Will any honorable senator on the Government side say that they will not introduce taxes on tea or kerosene ? The silence is painful. We know very well that what is in the minds of honorable senators opposite is that they will get the necessary revenue, or some of it, by taxes on tea and kerosene. </para>

No one realizes more fully than I do that we are faced with a most acute financial crisis in Commonwealth affairs, but at such a time the present Government come down without a single proposal to meet the financial stringency. I see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> smiling, but I remember that he addressed a meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall, at which it was proposed to present Great Britain with a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and he was a member of the Deakin Government whose Minister .for Defence submitted proposals in his defence Estimates, including one to buy guns to arm and defend the principal ports of Australia, and in particular the port of Newcastle, the most important .coaling station in the south-, em hemisphere. Newcastle is at present defended by obsolete guns, but when the Minister of Defence in the last Deakin Government came along with a proposal to buy two guns to defend that port, which would be a coaling port and a port of refuge for  His  Majesty's ships the patriotic Deakin Government cut out the proposal. Why did they do so? Because they found that to do what was absolutely necessary to keep the Defence Forces going as they ought to be kept going would cost more than the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue belonging to the Commonwealth. Rather than face Parliament with some proposals for new taxation, they cut out what was absolutely essential to keep the Commonwealth Defence Forces going. When I took charge of the Defence Department, what I found was that, so far from being able to give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain, we had only one rifle to give every ten rifle men in the country. After we had scraped up a lot of old rifles and put new barrels on them we were able to make the magnificent offer of one rifle for every five riflemen in the country. We were compelled, owing to financial exigencies due to the action of the Deakin Government, the men who now proclaim their interest in Imperial defence, to cut out all the senior cadet camps throughout the Commonwealth. We could not find the few shillings necessary to enable the senior cadets to go into camp. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Before concluding, I wish to say that I am not concerned with the fusion which now occupies the Government benches. I think that its consummation is a good thing from the standpoint of the interests of the party with which I am associated. I believe that it will result in a tremendous accession of strength to our party at the first election. Hitherto many members of this Parliament, under the pretext that they supported the same policy, have been accustomed to receive votes which ought to have gone to the Labour Party's candidates. The people will know in future that there is a distinct line of cleavage between them, and consequently will not be gulled as they have been. I sympathize deeply with the position in which some honorable senators have been placed. The fusion which has occurred has, I am reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> excited some attention even amongst our poets. I hold in my hand a poem, the inspiration for which was the following paragraph - </para>

                            <para>- A gentleman who signs himself Den. 1 wish now to deal with the excuse that has been put forward by so-called Liberals for their action in joining the recent fusion. They say that they did so because the Labour Party was attacking them in their constituencies. Stripped of its sophistry, what does that mean? What is the reason for our presence here? Am I here for my own personal advantage, or am I here to register the opinion of the people of Western Australia upon the legislative proposals which come before me? Am I not here to give statutory effect to their will ? My presence in this Chamber, I take it, is merely incidental. What is of importance is that the people of Western Australia should be able to place upon the statute-book the views which they hold. It is merely an incident whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> or myself or somebody else registers those views. But the excuse urges by members of the Liberal Party is that the one essential is not that they should register the will of their constituents, but that they should save their own political skins. Because a party with whom they say they held identical views was preparing to fight them in the constituencies, they turned their backs upon all their political opinions. </para>

                            <para>- That does not justify their change of attitude. The only question to be considered is, " Are these men standing by the pledges which they gave the electors on the hustings?" The question of principle is, "Are we carrying out the promises which we made to our constituents?" Are Senators Trenwith and Best in joining hands with Senators Walker and Pulsford doing what they promised the electors they would do? Certainly not. They are putting their own political well-being before the principles which they publicly avowed that they would stand by. When we get them before their masters - the electors - I am satisfied that the policy enunciated by the Fisher Government will find its way to the statute-book, while the vague generalities contained in the Ministerial statement submitted yesterday will be relegated to the waste paper-basket, to which they properly belong. </para>

                        <para>.- Such an enormous quantity of business is awaiting our consideration that I should like to get to it without delay I therefore intend to occupy only about fifteen minutes in discussing the question of naval defence, in which I take a very deep interest. But owing to the last few words uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I must devote about five minutes to a consideration of the political situation. It is astonishing how easy it is for us to see faults in others without being able to detect any in ourselves. I should have thought that a common-sense man like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would have said nothing about the political situation, because I am satisfied that the more there is said upon it the worse it will be for the Labour Party. We all recollect that upon a. certain date last session, its members joined in declaring that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> possessed the confidence  of the House of Representatives, and that within fourteen days thereafter, they turned him out of office. If ever a party proclaimed to the world by unmistakable acts that they were after office, and wished to gain the Treasury bench by whatever means lay in their power, the Labour Party did so. The idea of endeavouring to keep a man in office because they believed in his policy, and because he was in alliance with them, apparently never occurred to them. They were perfectly satisfied to support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> for years, but at last they began to think that there was £~ .13,000 annually attaching to Ministerial office. Accordingly, they said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> : " Twenty-seven of us have kept you in office for two years and three months. How long are you going to keep us in office?" Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> answered that question I do not know, but evidently they expected him to keep them in office for two years and three months, because within a very short time after voting confidence in him, they tapped him on the shoulder, and said : " Out you go." What absolute cant it is for any man under such circumstances to get up and speak as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did ? He endeavoured to explain away the circumstance that whilst the Deakin Party and the Labour Party were in the closest alliance, the latter was holding caucuses  all over the Commonwealth for the purpose of selecting candidates to run against every one of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> followers. Under these circumstances, was the present Prime Minister to sit down and do nothing to save his political skin ? Is he to be kept in office like a little puppy dog, whilst the Labour Party prepare to oust everybody else for this Parliament? Are we to allow that party to be the only party to organize? The whole thing is too shallow If my honorable friends opposite wish to get to the country upon this sort of cant, the sooner they  do so the better. I shall be very glad to meet them upon their own platforms. They have shown to the world that they think more of ,£12,000 a year, and of portfolios than they do of the working classes. I wish now to say a word or two upon the question of naval defence. The late Government acted quite wrongly in expending the £'250,000 voted by Parliament for naval defence purposes, in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> induced the House of Representatives to take that action upon the distinct understanding that the money should not be expended until Parliament had decided the way in which it should be spent. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in voting for that expenditure actually repeated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> very words. I think, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made a mistake in the action which he took. I do not admit that any Government have a right to repudiate a definite promise of that sort. The people of England forgave Disraeli for spending ,£4,000, 000 in the purchase of Suez Canal shares, because he did the right thing. I could forgive <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> if he had done the right thing; but he did not. He did absolutely the wrong thing; he wasted our money; and the moment he had acted, he went through the country saying to the people, "For eight years we have . .been fede-rated.  We have had seven Ministers of Defence, but they did nothing. See what a good boy am I. See what I have done. I have spent ,£250,000." My honorable friend spent  the  money absolutely in the wrong way. If I am wrong in what 1 have learnt, I am willing to unlearn ; but I do not think that I am. I have been taught by Captain Mahan, and by naval officers of all ranks, with whom T have conversed - admirals, captains, and commanders - that the important thing that stands before everything else is to help Great Britain to maintain the command of the seas.- I should not care if Hobart or Melbourne were blown to pieces, provided that we won the battle which was to determine that England was to be top sea:dog. What good would it be to us to have a cruiser or two to save one or two vessels laden with wool, and other produce or goods, if England was going to lose the battle, and the British Fleet to be sunk in the North Sea? If we had twenty armored cruisers, say, three or four in Australia, five or six in Canada, two or three in New Zealand, and two or three in South Africa, the hurrying qf these cruisers across the ocean might make all the difference in the world between England maintaining the command of the seas and losing it. How on earth can we do both ? Honorable senators on the other side, including my clear-headed friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> use contradictory terms, and exhibit confusion of thought. They all advocate a mosquito fleet to defend our ports  and coasts, and they say that this is to be done in co-operation with the Imperial Navy. The whole crux of the position lies there. I deny that it will be done in co-operation with the Imperial Navy. The very sentence which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Pearce read was, " If ever the Imperial Fleet comes to Australia, if ever the battle of the world is to be fought off Melbourne or Hobart, then torpedo destroyers and torpedo-boats will be of great use." Of course they would, if a thing of that sort should happen. But does any man. mean to say that the battle which is to decide the fate of the British Empire is likely to be fought near Australia? My honorable friend says that it might be fought in the Pacific Ocean. I quite agree with him ; but what will be the use to the British Navy of our few destroyers and torpedo boats if the great battle of the world is to be' fought in the Pacific Ocean ? It is quite likely that at the next Imperial Conference, the Admiralty will advise us that Dreadnoughts are not exactly suited to our requirements. What I think would best serve our needs would be scouts or armored cruisers of from 3,000 or 4,000 to 7,000 tons, with a speed of 25 knots per hour, and the best armament that money could buy. I believe that a fleet of that sort would be of infinite use to us, and to the Empire. I cannot see that' this mosquito fleet, or, as Captain Bellairs calls it, " this tin-pot navy," of ours, will be of the slightest good. My honorable friend spoke about the Imperial Conference. As I sent him a copy of my letter, I think he must know that on the 9th March last, a fortnight before the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> idea was started, I published a letter in the leading newspapers of the States, except the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which published only one-half of my letter about the cadets, in which I distinctly, said that I had no belief in a mosquito fleet, and pointed out the contradictory policies. " Here," I said, " is loyal New Zealand increasing her subsidy and willing to give two Dreadnoughts to the Old Country, and here is the great Dominion and Commonwealth of Australia wanting to get rid of a subsidy of £200,000, paid for the defence of its ports and coasts, and to break away from the Empire, and )ret using the words ' co-operate with the Empire,' which is a contradiction in terms." I pointed out that this contradictory policy would bring us to ruin, and suggested that an Imperial Conference of the whole Empire should be called at once, and should not separate until it had agreed upon a really co-operative scheme pf naval defence. At Home, I had the pleasure of talking to three or four admirals, and other naval officers, and I never met one such person who agreed with the idea of our defending our ports and coasts. Those who do adopt that view are simply giving way to the aspirations of a country which is striving after nation: hood. In order to please us and help us, they pretend to believe in our policy. I anticipate that the Naval Conference will point out that there is a much better way of achieving our purpose. Suppose that the whole of the oversea Dominions agree to a policy of local defence; suppose that Canada decides to defend her ports and to have a mosquito fleet all round her coasts; and suppose that Australia, with a coastline of  8,000  miles, follows her example, what possible help will that be to Great Britain in keeping command of the seas ? We may get our expenditure up to millions, and have an .enormous system of harbor and coast defence, but what good will that be when the stress comes and we have to fight for the supremacy of the seas? If any man will show me that, I shall be very much obliged to him. To believe it we will have to unlearn everything we have ever learned. I was astonished to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> say, in one speech, that he had the approval of the Admiralty for what he was doing. I cannot believe that he had. He sits silent. If he can point out to me in what article or despatch they have accepted his policy, I shall be obliged to him. </para>

We are going to do something which I think is selfish, and will not help old England at all. A remark of mine ' has been misunderstood. In my letter I distinctly slated that I did not believe that the Mother Country could for much longer keep up the two-power standard with a 10 per cent, margin. We all know that as regards the United States, which could not build, but could pay for twenty Dreadnoughts as against our five, it is simply impossible to keep up that standard. If Austria, goes on laying down three or four Dreadnoughts annually for many years longer, I doubt if England will be able then to have .a fleet double the size of the combined fleets of Austria and Germany. It is a deplorable thing that, with all our wealth and opportunities, we have allowed the Mother Country to bear .the great strain of its naval defence. My honorable friend perhaps did not see a return which was tabled at my instance last session, but not printed. Our share of the naval defence of England, taking it at <inline font-style="italic">£54.000,</inline> 000, is, on a population basis, .£2,400,011, and, :according to our trade, we should Day £2,470,000, but we have been paying the paltry sum of ^200,000 per year. Therefore I welcome what is called the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> scare as a kind of tardy admission on behalf of young Australia that we have been failing in our duty, that we sympathize with the Motherland, that we recognise that it was unfair to leave' her alone to keep up the two-power standard, that it was an awful burden to place upon her poor people, whose contribution is 15s. per head, as compared with our is.' or 2s. per head. Call it a scare if you like, but to my mind it was an admission that came from the hearts of the Australian people that they had been neglecting their duty. Virtually they said, " We have been neglecting our duty, but we are going to make it up to <inline font-style="italic">you</inline> in the future, and here is. a couple of million pounds for you right off." The Labour Party stepped forward, and, in order to curry favour with a certain section which supports them, they tried to throw cold water upon this little patriotic outburst, when the very reason of it was to show Germany that wc were determined that old England should keep ahead of her and retain the command of the seas. Did my honorable friend see the picture in <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> depicting the old British lion with young Australia, and Canada trotting round about, and the shadow of. the German Emperor in the distance, saying, " Oh, I wish I had cubs like those'? The Fisher Government would not allow the old British lion to have the cubs. When the cubs wanted to bark, and were prepared to bite a little, according to age or size, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> said, " No, you cannot, our policy is a better one. We intend to go alone. We propose to have a tin-pot navy, because it will mean a little work for Australian workmen." I should like to see Australians building all our ships. </para>

The only way to defend our ports is to defend our supremacy of the seas. I do not intend to go into the question of military defence,, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did the Prime Minister, unintentionally, a little injustice when he said that in his scheme the latter made no ' provision for cadets. The Prime Minister did not do as I wanted him to do; he did not adopt the compulsory system of cadets; -he said that that was to come ; but he most distinctly provided for cadets. </para>

He explained that it would require an enormous number of instructors to drill all boys between the ages of twelve and eighteen, and that, therefore, he proposed to bring in the system by degrees. He distinctly stated that 'the money he provided would increase the number of cadets at the rate of 10,000 or 15,000 per year. </para>

                            <para>- That is not in our platform, and it has nothing to do with our practice. As a party, we stood behind the Deakin Government for a number of years, and assisted them to carry out their platform, the greater part of which was our own. Whenever we wanted to get anything special, and approached <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> if we could assure him how the numbers were, we were pretty sure of him. But we got tired of that sort of thing. Wie did not gain much advantage from it, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was discredited in South Australia, and had no followers there until the fusion took place. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to tell an enemy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> But, before I sit down, I wish to say this of the New Protection : If I had known before what I know now, the Tariff would have been different from what it is. I was misled by the Deakin Government in reference to the New Protection. I told my constituents that I would support the New Protection principle. I was misled time after time. For that reason. I can never forgive the Deakin Government. If an. occasion arises again when the Tariff is opened, I shall see, so far as my votes go, that the farmers and the working classes get some benefit from the higher duties, as well as the manufacturers. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> who misled me and others, and who failed to do his duty. More shame to him, and the party that supported him. I should have been afraid to face the electors if we had not turned the Deakin Government out. </para>
