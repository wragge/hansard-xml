              <para>- I am very glad to get that information, because it has sometimes been suggested that the party which sits behind, me on this occasion has blocked business by adopting "stone-walling" tactics. My honorable' friend has frequently indulged in that statement, if not here, in Sydney, and I wanted to get this information in order to put myself right. I should now like him to tell me who asked for the Bill. The Bill may have been conceived in a good spirit.

On the other hand, I desire to point out what has already been done by agriculturists throughout Australia, and to emphasize the progress that has been, and is being, made without any effort on the part of the Commonwealth.

          <para>It is cruel for any man to talk in that fashion, seeing that whatever has been done has been prompted by consideration for the farmer. If the necessary provision had not already been made by the States, undoubtedly the passing of this Bill would be in the interests of the farmer. But I cannot help recalling the circumstance that within a few months we shall have to face a general election, and nt that time the "poor cocky," a class to which I belong, is much sought after. He is patted on the back, and told, " Poor cocky, you are badly treated." But it is most unfair on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staughton</inline> to suggest that the Bill is "another of these Socialistic schemes," seeing that the . Government has decisively declared in favour of anti- Socialism. Such a statement comes with ill grace from an avowed friend of honorable senators opposite. The Bill has been introduced into this Chamber because honorable senators have practically little else to engage their attention and to provide them with something to play with. </para>

              <para>- I am coming to that. At that <inline font-style="italic">time</inline> the farmers would not have wheels upon their ploughs. They were conservative, and the reason underlying their refusal to countenance the use of wheels was that their great-grandfathers did not use them. But since coming to South Australia, I have been surprised to see men working two- furrow ploughs. Then the three-furrow ploughs were introduced, and to-day as many as eleven furrows are worked, and, instead of a boy acting as driver, the person in charge of the plough sits on a comfortable seat and drives eight horses, or possibly more. </para>

              <para>- Provision has been made to minimise even that inconvenience. I repeat that to-day ploughs ' ranging from three to eleven furrows are in use. In South Australia stumps were troublesome. To get over that difficulty man's ingenuity devised stump-jumping ploughs. Instead of the mallee roots having to be grubbed out of the ground they were cut off level, and the stump-jumping plough was set to work. Once more, it was discovered that instead of it being necessary to cut down the mallee, great rollers dragged by engines could be used which would sweep down any bushes of moderate size. Scarifiers have been improved in a  similar manner. When I was a young man we had to walk over the clods and scatter seed by hand. </para>

              <para>- I could not, but I have seen men who could. I have sown on horseback so as to save my legs, because I always regarded sowing as about the hardest work done on a farm. But human ingenuity invented a seed-sower. I have sown 50' acres in a day with the machine. To-day we have machines that not only sow the seed, but deposit with it phosphates or other manures which the soil may require. All these improvements have been made since I became a farmer in South Australia. In Scotland we used to reap the crop with the sickle. I remember when the sickle was used in South Australia. Indeed, I read in a book published in Adelaide a little while ago that at one time, when there was a regiment of soldiers quartered in South Australia, their services were requisitioned to help to gather in the crops. Hay was cut with a scythe and gathered with drag rakes - clods and all. Later horse-rakes were introduced. Now we have every conceivable convenience for the handling of hay. By means of binders the crop is bound up into sheaves clean and convenient for handling; and the time and money saved in regard to stacking alone is very great. The advances made in reference to the reaping of grain have been enormous. The Ridley reaper was invented years ago. It marked a great improvement. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Martin, of Gawler, and others as worthy to be named as he, did much to . effect improvements, with the result that crops can now be gathered in at less than half  the expense formerly incurred. Winnowing the wheat in the fields used to be a very big contract. The turning of the winnowing machine was a very trying job. A man with the strengthof <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> was needed for the work. Sometimes, when my men were not very willing, I have had to buckle to and do the work myself. But now we have handy little motors for driving the machine, with the result that there is a great saving of labour and a wonderful increase of convenience. The introduction of damp weather threshers also led to the saving of a great deal of time. But to-day we have the stripper harvester, with which one man with plenty of horses can, not only reap, but bag a great deal of wheat in a single day. My reason for mentioning these improvements is that I desire to give all credit to individualism. The suggestions made by farmers themselves have brought about many of the inventions. I recollect another of C. H. Spurgeon's sayings. In his John Ploughman's talk he said - </para>

I should really like to know whether the diplomatic leader of the Senate really cares about the measure. I fear that it has been brought in merely as a plaything. I have shown what the farmers and manufacturers have done. It is going but a step further to show what the State of South Australia, is doing by means of its Bureau of Agriculture. I hope that the Senate will excuse me if I read a few extracts dealing with this question. I have here the report of the South Australian. Department of Agriculture and Intelligence for the year 1907-8, the latest available. One of the means adopted by the South Australian Government to encourage agriculture is that of subsidizing agricultural shows. On this subject the report says - </para>

              <para>- I am speaking in a general way, and I have the information that South Australia spends in connexion with the work of the Agricultural Department ,£85,000 a year. The agricultural, horticultural and ' viticultural interests are all considered, and, as I have said, some fifty societies are subsidized. I find the statement is made that ,£256 were spent in prizes for exhibits of dairy produce, flowers, fruit, pigs, poultry, vegetables, jams and preserves, and wine. I come now to deal with experimental work, and I quote the following : - </para>

            <para>In the early days of the State, much of the experimental work was carried on in connexion with the Agricultural Bureau; but, generally speaking, the experiments were confined mainly to the growing of seeds introduced at various times into the State through the agency of the Central Agricultural Bureau. </para>
            <para>In the past the State has had to look to the Agricultural College at Roseworthy for guidance in matters pertaining to agricultural affairs ; but obviously practices of that institution, evolved after years of experiment, could not be taken as a safe guide for districts with utterly different conditions of climate and soil. In 1904 the Agricultural Department was re-organized, and special prominence was given to experimental work. An effort was made to establish in each important agricultural centre a series of experiments. These plots have in . the past been carried on more for demonstration purpo'ses than on purely scientific lines, but considerably more attention will have to be paid in the immediate future to the scientific aspect of experimental work. </para>

          <para class="block">No doubt honorable senators are aware that there is an agricultural college established at Roseworthy, in South Australia. There is there also an experimental farm of 1,500 acres. The college and. farming operations are in the hands of competent and able men. The students are taught not only theoretical but practical agriculture. I may tell honorable' senators that on one occasion I had the honour to be invited by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cockburn,</inline> who is well known in South Australia, and was Minister of Agriculture at the time, to act as an examiner and judge of the practical work carried on on the farm. We watched the boys catch their horses, and noticed how they handled them, harnessed them, yoked up their ploughs, and put up their poles to do the work on the farm. The students are employed throughout the year on similar work. I do not know how many attend, but the .number must be large. As the farm is an experimental one, established for educational purposes, farmers are once or twice each year invited ro go there. They may have to pay a few shillings for a ride in the train, but that is all. At the Roseworthy station they are met and taken in 'buses to the farm. They are invited to see how the farm is worked a little before harvest time, in order that they may judge the results of the labours of those attending the College, and see what the Government are endeavouring to do for the agricultural education of the people. </para>

          <para class="block">Is there not a great deal of useful work included in that list? Although I have referred to Roseworthy College and the work done there, I may say that experimental farms are now being established in many other parts of the State, for instance, at Carricton, Hammond, and parts of the State where the rainfall does not exceed 10 or 1 2 inches per annum. It is clear that different methods must be adopted in such districts from those which are successful at Belalie and Jamestown, where there is a rainfall. of from 18 to 19 inches per annum. I ask honorable senators whether it would not be reasonable to look for better results from the operations of those who have personal knowledge of local conditions and variations of climate and rainfall than we could expect from operations conducted from one centre. I presume that the proposed Bureau would involve a great deal of expense. </para>

I am glad to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is present, because he is entitled to a great deal of consideration for having devoted so much time and trouble to the question of dry farming in America, and bringing seeds therefrom to the Commonwealth.

              <para>- In the precincts of this chamber the honorable senator showed me various kinds of seeds which he procured in America, and I can imagine the great trouble to which he must have put himself in order to obtain them. I would not for a moment try to take any credit from the honorable senator for the good work which he did in that respect in the interest of the Commonwealth. For  three years, these kinds of wheat have been tried in South Australia :  - Marshall's No. 3, Yandilla King, Federation, Carmichael's Eclipse, Comeback, Gluyas, Petatz Surprise, and Gallant. A table is supplied showing the average yield of each kind of wheat during that period. It has just flashed across my mind that in South Australia in 1867 - the year in which the Duke of Edinburgh arrived in Australia - we had some magnificent crops, being as high as the fence, and equal to 20 bushels, or over, per acre. But the red rust came, and they were not worth reaping. I refer to Alma Plains. </para>

              <para>- No; the crops were only fit to be burned. The State was also troubled with smut in the crops, that is, little balls of soot instead of wheat. It entailed a loss in every respect, being a filthy thing to have in the wheat. South Australia had to grapple with these difficulties, and I suppose with others. I do not wish to claim any particular credit for the State, because, although it is doing much, other States are doing equally as much, and, in some cases, even more, to 'assist the agricultural industry. These questions were discussed at conferences by practical men, and with the selection of the right kinds of wheat - that is, wheat less likely to be affected by rust - and the application of a solution to kill the fungus of smut, those troubles have practically disappeared. It will be seen that the education of the farming community has never been overlooked. That question has been brought before the country by leading agriculturists, it has been dealt with by scientific men, and the people are deriving benefit from their efforts. From a book which has recently been published in Adelaide, let me give a little information on the question of how the State helps the producers - </para>

Here cereal-growing, stock-rearing, dairying, wine-making, and other pursuits are practised. At Parafield, comparatively close to the city, 80 acres are devoted to the testing of wheat varieties, and to the improvement of wheats by cross-breeding and selection. In the dry areas, with an average rainfall of about 10 inches annually, two experimental blocks have been established. A small area of reclaimed swamp land is cultivated at Murray Bridge by the Agricultural Department in order to demonstrate to occupiers of similar land the best crops to grow and methods of cultivation, and at Kangaroo Island test farms have been started. </para>

            <para>The past year was again  a  record one, the quantity of produce treated and the profit made on the working of the Department both being in excess of the previous year. The removal of the slaughter yards from Dry Creek to Port Adelaide was completed, thus bringing  all  the various branches together, and the increased  accommodation  enabling from 4,000 to 8,000 carcases per day to be treated was proved to be a necessity during the rush of the season. The Department is now completely equipped to cope with the large quantities of lambs, mutton, fruit, butter, cheese, eggs, poultry, honey, &amp;c, that may be forwarded for shipment, and excellent facilities are offered for storing produce to be placed on the local market. </para>

              <para>- It is not my object to extol "South Australia at the expense of any other State. I admit that in some respects Queensland is in advance of South Australia. I repeat that,- some years ago, when the farmers of my own State were sending their cream to the merchants, they had a suspicion that they were not receiving a fair deal. The matter was brought under the notice of Parliament during the time that the Price Government held office. As a result of the complaints which were made, the Government decided to establish a butter factory, to which the farmers might send their cream for treatment. It was not the policy of the Government to make a profit out of the undertaking. They merely desired to assist the producers. Whether there was any substantial reason underlying the complaints of the producers that they were being " got at " by the middleman I do not know. But I have met a great many farmers who have said, " Since the Government butter factory has been established at Port Adelaide, our cows have been giving richer cream." What has been the result of the establishment of that institution ? Last year it not only paid its way, but the suppliers of cream had the satisfaction of receiving a bonus of£500 for distribution amongst them upon apro <inline font-style="italic">rata</inline> basis. That is what the Price Government did for South Australia. </para>

              <para>- I was afraid that I would tread on the corns of private enterprise in this connexion. The South Australian Government naturally desired to act cautiously. But when a small surplus was forthcoming, it was considered a fair thing to hand back that surplus to those to whom it belonged. I am showing that the South Australian Government has done everything possible to assist the farmers, and that it has been the means of placing them in a much more satisfactory position. When I was a member of the Legislative Council of South. Australia some years ago, and phosphates were beginning to be used, there was a suspicion that the manures were mixed with inferior ingredients. Accordingly an Act was passed to compel dealers in phosphates to have them tested and to guarantee their quality. That is one other direction in which the State has come to the aid of the farmer. Yesterday I asked a. question of the Vice-President of the Executive Council as to whether any money had been placed on the Estimates for the purposes of the Bureau of Agriculture. He said that that had not been done. I find, however, that there is a sum of  ^250  for the purpose on the Estimates. The amount is wholly insufficient. The Bureau, if established, will cost thousands of pounds. I have shown that in the opinion of the Ministers of Agriculture of the States this Bill is not necessary, and that it will cause overlapping with what the States are already doing. As a friend of the farming community and in their interests, I shall, therefore, vote against the second reading of the measure. </para>

            <para>.- We have listened with much pleasure to the speech of the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat, in which he has been so reminiscent of his experiences as a farmer, and has detailed in so pleasant a fashion the progress made in agricultural pursuits in South Australia. But though I listened to him intently, I listened in vain for any cogent arguments against the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture. As an account of the progress made in South Australia the honorable senator's address was worthy of attention, but as a damaging criticism of this Bill I fail to see that it contained any strong points. I thank the honorable senator for his kindly references to me, which quite disarm anything which I might have to say in criticism of his speech. Those who know anything about the progress of agriculture in South Australia will probably place that State first amongst the States of Australia in reference to development in the face of adverse conditions. I believe that we have there the best dry farmers of Australia. They have done more to show what can be done bv the intelligent conservation of water than has been done in any other part of this continent Tt would be well if farmers in the other States would take lessons from what the South Australian farmers have accomplished. </para>

We owe to South Australia the stump-jumping plough, and she has taught us the proper method of working that great territory in the northwest of Victoria, which is close to the South Australian border. Consequently, I thoroughly indorse everything that has been said with regard to South Australian agriculture.

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs gave considerable attention to the subject, but he was not the member of another place who submitted the motion, though he spoke strongly in its favour. Since then the subject has been on the programme of each Government that has held office in the Commonwealth. The Fisher Government intended to bring in a measure to establish a bureau. At length we have made a definite advance. We are now face to face with the Bill for the purpose, so that we now have to say definitely, yea or nay, whether a Department of Agriculture shall be established. We are no longer discussing an academic motion, although it would be quite easy to make an academic speech on the subject. One could occupy hours in discussing it. But that is not what we are concerned with now. The task of those who support this Bill is to give reasons in justification of the introduction of the measure, and those who are opposed to it will, of course, be justified in giving reasons as to why it should not be passed. I support the Bill very heartily. I am not, as has been sneeringly suggested, a farmer. I have not cultivated land to any great extent beyond my own half-acre. But I claim to have probably as keen an interest in farmers and their work, in land settlement, and in the prosperity of the people engaged in its cultivation, as has any other member of the Commonwealth Legislature. I have represented farmers in Parliament for the past twenty-five years. Unless they thought that I was in touch with them and their interests, I do not think that they would have sent me back so many times without a single defeat. Therefore, I consider that  i.  can claim some little authority for venturing to speak on their behalf. It would be a truism to say that the importance of agriculture cannot be over-estimated. At the present time, in view of the complex conditions of modern life, and the uncertain future that faces every country in the world, it seems to me that the one outlet, the one hope, the one salvation, for the nations is in the land which their people cultivate. The late French Premier, M. Meline, in a very interesting book, called <inline font-style="italic">Back to the Land,</inline> has pointed out that the only way out of the <inline font-style="italic">impasse</inline> in which industrialism has landed us, is to get our people more and more on to the land. In the old Roman days agriculture was looked upon as the highest of pursuits, and for many long years after the time of the Romans agriculture held a. similarly high position. As a matter of fact, the first book on English husbandry was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Anthony</inline> Fitzherbert, a Judge of the Com-mon Pleas. But the increase of trade and commerce during the last century, the spread of manufactures, the augmentation of foreign trade since 18,30 or 1840, and the flooding of British markets with foreign grain due to the opening up of the United States, Canada, and Australia, caused considerable areas of land to go out of cultivation in Great Britain, and tended very greatly to the aggregation of estates which has been in process there. By these means people have been driven off the land, and so it has come about that the tillers of the soil did not hold the same position in the estimation of the public that they at one time did. They came to be c looked down upon, and their occupation carr.e to be considered as not one worthy to be placed on a level with those of professional and business men. Numerous instances could be given in proof of that assertion, but there is no occasion to do so now. It can scarcely be denied that farming came to be regarded as no longer gentleman's work. It was all right as a hobby, or a pastime, but not as a means of earning a livelihood. But a great change has come over agriculture and over public opinion concerning it in recent years. The farmer to-day is not the mere hewer of wood and drawer of water for others, that he was looked upon as being a generation ago. Science has become wedded to agriculture, and the union has elevated the industry. This union has increased production from the soil enormously, and the utilization of scientific methods has improved the status of the people who are so engaged. Science has ameliorated the conditions under which they are working ; it has cheapened production ; it has eased the burdens of the agricultural community; it has eliminated the element of chance, which at one time ruled to a greater or lesser degree, in regard to agricultural operations; it has led to increased yields, and profits have become greater than they ever were before. For my own part, I should have liked many years ago to go on to. the land, but the opportunities were not available to me. But both my father and I represented farming electorates for many years, and we were both in close touch with farmers. I have watched the development of our great northern plains. I have seen men battling there against courses of bad seasons, and forced ultimately to abandon their holdings. My. father did much to alleviate their lot by means of irrigation, and I have taken a keen interest in the same subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> yesterday referred to the fact of agricultural areas becoming depopulated. There was a great rush to the north of Victoria in the seventies, when there were one or two good seasons. It is true that there is not, perhaps, one farmer there now to ten who were there some years ago. The soil has gone out of cropping into grazing, and settlers have melted away. Efforts were made at that time, and have been continued, to settle people on the land, but there has been no sustained and energetic effort to keep them there. If, twenty-five or thirty years ago, we had had the knowledge we have to-day, and had understood the up-to-date farming methods now adopted in South Australia and other places, very different results would1 have followed from our efforts to settle people on the land. We have made some attempts at irrigation, but through lack of knowledge they have been, to  some extent, failures. Useful as the work of our Agricultural Departments has been, they have done very little to keep people on the land. From the lack of experimental farms, on which settlers might be shown the best methods of agriculture, the real settlement of this country has been delayed for a generation. I must confess that of late years the State Agricultural Departments have been putting more vigour into their work. I do not blame the expert officers of the Departments, but the Ministerial heads, who have kept men with brains and talents for agricultural work at routine clerical and administrative work. They should have been permitted to follow the bent of their minds in endeavouring to discover how to" cheapen and increase production. The work of those who have been engaged in testing has been more in the direction of demonstration than of experiment. Speaking of the work done in Victoria, I say that good as the work of our agricultural colleges has been, I know of no man who has come from  those  colleges who has stamped his individuality upon the agricultural methods of this country as men have done in other lands. Governments in new countries have greater obligations to those engaged in agriculture than have the Governments of old lands. It is not right that the pioneers should bear the whole of the risks. When people come to a new country, of the conditions of which they have very little knowledge, and perhaps are required to adopt a system of farming to which they have been unaccustomed in the past, it is the duty of a Department of Agriculture to help them in every way to a knowledge of the best means of performing their work. We are told that we do not require a Federal Agricultural Bureau, because we have a number of State Agricultural Departments. I ask honorable senators to say whether they think that the State Departments do all that is necessary at the present time. Do we not know that each State Department is working only for its own State, and that its work is limited to the boundaries of that State? National considerations are not taken into account and, to a great extent, each State Department is ignorant of what is being done by the others. Owing to the adoption of new and improved methods, farmers in South Australia are raising satisfactory crops in districts with an average annual rainfall of only from 10 to <inline font-style="italic">12</inline> inches. Yet we find that in New South Wales, at  Narromine and Wellington, with a 16-incb rainfall, the crops last year were a failure. It is not a question of quality of the soil. The failure was due to improper tillage. If we had a body with some co-ordinating power the farmers of Narromine, Wellington, and other places might be shown what farmers are doing in districts with a lighter rainfall, and so would be able to avoid failure in the future. </para>

              <para>- No, it was due to the fact that the farmers did not till their land properly, and did not conserve the rain when it did fall. The farmers of South Australia have learned how to conserve the water in the soil, and so they are able to raise good crops in districts that have a comparatively light rainfall. Farmers in that State get crops giving 40- bushels to the acre, whilst the crops in other States are comparative failures even' though they are blessed with a better rainfall. I know that we have some valuable institutions such as the Hawkesbury College in New South Wales, the Dookie and Longerenong Colleges in Victoria, the Gatton College in Queensland, and the Roseworthy College in South Australia. No doubt these institutions are all doing excellent work, but they do not reach the actual farmers, chiefly because co-operation and coordinating power is lacking. We must judge by general results what we are doing in Australia. Our yields, for example, are almost the lowest in any part of the world. This is . a new country, with virgin soil, and perhaps the finest climate in any part of the world, and with a fair average rainfall - The average production of wheat per acre in the United Kingdom is 33 bushels; in&gt; Germany, 28 bushels; in France, 19/ bushels; in Canada, 21 bushels; in the United States, 1.4 bushels, and gradually rising; whilst the average for Australia, leaving out the small production in Queensland and Tasmania, is only 9 bushels per acre. The production of barley is, for the United Kingdom, 35 bushels ; Germany, -37 bushels ; Canada, 30 bushels -r United States, 25 bushels; and Australia,  only  19 bushels. Oats - United Kingdom. 46 bushels; Germany, 38 bushels; France, 27 bushels; Canada, 40 bushels; United States, 30 bushels ; and Australia, 10 bushels. Potatoes - United Kingdom,  tons per acre, and here a yield of between 2 tons and 3 tons per acre is considered a good yield. The average yields I have quoted are based upon the returns for a period of seven years. There is no question so important to Australia as is its agricultural development, because it is on that we have to depend for the money coming into this country. What we use ourselves brings in nothing, but our exports give us a return. Taking the last figures available, I find that the value of our exports of the products of the soil is £48,691,850 ; specie and metals, £21,521,116; and the balance from other sources, £2,611,281, making the total of our exports £72,824,247. </para>

              <para>- It is from the soil that we derive our wealth, and we should do what we can to increase productions. Speaking now of our total production, the figures are :- From land, £101,570,000; from mining, £28,301,000 ; from manufacturing, £37&gt;575. 000 J °r a total of £367.446,000. Honorable senators will see from the figures that agriculture is our mainstay, and should be given more attention than any other industry that we have. If the State Agricultural Departments have not been so successful as they might have been, the responsibility . is not upon the expert officers of those Departments. There are many .fine men. amongst them, but, instead of being able to devote themselves diligently and closely to their work, and to concentrate their attention upon their investigations, they have been obliged by the various' Governments to undertake so much of the ordinary routine and administrative work, of their Departments that we could not hope that their professional work would be successful. Very few of the State Governments in Australia have realized the possibilities of this country in regard to agriculture. We are asked, and will be asked, how by means of this Federal Bureau, we are to realize them.  1  would say that Federation is quite as much required to deal with agricultural matters as to deal with any other matters with which the Commonwealth authority has been intrusted. A Federal Agricultural Bureau is necessary to do work which the State Departments have not done, are not doing, and cannot possibly do, for the country as a whole. lt is said that officers of the State Departments might, by meeting in conference, coordinate their work, and so carry out the duties of the Federal Bureau. The adoption of such a course would lead to results similar to those which followed the creation of the Federal Council. Representatives of different States met in that Council, passed resolutions, laid down platforms, and initiated policies, but nothing ever came of them, because the Council had not the power to compel the States to give effect to their legislation. Conferences of representatives of the various State Agricultural Departments might do some little work in the direction of coordinating agricultural information, but they would be ineffective to forward the general interests of agriculture in Australia. The representatives would he concerned about State interests rather than about those of Australia as a whole, and we require the establishment of a Department which would take a wider view of various questions than could be expected from the representatives of the 1 separate States. There are questions concerning agriculturists in all of the States that require the attention of a far-reaching and all-embracing central organization. I wish now to touch upon the question of bounties. Some two years ago we made provision for the payment of £430,000 by way of bounties upon agriculture and other products. At that time I made a strenuous effort to delay the payment of bounties, and to secure, instead of what was proposed, the establishment of a Department for agricultural experiment. The Senate did not agree with my proposal, and on a division only nine supported it, as " against fourteen opposed to it. My contention then was that it would be better to educate the farmer than to  give  him a bounty. I considered that w&lt;» would obtain much greater results bv imparting the education first, and, if necessary, giving the bounties later. But we have granted the bounties, and the administration of them needs supervision by a Federal authority, who can examine what is being done in the States, point out the mistakes which are being made, and put on. the right track those who are endeavouring to cultivate particular products in order to gain the bounties and increase the production of the Commonwealth. That is one reason why, in my opinion, we require a Bureau of Agriculture. It is a very large sum which has been appropriated for the payment of bounties. We do not want to see that money frittered away, and the few thousand pounds which the Federal Department will cost for some years will be nothing in comparison with the amount which will be paid in bounties if we provide for proper supervision. The Commonwealth has sole power, not only in regard to bounties, but also in regard to Customs and Excise, and trade and commerce with foreign countries, and among the States. All these matters touch agriculture very closely indeed, and, to a great extent, its success depends very considerably upon the exercise of those powers. We need a bureau for the collection and the dissemination of agricultural intelligence. We want to learn from those older and more advanced countries in which experimentation and demonstration are carried on every day, and whose farmers are far ahead of ours. We are not learning at present, simply because each State is only trying its own system, and there is no central authority to go afield and bring into use improved methods. We require to know the latest methods of cultivation and production. We need an accurate knowledge of the markets in other countries, with regard to not only prices, but also the kind and quality of the products required there. Our farmers have to face the competition nf other lands. To-day the finest agricultural implements and machinery in the world are in the hands of the, lowest-paid labourer in many countries. Our agriculturists have to face this competition. Only a moiety of their products can be sold in Australia, and markets for the balance must be found outside the Commonwealth, so that we need an intelligence department to ascertain the latest methods of agriculture in regard to machinery, cultivation, seeds, and other branches of the industry. A bureau is also ' required for educational work. Yesterday the Vice-President of the Executive Council laid considerable stress upon the scientific investigations and discoveries which are being developed every day in other lands, to an extent which, perhaps, honorable senators have little idea of. We require a central authority with power not only to collect this information from other countries, but also to distribute it amongst the States. Then, inasmuch as we are controlling trade and commerce, surely it is necessary that our bed-rock industry - the great source from which our commerce comes - shall be brought under Federal control. Again, there is the carriage of produce. That is a most important matter to the producers, but at present each State is simply making its own arrangements. Our producers require cheap safe carriage in sound, fast boats, and with the best kind of cool storage, in order that their products may be put on foreign markets in the best condition and in the quickest time. In America all these matters have had to be brought under Federal control. We shall not secure a satisfactory trade with other countries, or get our goods valued as they ought to be, unless they are sent away bearing upon them the stamp of Australia. Outside countries do not know of Victoria or Queensland or New South Wales; they scarcely know the names of those States, but they do know of Australia. In the markets of the world the stamp of the Agricultural Department of the United States on any goods is ac- 1cepted at once as a warrant that they are sound, and they find a ready sale. We all know that one bad shipment will spoil <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> market for a product. If a bad shipment were to go from Victoria, it would spoil the market for the product to both New South Wales and Queensland. We need Federal control, in order to insure that only products of the best quality shall be exported. Then there is the great question of coping with animal and vegetable diseases. It is necessary that the Commonwealth should establish a bureau, in order to prevent the introduction of diseases in animals or plants or seeds. It will have to take in hand the. eradication of such diseases if introduced. A disease may exist in one State, and it will use its utmost endeavours to eradicate it; but it will not trouble about the eradication of a disease in another State. The Commonwealth needs authority, in order to see that  diseases are properly and quickly eradicated. The necessity for Federal control was learned in America when Texas fever and pleuro-pneumonia broke out and decimated the herds and flocks. It was found that the States were absolutely incompetent to cope with those diseases. It was not until the Federal authority intervened and took strong measures that they were stamped out. </para>

              <para>- No, because the Federal authority has not been able to exercise full control. Each State is merely concerned with clearing its own territory, and not with what is happening to its neighbour's. For that reason alone we require a bureau, not to override the State authority, but to co-operate with it, as the Federal authorities did in the United States, where their efforts in this direction have been so successful. We need a bureau to search in other lands for improved seeds and plants suitable to Australia. Much of the success of agriculture in the western States of America has been due to the adoption of that policy in the United States. In the nineties the eastern lands were filled up, and largely owing to careless cultivation the settlers there had become disheartened. People were entering the country by the million and more a year, and had to be provided with land. The only land available was that west of the 93rd meridian, which marks the humid portions of the Republic from the arid and semi-arid portions. For the first time the United States sent men to all the arid countries - to the plains of the Don and the Volga, to Asia, to Africa, and to other countries, in order to search out seeds and plants which would be suitable to the land west of that meridian. Bv their introduction, agriculture in the Western States has been revolutionized. In Australia, however, no one is engaged upon work of that kind. A year or so ago, Secretary Wilson, of the Department of Agriculture, said, " We will not admit that we have in the United States an acre of bad land. Wherever a herb or a shrub or a tree can grow we know that there is some plant of economic value which can. grow there as well as a plant which is of no value. We will never rest until we discover that plant." So to-day the Department has men in all countries with similar conditions, searching out, and forwarding, year after year, seeds, plants, and roots of all kinds. By this means, a population has been settled in places which only a few years ago were looked upon as deserts. </para>

              <para>- Presently I shall quote some figures on that point. In some of the Eastern States there is a drift to the towns, but I can assure the honorable senator that in the Western States the drift to the land is', and for the last three or four years has been, enormous. Of late the study of plant breeding has come to the front. When I visited the Old Country, four years ago, I had the pleasure of calling at the Garton Brothers' place, at Newton le Willows, in Lancashire - a wonderful place - where plant breeding is carried on, and where I spent an afternoon with one of the firm. I found that on a few acres of land a wonderful work in plant breeding was going on. They were breeding plants and seeds suited to any country in the world. If a dry country wanted seeds they would search dry countries for them, and bring them, to their place, where they would  pollenize  and fertilize until they got something they required. If they got an order from a moist or swampy country, they sent to a like country for seeds. Still more wonderful, however, has been the work of Burbank, who has been called a wizard, and who, I suppose, if he had lived a few hundred years ago, would have teen burned. He takes the seeds and the pollen of dissimilar plants, brings them together, and enriches the world, year * after year, with absolutely new productions, not only gratifying the tastes of many people, but also enabling cultivators to make enormous profits. If honorable senators desire to know full particulars of the wonderful work which he has been doing, I would advise them to read  Harwood's  " Life of Burbank." In America, there is a man who stamped his individuality upon its agriculture, and that is  Willet  H.  Havs,  of the Department of Agriculture. Living on a farm, and his father dying when he was twelve years of age, he and an older brother had to take the work of the farm in hand, and they managed to get along. With the assistance of, first, a country school at odd times; secondly, an experimental farm ; and, thirdly, a college,  he gradually worked himself up from position to position, until he got into the Minnesota University. For the past four years he has been the head officer in the1 Federal- Department of Agriculture, under Secretary Wilson. In  1888  or  1889,  Hays took in hand - and it requires genius to succeed1 - the improvement of the corn, oats, flax, and grasses of ' Minnesota. He has laboured with his plant-breeding experiments until he has completely revolutionized agriculture in that State, and indeed throughout America. He has gradually increased the yields of these crops by  10, 20, 30,  and even  50  per cent., and to-day the Minnesota plant-breeding station, which he has established, is one of the finest places of the kind in the world. It is estimated that at an expenditure of  $20,000  the  1 90S  crop of the State had an additional value imparted to it of  $2,000,000.  He has done admirable work in the matter of seed improvement, but he has also turned his attention to stock, and is now the executive secretary of the American Breeders' Association. That association not only takes cognizance of seeds, but also of stock. Its membership includes persons from all parts of America, and its shows are recognised as one of the great national features of that country. If similar work were performed here how much would this country be uplifted ? Our agricultural production is valued at more than  £100,000,000  annually, and if we could increase it by only  10  or  20  per cent, what an immense additional return that would mean. It would impart an impetus to settlement by attracting persons from abroad who read of our wheat yield of only  9  bushels per acre, when we knew perfectly well that we can produce - and, indeed, are producing, in some parts of Australia -  20 30,  and  40  bushels per acre. But whilst the States continue to work separately we shall not get the development in agriculture that we should have. </para>

              <para>- I wish to help them. The work that is proceeding throughout the world in connexion with new plant breeding is reducing agriculture almost to an exact science. Experts are constantly experimenting with different pollens, which they cross. I know a man in this State who is endeavouring tq obtain a new cereal by crossing wheat and maize, just as Burbank crossed the potato and tomato, and produced a new plant which he called the pomato. Is all this great work to proceed elsewhere, and is Australia to take no hand in promoting the development of its foundation industries? Then there is the scientific research work, to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council referred at some length. The preservation and standardizing of our products are questions which are well worthy of our attention. The cheese which is sent from Canada to England is almost identical in quality and character, so that it commands almost a uniform value. We require to standardize our productions so that our customers may know exactly what they are getting. The questions of vegetable diseases and pests, and of labour-saving appliances should also be investigated. In almost every country labour-saving appliances are being invented, and I am happy to think that in this connexion Australia is doing its share. We have mechanics who are putting into the field some cf the finest agricultural implements to be found in the world. In Canada, the cost of taking off crops amounts to  8  cents per bushel, whilst in the Commonwealth it ranges from  is.  6d. to  2s.  per acre, so that it cannot be urged that we are behind the times in that respect. But it is desirable that we should let the world know exactly what we are doing. At Home the people generally know of Australia - they do not recognise the States. We want to maintain the reputation of Australian goods, and we cannot do that in the absence of Federal control by a Department of Agriculture. Of course, we do not desire to overreach the States in any way. There is a sufficiently large field available to permit of all working in it. We wish the Federal Department of Agriculture to preside over the work that is being done by the States, and to co-operate with State agencies in supplying our producers with the most up-to-date knowledge. Such a Department could advise the States of the information which it has obtained from other countries, and, in turn, could accept advice from the States. Properly controlled, a Federal Bureau of Agriculture such as is sketched in this Bill will be a new agency and power in connexion with agriculture in Australia. Of course, a great deal will depend upon the individual who is placed in charge of it. Indeed, that consideration alone will determine whether or not it is to be successful. The Government ought to select for its head a man with the widest possible experience. There are plenty of Australians who would be able to fill it if they had had the necessary experience elsewhere. I know of one man who .could fill the office, but even he would be better equipped if he first visited other countries, and then brought back with him the knowledge which he had acquired there. I have seen too many cf these Departments with mere faddists - mere clerks - at their head.. We cannot expect a Federal Bureau of Agriculture to be successful unless we have as its principal a practical man who thoroughly understands his business. What are other countries doing in this connexion? In Canada the matter of the Federal control of agriculture was first brought prominently forward in 1887. " About that time an Act was passed under which experimental stations were established under the Dominion Government. The Canadian States have colleges and other institutions of their own in. which they are doing good work; but the experimental stations are under Federal control. Experimental farms -were established in Canada in 1885, and to-day the expenditure upon them amounts to ^181,000 per annum. The result of the work that has been taken in hand by the Federal Government there has been that in eight years, by adopting improved methods of cultivation, by thorough tilling of the soil, and by seed selection and improvement, the yield of oats has been increased by 23J bushels per acre, that of barley by 12 bushels per acre, and that of wheat by 4f bushels per acre. These results have been brought about by the work of the Federal Government. In addition, Canada has a. standing Committee of Parliament - a Commission whose business it is to exercise supervision over agriculture throughout the Dominion, and .to make recommendations to the various State institutions and to the Government for the good of the industry. The work of this Committee has been wonderfully successful. Why should not a similar Committee be appointed here? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">The Canadian States, I may mention also, have their own colleges. I suppose one of the finest of these is that at Guelph, in Ontario. A few months aso I had the pleasure of spending more than half a day there, and I must say that it is a wonderful place. President Creelman told me that when these colleges were first established they were of very little use. They imparted information to the students attending them, but they were unable to lay hold of the great body of farmers. The latter would not attend them. Thereupon the colleges resorted to the expedient of broadcasting bulletins free of cost, and sending men among the farmers, and thus they have caused the institution at Guelph to be recognised as one of the finest, if not the finest, institution of the kind in the world. The United States has accomplished far more for agriculture than has any other country. As far back as 1794 Washington spoke very strongly of the necessity which existed for the people of those States doing all that they possibly could to encourage agriculture. He said - </para>

              <para>- When the adjournment took place, I was referring to the fact that Washington, in his last message to Congress, alluded to the desirableness of establishing means for improving agricultural methods in the "United States. He himself would have opened a National Bureau of Agriculture, but felt that he could not carry the proposition. He therefore left that last message to Congress before resigning his duties. Five great steps have been taken 'in this matter in the United States. The first step was taken in 1839, when Henry Ellsworth, of Connecticut, secured an appropriation with reference to plants and seeds, which were distributed throughout the country. That was a beginning. The second important step was taken in 1855, when an appropriation was made for the purposes of entomological work. Insect pests were very troublesome in the United States at that time, and Congress made a liberal appropriation for the purpose of investigating and eradicating them. The third step was the establishment of the present Bureau of Agriculture in 1862. I interjected yesterday, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> was speaking, that the Bureau had been established seventy years. I should have said that it was established seventy years after the commencement of Federation. Washington's idea was promulgated in 1797, but was not carried out. When the Bureau was established there were in the United States 30,000,000 people. Congress passed an Act for the establishment of an Agricultural Department for the purpose of investigating and developing the soil resources of the United States, and analysing soils, grains, fruits, manures, &amp;c. That was really the commencement of the great institution which America has to-day, and of which she is so proud. The fourth step was also taken in 1862, when, under the Morrill Act, grants of land were made in every State of the Union for the purpose of agricultural and industrial colleges. At these institutions, not merely was agriculture taught, but also various handicrafts, although agriculture was the primary subject dealt with. Under that wise Act every State now in the Union has a magnificent agricultural college, in addition to the experimental farms to which I shall refer later on. The fifth step was taken in 1887, when, under the Hatch Act, £r44.000 per year was voted in perpetuity for experimental stations for original research, agricultural education, the testing of soils, seeds, and methods in all branches of husbandry. The wonderful advantages that these three institutions - the central departments, the colleges, and the experimental stations - have conferred upon the United States cannot possibly be measured. Not only is instruction given in farming, but if any farmer has any difficulty with diseases, alkaline soils, or pests, he is able to go to the experimental station and secure advice from the best experts. Moreover, they will visit his farm and he will get all the necessary advice to enable him to get on to the right track. I had the pleasure of visiting the Agricultural Department at Washington twice. To go through that institution is almost an education in itself. One has to see to realize the important work that is being done. I should like to point out here that the United States Government gives no bonuses for agricultural production. Congress is willing to spend millions on education, but not a dollar will it give by way of bonus. That seems to me to be a very sound policy indeed. The growth of the Department in all its branches of knowledge and business has been very extensive. Its scope now embraces animal industry, biological work, plant ' industry, life processes, physiology, pathology, intelligence and statistics, foreign markets, a weather bureau, an experimental stations branch, and irrigation investigation-. The Department is thoroughly in touch with all State local bodies. The work of the weather bureau in itself is very wonderful. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> tabled a motion last night with reference to this subject, and I was sorry that he did not accept the offer of the Government that they would look into the matter. He made a mistake in forcing the motion, to a division. I spent half-a-day in the United States Weather Bureau, and am thoroughly of opinion that ever\ year this branch saves, in respect of both property and human life, ten or twenty times as much as it costs, to the people of the United States. I trust that our own authorities ' will be able to push on their work in this direction as soon as it is possible to do so. In regard to all these matters we require a central authority. In America the Department of Agriculture takes control. It conflicts with no State or local body whatever. It is in touch with all of them, and co-operates with them for the good of the people. The Department shows a readiness to help all round. The appropriation made by Congress in the </para>

          <para class="block">United States last year amounted to £2,692, 153. That is an enormous sum. Of course, the United States is a rich country, although last year there was a deficit of £2,000,000. - The Government can afford to do this work, and provision is made for it with a lavish hand. Of the 30,000,000 people employed in the United States in various occupations, no fewer than 10,381,765 are employed in agriculture. So that over one-third of the working section of the population are . so engaged. The number includes 9,404,429 males and 979,336 females. Those figures are taken from the latest census returns, dated 1900, but the numbers must have been very largely increased since then. The salaries paid to the officials of the Bureau of Agriculture are not large. The highest salary is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hays,</inline> who, however, is paid only $5,000 a year. The other salaries vary. The librarian receives $2,000. The work is not really expensive, having regard to the enormous services that are performed. America, of course, has enormous areas to occupy and cultivate, and she has had., for many years past, a huge accession of population year by year. The Department of Agriculture is enabling the people to push things ahead. Without the Department agricultural development could not have taken place as it has done. We have not such an enormous yearly accession of population, but, at the same time, we want to be ready for developments, and ought to make preparation for settling people when they come to us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> this morning observed that in the United States there was a great rush of people from the land to the cities. But, as a matter of fact, the great rush in America to-day is to the western States - those States west of the 93rd meridian, which thirty years ago were marked in many places as "desert." People went there once or. twice in great rushes, but were beaten back because no provision had been made for them. No experimental work had been done, to enable them to learn how to cope with the difficulties, and to manage the soil in the best way. But the United States Government was wise,, and set to work to establish experimental stations. In Wyoming and Colorado, for instance, there is an elaborate organization for taking people in hand, settling them on the soil, and showing them what to do, and how to do it. </para>

              <para>- That may be true with regard to the eastern States, but I paid more particular attention to the west, because the conditions there are analogous to our own. Before I. came away from the United States on my last visit, I wrote to the authorities in Wyoming, Colorado, and Kansas to obtain the latest information. I did not know that I should have to speak to-day on this question, and have not all the answers with me. But the Kansas letter came by the last mail, and I shall quote it to the Senate to show what has taken place. The letter is from the Department of the Interior, General Land Office. The homesteads referred to in it are not, of course, large tracts of land, but consist of areas of only 160 acres each. The letter is as follows- </para>

          <para class="block">The figures for Colorado- and Wyoming are even more remarkable. These facts show how people have made homes for themselves in these western States, and how land that was formerly thought to be beyond hope of cultivation has been made habitable. The people are doing well upon it, because of the efforts of the Department of Agriculture backed up by the local experimental stations. It is known to honorable senators that I visited America on the last occasion especially for the purpose of taking part in a Congress relating to dry farming. It was wonderful to meet there so many men who had been engaged in overcoming difficulties that at first seemed insuperable. What I saw and heard was an education for an Australian. I do not intend to pursue the subject on this occasion. Honorable senators will find what I have had to say about it in the reports which. I have furnished to the Government, if they care to read them. Whether we form a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau or not I should like to see an effort made to bring together farmers from all parts of Australia for the purposes of a dry farming congress. We have men in South Australia who can teach people in other States how to set to work in the matter of dry farming. A conference between men who have been farming successfully under difficulties, in conjunction with the various agricultural experts, would be likely to lead to useful results. Some of the farmers would be able to. give valuable information to others as to how they have been able " to make a do " of things in various States. We are told that this measure has been introduced too early - that it is premature - that the United States waited seventy years before establishing a Bureau of Agriculture. But I would point out that the United States did not wait seventy years with the good-will of many of the wisest leaders there. If this is not the right time to commence, when will the right time come? Times are changing. We are moving very much faster than we did a few years ago. Fresh discoveries are being made day bv day. We ought to keep in touch with them. We cannot afford to lag behind the foremost countries in the matter of agricultural production. National development will inevitably follow the fullest development of our natural resources. We have in this country 4,500,000 people - 1£ persons to the square mile. Of this number one-half are residing in the cities. We cannot keep up our cities unless we have a successful back country. It would be impossible to do so. We cannot export what our cities produce. We shall have to use it up ourselves. Therefore we want to develop our back country, and then we can send out the products that we do not require for our own consumption. Our manufacturers cannot compete with the manufacturers of other lands, who have the advantage of employing cheaper labour and working their employes under harder conditions. We do not wish to introduce those inferior conditions into- our country. Ergo, let us develop our agricultural resources as much as we can. Let the people who are here already attract others from outside, by showing how the soil of Australia can be successfully cultivated. I notice that the delegates to the Chamber of Commerce Congress were surprised at seeing such a magnificent country so sparsely populated. I do not wonder that they were surprised. But as I said a short while ago, when speaking . on the High Commissioner Bill, I believe that the tide will very shortly turn. America is getting filled up. Australia is becoming better known. I believe that within a measurable distance of time we shall have a great stream of immigration to this country. It is our duty to be ready to receive it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that he regards this Bill as a mere placard. I do not. I look upon it as a useful measure. The question has been asked whether an appropriation has been made for the purpose of the Bill. But I should like to know what would have been said by honorable senators opposite if the Government had placed an appropriation on the Estimates for this purpose. Would it not have been said that they were guilty of impertinence in proposing to appropriate money for something of which Parliament had not yet approved? We need not, I think, pay much heed to that criticism. The subject is one about which a good deal could be said, but I do not desire to take up any more time. I can only say, in conclusion, that I regard the Bill as being in the interests of Australia as a whole, and that I shall give it my cordial support. </para>

He complained, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell had not stated any good reasons why the Bill should be opposed. The honorable senator then took upon himself the responsibility of giving reasons for the passing of the Bill. He commenced and has finished his speech, but during the whole course of it he mentioned no substantial reason for the establishment of a Federal Agricultural Bureau. He did not show that such an institution is necessary. He gave the Senate a good deal of the history of agricultural development in the "United States. But every one must recognise that that development was inevitable and did not depend upon the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau. </para>

The same kind of thing is taking place <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> Western Australia. The Government of that State have established an Agricultural Department, and they never abject to any reasonable expenditure in order to provide experts in every branch of agriculture. Capable men are employed whose knowledge is not confined to the Agricultural Department. If a farmer in Western Australia requires the knowledge and experience of an expert he can secure his services by application. The services of these  agricultural  experts are given free to the settlers in all of the States. Towards the close of his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> put the question : "If the time has not now arrive for the establishment of a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau, when will it arrive?" If he really required an answer to his question his own line of thought should have led him directly to it. The time. for the establishment of such a bureau as is provided for in this Bill will arrive when the Commonwealth has cash to spare j when we have a surplus enabling the Government to create unnecessary billets. </para>

              <para>- What is there in addition contained in the four corners of this measure? I venture to say that this Bill does not make provision for a solitary thing that is not .already provided for in every one of the States. I go further and say that there is no work indicated by this Bill that is not already being carried out in the States. I have listened to lectures by .agricultural experts, and have conversed with them, and I know the difficulties against which they have to contend. When they have demonstrated that a certain thing can be done they are very seldom able to induce a farmer to devote even one little plot of ground to an experiment. He wants to see the other fellow do it first, and after the other fellow has shown that it can be made a success he is prepared to follow. The States are now spending thousands of pounds on this work every year, and if the Commonwealth takes it over I suppose we shall have to go one better than the States. If the- State Governments are spending £50,000 on the work the Commonwealth Government must get a little ahead of them, and will probably spend £60,000. </para>

He wants immigrants without the prospect of their employment ; I want them to come; but I want them to have something to do when they come. -That is the only difference between my honorable friend's position in respect to immigrants and mine. I want the country to suit the man. I want the country to be placed at the man's disposal. I do not want the man to be brought here as a mere abject slave of the conditions of the country if they are bad. The Bill contains no provision which is likely to encourage immigration. Each State is doing its best in that direction, and I think it would be superfluous on the part of this Parliament, which to-day professes to be flooded with State Righters, to assume for a moment that it can profitably take control of agriculture.

The policy of the late Government is that which was read to both Houses by the Governor-General, and it does not contain a single syllable relating to the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture. The Minister has been merely making remarks which are not warranted by facts. </para>

              <para>- I am relying upon an authoritative document which I have at hand. I am quite satisfied that this measure has been introduced for no other purpose than to supply the Senate with a stop-gap. That can easily be proved by the attitude which has been taken up by the Prime Minister on this subject. Notwithstanding statements which he has made, this Bill is before the Senate. That is, I think, rather playing with politics in a way which should not be tolerated. If there is no real business to be done, it would be far better for the Senate to adjourn, and await the submission of an urgent measure which the Government intend to push to completion. I protest against the time of the Senate being occupied with the discussion of a measure of this kind. I admit that it has led to the delivery of some informative addresses, especially by Senators W. Russell and McColl, but surely the time of the Senate should be devoted to the transaction of real work, not to the consideration of a Bill which is introduced for no other purpose than to provoke talk. We are now approaching the end of the session, as well as the end of the year. Surely there are some useful and needful measures which could be submitted in place of this Bill ! Even if the Government were in earnest, and the Bill were placed on the statute-book, of what real use would it be? In the first place, is the Commonwealth going tq perform anything which the States - who are the proper authorities to act - are not already doing or trying to do? Not a single thing. The State Agricultural or Lands Departments are 'carrying out everything which the Commonwealth can possibly do, and in a much better way, because they have the means for conducting experiments, whereas we have not. I could understand that, after the Commonwealth had acquired the Northern Territory, or other property, it might be desirable to establish an institution in order to discover new methods of agriculture suitable to our northern latitudes. In such circumstances, I could understand a measure of this kind being brought in ; but its introduction at the present stage is neither more nor less than a mere waste of time. After all, what are we asked to do ? We are asked to supply ' assistance to a class who are very well catered for by the State Governments. In the absence of such assistance, I could understand the Commonwealth Government intervening and submitting a legitimate proposal for the consideration of this Parliament. There are many ways in which we can get rid of our surplus cash in the near future which are entitled to much more consideration than is this proposal. If it were proposed to strike out in a. new direction, the proposal would have some merit, because it is easy to see that there are directions in which a new departure might be taken, so far as the utilization of land is concerned. But we are asked to establish an Agricultural Bureau, to go over ground which has already been traversed by the States ; in fact, to do no more than supplement the work which is being done in each State. To my mind, that is an unnecessary task. If the States had  agreed  to the abandonment of their various efforts, and to the establishment of a large central institution, which could take this work in hand on a bigger scale and in a more scientific way - if the Government had come to an understanding of that kind with the States, there would he some justification for them rushing into the work, but there has  been  no such understanding.

Surely no better proof than that is required that the Bill has been brought in to supply the Senate with something to talk about, and with no other object? I am far from thinking-- </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator imagines that he has made a very smart interjection. In whichever way I think, I act independently. I try to think consistently with the principles that I hold. I do not think as certain influential men may want me to think, or barrack for them, either. I stand for the same principles all the time, and try to think consistently with them - a habit which the honorable senator would do well to try to imitate. There is one work which might be taken up by the Commonwealth, but which is not touched by this Bill, and that is the training of our unemployed men who would desire to go upon the land, if qualified in that way. My opinion is that Australia is not going to be a great manufacturing country. I do not think that we have the necessary advantages to become a great manufacturing people as a competitor with other countries. Our large towns are ever being shown to contain a much larger population than can be provided with employment. There is a tendency for persons to leave the country and concentrate in large towns. I do not take that as a sign that people would prefer to live in the towns if equal opportunities in the country were provided. I dare say that there are many persons in towns who would gladly live in the country only that they cannot gain a livelihood there. The fact that many men who had been engaged in manufacturing industries have failed on the land is a very good proof that a departure of some kind is called for. The number of farms which have been taken up from time to time, and which have ultimately passed out .of cultivation, or fallen into the hands of large land-owners for pastoral or other purposes, is a very good proof that a large proportion of those who went on to the land had not the necessary training to become successful farmers. If this measure proposed to give to that section of the community - and I believe that it is a much larger section than we imagine - an opportunity to acquire the necessary training, it would be aiming at a useful object, but no such proposal is made. All that it is proposed to do is to extend facilities to the well-to-do farmers and big land-owners - to supply such persons with information how to be more successful. Not the slightest effort, I repeat, is made in the direction of helping the men to whom I have alluded. I anticipate, and every indication seems to show, that there will be a much larger increase in agriculture in the future than there has been in the past. It is the small men whom we have to cater for and assist. Areas which previously were considered unsuitable for agriculture have been proved, in recent years to be good wheat-producing lands in Western Australia ; land which at one time was considered a desert .is now producing wheat of the best kind, bringing the highest price in the world's market. In view of the fact that the drier areas, or the areas with a light rainfall, are now proved to be good farming lands, I hold that, if the present ratio of increase is maintained, agriculture must of necessity be our principal industry for many generations. For that reason I would have welcomed a departure in the direction of educating the working men who, from time to time, are thrown into that great army of unemployed, which, I am afraid, will continue to exist for a considerable time. There is no better way in which we can assist men who may be thrown out of the manufacturing or mining industries, especially gold-mining, than by putting them on the land. I, as a Labour man, know that it is thought that by increasing the number of persons on the land we are increasing the number of our opponents. But that is a secondary consideration. I believe that the farming classes will come to recognise that their best friends after all are the members of the party to which I belong. The Labour party has  always  done its best to assist them. It has done so whenever any question of special interest to the farming class has come up for consideration. I am of opinion that if our country is ever to be utilized to its fullest extent in the future, it must be by means of a small farming class. But, so far as I can see, no provision is made in this Bill to encourage such a class. Nor is any effort to be made to cope with the curse of unemployment. Unless, however, something is done to deal with that curse in a wholesale fashion, it will be with us in the future to a greater extent than it has been in the past. If we are anxious to increase our population I hold that we should do everything possible to enable the unemployed to earn a living in the way in which they would be likely to be most successful. We have plenty of empty spaces in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has referred to the Chamber of Commerce delegates being surprised at the empty lands .they saw while travelling through the country. Those gentlemen did not know, however, that all the land which they saw was already privately owned. If we want our lands to be utilized we shall require labour for the purpose. We have plenty of people in our towns who, if they could be shown the way to become successful farmers, would be glad to take up land and to earn their liv-   ing upon it. But this measure does not propose to do anything in that direction. I remind the Senate that the States have already done much to assist the agriculturist. Railways have been built into the agricultural districts - lines that in the opinion of many were quite unnecessary. In some States the produce of the farmer is collected, a market is found for it, it is sold by Government agents, and the money received for it is paid over to the producer. Colleges have been established for teaching farmers in a scientific manner how to make the best of their land. The State Government supply them with publications to keep them abreast of the latest knowledge. The States having been engaged in this useful work, it is scarcely necessary for the Commonwealth to do the same sort of thing. We ought to strike out on new- lines. If we could seriously tackle the unemployed problem we should do well. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> yesterday made the remark that the unemployed  are quite unsuited to go on the land. We ought to train them. The first step that ought to be taken by the Commonwealth Government is to acquire suitable land, and to establish a Government farm upon it. We should teach settlers the art of cultivation, and assist them to find land for themselves. What do we do for the unemployed at present? When they congregate in our big cities in sufficient numbers to become a menace, we set them to work to shift sand or paint the fences around our public parks. We adopt merely  temporary means of getting over a permanent  difficulty. </para>

              <para>- They have always shown themselves willing to take all that the State could do for them, and ask for more. I can remember a time when a well-known Commonwealth politician made the proposal that if people would not settle on the land in Western Australia the Government should establish a farm and work it as a Government Department. He went so far as to say that the Crown lands of the State should be worked as Government farms. That idea was thrown out by the present Treasurer of the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, in a. speech at Bunbury, ten or twelve years ago. </para>

              <para>- No, he is eminently practical. If he is removed from the State milch cow for ever so short a period he cries loudly until he gets back. The question of dealing with the unemployed which I have mentioned would, if seriously taken up by the Government, do more credit to them than anything that they have yet proposed. I know of nothing that would add so much to the prosperity of the country than the education of those who would, if they had the opportunity, go upon the land. If we have money to spare let us establish State farms, and let every man who desires to learn farming have an opportunity of so doing. By that means we shall undoubtedly add to the  population and prosperity of Australia. But the present Bill holds out no hope in that direction. Unless the Government can show that they intend to take up some new line of activity that the States do not at present follow, the measure can be of no advantage to the country. </para>

If, however, the usual fee was not so high, the account  should not be paid, but should be sent back for reconsideration. The point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> apparently desired to make was that this fee was claimed by a man whose views are in accordance with those of honorable senators on this side of the chamber. I have hoard correspondence of that kind read here before now. I do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sutch</inline> has done anything wrong. </para>

            <para>- I have 'no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> thought he was making a great exposure when he read this correspondence. If honorable senators on this side cared to hunt up documents it would be very easy for them to do the same kind of thing; but we do not consider the course followed by the honorable senator is altogether the correct and dignified thing to do. Time and again questions have been put in this Parliament which have evidently been inspired by those in office. I might refer to the questions which were put in another place with respect to the amount paid to members of the Postal Commission as expenses. Those questions were quite evidently inspired by those who are in office at the present time. I might have retaliated upon the gentleman who inspired them in a way which would have made him smart. . I did not do so, because I do not approve of that kind of fighting. I like to fight openly and fairly. </para>

            <para>- That is another matter. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> had made his object clear in this case it would have been much more satisfactory. I may be wrong, but what I gathered from his remarks was that he wished to bring into prominence the fees charged by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sutch,</inline> the secretary of the Woodworkers' Union, for attending the Court and acting practically as counsel during the conduct of the case. I do not know in what capacity <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sutch</inline> appeared, nor do I know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woolf</inline> engaged counsel. If I had known that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> intended to bring this matter up <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> should have fortified myself with the facts. </para>

            <para>- Very well.' Comrade Fisher, as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. the intention being that- the people of the Commonwealth should pay his fees. I think it is generally recognised that for work of an intellectual character in a Court the fee usually paid is much higher than that paid for manual labour or secretarial work. If a professional lawyer like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is entitled to charge a higher sum for appearing in Court than he would be entitled to charge if some one engaged him to dig his garden - and I do not suppose the honorable senator would get very much for digging, because he would not be worth very much at that work- </para>

I have been informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sutch</inline> did the work which he appeared in the Court to do' better than a barrister could possibly have done it. He is as intelligent as the ordinary barrister - I say that without any disrespect to the legal profession - and, in addition, possessed a practical acquaintance with the subject before the Court. If that be true he was entitled to a very much higher rate of remuneration than he would have received fs an ordinary woodworker or as the secretary of a trade union. He was engaged in that particular case as a specialist. </para>

            <para>- Why should I not refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> ? Every one knows that the honorable senator is on the roll as a lawyer, but whether he is a lawyer or not I do not know. I know that he has sent in some remarkable bills of costs that have had to be considerably reduced. </para>

            <para>- The feeling of honorable senators on the other side appears to be that as this man Sutch is an ordinary woodworker, belonging to a trade union, it was presumption on his. part and extortionate to charge a fee of five guineas for attending this Court. </para>

            <para>- If he had been a member of the legal profession he would probably have charged fifty guineas a day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> says there would be no objection if the union paid his fees. But the union claims that the Commonwealth should pay them. They go further, and claim that they have saved money to the Commonwealth by employing this man to represent it; instead of hiring some expensive and inefficient lawyer. </para>
