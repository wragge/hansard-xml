                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;10.40&#93;. - On this clause, which really involves the kernel of the very momentous question which we have been debating, I desire to record an emphatic protest against any business bargain or arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth being put into the Constitution. I do not propose to move an amendment, because I do not wish to introduce anything which may be of a subsidiary nature, and which may be only regarded as one element in the larger concrete question which we are considering at this stage. I think that I would fail in my duty if I did not point out the extreme inconvenience and the danger of adopting the practice of putting into the Constitution commercial bargains of any sort or description. It was not framed for that purpose, and there is no more necessity for doing that sort of thing here than there is in regard to the business arrangements between man and man. We are forgetful it seems to me, of all that we have done in the past ; of the provisions, and the effect of the Constitution under which we are working. Of course, when it was framed by the Convention - and it was framed in point of fact, by the people, as the result of the two-fold referendum - there were certain matters introduced which were more or less of a business nature, whether of a temporary character or not - temporary, I think, for the most part, but that was because the Constitution at that stage was in itself a bargain. The moment it emerged from that category, it became the Magna Charta of the nation. Under that Constitution, we have appointed a Judiciary, and made arrangements under which the Commonwealth and the States can be sued ; under which bargains entered into between them can be enforced just as bargains between individuals can be enforced. If we find that an arrangement is being made which ought to stand whether for a term of years, or subject to determination on notice between the States and the Commonwealth, we have a great tribunal - the High Court of Australia - for the purpose of enforcing contracts between the States and the Commonwealth, just as it enforces contracts between individuals. To ray mind, it is derogatory to the Constitution, and to us, and it is foreign to the character of the Constitution, that we should seek at any time to put in the Constitution any bargain which it may be essential for us to make between the States and the Commonwealth. There is no object in it It is making the &#34; ark of the covenant &#34; of this country a repository and a register of business bargains of more or less importance. That is not the purpose for which the Constitution was established. That is not the purpose for which we act under it, and it is not merely derogatory to our position, but wholly needless. If we enter into an arrangement, whatever it may be, for a proper bargain, to the advantage of the Commonwealth or to the advantage of the. States, there it is enforceable. I cannot understand on what principle it can be suggested that commercial arrangements for business bargains should be embodied  in  the Constitution. I hope that honorable senators  will  give their attention to that point of view, and ask themselves whether or not they are playing the Constitution very low down in making it a sort of receptacle for the registration of business bargains of that description.

                        <para>- In the first place, it is a variation, and, in the second, I doubt very much whether it could ever possibly prove a settlement. But I wish to call attention to the fact that it was not this Parliament which made or ratified that deed of partnership. It was not the State Premiers who made or ratified it; it was the people of Australia. Yet this Parliament coolly proposes to shear itself of all the power and authority with which the people of Australia clothed it. I have no objection to the repeal of section 93 of the Constitution, because it has already been virtually repealed by effluxion of time. </para>

It is desirable that the determination should be arrived at upon this matter to-day in order that a call of the Senate may be fixed for next week. The tactics which have been followed by the Leader of the Opposition will give the opponents of this Bill every advantage under our Standing Orders, because, should a tie result upon proposed new section  94B,  that provision will be resolved in the negative. Honorable senators opposite have therefore placed themselves in the best possible position to secure victory. The numbers entitle them to it, and therefore no advantage can be gained by an unduly long discussion. </para>

                        <para>- I protest against that statement. It is not an accurate one. Indeed, it is most misleading. If the Government are sincere in their desire to arrive at an adjustment of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, this Bill can be proceeded with, even if the proposal outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> be carried. Why can it not then be submitted to the people ? </para>

But nobody ever dreamed of doing such a thing. A similar remark is applicable to the scheme which has been propounded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> I wish to pillory the inconsistency of those honorable senators who oppose that scheme. A few days ago they taunted us with being afraid to put the proposed allocation of 25s per head annually to the States before the people. Under the proposal which has been outlined, that very allocation, stripped of every other issue, would be submitted to the electors. Let us see who are afraid to put it before them. </para>

                        <para>- From the honorable senator&#39;s own side it has been pointed out that if we do not attach a time limit to the agreement proposed by the Government, this Parliament and the people may, at any time, make an alteration in that agreement. If that statement be correct, the agreement in question is not a better agreement, because the proposal which has been outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> would have a fifteen years&#39; currency, whereas the agreement proposed by the Government might be altered at any time. I hope we shall have a straight-out issue submitted to the people, stripped of all conditions, so that this Parliament, at the end of fifteen years may have the power which it now enjoys under the Braddon section of the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>. - honorable senators are aware. I have given , notice of an amendment, the effect of which, if adopted, would be to limit the operation of the agreement to a period of ten years. But having discovered&#39; that the proposal, which has been outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> is more likely to prove acceptable to the Committee, I do not intend to proceed with it. Several honorable senators have signified that they are more inclined to favour a time limit than to support an arrangement in perpetuity. We are being placed by the Government in a most peculiar position. The Vice-President of the .Executive Council has informed us that if the amendment foreshadowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> be carried, the Bill will be killed. Why? Because, he says, an agreement has been arrived at between the Government and the State Premiers, and, if its terms be departed from. in the slightest degree, the whole proposal falls to the ground. But I should like to ask the members of the Senate of the Commonwealth to have a look at themselves, to examine their position, to ascertain what power they have. According to the Vice-President of the </para>

                <para>Executive Council they have nothing to do here but register, or refuse to register, an agreement which has been made with people who have no standing whatever in the affairs of the Commonwealth. This agreement, so far as this Parliament is concerned, is not worth the paper it is written upon. It has been made with individuals or officials who have no standing in this Parliament. It is an insult to the Commonwealth Legislature. Just look at the thing. We were elected by the people of the Commonwealth to look after their affairs. Yet we are told that if we refuse to accept an informal arrangement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and individuals who have no standing in Commonwealth affairs, and who have no more right to speak than any ordinary man in the street, the Bill will be killed. What a position in which to place the Parliament, of the Commonwealth! The acceptance of it would deprive the Senate of the right to discuss a Bill submitted to it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s intellect appears to me to be exceedingly short if what I have said is 1 &#34;a bit tall.&#34; We are told, &#34; Here is a measure which, if you alter it by no matter how large a majority, the Government will withdraw.&#34; Is that not a. threat held over our heads? Is it not a distinct intimation that we are not free agents? I maintain that when a Bill is laid upon the table of the Senate, it becomes the property of this Chamber. If it does not, then this gathering, which is dignified with the name of a Senate, is a mere farce, and we are only pretending to legislate; we are here merely as a recording machine for some outside power. Some honorable senators are fond of talking about the caucus. The caucus never attempted anything like this. This is caucusism intensified a hundred fold. It rs caucusism which stabs the representative idea in its most vital part, and which takes away from a House of Parliament its representative character. We become mere instruments for registering the dictates of some power outside. I ask honorable senators to assert themselves. Some of them have been sent here by the votes -of over 100,000 trusting citizens - men and women who believed that their interests could be safely placed in the hands of those whom they elected. Are they prepared to deceive the people who sent them here, and to hand over the affairs of the Commonwealth to persons with whom the Government were not empowered to make any agreement? In fact, there is no agreement. There can only be an agreement between people who have authority to come to terms. </para>

I would appeal to him, however, if <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> be possible to influence him at all, to remember that he is a representative, and has some responsibility to the people who sent him here. They expect him to scrutinize closely every measure submitted. They do not expect him to be terrorized by a threat that if any line of this Bill is altered, the whole thing goes by the board. The Government wish to place us in a position more dishonorable than any representative body ought to consent to occupy. </para>

                    <para>. - The utterance of the Vice-President of the Executive Council gives us a fair idea as to how the Bill was carried in another place. When we hear the whip cracked in the Senate, we can form an idea as to the pressure which must have been exercised elsewhere. If honorable senators are going to stultify themselves, and place themselves in such a humiliating position that they must not make any alteration in this so-called agreement, it will be a clear admission that we have totally abandoned our position in respect to the maintenance of State rights. Whilst I have every respect for the gentleman who represented Western Australia at the so-called Conference of Premiers, I have a much greater respect for the position I occupy with respect to the people of Western </para>

                <para class="block">Australia. That gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> represents only a small portion of the people.  His  position is so precarious, that, notwithstanding that he is anxious to go to London as Agent-General, his party will not permit him to go, because they know his seat would be in danger, and would probably be captured by our party. I mention this fact to show the nature of the representation of Western Australia at the Conference at which the agreement was arrived at. I represent every portion of the State. In the very town of Bunbury represented , by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> in the State Parliament, I headed the poll when I was returned. At the last election, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did likewise. The people of that electorate will expect us to do our duty when a question of this kind comes before us, no matter whether the Premier of the State gave his consent to what is proposed or not. I am not quite sure, indeed, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> did consent to this agreement. I do not know that he did. We have no proof. I do know, however, that so far as concerns the actual amount in question, little or no opposition has been shown. But there is a great deal more in this agreement than the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> sum proposed to be paid. There , is no denying the representative character of the Senate. There are six senators from Western Australia, as against the one gentleman who represented that State at the Premier&#39;s Conference. Are those six Western Australian senators to stultify themselves, and to admit that they represent nobody in Western Australia? Are they to accept, holus bolus, an agreement merely because it is alleged to have been consented to by one man from their State? The proposition is so preposterous that if it were accepted, the Senate could no longer be regarded as representative of the States. What is proposed in the suggested amendment is so eminently fair that the Government, if they really wish to place the question before the people of Australia in an honest manner, cannot possibly refuse to accept it. There is nothing catchy about the amendment. It presents a clear-cut issue. The Labour party has been twitted more than once with favouring the principle of the referendum on Democratic grounds. Therefore, it is urged that we cannot possibly oppose this referendum, but if the question at issue is put in such a way to the electors that it is designed to catch their votes, and to place us in a false position, we have every right to oppose it. To show our <inline font-style="italic">bona fides,</inline> and to prove that we are not opposed to the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, we ask that the question shall be submitted to the electors in a fair and honest way, and that there shall be no attempt to make points at the expense of political opponents. We desire the people to have a fair chance of registering, their opinion honestly, and the amendment gives that opportunity. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to emphatically deny that it would mean killing the Bill. If that were the effect of the suggested amendment it could only be because the Government would drop the measure and throw it under the table. Let me point out what the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is, so that there shall be no misapprehension. We have already agreed to clauses 1 and 2 and to clause 3. of the Bill to the end of the proposed new section 94A. That is the section which would repeal sections 93 and 94 of the Constitution. Now we come to the pro- posed new section  94B,  which provides for the payment of 25s. per head to the States in perpetuity. The course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is that if the Committee desires a limitation to the operation of the agreement - and if honorable senators are true to the pledges they have made, there is a majority in favour of the limitation - we should negative the proposed new section  94B  and substitute for it one suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline></para>

                        <para>- No; I am referring to what my honorable friends opposite are doing, and I find no fault with them. It is well known that under our Standing Orders, if the voting upon any question is even, the question is carried in the negative. For that reason honorable senators abstain from moving the insertion in this proposed new section of a provision for a time limit. That is an admission that they know that they have not a majority to carry it. </para>

If they knew that they had the majority of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> talks, they would have proposed such an amendment. It is because they know that they have not a majority that they are now seeking in a roundabout way to carry a time limit. They also know quite well that while they might succeed in striking out the proposed new section  94B,  they could never put in the amendment they have suggested afterwards. </para>

                        <para>- How can honorable senators opposite expect these who are supporting the Bill as a part of an agreement to stultify &#39;themselves by agreeing to the course they have suggested? Despite the appearance of surprise and indignation we know that the fact is that a manoeuvre  is  proposed. We know that  if  honorable senators opposite could strike out the proposed new section  94B,  that would be the most they could hope for. They know that they would be impotent to insert anything in its place, and the result would be that the Bill would be absolutely killed. </para>

                    JOSIAH SYMON .(South Australia)  &#91;11.25&#93;.  - I quite agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline>
                    first remarks, which, I think, were in better temper and less provocative than the later remarks he made. I agree that it. is unnecessary to re-open the second-reading debate, or to prolong the discussion. I - think there is no room either for any particular display of temper. What is proposed is to negative the proposed new section  94B,  with a view to substituting for it that which I believe a ma&#62;jority of the Committee desire, namely, the same agreement and the same bargain, with a time limit. The amendment foreshadowed by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    is the most direct and the best way in which to test the opinion of the Committee as. to whether, in the first place, the proposed new section  94B,  providing for the operation of the agreement without any limit as to time meets with the approval of a majority of the Committee - and if it does there is an end to the matter - or whether a majority prefers a time limit. If the majority say they desire to abandon the power given to us under the Constitution, and to put this agreement into the Constitution without any time limit whatever, there is an end to the matter. But if, on the other hand, they believe in their conscience that there ought to be a time limit, they will be given an opportunity, under
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline>
                    proposal, of saying so in direct and clear terms. I am not going over the whole of the ground again. I admit that I feel very strongly, and hold very pronounced views upon this question. I hope I have given, as I shall always desire to do, due consideration to the opinions and views of others. I have been most anxious to do so in this case, but I confess that I cannot understand how any believer in the principle of national unity, and in our national institutions - the highest of which and the one of which we should be most proud is Parliament - can agree to give up the power, small or great, with which the people have clothed&#34; us, and which they have asked us to exercise. No one has attempted to prove that we are unfit to exercise it. When I&#39; say &#34;we,&#34; I do not speak of the members of the present Federal Parliament. We are here to-day and gone to-morrow. The
                    <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline>
                    of. this Parliament is like the grass that perishes. Its time .comes and there is an end to it. When I say &#34; we,&#34; I mean the Federal Parliament in its corporate representative character. In my view, the condemnation sought at our hands is not the condemnation of this Parliament, because it is admitted we are doing what is right and fair. We are to be trusted, but we are asked to condemn the continuity of Parliament. We are asked to say that, although the bargain which we make is fair, and that if we were returned to the next Parliament -we should maintain it, the Parliaments subsequently elected by the people would not. We are asked to declare that the Parliaments of the future will not be fit to be trusted with the destinies of this country and the financial safety of the States; and we are asked, therefore, to take this power away from them lest they might use it mischievously. The question is a momentous one, and it is not to be met, if .the Vice-President of the Executive Council will pardon me for saying so, by references to manoeuvring for position, and that sort of thing. The provision we are now considering is one of abject surrender. If agreed to it will stand as a record of our confession of guilt in  respect to the Parliaments that are to come. It is a provision which hauls down the flag of our financial supremacy and control. For that reason I shall vote against it.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline>
                    suggestion is that we shall substitute the same agreement, the same concession, if you like, though I do not want to call it a concession, the same just right, if you like, as the States are getting under this provision, and give them  a  guarantee for a term of&#34; fifteen years. I do not think that they are entitled to a guarantee, but I am willing to sacrifice my own conviction and make the agreement for  a  term. There is no indignity in that to the Commonwealth. They can make their bargain for a subsidy for five or ten or fifteen years without loss of dignity.

                    <para>- I am not going into that matter. I am quite willing to do that, and for the reason that that is the period - from ten to fifteen years - which, the Prime Minister suggested as a time limit. I am willing to give more if it can be done. But we can discuss that when the second branch of the matter is dealt with. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said that he could not see into the future for more than ten years, and no one can blame him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> said the other night that he did not expect the agreement to last longer&#39; than the term of three Parliaments? Why is it to be put into the Constitution, if you please ? </para>

                        <para>- We ought to have no National Parliament if we cannot trust it. It is a reflection on the National Parliament and on us who are members of it when you ask for guarantees, pledges, and bonds that we shall keep our faith. It is also a reflection on the people who sent us here. &#39; We. are a Parliament chosen by the people, and  if  you say that such a Parliament .is not to be trusted, that it will break faith, that it will destroy without just cause an agreement fri a term of fifteen or nine years, and that you must have it put into the Constitution, von reflect upon the people. If the people me honest and choose an honest Parliament it is to be trusted with the finances of this country. If the people are not honest and will not choose an honest Parliament, then we had better abolish the Federation. We ought to be ashamed of being members of a Parliament which would confess such a thing, not of us, but because of some fear that the Labour party or the other party - I do not care which  - -Will  be in a dominant majority after the general election, and will try to break the public faith. That is indeed a . pretty position. At the close of his speech the other day, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in terms of eloquence which thrilled me, said, &#34; I do not understand this apprehension as to future generations. Brush aside all these fears.&#34; But are we to confine that brushing aside of fears to the people; why are we not to apply that to the Parliaments chosen by the people? Why are we to say that we are to be in fear of future Parliaments? If you distrust the Parliament you distrust the people who chose them. If you have a Parliament that will not maintain the public faith as plighted through acts of legislation; if you have a Parliament that will not maintain those rights, then its members will have to answer to the people. It is those who want to put this agreement into the Constitution who really do not trust the people. It is not we who wish to maintain the powers of Parliament who distrust the Parliament and the people. It is for that reason that I take the strong view I do in respect of this matter. The people ought to be made to understand that certain members of the Parliament say they are not to be trusted to elect honest Parliaments - for that is what it comes to - and certainly  they ought to be made to feel and understand that, as a precaution against this abuse of a privilege and a duty, we are going to take away a power which they vested in their Parliament because they are not likely in future years to elect Parliaments which can be trusted to exercise it. I was sent here to maintain the Constitution. I was sent here to maintain the powers of the Parliament, not to give them away. 1 was sent here to exercise those powers, not to abandon them. I was sent here to make bargains with, and do justly by, the States. But I was not sent here to accompany that justice with the surrender of powers of . Parliaments to come. If you pass proposed new section 94B it ought to be surrounded with a deep mourning band to signify to future generations the bereavement we are inflicting upon ourselves. Let us keep to the powers of the Constitution and we shall do well. Let us do justly, or if you like generously, by the States. We are here for that purpose. Let us give them this time - the longest time which the Prime Minister mentioned ; a longer time if you can show that it ought to be extended, or the term of three Parliaments, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> said - let us give them more time if they wish, and if it will console them in any way let us put the thing into the Constitution. Of course everybody knows that if a crisis, such as a war, or something that involved our immediate national existence arose, even the Constitution would not prevail. But the time for revision would be fixed. The time for ordinary revision, having regard to the fluctuations of revenue, population, and other things, would come in the ordinary course, and there would be no disturbance, any more than under the Braddon section as it exists, for the fifteen years. I think that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> put it very well indeed in saying that what we were going to try to do was to substitute something fresh for the Braddon section. I agree with that. But is there any reason why we should not proceed on exactly the same lines as that provision, which had a fixed time limit, leaving the matter to be dealt with afterwards by the Parliament ? Why should not the substituted arrangement be in exactly the same position? I do not wish to re-open that part of the discussion, but I would like to say a few words as to a point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has very candidly and, I think, very fairly referred, and that is the rule of the Senate with regard to a question passing in the negative on an equality of votes. I think that Senator&#39;s Stewart&#39;s method would &#39;have been a bad one. In my opinion, the proper method is to take a direct vote on the question as to whether this is to be an agreement unlimited as to time or not. I do not understand the Minister to complain of the fact that the rule is not at all in his favour if that method is adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I think that my honorable friend put the matter fairly. I would very much rather see the powers of this Parliament maintained by the enforcement of that negative rule than I would see it taken advantage of to takeaway those powers. To pass a Bill of this description, taking away a power of the Parliament by the vote of one man, is contrary to every Parliamentary and constitutional principle We ought not to do such a thing unless with a majority of substance, and how much more so when the question passes in the negative? If, as has been suggested, an amendment had been moved in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposed, we should not have got a direct issue or a direct vote, and we should, by the mere operation of the rule, have abandoned our powers. That would be a position of which the Parliament ought to be, to use the language of the boys, &#34;jolly well ashamed.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in his sense of fairness and constitutional susceptibilities, has put it very well. But, if it were a question of taking advantage of the rule, I ask every honorable senator whether, from the position of fair play and righteousness, and of fairness to the people of this country, it is not better to take advantage of it to prevent this serious thing being done, than to take advantage of it to let it be done ? It is said that the agreement is to goto the people. It is a double barrelled arrangement. It is going to the people, first of all, as a financial arrangement with the States, to which probably noone takes objection. But the other barrel is the surrender of this power; and the two questions are mixed up together. </para>

                        <para>- If the time were limited, you would have unanimity, and there would be no surrender of a power. In the other case, there would be an absolute surrender of a power. This Parliament would be saying to the people, &#34;We ask you to take this power from us.&#34; We can imagine honorable senators standing on the public platform for the purpose of expounding the effect of the proposed agreement and of the referendum upon it. Whilst doing so, a voice from the audience might ask, &#34; Why is this power to be taken from the Commonwealth Parliament; why does the Commonwealth Parliament wish to give it up?&#34; What answer could be given to such an inquiry? We should have to say, &#39; 1 Because the Premiers do not think that we are to be trusted, and because we think that future Commonwealth Parliaments are not to be trusted.&#34; That is the only answer which we could give to a question of that description. If we are fit to exercise this power, if we are an honest Parliament, we ought certainly to be careful as to what we do. If a doubt exists as to that, we ought certainly to solve it in favour of abundant consideration being given to the matter. We ought not rashly to take a step which may be irretrievable, and which will plunge the country into an agitation which the mere circumstances attendant upon a general election - vivid and active, perhaps, as they may be - will not equal. I only wish to add another word in reference to the statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the adoption of the proposal outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> would kill the Bill. As to the terms of the arrangement which has been made with the States, I certainly think that they ought to be maintained. But if those terms are to be accompanied by a surrender of power on the part of- the Commonwealth Parliament, I shall make every effort possible to defeat- the latter portion of it. If the proposal indicated bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> be carried, I do think that the Government - and I hope they will not imagine that I am presuming to be wiser than they are - ought to do what I take it the Prime Minister would have done had -the omission of the word &#34;The&#34; in the other branch of the Legislature been carried to his satisfaction - that omission is obvious on the face of the Bill - namely, regard it as an indication that Parliament wishes to attach to the operation. of the agreement a time limit. I take it that, if the omission of the word &#34; The &#34; had been carried to the satisfaction of the Prime Minister, he would have communicated with the State Premiers with a view to securing their acceptance of a time limit, so that the agreement in a modified form might be adopted and be in operation. That, I think, expresses what the Government in the discharge of their public duty - if they will allow me to put the matter in that way - should do in . this case. They desire to carry out an arrangement with the States. If the State Premiers refuse to accept a time limit to the agreement, the responsibility will be theirs. The Braddon section will continue to be operative, and we shall have ample opportunity, without surrendering our power, to adjust matters as between ourselves and the States. I do not at all complain of the Vice-President of the Executive Council declaring that the effect of deleting proposed new section  94B  would be to kill the Bill. That is a perfectly legitimate expression in political controversy. But when this Bill was first brought under public notice, its consideration was postponed for a period of two or three weeks, while more or less informal negotiations were in progress with the Premiers, with a view, as everybody understood, to inducing them to agree to a time limit. I do not see why that course should not be followed now. If the Senate, in the exercise of its constitutional functions, chooses to say that it will not subscribe to the proposed agreement for an unlimited period, and negatives proposed new section  94B,  and if the Government, in a fit of petulance, then choose to throw the Bill into the waste-paper basket, the responsibility will be theirs. Parliament should be afforded an opportunity of exercising its freedom of judgment upon any matter that came before it. Of course, any Government is&#39; free to throw a measure into the waste-paper basket if that measure be defeated. But if the Senate is prepared to attach a time limit to the operation of the proposed agreement, the Premiers, if they are wise men, who are care.ful of the interests of their States, will accept that time limit, and we shall thus secure a harmonious agreement which will be for the best interests of this country. I do hope that we shall be careful to clearly understand what we should be giving up under the proposal of the Government. I trust we shall realize that we shall not merely be surrendering our power as a confession of distrust in ourselves and in future Parliaments, but as a confession that the people of this country cannot be depended upon to elect honest Parliaments. </para>

Therefore I quite appreciate the tactics which&#39; are being adopted by my honorable friends opposite. I can tell them that they are doing just what I would do myself if I were in opposition..

We all know that if my honorable friends opposite merely desired to limit the operation of the proposed agreement to a fixed term, they could easily accomplish their object by moving an amendment upon proposed new section  94b.  For instance, they might propose the insertion at the beginning of it of the words &#34; For a period of fifteen years.&#34; But, as a matter of tactics, they are pursuing the right course from their stand-point. It would be presumption on my part to congratulate them upon recognising the most effective method which they could adopt in this connexion. </para>

And, further, in order that there may be no member of the Committee, who, wishing not to kill the Bill, but to put in a time limit, will fail to recognise that the true and honest way of putting it in is not to adopt the method of first rejecting the proposed new section, but to propose a direct amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> smiles.

                    <para>. - In my speech on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I said that the measure had one grave objection, but that it was not nearly so weighty as were its- intrinsic advantages. I further said that if, in Committee, I could remove the objectionable feature, I should do so, but that, if I were unable to remove it, I should regard the Bill, with all its faults, as better than no Rill. I am now confronted with the possibility of obtaining no Bill. . When I spoke at the second-reading stage, I had in my mind an amendment on the notice-paper. I should have supported that amendment had it been presented. If the amendment on the notice-paper were not submitted I intended to move one myself, with the object of limiting the time during which this agreement shall have currency. </para>

Some honorable senators have pointed out this morning how seriously they view the fact that they are representatives of the people. I am here as a representative of the people, and to secure, as I said the other evening, not what in every particular meets with my approval, but that which is the nearest approach to what meets with my approval in every measure that is submitted. </para>

I have faced that situation without fear, and voluntarily, because I would not sacrifice a principle in which I- believed. I have been opposed by every newspaper because I would not be dragooned into a position in which I did not believe. The people of this country who know me, placed me 5,000 votes ahead of every other candidate ; and they will do it again. I want no party nomination. The people of Victoria are my party. I secured my seat in the Senate without the support of any party or any newspaper, and in spite of the opposition of the party of my honorable friends opposite. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator who interjects knows something about &#34; blue funk.&#34; I- do not know what it means. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> - whom I will not twit with making a second-reading speech - has repeated with considerable warmth the major portion of the strong objection which he raised to this Bill in his former utterance. The principal objection that he has presented to the measure in its present form is that it abnegates a power of Parliament; that it means giving up one of our powers as a Senate; that it amounts to an emasculation of this Parliament. The honorable senator knows - with his logical mind he must know - that he has been tearing a passion to rags. He knows that Parliaments frequently give up powers that they possess, and that in so doing they do not contribute to their own emasculation. </para>

                        <para>- Formerly the Imperial Parliament controlled British Possessions beyond the seas, and amongst them Papua. But it was realized that it would be expedient in the interests of the Empire to hand over that power of control to another body. The Imperial Parliament did so. But it did not take that course, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> suggests, because it considered that it was not fit to be trusted to exercise the power. It did not say that some future Parliament sitting at Westminster would be incompetent. And, similarly, the supporters of this Bill think it expedient to forego a power that we now possess because we think that to do so will be in the interests of the Commonwealth. We do not take this action because we think we are not fit to be trusted, or because some future Parliament may not be fit to be trusted. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite as forceful a case as any which the honorable senator himself presented, though I am afraid I have not put it as forcefully as he would have done. I wish I could simulate a passion as completely as my honorable friend can when he is in no passion at all. I should be delighted if I could. I wish I possessed that forensic capacity which he has acquired during many years of experience in deluding juries. I regret, in an emergency of my country&#39;s history, that I lack that talent. </para>

We thought that the honorable senator had an honest intention to seek to amend the Bill. I am sorry to find now that we were mistaken. The honorable senator knows very well that if the Bill was amended by inserting a time limit, the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that the Government would drop it. </para>

If the proposed new section  94B  were&#39; omitted, and the amendment I have suggested were proposed, even the objections urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> might be overcome. I have proposed that we should say that during a period of fifteen years, after the 1st July,  1910,  and thereafter &#34; until the Parliament otherwise provides,&#34; certain things should be done. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> desired that the matter should be left entirely to Parliament, and that there should be no time limit, he might move that the first words of the proposed new section I have suggested be left out, and that it shall commence with the words &#34;Until the Parliament otherwise provides.&#34; </para>

                            has said that if the amendment we suggest were carried the Bill would be lost. I do not agree with that view. In my opinion it would be a better Bill than it is now, because, ultimately, the power to deal with the matter would be left to this Parliament. I am very tired of listening to the arguments of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline>
                            If people will impugn his intentions, here or outside, I will impugn them anywhere. Does the honorable senator think that I am to be bullied by his threats or by those of any one else?

I could not stop the honorable senator. The interjections have been answered, and I cannot .allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> now to refer any further to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> except as to arguments used by him which were relevant to the question. </para>

                    <para>. - A great deal has been said about the tactics which have been adopted, but I do not know that any Government has  a right to claim that they shall carry any measure if they have not a majority behind them. That seems to be the claim now made. I wish to speak without heat, and to put the position clearly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> no doubt, in a perfectly friendly way, spoke of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> eloquence and forensic ability in deluding juries. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has been successful in that, I hope that at least <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will not be successful in deluding the electors as to his intention in moving his amendment. The Vice-President of the Executive Council made a threat that if the amendment suggested from this side were carried the Bill would be dropped. </para>

                        <para>- I ask why should it be dropped? Honorable senators of both branches of this Parliament have expressed a unanimous desire to give the States all that this Bill proposes to give them. The only point at issue is whether there shall be a limit of time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> would not support an amendment which would bring about a limit of time, while proclaiming his desire for such an amendment of the Bill. The honorable senator knows, as does every other member of the Committee, that his amendment cannot be carried, because there is not a majority in favour of it. </para>

                        <para>- Thank God it is, and not backed up by the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> this morning. If the amendment suggested from this side would kill the Bill, 1 believe that the amendment which the honorable senator has proposed will be the means of killing &#34; Bill&#34; Trenwith ; at all events I hope so. We are taking the only course which is open to us to secure a time limit, and one which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has indorsed. Every honorable senator knows that there is not the slightest chance of a time limit being agreed to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has given a promise that in the event of its rejection he will vote for the third reading of the Bill. Would it not have been more candid and more direct - at any rate, it would have let the public know exactly the position - had he said, &#34;If it were not owing to my position in relation to the Fusion Government I would have voted for a time limit, but seeing that I am bound hand and foot to be their slave, their tool, I will make a pretence, praying to God that it shall never be carried out.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - It must be evident to honorable senators, if they have not recognised the fact before, that this is merely a contest between the supporters of the Bill and those who are seeking to smash it. That is undoubtedly the intention of the Opposition. I would make some distinction between the members of the Opposition and gentlemen like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> who is supporting them. He takes the ground that we, in assenting to this Bill, will surrender one of our powers, but I think that he is not doing justice to the sovereign States of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have said repeatedly, and it must be clear to honorable senators, that at the end of six or nine, or eighteen years, the Parliament can again go to the people, and present a case for an alteration of the Constitution. I am not going to labour the matter as that is quite unnecessary. The position is clear and absolute. We are dealing with something more than a mere Bill. If we alter the Bill, we alter the agreement. I am here to support the latter. Going before the electors, as I shall do in the course of a few months. I declare that I would rather go to them with the agreement defeated here than sustained, because I know how they would act. I know their wishes in the matter, and I am quite certain that they mean to have this agreement whether it is carried here now, or later. I think that honorable senators would do wisely for their own sakes to allow the agreement to be carried as speedily as possible. </para>

                    (Tasmania) cause so many honorable senators were anxious to speak. There are two or three things which have been overlooked. We are all of the opinion apparently that this agreement is a good one as to a
                    <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline>
                    contribution. We are all in favour of it. The answer to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                    and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                    and others, is that you could not get an agreement except upon the terms which the heads of the States and the Prime Minister came to. It was a compromise. The States said that they must have the agreement embodied in the Constitution.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline>
                    after objecting to that proposal, said : &#34; Yes, I will allow the agreement to go into the Constitution, but for a limited time.&#34; Can he not allow it to go into the Constitution for a time, which may be altered by the will of the people. They gave us the authority which we have, and can take it away. We ought to think more of the people, and less of the party manoeuvres which are now being carried on. I would remind the senators from Western Australia that under the agreement their State will receive in the special grant  , &#163;3,250,000,  but if there is no agreement, it will stand to lose.

                    <para>. - The last  speaker  has made an appeal to the representatives of Western Australia to assent to this agreement. We represent the largest State, and there is no telling what the future holds in store for a territory which contains such a vast unexplored area as it does. If a few gold- fields were discovered ten, or fifteen, or twenty years hence, that would send the receipts from Customs and Excise up with a bound. In a case of that kind, it is very necessary indeed that this Parliament should have in its hands the power to review the position with a view to giving fair play to the States. If, however, this agreement were embodied in the Constitution, then Western Australia would have to seek the assistance of the other States to remodel the Constitution, and I am very doubtful whether they would assist to do that. </para>

                        <para>- I shall always be found prepared to deal with the financial position of Western Australia or Tasmania, or any other State, on its merits. 1 am not in favour of fixing the duration of this agreement for such a short period as that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> indicated. I believe that it would be better to adopt a period of twenty, or twenty-five years. I am certainly not in favour of planting the agreement permanently in the Constitution, even if I thought that it would temporarily benefit my State. I think it is a vital matter for this Parliament to retain its powers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> admits that the agreement is imperfect, and yet, rather than adopt a proper course, he has, in his useless way, proposed an amendment which can only end in defeat, and, at the same time, rob the Senate of the power of recording the will of the majority. There is a sufficient number of honorable senators who are prepared to so amend the agreement as to bring it into an acceptable shape, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will not embrace the opportunity to get what he professes to desire. I am sorry that he is not present to hear me say that he would not have moved the amendment if he had known that it would be carried. I am ready to repeat that statement here or elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>. - A greater exhibition of mock heroics, make-believes, and backsliding on the part of a politician - I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> - has not, so far as I am aware, been witnessed in any Parliament in Australia. When he addressed himself to the second reading of the Bill, he made it very clear that it contained serious and fatal defects, and that when the Committee stage was reached, he would do all in his power to remove those blotches. He assured more than one member of the Opposition that he would help that body and Senators Symon and Keating to make the Bill a better one than it is. Let us analyze the position in which he finds himself in respect to the amendment which he has submitted. </para>

If it was a move which could not have been contemplated by the Government, that shows the wakefulness of those who sit on this side. It shows how conscious we are of the powers which we possess under the Standing Orders. True Australians desire to see the national powers remain for ever with the National Parliament, and, in order to attain that object, the Opposition desire the elimination of a provision which would place the financial agreement in the Constitution for all time. They decided to move for the deletion of proposed new section 94B, and afterwards to submit an amendment which would give those who favour a time limitation an opportunity of recording their opinions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has had the whip cracked in and around the building. If there was one uncomfortable being in Victoria during the last half -hour or so, if there was one person who was uneasy in regard to the attitude which he was to take, if there was one person who was in a state of perplexity as to what would be to his advantage, in respect to this measure, it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> It suddenly dawned on him - no, I do not think that it dawned on him, because he is not sufficiently wide awake to see a point when it is before him - but probably it was suggested to him that he should commandeer an amendment which was to be submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> for the purpose of saving his political skin. But he will not save it. When it was stated by members of the Opposition that, in the event of proposed new section 94B  being negatived, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment would be submitted, the Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that the insertion of a time limit to the agreement would kill the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator boasts that at the first Senate elections he was returned at the head of the poll with a majority of 5,000 votes, despite the opposition of a great daily newspaper, but he omitted to tell us that upon that occasion there was a multiplicity of candidates, and that he received a large sympathetic vote from persons who imagined that he had been harshly treated by that great journal. At the next election, however, the public will know that any harsh statements which that newspaper may make concerning him will be perfectly justified. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has succeeded in fooling all the people of Victoria for some time, and some of its people for all time, but he cannot hope to fool all of them for all time. </para>

                        <para>- As I have already pointed out, a considerable number of honorable senators are in favour of adopting  a  certain course of action. When a man wishes to do a thing, he will naturally endeavour to do it by adopting the most effective means at his disposal. He will not attempt to do it in a way that he knows it is impossible for him to do it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> wished to get to Tasmania, he would naturally go by the boat. He would not wait here till a railway was constructed, and he would not attempt to swim. He would know that neither of those means would be effective in enabling him to reach his destination. But in regard to this Bill, he says that though he has a certain object in view, he will not . adopt the most effective method of securing it. </para>

                        <para>- Nobody is asking him to do that. There is a proposed new section in this Bill which requires to be eliminated before another provision can be substituted for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> declares that he is in favour of eliminating that proposed new section, but he will not do it. He thinks that the people of Victoria can be fooled for all time in that way. It is ridiculous to imagine that the electors of any State are so simple as to be gulled by such a transparent absurdity. </para>

                        <para>- Immediately before the adjournment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> said, by way of interjection, that the people of Victoria believed in him because they knew him. My reply was that up to the present moment I had believed in him, but evidently that was because I did not know him. I perceive that my faith in him has been misplaced. I was one of those who believed when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> declared to me and the Senate that he was in favour of a limitation, that his statement might be accepted in good faith. I believed that he really meant what he said. But a number of others, who apparently knew him better, assured me that he did not mean anything of the sort. I stuck to him, but he has proved that their lack of faith in him was justified, and that my trust was not. I am very sorry for. that. I like to believe the best of a man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> cannot blame me if in the future I decline to repose the same faith in any professions he may make, as I have done in the past; because it is very hard, when a man has once been deceived, to bestow faith in the person who has deceived him. I wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> once more what the position is with regard to the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and that which he himself intends to follow. The position is prescribed by the Constitution. In order that there may be equal representation of the States in the Senate, each State has six senators, and every senator, including the  President  and  Chairman  of Committees, has one vote and one vote only. There is the further provision to prevent deadlocks, that when there is an equality of voting the question shall pass in the negative. The object of that is to leave things as they were. It is well known that&#34; there are in the Senate eighteen who are absolutely opposed to this Bill in its present form; they prefer some other form. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> shares that view. </para>

                        <para>- But if his own amendment were carried the position would be just the same - the Government would refuse to accept the modification which he favours. What a ridiculous position to assume ! When he is shown a means of securing what he professes to desire to secure, he runs away in the most cowardly fashion - I do not accuse him of personal or physical cowardice, but of political cowardice - to save his own political skin. That is what it means. He knows that if he dared to put the Government in an embarrassing position in regard to this financial agreement, they would put up a candidate against him at the next election. </para>

                        <para>-  I say so now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS.</inline> - That means that he will not trust future Parliaments. We can more easily see what the requirements of the Commonwealth will -be fifteen years ahead than fifty. We have certain facts to go upon, and can fairly well gauge the possibilities for the next fifteen years. That being so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was willing to give the advocates of this agreement a certainty for fifteen years. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who is in favour of a limitation, sneered at him for advocating the very thing which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> professes to favour. </para>

                        <para>- There are several who are not ready for a division. By inviting the people of Australia to sanction this agreement in perpetuity. we are inviting them to put themselves into a strait-jacket. We hold up the agreement to them and say that we are offering them a nice garment to wear. At the same time, however, we carefully disguise the fact that the coat is a strait-jacket which is intended to tie up the people hand and foot for all time. &#34; Trust the people,&#34; honorable senators opposite say. But we cannot trust the people when this garment is upon them, because the majority of them will not be able to get out of it if they want to. Four-fifths of the people might be in favour of throwing off the straitjacket, but they would not have the slightest possible chance, because the Constitution requires that there shall be a majority of the people and a majority of the States. </para>

                        <para>- I am not now spying whether it is right or wrong. I am merely pointing out &#39;the position. Before an amendment of the Constitution can be secured, the Government of the day must initiate a measure for that purpose. Owing to the exigencies of politics, a Government might be unwilling to take that action. It might enjoy the confidence of the people on various other questions, but might refuse to bring forward a measure to alter the Constitution. The measure now before us was not initiated by the Commonwealth Government ; it came from a secret caucus of State Premiers. The Government, to save their own political skins, took it up. The majority of the members of another place declared against this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Because the Government dragooned their supporters into voting for it. A majority of the members of the Senate has not declared in favour of it. In this Chamber the numbers for this Bil! and for an alternative are absolutely equal. How then could it be said that we are adopting the proper procedure for securing an amendment of the Constitution ? We are not fulfilling the first condition required by the Constitution. Not only were honorable members in another place dragooned by the Government, submitted to pressure of the grossest kind ; not only were threats and offers made to them to secure the passing of the Bill, but it was &#34; gagged &#34; through in that Chamber. Possibly it will be &#34; gagged&#34; through the Senate also. Will any one contend that that is a proper way in which to proceed with an amendment of the Constitution? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> very properly asked this morning whether it is not a very serious matter that if this proposal is carried it will be because of the negative vote provided for under the Constitution.

Honorable senators on this side are willing to give a fair deal to the States. They are willing even to accept the dictum of the State Premiers as to the amount which should be returned to the States, and to agree to the return of that amount for a fairly long period. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to go into the whole question again ; but if it were not the desire of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and his party to saddle the poor people of the Commonwealth with indirect taxation, there would be no need for the Commonwealth Parliament: to do any more than raise sufficient revenue for its own requirements. If our Tariff did bring, in more than we required, I have said that I should be prepared to return to the States the last farthing that we did not require for ourselves. I remind the honorable senator of the generous offer made to the States by the late Labour Prime Minister. Every member of the Labour party was and is prepared to stand by that offer. We are asked to let this matter go before the people in such a way as to leave them practically no alternative They would be unable tn say whether they desired that the amount returned should be &#163;i or 30s., or any other amount, and they would be unable to say whether in their opinion the agreement should continue for five, ten, fifteen or twenty years. They would be left to accept the dictum of the Government which the Government have themselves taken from the State Premiers who were assembled in the secret caucus. The position in which this Parliament has been placed by a recreant Government is humiliating, lt is especially humiliating to the Senate, which was elected by the people to safeguard the interests of the States. </para>

The Senate was specially created in order to safeguard the interests of the States. I know some of the State Premiers, and I have read most of their speeches upon this question. I see around me honorable senators from every State, and of every political party, who know quite as well as does any State Premier in what direction the true interests of their States lie, and who are quite as capable of safeguarding them. That being so, I object to the interference of these outside people, who were never given any authority to interfere. I object to the Senate being asked to be false to the trust imposed in it by the people, and I shall do my level best to retain for this Parliament the power that it now possesses, and to put a just interpretation upon the Constitution which is the deed of partnership between the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

                        <para>- I have no means now of checking the honorable senator&#39;s statement, but even if the Attorney-General of the late Labour Government did make the statement attributed to him, I defy the honorable senator to prove that the Labour party ever wished to take all the money from the States. In support of my statement, I have only to quote the proceedings at the Brisbane Labour Conference. That Conference was Labour&#39;s Parliament for the time being. At it a platform of the policy was approved for the ensuing election. The Conference . also drafted a financial scheme. The speeches of the delegates on that scheme were printed and have been quoted in this debate, and there is nothing in them to justify the allegation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> that the Labour party desired to take all the money from the States.&#39; On the contrary, the representatives of the party at that Conference desired, as the members of the party now desire, to deal generously with the States while preserving the right and the power given to this National Parliament by the people. I characterized <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> statement when he made it as absolutely false. I repeat now that his statement was absolutely false. </para>

There was no intention on the part of himself or his colleagues to insert a permanent provision in the Constitution, nor was there any such intention on the part of the delegates to the Brisbane Congress. I attended that Congress from early morning until late at night for a period of five days, and, as  1  stated in my second-reading speech, there was no intention on the part of a single delegate to place the financial scheme in the Constitution in perpetuity. &#39; ,The opinions of the delegates have since been sought, but only one delegate has asserted that that was the intention. When he was speaking; to his amendment in his usual forceful style, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> said that he did not want  a  nomination from any party. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will not deny that he has been nominated by the Fusion party. If it is possible to carry an amendment providing for a limitation, he is proceeding in the wrong way to attain his object. The other day he declared himself in favour of a limitation being made. Generally speaking, I have no fault to find with the agreement, except that it is to be placed in the Constitution in perpetuity. I am prepared to give more than 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per ^capita</inline> to the States-, and for a longer period than fifteen years. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> desires to secure such a limitation, he is taking the wrong way to attain that end. He is also aware that the leader of his party has stated that he will accept no such amendment. Colour is lent to that position by the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> that, if his amendment is not carried, he will vote for the third reading. </para>

                        <para>- When this question was first brought before the other House, we were told that it was not to be treated from a party stand-point. But the manner in which the Bill was bludgeoned through that Chamber proves conclusively that it was made a party question. The <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline> of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> to-day proves that the party whip is also operative in the Senate. There lies the difference between the two parties here. Every member on this side is free to vote for or against the agreement - either in whole or in part - without violating his pledge to his constituents. The whip has not been cracked on this side, hut it is evident that it has been successfully cracked on the other side. I regret to think that by the vigorous use of that whip national rights are about to be sacrificed for the sake of securing party advancement. </para>

                    has moved this amendment knowing full well that it will be defeated. He has said over and over again, both in his speech and by interjection, that his great concern is to save the Bill. He knows quite well, as every one in the Senate knows, that if the amendment introducing a time limit is carried, the Bill will be doomed.

                        <para>- If the honorable senator was here in the early part of the discussion to-day, he must have heard what the Vice-President of the Executive Council said. The statement has been repealed over and over again, and every one except the honorable senator knows, that if an amendment providing for a time limit is inserted, the Bill is to be dropped. That being so, we are entitled to infer that he moved the amendment with no desire that it shall be carried. I suggest to the honorable senator that his attitude is that of the sundowner, who goes about looking for work, and praying to God that he may not find it. The political sundowner moves an amendment, praying to God that it may not be carried, and, in this instance at least, knowing full well that his prayer will be answered, and that his amendment will not be carried. I decline to vote on an amendment moved in such circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- I have it that the honorable and learned senator is opposed to the first, second, and third readings of the Bill. I honestly desire to amend the Bill, but I have unhesitatingly arrived at the conclusion that, even if it is not amended, it is so advantageous that it ii preferable to no arrangement at all. Then the question of means arises. The political wreckers - not the sundowners - have sought to wreck the Bill. In the first place, they determined to strike out proposed new section  94B  without any qualification. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be in time. I was in time this morning, although I was not the first honorable senator here. It might have been possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -</inline> McGregor, with his great astuteness, to delude me. I know that I am unsophisticated and easily taken in, but 1 have seen so much manoeuvring in connexion with this Bill that I had inquired &#34; What is the meaning of all this underground engineering. What is this thimble a.nd pea business in which certain honorable senators are engaged?&#34; Then, when I saw what was going on  to-day, I said to myself, &#34; This is rather clever. It is what I might have expected from the source from which it has emanated, but it is rather disappointing to my ideal of disingenuousness.&#34; One can see just where the pea is. </para>

                    <para>. - I am somewhat astonished at the developments which have occurred since the introduction of this Bill. I desire - and I have done so from the very outset - to support some of its provisions. But I am not so widely enthusiastic over &#62;t as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> I am not prepared to accept it on any conditions. If the Bill is likely to be wrecked I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be the person who is responsible for its wreckage. For days the measure was under consideration, but it was not until it had passed its second reading that he felt sufficient confidence in his docile followers to declare that unless certain things were done the measure would be killed. When he made that statement this morning I was rather tickled with his position, and for a moment I wondered whether effect would be given to his declaration in connexion with every other Bill which may be presented to us during the remainder of the session. The position which he has taken, up means that there is no further need for the existence of this Parliament. . It means that if the Ministry choose to enter into an agreement with any outside body there is no necessity for &#34;them to submit that agreement for the indorsement of this&#39; Parliament. If agreements made by the Ministry are to be like the laws of the Medes and Persians, it is criminal for them to occupy the time of Parliament in their discussion, when they know that unless those agreements are approved in their entirety they will be thrown into the waste-paper basket. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> is willing to subscribe to such a position of affairs, I am not. Neither do I accept the honorable senator&#39;s definition of a &#34; wrecker &#34; of the Bill. I am sorry that he has seen fit to turn his back upon the Chamber at this particular moment, because I want to remind him of a former occasion when he was called upon to pull the Government, of which he is such <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> servile follower, out of a difficult position in almost similar circumstances. ^ </para>

                        <para>- It will be recollected that on the occasion in question the Government - having neither this Bill nor any other to occupy the attention of the Senate - had to call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> to their assistance and induce him to trump up a little private Bill to afford them time 10 consider their position. Similar circumstances have arisen on the present occasion.  His  declaration was emphatic that he was an opponent of the provision of this Bill which gives perpetuity to the conditions embodied therein. He made his position indisputably clear. But, after that declaration was made, I presume that the Government were disturbed, and they set themselves to think cut a method by which they might escape. They hit upon the plan of having <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> amendment moved in place of that which had been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> Now, if this amendment had been in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I should have believed that there was some sincerity in the attempt of the mover. As it is in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> I am decidedly of the opposite opinion. There is not only no sincerity in the action which he has taken, but there is a deliberate attempt to be fool the Committee and the country with a proposal which he has no intention of endeavouring to carry. As n supporter of the Bill in every respect. a Dart from its perpetuity provision, I am of opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has done wisely in suggesting an amendment which, if carried, would meet with the approbation of a very large section of the people. But I recognise that it will fail to gratify the desire of those who, without a mandate from the people or from the Parliament, have sought to compel us to swallow whatever scheme they might connive at. </para>

                        <para>- There have been many peculiar incidents in connexion with this Bill ; but one of the most peculiar is that which we have been witnesses of to-day. I do not intend to go over the arguments for and against the Bill. Neither shall I attack <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> for the attitude he has adopted. But I do wish to comment upon one statement which he made. I wish he had had the courage to come in when the bell rang for a quorum. He rushed away while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> was speaking. Perhaps the Government are keeping him under observation, in order that he may not slip them up. The honorable senator made a statement which was not denied by the Government, and which is of considerable importance. It should receive, either confirmation or contradiction from the Vice-President of the Executive Council. He stated that the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> would, if carried, have the effect of killing the Bill. The effect of that amendment would be to delete proposed new section  94B,  and to put in another provision. </para>

He knows perfectly well that if the Government were prepared to drop the Bill in the one case, they would in the other. He also knows that his amendment gives the Government the advantage of a negative vote ; because he is well aware that the other honorable senator who would vote for his amendment if it did not mean the loss of the Bill, will vote in the contrary direction if he knows that the Government intend to drop the Bill in the event of. the amendment being carried. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> need not be informed that I am talking about something of which I know. If, however, he has any doubt about it, let him ask the Government Whip, who will tell him the name of the senator, to whom I am referring. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt about it whatever; but if the Minister wishes to test the accuracy of my statement, he can do so by making a declaration to the effect that the Government will not drop the Bill if the amendment be carried. Then we shall see. What is the history of this matter? First of all, the agreement was conceived in mystery and secrecy, and in suspicious circumstances. It came _ before the other branch of the Legislature,  where a majority of honorable members declared themselves absolutely in favour of a time limitation. Only by compelling representatives of the people to swallow their convictions did the Government succeed in enabling the Bill to reach the Senate. What has its history been here? AVe find that there is not a. majority of the Senate in favour of the Bill as it stands. Yet the Bill - which has not a majority in favour of it as it stands in either House - will be submitted to the country as representing the opinion of this Parliament. Was there ever such an extraordinary set of circumstances? Was ever a Bill submitted to the people by such means?. It only shows what peculiar tricks the Parliamentary machine is capable of. Yet, forsooth, the party which has engineered this measure in such a fashion has the audacity to talk of trickery, and to taunt the Opposition with the wiles to which they have resorted ! </para>

                        <para>- I do not wonder at his admitting it. I am going to make a candid confession myself. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith&#39;s</inline> vote was canvassed amongst the members of the Opposition, and inquiries were made as to how he was likely to vote, I was one of those who said I thought he would vote for a time limitation. He told members of our party that he was in favour of one. There were some of us who believed that he was sincere. But there were others of our party who said that they did not believe he would do anything of the kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was one of them. He said, &#34; I do not care what you do or how you do it ; I am quite sure that if anything that is proposed means carrying an amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will not be with us.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator McGregor</inline> has been a true prophet. In other words, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> was only prepared to vote for a time limit if he was assured that as a consequence the Government would not drop the Bill. Now he says plainly that he is going to vote to save the Bill. Born in such an inglorious fashion, therefore, this Bill is to go before the people of Australia for their <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur.</inline> The people are to express their opinion upon it ; but they are to do so manacled on the one hand by their desire to do justice to the States, and on the other by their wish not to do an injustice to their Federal aspirations. The position in which the Parliament and the people are being placed is a most unfair one. But, apparently, the fates have willed it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> in an accommodating way, has come to the rescue of the Government, and they are able, by a piece of trickery, to get the Bill on the statute-book. They are welcome to their victory. It is worthy of the Fusion. The proceedings at every stage of this measure have reeked with the atmosphere that has surrounded the Fusion from its birth. The Bill is a worthy child of such unworthy parents. One could only expect such a measure from such a source. I hope that honorable senators opposite are proud of it. I hope that the Government are proud of the fact that they have carried this Bill by the votes of men who do not believe in it, and of men who have acknowledged that they have been compelled to vote against their consciences. In the circumstances they are welcome to any pleasure they can derive from their victory. </para>

I have only to say, in support of my amendment, that, so far as Tasmania is concerned, if the sum of 25s. per head is to be the return to the States, the Parliament of Tasmania will have to find between ,&#163;60,000 and &#163;80,000 per annum in order to liquidate the yearly indebtedness of the State in respect of interest on debts already incurred. Western Australia has been singled out - I do not know why - for special treatment in this regard. It has been contended from time to time that, by reason of its proximity to Victoria and New South Wales, Tasmania has lost considerable Customs revenue because it has been impossible to trace all the goods which have gone into consumption in that State, and in respect of which it should have received Customs revenue. Many attempts have been made to overcome that difficulty. It has not been overcomes yet. We are now, for the - first time, and for all time, going to make a permanent agreement as between the Commonwealth and the States, and I do say sincerely, as I said last night, that if an agreement of this character is to be  entered upon, I believe that the provision made is inadequate to meet the requirements of Tasmania. I have no further reasons to offer, at the present juncture, in support of my amendment. I ask the Committee, if there is to be a permanent agreement, to agree to apply to Tasmania for at least a period of twenty-five years a provision somewhat similar to that made in respect of Western Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I am extremely anxious that Tasmania should have justice done to her. I think that the BUI ought to have contained a special provision for Tasmania as well as Western Australia, but as no such provision was made in the agreement, I do not intend to throw away the agreement which has been arrived at. </para>

                        <para>- When I was a Minister I had no opportunity of dealing with this matter. Ministers from the several States met together, agreed upon certain terms, and said to the Commonwealth,  &#34; Take them, or leave them.1&#39; It was. put in the position in which the people of this country are going to be put directly with regard to this- agreement - &#34; take it, cr leave it.&#34; There was no question then of meeting on a common ground. So far as I know, no Federal Minister went into a Premiers&#39; Conference until this year, except, as  1  said last night, without prejudice. He went in there to hear their views ; he went in there to give the most sympathetic consideration to any expression of consideration they might make ; but he bound himself to nothing, because he recognised - and properly .recognised - ;as the responsible representative of the Parliament and&#39; people of Australia, that at the end of 1910 with this Parliament alone would rest the determination of this most important question. So far as I know, no honorable senator has any record of the proceedings of the last Premiers&#39; Conference., but we do know that, as a result of its deliberations, amongst other things, special provision is again proposed to be made for Western Australia. It has enjoyed such treatment for some years. Last night I said, fairly and openly, that it is not the terms of the agreement I am quarrelling with, so much as the idea of embodying it perpetually in the Constitution.. I said last night, and I repeat now, that if the terms were to be discussed, I do not think that they are satisfactory to Tasmania. Finding that the measure is going through the Senate with a perpetual provision of this character, I ask that at least the circumstances of that State shall be considered, and considered justly. I want nothing further than that. I indicated last night that if the terms, and the terms, only .. were to be considered, I&#39; had no quarrel with them, but that they did not seem to me to be just to Tasmania, and that, if I had the opportunity of doing so, I would see that she got better terms. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> to. extend the same measure of justice to- that State as he will to Western Australia. The Government can- easily do it. </para>

                    <para>. - I decline to discuss the amendment on its merits or demerits. <inline font-style="italic">If</inline> it has any merits, we have no time in which to give them proper consideration. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> believes that Tasmania, should have any allowance, as I think every representative of that State does, he should have given notice of this amendment some time ago, and then we should have been able to form an idea as to whether the amount which he proposes, and the terms which he desires to embody in this provision, were fair to the State or not. At the last hour, when we are dealing with a most important Bill, he has sprung this surprise upon us. I have too high an opinion of him to think that it has been submitted with the object of placing other representatives of the State in a false position.  If it had emanated from the other side. I should have been disposed to take that view. The support which it is receiving from honorable senators opposite is extended in order to give some of their colleagues in Tasmania an opportunity of reminding me that I voted against a grant of &#163;75,000 to the State. It does not want any grant from the Commonwealth ; it only asks for its own. I am prepared to take all the consequences of my action. I resent the fact that, in relation to a measure which has been very amply debated in both Houses, and which we are about to deal with finally one way or the other, the representatives of Tasmania should have been placed in the position of having to apparently, vote against its interests. I resent an amendment of the kind, by whomsoever it is moved, even though it should emanate from a personal friend. </para>

Undoubtedly there is more justification for granting special treatment to Tasmania than there is for granting it to Western Australia.

                        <para>- The reason why Western Australia will receive special treatment under the agreement is that a large proportion of her population are adult males who are engaged in mining pursuits, and consequently her contribution to the Customs and Excise revenue, which is collected by the Commonwealth, is correspondingly larger than is that of any other State. But there is an equally good reason why special consideration should be extended to Tasmania. Nobody has insisted, more than has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mul-</inline> cahy, that owing to her geographical position Tasmania is losing revenue every year. He has repeatedly affirmed that she is not being credited with the amount of Customs and Excise revenue to which she is entitled to be credited, owing to the impossibility of keeping track of the goods consumed within her borders. I shall vote for the amendment, which I hope will be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - On Tuesday next the Constitution Alteration (State Debts) Bill will be dealt with. If the Senate then deems it undesirable to act on the call which has already been approved, we can postpone that call until a later period. If, on the other hand, it is then considered advisable to deal with the Constitution Alteration (State Debts) Bill, as every honorable senator will be present on Wednesday in response to the first call, no objection can be urged to dealing with both Bills upon that day. I therefore move - </para>
