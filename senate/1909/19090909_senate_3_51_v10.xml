The proviso refers to a meeting of the Senate held before the expiration of the existing term, and as the newly-elected senators will not be members of the Senate until after the 30th June, it is unnecessary to add this proviso, since it can have no reference to them. </para>

Even if they have no definite meaning they fitly complete the sense of the previous words, and it would be as well to leave them in. The standing order will conclude very abruptly if they are omitted. There is certainly no harm in allowing the words to remain. </para>

                <para class="block">These amendments are necessary, in view of the alteration which has been made under the Constitution Alteration (Senate Elections) Act, in the period for which the Senate is elected. Under the existing standing order the office of the  President  becomes vacant on 31st December following a periodical election, or on the date of any proclamation dissolving the Senate. Now, a periodical election may not take place during the coming year until the month of March or April. It will be seen, therefore, that under that standing order the  President  would be entitled to retain his office until 31st December next year. Now, it is not intended that any officer of Parliament shall hold his position for a longer period than the Parliament itself exists. Of course, under the old state of things, the Senate expired by effluxion of time on 31st December, and consequently no difficulty arose in that connexion. But now that the period of its election has been extended to 30th June, it has become necessary to insert these words. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment is proposed by the Stand Orders Committee. There is a later proposed new standing order which will provide' that in the case of a count-out the names of the senators present shall be entered in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals.</inline> We are now dealing with a standing order which relates to the want of a quorum before business commences.

                        <para>. - Certain honorable senators may feel interested in the proposed alteration. Our present standing order provides - and I think rightly - that if at the commencement of business there is not a quorum, the names of the senators present shall be taken down. The proposed new standing order provides that if at any stage of our proceedings a quorum is not present, the names of those present shall be taken down and entered in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals.</inline> But, as we all know, there are reasons, both satisfactory and unsatisfactory, as to the presence or absence of certain senators on some occasions. I suppose there are some who will argue that any deliberate failure to make a quorum involves a neglect of public duty. On the other ' hard, there may be some who deliberately fail to make a quorum, and who think that they are thereby discharging a public duty. Both interpretations- can be fairly put upon the absence of senators on certain occasions. But if we passed the proposed new standing order, the fact would be placed on record that a certain number of senators were not here, and those senators might, or might not, be able to explain why they deliberately remained outside. </para>

The recording of the names of the senators present in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> may, or may not, be fair; but I can quite conceive that it may in some cases be desirable to abstain from making a quorum. I am not at all sure, therefore, that a senator ought to run the risk of being pilloried for remaining out of the chamber. Personally, I do not like the alteration. </para>

If their action is challenged by their constituents, they will be able to explain their absence. Therefore, there will be no great hardship in recording the names of .those who were present. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales)  [3.6].-  The proposed new standing order would only embody what has been the practice since this Parliament was established, and that practice is in accordance with what is done in nearly, if not in all, the State Parliaments. In the first place, we want to form a House, and then if a quorum is not obtained, we want to place on record the names of those who _ were present. I think that that is perfectly right. As to the Senate' being counted out, I can quite conceive that there may be occasions when certain senators think that they are doing the right thing by absenting themselves. But the public are entitled to know who are present on such an occasion. For that purpose, it is desirable to have &amp; record made. The
                    <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline>
                    of the Senate invariably record the names of senators who were absent at the beginning of any sitting, and it is only reasonable and proper, in the interests of the public, that a record of those present on the occasion of a count-out should also be made. We can hardly legislate for special circumstances. The public have a right to know how their representatives attend ; and senators who are absent on any occasion can make any explanation they choose if asked why they were not present when the Senate was counted out.

                    <para>. - I think that it would be well to pause before we accept the proposed alteration. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> hardly meets the case, because the entry in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> gives no reason for a count-out. There is nothing to show why senators abstained from making a quorum. The <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> will show that certain senators were present; and they will also show that certain senators were absent when the sitting commenced. The record of those present on the occasion of a count-out will make it appear that certain other senators neglected their business when a quorum was called for. But,, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has pointed out, there may be very good reasons for the absence of senators at a certain time. For instance, on Friday afternoons, when some senators want to catch InterState trains, we have known others to get up and talk right up to the time when the trains were about to leave. The only way for senators to protect themselves against that kind of treatment is deliberately to stay outside and count-out the Senate. Yet in such a case the <inline font-style="italic">Journals,</inline> without giving reasons, would show, that a quorum was asked for, and that certain senators were absent. </para>

                        <para>- That is only one of many examples which could be cited. A record of the names of those present can only imply that they were doing their duty, and that the absent ones were not. What other value can it have? It is provided that if there is no quorum at the hour appointed for a sitting to begin the names of th.i senators present shall be recorded. I think that the Committee will be well advised in not agreeing to the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - 1 intend to support the proposed standing order. I think that the reason given bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is one of the most" extraordinary reasons which I have ever heard advanced here. On Friday afternoon, no matter how important the business may be, there is a general scurry to catch the trains on the part of senators from South Australia and New South Wales. However important the business may be, those honorable gentlemen clear out. </para>

                        <para>- Occasionally they remain; but, as a general rule, they clear out whenever the train time comes. If it happens that the Senate is counted out on Friday afternoon, because of those honorable senators wilfully absenting themselves, the men who have loyally remained to do their paid duty are counted with the black sheep. I object to that. I do not want to shield myself behind any man. If I commit an offence I am willing to take my punishment, but I am not willing that any man should hide himself behind the skirts of my coat. If at any time the Senate is counted out and I am absent, I am quite willing that the public should know that fact. But I do not desire that those who are prepared to do their work should have to share with me the blame of a count out. </para>

If I had to choose between a man who clears out, as if things here did not matter, and as if affairs elsewhere were of much greater importance, and a man who " stone-walled," as some of our honorable friends here have done for hour after hour I would choose the latter, because he at least shows some interest in the affairs of his country. I intend to support the proposed standing order.  </para>

                    <para>. - Unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> remarks are criticised a false impression is likely to get abroad. He spoke of the senators who leave on Friday afternoon to catch their trains, and argued from that fact that the members of the Senate have to put in only 20 hours a week. I should pity the work of the Senate if the time which honorable senators devote to public business were judged by the length of their attendance on the benches here. Outside the chamber a considerable amount of work has to be done. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> does any work outside the period of 20 hours or not. But I should imagine from a number of his speeches that he puts in a considerable amount of time outside the chamber. </para>

                        <para>- While I have 'no strong feeling on the question either one way or the other, I think that there is something in the objection which is raised. Let me recall one or two cases which have occurred during my membership. It was only last session that a number of honorable senators were engaged in other parts of the building. Time after time the bells were rung as I sat in my place, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council made various remarks about the fact that a great many senators had not responded. </para>

                <para class="block">Suppose that a count-out had occurred on that occasion, I would have been a sort of white-haired boy, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> would have incurred, perhaps, the censure of those whom he was representing elsewhere in the building to the same extent as I was representing them within this chamber. There is no reason why on such an occasion I should* be able to score off the honorable senator. It does not seem reasonable that whenever there is a count-out, as the result of a general understanding on both sides of the chamber, the few senators who happen to be present at the last moment should have an opportunity to say that they alone stuck to their work when, perhaps, they were parties to the count-out. Why should they have an opportunity to say that the absent senators caused the count-out, and that they were present looking after the business of the country? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> whether, " in - the event of making a covenant with the members of his party to secure a count-out, and being in the chamber when it occurred, he would go on to a public platform, and say that he was the only loyal member of the party who remained to do his work, and that the others absented themselves? It does not seem to be reasonably decent that any senator should be able to make such a statement. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. I believe that the honorable senator has taken part in quite a number of unsuccessful attempts to secure a count-out. I do not think that any stigma is attachable to the honorable senator for having taken that course, as he may have believed that he was acting in the interests of his constituents. It seems to me that the existing Standing Orders are sufficient in the public interest. When divisions are taken the votes of honorable senators are recorded, and if any member' of the Senate is absent from a division, he can find an opportunity to explain his absence. </para>

                    <para>. - I have much pleasure in supporting the proposed new standing order. We are elected for a particular purpose. The record of the attendance of honorable senators is not a good one. Several members of the Senate are very frequently absent, and some are not present during more than half the sittings of the Senate. I abstain from mentioning names, but it is unfair to honorable senators who are regular in their attendance that those who are frequently absent should not be treated according to their merits. </para>

Honorable senators who are regular in their attendance should get credit for it, whilst those who do not attend regularly should be placed on the black list. For these reasons I intend to support the proposed new standing order. </para>

                    <para>- - I - I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> in this matter, though I find it hard to follow the honorable senator's reasoning. He has said that he has taken part in a count-out in obedience to his party, and that the welfare of the country had very little influence upon his action. I am sure, .however, that when the honorable senator has joined in this villanous practice he has always had in mind the advancement of the interests of his party, and, ultimately, of the interests of the country. It might just as well be frankly admitted that every political party at times take advantage of a count-out. But "when the (business of a legislative chamber is brought to a stand-still as the result of the absence of certain of its members, the public are entitled to know all about it. It has been suggested that ' a record of the names of honorable senators present when the Senate is counted out might place absent senators in a false position; but I think that a record of those present when the Senate is counted out is very desirable. The matter may be looked at from two points of view. Honorable senators may take some pride on occasions in a successful count-out, and the political party to which they belong may quietly enjoy the discomfiture of those who have been unable to keep a quorum. On the other hand, members of the party on whose shoulders rests the responsibility of keeping a quorum may have a real interest in letting it be known which members of their party fail to assist them in doing so. I regard the proposed new standing order as a very fair one, and I am- prepared to support it, because it will enable the public to ascertain who are responsible at any particular time for bringing the business of the Senate to a standstill. </para>

                    <para>- - <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> have not an expert knowledge of the Standing Orders, 'and have only a short experience of the work of the Senate. But I do not intend to support the proposed new standing order, It seems to me to be intended to relieve the Government of the day of responsibility. One-third of the members of the Senate is sufficient to form a quorum, but no Government has a right to control the business of the country without the assistance of a majority of the members of the Senate. There is a considerable margin between a majority of the members of the Senate and the number necessary to form a quorum. I do not remember an occasion during the time I have been a member of the Senate when it has been impossible to form a quorum because of absolute neglect of, or indifference to, their duties on the part of members of the Senate. The only counts-out I have witnessed have been brought about more or less from party reasons, or when it has been considered that an honorable senator by talking at too great length has not been doing a service to the country. The Government and their supporters should accept the responsibility of seeing that the business of the Senate is carried on by more than the few necessary to form a quorum. If an honorable senator has absented himself deliberately, he will be penalized by the publication of the fact, but to pass the proposed new standing order would relieve the Government and their supporters of the responsibility of insuring a good attendance of honorable senators, except when the vital clauses of a Bill were under consideration. I think I could quote fifty or sixty instances in which the attendance of honorable senators who are frequently absent, has been specially secured to carry the vital clauses of a Bill. Honorable senators protest against this sort of thing, and under the existing standing order the Government and their supporters are made responsible for keeping a quorum. It is within the knowledge of every member of the Senate that the count-out has been regarded as a necessary weapon by those who desire to protest against the failure of the Government to keep a quorum. It is not always used for party reasons, and it may be useful to prevent deliberate obstruction of private business. </para>

The honorable senator as a member of the Senate in charge of a private Bill had an' interesting experience of the kind quite recently. Honorable senators can explain their absence from this chamber to the electors. I am sure they will not be anxious to shirk responsibility for .it. Where .the Government of the day and their supporters neglect to keep a quorum, it is unfair to penalize other members of the Senate who desire to enter an emphatic protest against their neglect. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree that it is right that the parties responsible for a count-out should be made known. I do not believe that a count-out is necessarily immoral, or prejudicial to the interests of the country. I have a very distinct recollection of one count-out which took place here and which I personally took a great deal of trouble to achieve. 'When it. became known through the press on the following morning it gave rise to the expression of strong feelings of satisfaction by a large number of people. The circumstances were such that there was no other means at our disposal to abate a nuisance.-' At times circumstances arise which justify a count-out, and in such a case no honorable senator would be afraid or ashamed to have -his name associated with it. Still, it is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has pointed out, that it is by no means an unimportant or trifling thing to bring the business of a legislative chamber to a standstill, and honorable senators should be impressed in every way with the importance of such a thing. There is just one danger which I foresee. The circumstances under which the work of this Parliament is performed are such as to render it necessary to extend a good deal of latitude to its members. It must be recollected that the representatives of States other than Victoria have to travel considerable distances from their homes, and consequently, if the business of this Parliament is to be transacted as it should be, there must be a liberal use of the practice of pairs. But our official records take no cognisance of pairs, and thus honorable senators who are absent when a count-out occurs are penalized, even although that count-out may be of an unjustifiable character. That is the only objection which I can see to publishing the names of those honorable senators who are present in the chamber when a count-out takes place. </para>

                    <para>- - It seems to be assumed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell that the publication of the names of honorable senators who are present when a count-Out takes place has the effect of making them " white-haired boys" with the electors, and of placing those honorable senators who are absent in a black list. I would suggest that the very reverse may be the case if those present when the count-out occurs are engaged in some little scheme which is not for the public good. I shall support the proposed new standing order, and I do not fear the consequences of mv action. </para>

                    <para>- - I intend .to support the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee, because this question has been thoroughly considered by that body. Our Standing Orders differ somewhat from those of another place. In the other branch of the Legislature an honorable member may rise at any time and move, " That the question be now put." The standing order which we are now considering confers upon honorable senators practically the same power. In other words, by merely absenting themselves from the chamber they can count-out the Senate, and thus put an end to the transaction of business. </para>

Only a few moments ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> gave utterance to sentiments which were entirely opposed to democratic ideas - sentiments which were altogether out of harmony with the principle underlying representation in this Chamber. I would ask him to recollect that every member of the Commonwealth Parliament is sent here with a distinct responsibility to the electors, and that so long as he comports himself decently, and confines his remarks to questions of public importance, he has a right to be heard. It is highly improper that facilities should be granted to honorable senators to troop out of the chamber, thus leaving him without a quorum, and effectually gagging him. </para>

                        <para>- Is it proper that we should grant facilities for doing that sort of thing? Honorable senators might first decide amongst themselves that the business which was being discussed was not worth discussing - that it was not in the public interest - and they might then leave the chamber, thus depriving the honorable senator of an audience. But apparently they do not wish .the public to know when they do this sort of thing, and therefore they do not want their names recorded. If an honorable senator absents himself from this Chamber he should not seek to hide the fact from the public. But that is exactly the position taken up by those who wish to expunge from the records of this Chamber all evidence regarding their attendance on occasions when the Senate is counted out. The fundamental rights of honorable senators are affected by this proposal. A group of two or three honorable senators might constitute a small minority in this Chamber, and they might be continually silenced by other honorable senators trooping out and leaving them without a quorum. Those who leave this chamber ought not to be afraid of their constituents knowing the fact. If their words are to be recorded here, their actions ought also to be recorded. If ever I take part in a movement to count out the Senate I shall be prepared to justify my action to my constituents. </para>

                    <para>.- It is rather difficult to follow the argument which has been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> with a view to preventing the amendment being carried. He appears to imagine that the time may come when a solitary member of this Chamber may be anxious to express his opinions on some subject of interest to a large number of the electors who returned him, and when a majority of honorable senators by leaving the chamber may effectually gag him. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> imagine that the publication of the names of those who remain in the chamber would insure for that solitary senator an audience? I do not think it would. Since I have been a member of the Senate, I do not think that any senator who has walked out of the chamber in company with others would have been afraid to have his name published as having done so. There have been periods in the life of this Parliament when a senator by walking out of the chamber has rendered a real service to the country. On one or two occasions certain senators, anxious to make record speeches, and filled to the brim with information on the subjects with which they were dealing, have repeated themselves time and again. Finally, having grown weary, some of us have walked out. I have done so for the purpose of having the Senate counted out. </para>

If the Bill be one about which further information is required, and it is desired to appoint a Select Committee, the Committee ought to be appointed before the second reading is agreed to.

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [4.10].- The motion for the second reading of a Bill is a substantive motion. If it is proposed by motion to refer a Bill to a Select Committee, that becomes the question before the Chair. Our Standing Orders contain certain provisions with regard to the recommittal of Bills. A motion to recommit supersedes the question before the Chair. Standing order 205 reads -

                    <para>On the motion for the adoption of the report, the Bill may, on motion, be recommitted, either in whole or in part. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The proposal for a recommittal is not taken as an amendment to the motion before the Chair, but under the standing order it becomes a substantive motion. Wherever the word " amendment " is used in a standing order, a motion and an amendment are presumed to be before the Chair, and the two questions are properly debatable together. Although the wording of the proposed new standing order may be somewhat clumsy, still that wording has been accepted hitherto and acted upon, and it has created no difficulty in the minds of honorable senators. If there be any charm in retaining words which have had an interpretation placed upon them, I think it undesirable to adopt the amendment of the honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>.- The motion before the Senate would be "That this Bill be now read a second time," and an honorable senator might propose, as an amendment, to omit "now" and to add "this day six months," so that the motion would read "That this Bill be read a second time this day six months." On the motion and the amendment the whole question would be under review and be decided. A motion is a substantive matter which is before the Senate and supersedes the original question. An honorable senator may say that it supersedes the original question with regard to the second reading taking place "now," and the limitation would be, strictly speaking, as to whether the Bill should be read "now" or "this day six months," without going into the whole merits, as honorable senators would be entitled to do if it were purely an amendment. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>This rule is proposed because it is thought undesirable that after a Bill has been read a second time without any objection having been taken an honorable senator should have the opportunity of raising in Committee the question whether it is properly before honorable senators or not. The Senate is the proper place in which to raise that question. When a Bill is read a second time it goes to a Committee, which, of course, can only deal with that which has been referred to it. The function of the Committee is to bring the verbiage of the Bill into consonance with the wishes of honorable senators, so long as amendments are relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. It would be undesirable that a debate should take place in Committee on a question of validity, which ought to have been raised before the second reading of the Bill was agreed to. When that motion is agreed to, the principle of the Bill is accepted, and the assumption is that it is properly before the Committee. The Senate having taken the responsibility of sending a Bill to the Committee, the Committee should not be called upon to judge whether the Senate has acted correctly. It is probable that the  Chairman  of Committees would not permit a debate on a matter of that kind, but he might do so, and it is as well that it should be definitely settled by our Standing Orders. I ask honorable senators to assent to the proposed new standing order, on the ground that the Committee has to deal only with a Bill after it has been referred to it by the Senate, and as the superior body, the Senate must accept the responsibility of deciding whether the Bill is properly before the Committee or not. </para>

                        <para>. - This proposes a very dangerous alteration in our procedure. I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that it is the duty of the Committee merely to alter the verbiage of a Bill, the second reading of which has been assented to by the Senate. It is the duty of the Committee to give the Bill just that exhaustive criticism in detail which we are unable to give it in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it would. It proposes that no question shall be raised in Committee as to whether any of the provisions of a Bill are properly before the Committee. There are many ways in which the provisions of a Bill may  not be properly before the Committee. It might be perfectly within the competence of the Senate to deal with a particular Bill, but some clause included in it might be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vi-res.</inline> Take, for instance, a BiH like the Navigation Bill, consisting of 467 clauses. Are we to assume that when that Bill is before the Senate for its second reading, honorable senators will be able to give all its clauses the careful scrutiny which might be necessary in order to discover whether, for instance, one of them was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires?</inline> Our usual practice in the discussion of Bills has been that, on the second reading we address ourselves to the general principles of the measure, and deliberately leave to the Committee on the Bill, the close examination of all. the clauses intended to give effect to its principles. I venture to say that we should find it impossible in many cases to give a Bill the careful scrutiny in the Senate which the proposed new standing order implies that we shall give it. If we adopt the proposed new standing order, we shall find ourselves tied down in Committee, and may, to our discomfiture, "be obliged to accept some clauses which, if we could give them the consideration they deserve, we would strike out. What is our ordinary procedure? If, in Committee, an honorable senator raises a question as to the validity, tor various reasons, of the clause of a Bill, he appeals to the  Chairman,  but we can go beyond the  Chairman  of Committees to the  President,  and beyond the  President  to the Senate itself. We shall lose nothing by continuing to exercise a power which, under the proposed new standing order, we should not be permitted to exercise in Committee. If the proposed new standing order is agreed to, the moment a Bill passes its second reading, no question affecting the validity of a clause can be raised, and I venture to say that if we adopt this procedure, the Senate will on more than one occasion in the future, cover itself with confusion, because there will be many points which could only be conveniently raised in Committee which will have escaped the observation of the Senate. </para>

To do so would be to manacle honorable senators, and to interfere with the opportunities at present afforded to enable the Senate to carry effective legislation.

If he supported the ruling of the  Chairman,  a majority of the Senate might afterwards overrule both  Chairman  and  President.  The object of the proposed new standing order is to prevent prolonged discussion in Committee upon a matter which should properly be dealt with on the second reading of a Bill in the Senate. It has been suggested, with a view to conserving the time of a Committee of the Senate, and honorable senators understand that the members of the  Standing Orders  Committee have no personal feeling in the matter. They have suggested the proposed new standing order to conserve the time of honorable senators in the Senate, and in Committee, and to secure the de- termination, at the proper stage of a Bill, of difficulties and questions of the character referred to.

                    <para>- - If the proposed new standing order is adopted the Senate, instead of gaining anything, will have placed itself at a very serious disadvantage. Every member of the Senate might be in favour of the principle of a Bill which contained a clause that for one reason or another might be held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> If the proposed new standing order were passed, and that were not discovered on the second reading, the Bill would have to be withdrawn, the time occupied in dealing with it would have been wasted, and a new Bill would have to be intro.duced. Without such a standing order the principle of the Bill could be affirmed on the second reading, and the Committee would have power to alter the objectionable clause. The only advantage which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has claimed for the proposed new standing .order is that it would conserve the time of honorable senators in the Senate and in Committee. I would ask honorable senators to say whether after nine years' experience of the work of the Senate they have known of such an inordinate waste of time as would justify the adoption of so drastic a standing order, which must deprive them of advantages which they now possess for discussion in Committee. As a matter of fact, we have, during the present session, been passing Bills with almost indecent haste. The business-paper in another place is overloaded with Bills which have already passed the Senate. I should like to say that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has so cogently urged, it is in Committee that defects in the clauses of a Bill are usually discovered, because it is in Committee only that they ran be subjected to close scrutiny and discussion. On the second reading of a Bill we can discuss only its general principles. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The  President  would very properly call any honorable senator to order who tried to initiate a Committee discussion on the second reading of a Bill. Honorable senators having only the opportunity to speak once on the second reading of a Bill would, if they raised a question as to the validity of a particular provision, be unable to combat the opposite view if it were subsequently urged. I should like to know what advantage is likely to be gained from the adoption of the proposed new standing order. At present we are able to discuss the principles of a Bill on the second reading, and if it is shown that it contains a flaw we can remedy it in Committee. The adoption of the proposed new standing order would deprive us of that advantage. I think the good sense of the Committee will be against the adoption of the proposed new standing order. </para>

                    <para>- - I share the apprehension expressed regarding the proposed new standing order. It appears to me that by adopting it we should deprive ourselves of any opportunity to discuss whether or not a certain clause should be included in a Bill. It is true that on the second reading we could raise a question as to whether or not the Bill was in order, but we should not be at liberty to raise a similar question with regard to a particular clause. Having passed the second reading of the Bill with the objectionable clause in it, we should be debarred in Committee from discussing whether or not the clause was properly included in the Bill. We might, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has suggested, favour the principle of the clause, but have grave doubts as to whether it should be included in the Bill. We should have no opportunity to discuss whether it was in order, as the moment the question was raised the  Chairman  of Committees would, under the proposed new standing order, say - " Honorable senators can discuss the merits of the clause, but not whether it is properly in the Bill." </para>

I, therefore, ask leave to withdraw the proposal.

                <para class="block">In the early history ot this Parliament the question arose whether it was competent tor the Senate to amend a certain class of Bills in parts, and to make requests in other parts. The Constitution lays it down that certain " proposed laws " may not be amended by the Senate. Now, a Bill may be regarded as embodying such " proposed laws," and it is sometimes found desirable to amend in certain respects a Bill which we cannot amend in all respects. That is the practice which has been laid down by mutual agreement between the two branches of the Legislature, and it seems to be a most convenient course to pursue. For instance, we cannot amend the clauses in a Bill so as to increase the burden of taxation. But such a Bill may contain a large number of other provisions which do not affect the question of increased taxation, and the Senate may find it necessary to amend, them. </para>

                        <para>- Those words refer to the message which would be sent to the other branch of the Legislature informing it that the Senate had agreed to the third reading of any Bill. In connexion with this standing order, the question arose as to whether the Senate should, in the first instance, request the other House to make amendments in certain Bills, and whether after those requests had been dealt with, the Bill should not be again taken into Committee where amendments might be made in other portions of it. It was, however, considered that it would be fairer to the other House to indicate at once where the Senate had made amendments in a Bill, and where it bad requested that amendments should be made. The other Chamber would then know exactly what were the views of the Senate upon it. It appears to me to be very much better that a Bill should pass through all our Committee stages before being transmitted from this Chamber to the House of Representatives. The other Chamber is then in a position to see the effect of our requests and also of our amendments. The proposed new standing order will facilitate the task of dealing with Bills which we may amend in parts, but which we may not amend in other parts, although we may make requests in regard to those parts. </para>

                    <para>Upon the disposal of such requested amendments, as provided in standing orders 240 to 246, inclusive, the Bill shall be read a third time, and thereafter the procedure in respect of amendments shall be followed -  is a crude way of expressing what is intended to  be conveyed. Of course, we all know what those words are intended to mean, but in their present form they certainly convey the impression that it will be open to the Senate to amend a Bill after it has been read a third time. If we are going to adopt this proposed standing order, I suggest that it would be wise to postpone its consideration with a view to permitting it to be redrafted in a better form. </para>

                    <para>.- I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that the proposal which we are now considering is a new one, and that standing order 227 deals wholly with the question of amendments. The latter lays down the whole procedure that must be followed in connexion with amendments made in Bills by the Senate. We know that it is not often that we are afforded an opportunity of dealing with our Standing Orders. These amending Standing Orders have been on the stocks for a very long time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is himself a member of the Standing Orders Committee, and has had a full opportunity of thrashing out the questions involved. </para>

After the Bill came back to us, and our requests were disposed of, we read the Bill a third time. </para>

                        <para>- I understand the honorable senator to say that after a Bill containing both requests and amendments is dealt with by this Chamber, our message goes to the other House; that the Bill then comes back to us ; and that then we pass the third reading, before the other House has dealt with our amendments. If such a procedure has been followed, I have no recollection of it. There is. a conflict of evidence. If the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> be correct, the concluding words of the proposed new standing order are required. </para>

                    <para>. - Let me ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to analyze the position which he states has been accepted by the Senate in the past. He has invited us to believe that our practice has been this - that we have read a Bill a third time in the Senate; that we have been told that all the requests made by us in the Bill have been agreed to by the other House, but that certain amendments which represent a form of our inherent right are outstanding and unsettled between the two Houses; and that, nevertheless, we have read such a Bill a third time. It seems to me to be incredible. If the Senate  has  read a Bill a third time under such circumstances - its requests having been agreed to, and its amendments remaining outstanding - it is a procedure that ought not under any circumstances to have been allowed. I trust that either the proposed new standing order will be postponed, or that the concluding words will be struck out. </para>

                        <para>- The standing order under consideration contemplates that procedure, and I feel confident that that course has been followed, although I have not had time to look up an instance. There is a good reason why it should be so, because if our requested amendments have been made by the other House, the Bill is in the same position as if we had amended it. It then goes to its third reading, and, so far as the Senate is concerned, that ends the matter. Our amended Bill is then dealt with by another place, and it may further amend the Bill. It should be borne in mind that it has not disposed of the Bill. </para>

If we send down a Bill with amendments we have agreed to the Bill as a scheme, but if we send back the Bill with requests for amendments, and also with amendments, our scheme may be altered entirely by the other House acceding to some of our requests and rejecting others. The Senate might not press its requests if it knew that some of them had been rejected elsewhere. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [5.12].- My memory is quite clear with regard to the Sugar Bounties Bill.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline>
                    has made a note that this practice was established at the suggestion of the Senate in connexion with that Bill, and the proposed Standing Orders are designed to meet a case of that kind. The Sugar Bounties Bill was amended by the Senate in several respects. There was one amendment which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                    held to infringe the rights of the other House, and which he pointed out should have been dealt with here by way of request. The Bill had gone through all stages here. When it was pointed out by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                    that in his opinion the Senate had exceeded its powers, the other House sent up a message reciting that statement, and asking us to make a request.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline>
                    Barton, the Prime Minister, pointed out very clearly what ought to be done, and his speech is very fully reported in
                    <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline>
                    In that case the difficulty was that the Senate had practically dealt with the Bill finally. It had been read a third time here, but, notwithstanding that fact, it came back from the other House. We recognised that the Bill should not have been dealt with finally by the Senate until it had had an opportunity of knowing the attitude of the other House with regard to the request. Had we sent down amendments together with requests the other House might have accepted the Bill subject to our amendments, but declined to make the requests. It was felt that that procedure would place the Senate in a false position, because the amendments might be of such a nature that it had only been induced to insert them subject to the requested amendments being made. In the proposed standing order it is provided that after a Bill has gone through the Committee stage, and the report has been adopted, and before proceeding to the third reading, the Bill shall be sent back with a message requesting the other House to make the amendments desired. Upon the disposal of our request as provided in standing orders 240 to 246 inclusive, the Bill is to be read a third time, and thereafter the procedure in respect to amendments followed. Those standing orders relate to the proceedings on Bills which the Senate may not amend. Standing order 240 provides that unless otherwise ordered, after the second reading has been passed the Bill has to be referred to a Committee, of the whole. Then on the adoption of the Committee's report a message has to be sent to the other House, and if we receive a message stating that it has completely complied with our requests, the Bill is read a third time here and passed.

                        <para>- The other House must have the Bill before it can make any amendments in accordance with bur requests. If a Bill were sent back after it had been read a third time here, the other House might decline to make the amendments we desired, and send the Bill straight away to be assented to. In the new rule, it is provided that a message shall go to the other House containing the requests from the Committee for amendments. If the other House accedes to the requests, the Bill is to be returned and the Senate is to proceed right away to the third reading stage. If the other House does not agree to our requests, but agrees to them in only a modified form, then, under standing order 245, the Senate can deal with the Bill at that stage, and come to a conclusion. The difficulty has been as to what steps should be taken when we have considered a composite Bill, sent down a message indicating our requested amendments, and the requests have been dealt with by the other House. The Committee stage has been passed, and there is only one course to take, and that is to proceed with the third reading. On the receipt of our message, the other House deals with only our requests, but it knows the amendments we desire, and thereby it is enabled to deal more clearly with our requests. Then it sends back the Bill, and if we come to a satisfactory agreement as to the requests, we proceed to the third reading. If we have made amendments in the (Bill besides those which the  other  House has made, then a message is sent down  to the effect that the Senate has agreed to the Bill with the amendments indicated in the schedule. The other House may accept the Bill with the amendments, or it  may send back the Bill, saying that it declined to agree to our amendments, but had agreed to some, and disagreed with others. It is then necessary to refer the message of the other House to a Committee of the whole Senate to be dealt with. In accordance with standing order 245, the Committee deal with the message, and then a message is sent to the other House. If, after the exchange of messages, the Houses cannot be brought into agreement, provision is made in the Standing Orders for the holding of a conference, in order to ascertain whether the Bill can be brought into shape. The concluding words of the proposed new rule, " and thereafter the procedure, in respect to amendments shall be followed," are inserted in order to enable the Senate to deal with the various messages which may be received from time to time with respect to amendments. It will be observed that it only deals with Bills in respect of which both amendments and requests are desired. The other House has no opportunity of dealing with our amendments until the Bill has been read a third time here. </para>

I propose instead of adopting the proposed new . standing order which I have quoted, to provide that the first stage at which a request may be made shall be on the motion for the first reading. I will explain the reason for that. In the early days of the Parliament a Bill was sent to the Senate which we had not the right to amend. It was an Appropriation Bill for the annual services. There was no schedule attached to the Bill showing the salaries to be paid <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> various officials.

                <para class="block">Commons to the House of Lords. It simply included a summary of amounts for the various departments. The Senate determined that as under the Constitution we have a perfect right to review the salaries proposed to be paid to the various officials, it was necessary that we should have a schedule to enable us to ascertain what those salaries were ; and T quote the following from the record of what took place on the second reading of the Bill on the  14th  June,  1901 - </para>

                <para class="block">Then the main question as amended was carried, and the Bill was returned to another place, with a message requesting that it might be so amended as to show the items of expenditure comprised in the sums which it purported to grant to  His  Majesty. If we had had in force a standing order in the form recommended by the Standing Orders Committee, we would have been confronted with the difficulty that we should have had to carry the second reading of the Bill before any request could have been submitted for its amendment in such a way as to supply a schedule of the salaries. It is very much better that a request of the kind should be moved on the first reading, because it does not deal with individual items, but with a general principle desired to be affirmed. In another case some difficulty arose with regard to the preamble of a Bill in which it was stated that the House of Representatives had granted certain sums of money to  His  Majesty for the services of the year. It was pointed out that the grant of Supply was not by the House of Representatives only, but by both Houses of the Federal Parliament. ' The Bill in .question was returned to the House of Representatives with a request for amendment, and the wording of the preamble now used to such measures was adopted. The grant of Supply is initiated in another place, but both Houses of Parliament make the grant. That is an amendment which might properly have been considered on the first or second reading of the Bill. At the time it was not competent for a request to be submitted on the motion for the first reading, which had to be accepted or rejected. The request in that case was, therefore, proposed on the second reading. The Standing Orders under which we are working to-day are not the Standing Orders which were in existence at that time. At present, as. honorable senators are aware, they are entitled to debate the first reading of a Bill which the Senate may not amend, and are not confined in that debate to the subject-matter of the Bill. It has occurred to me, and in this matter I have been acting since the Standing Orders Committee met, -that it would be wise to afford an opportunity on the first reading of such a Bill for the making of a request. So that if a Bill of the character of the measure to which I have referred had been dealt with in the early part of  1901-2,  were before the Senate, we might on the first reading, carry a motion requesting the House of Representatives to make- any amendment in it we thought desirable. On the Bill being returned to the Senate, we could continue its consideration in the ordinary way. In order that large powers may be given honorable senators under the Standing Orders, I desire that the proposed new standing order shall be amended in the way I have indicated. Honorable senators may ask why we should not take the power to move a request on the second reading, and my reply is that, if upon such a Bill being presented in the Senate, it is found that there is any omission to recognise the powers of the Senate with regard to it, it is very much better that before it is read a first time, we should intimate to the House of Representatives our objection to its form, and request it to make the necessary change. </para>

                        <para>.- That is so. But honorable senators are at liberty to debate the first reading of such a Bill and during the debate they would, no doubt,  discover whether any amendment was desirable. I think it is very much better that on the second reading discussion should be confined to the subject-matter of the Bill, and we should take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the first reading' to make such requests as may be considered necessary. </para>

                        <para>- If it is intended to proceed with the consideration of such measures I think that the  President  might be given an opportunity to examine them before they are brought before the Senate to see whether it is desirable that any request for an amendment should be submitted. Another question has arisen in this connexion. It has been contended by another place that the Senate has no right to make a request more than once. We have" made a request which has not been acceded to, and have then sent a message insisting upon our request. Although the House of Representatives has considered such a message they have always, on the reconsideration of a request, carried a motion that it is not to be considered as a precedent in any way interfering with their rights and privileges. 1 think it is wise that we should definitely affirm by our Standing Orders that we claim the right to make a request more than once. We should lay down what we consider to be our rights, duties, and privileges in this connexion. It is contended that the wording of section 53 of the Constitution - </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [5.47].- Standing order 224A provides that requested amendments in any Bill must be disposed of before that Bill can be read a third time. But under the proposal which we are now considering the Senate would have power to amend the motion for the third reading of the Bill by making requests for further amendments. If that course were adopted the Bill would then be returned to the House of Representatives with a request that certain amendments should be made. When those requests have been finally disposed of the Bill would be read a third time. This proposal is really- an extension of the power conferred by standing order  224A,  and not a contradiction of it.

                    <para>. - While the new standing order is designed to meet such cases as have occurred more than once, there are nevertheless some dangers which it is desirable to avoid. Let us see what may happen. A senator might begin a second-reading speech at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. At 5 o'clock he might desire to get permission to resume his speech on a subsequent occasion. If that leave were granted it would operate as an adjournment of the debate, and other business could be taken. I do not think that that is what we mean. When a senator gets leave to resume his speech, it is not intended that the Government should have power to bring on fresh business. That would be a very dangerous innovation. </para>

                        <para>- The proposed new standing order might operate in such a way as to cut off from other senators the opportunity of debating a certain Bill for a considerable time. The provision is rather dangerous as it stands, and will be followed by consequences wider than are contemplated. I do not think it is desirable that a debate should be adjourned while there is full time to continue it during the sitting of the Senate then proceeding. Nor do I think it is desirable that if a senator at 20 minutes to 10 o'clock at night gets leave to continue his speech the following day, the Government should be allowed to bring on fresh business. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [6.1].- What
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    has stated is quite correct. The proposed new standing order contemplates that if a senator obtains leave to continue his speech, the result shall be to close the debate automatically for the time being. It would be quite competent for a senator at half -past 5 in the afternoon to obtain per- mission to continue his speech at a later time, and the Government might then proceed with other business. If, however, a senator, through indisposition, obtained leave under the standing order, it would not be right, and would indeed be extremely awkward, for three or four other senators to intervene with speeches, and then - perhaps in the following week - for the senator who obtained leave, to deliver the remaining portion of his speech. I do not think that such a course should be permitted. But, nevertheless, the standing order will be useful in some cases. Take the case of a Minister who moves the second reading of a Bill at half-past 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon, expecting to conclude by about half-past 4. In consequence of interjections of a very pertinent character, perhaps, he might not be able to conclude his speech before the usual time for adjournment, and might wish to obtain leave to finish it on the next sitting day. If, however, there be a fear that the proposed new standing order contains an element of danger, I shall not feel justified in pressing it upon the Senate. It simply embodies what has been our practice.

                <para class="block">Reply affords an opportunity for honorable senators to criticise the conduct of the Government, the administration of the Departments, the legislation proposed to be. introduced, and the necessity for other legislation being submitted. Under a strict interpretation of our Standing Orders, a senator might be precluded from alluding, during the course of a debate on the Address-in-Reply, to any subject with regard to which a notice of motion had been given. A case of the kind came before me as  President  some time ago. I then declined to prevent an honorable senator from discussing a matter during the Address-in-Reply debate, although notice of motion had been given with regard to the subject in question. I considered that it was not right to block debate by such a method. In the Parliament of New South Wales, of which I was a member, notice of motion was at one time frequently given for the express purpose of preventing discussion on certain questions. The motion having been placed upon the business paper, it would remain there for two or three months. When it was called on, the mover would simply decline to proceed with it, and would give fresh notice immediately afterwards. Under this proposed new standing order, it would not be possible to block debate on any matter for a longer period than four weeks. The proviso may be commended to the Senate as an improvement on our present standing order. </para>

On first reading of a Supply Bill ample latitude is allowed, because that is practically our grievance day. But, under the present rule, an honorable senator can give a week's notice of a motion relating to a matter which other honorable senators might desire to discuss on the first reading of a Supply Bill. Is it not also necessary to provide that the debate on the first reading of such a Bill shall not be circumscribed by the presence of such a notice of motion on the business-paper? </para>

                        <para>- Under the proposed standing order the discussion of a subject could not be blocked for a longer period than four weeks. I think it is a wise rule that when a senator is discussing grievances on a Supply Bill he should not be allowed to anticipate the discussion on a specific motion. I draw a distinction between the ventilation of grievances on a Supply Bill and the discussion on the Address-in-Reply. The submission of the Address-in-Reply provides the first opportunity to honorable senators for discussing various matters which may have arisen during the recess. But after the Senate has been sitting for a considerable time an honorable senator has had many opportunities on motions for adjournment to bring forward grievances, before a motion dealing with a grievance was placed on the notice-paper. If an honorable senator wants to protect himself, he can give notice of a motion for a day or two prior to the expected introduction of a Supply Bill, then withdraw the motion and ventilate its subject-matter in connexion with that Bill. I think it is much better not to allow the subject-matter of a notice of motion to be anticipated by honorable senators when they are ventilating grievances on a Supply Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The object of the proposed rule is practically to prevent the forestalling of any honorable senator who wishes to discuss a subject on a specific motion, but its application is limited to the debate on the Address-in-Reply. In a recess extending over four or five months honorable senators hear of matters of which, perhaps, they had no previous knowledge. In a new session they naturally do not wish to postpone the consideration of those matters. On the contrary, they desire to afford an early opportunity for discussion to honorable senators generally, and, therefore, they do not set down any motions on the notice-paper. One senator, however, may have heard of a subject which he may not desire to be discussed on the Address-in-Reply, and so, in order to block its discussion, he gives notice of a motion for a date some time ahead. That has happened from time to time. I quite agree with this proposal to allow freedom of discussion on the Address-in-Reply, but I think that the rule should be extended to Supply Bills. Whilst I recognise that on a motion for adjournment an honorable senator has an opportunity to discuss a matter which is not embodied in a notice of motion, at the "same time that may not afford sufficient time for a full discussion of it. No satisfaction is derived from moving the adjournment of the Senate to discuss a question, because, as a rule, the motion is withdrawn after the grievance has been ventilated, and no definite result has been achieved. Naturally honorable senators do not want to lose hours of valuable time by agreeing to such a motion. On the first reading of a Supply Bill the rule of relevancy does not apply. Some honorable senators may desire to secure the full discussion of a subject, But they can be forestalled by one senator giving notice of a specific motion. When we are depriving an honorable senator of the opportunity to hobble his fellow senators on the Address-in-Reply, would it not be as well to secure as free scope for discussion on a' Supply Bill as on the Address-in-Reply? I feel inclined to move an amendment, unless a very strong reason is given for not extending the application of the proposed rule. </para>

                    GOULD (New. South Wales) [6.24].- Tt is a matter of fairness to an honorable senator who has given notice of a motion which he honestly intends to discuss, that it should not be anticipated. Month- after month a Supply Bill comes up, and if the rule against anticipating discussion is relaxed, an honorable senator will never be safe in regard to any motion he may have on the notice-paper. Would it be fair to allow the discussion of the subject-matter of a motion to be anticipated whenever a Supply Bill came up?
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline>
                    must see the
                    <inline font-style="italic">reason</inline>
                    for distinguishing between the Address-in Reply and a Supply Bill. It is only once in a session that the Senate is called upon to consider an Address-in-Reply, and it is the first matter submitted after a recess. An honorable senator will have been in attendance in the Senate, perhaps, for three or four weeks before a Supply Bill is introduced, and during that time he .will have had an opportunity
                    <inline font-style="italic">to put</inline>
                    a
                    <inline font-style="italic">motion</inline>
                    on the business-paper. If he does not do so why should he be enabled to take advantage of his own neglect, and at the same time prevent another honorable senator dealing with the matter later? It may be suggested that the proposal would fetter honorable senators to a certain extent, but it would be in their interests generally. If it be right on a Supply Bill to anticipate the discussion of a motion, why not on any other measure? Why not permit a motion for the adjournment of the Senate in order to discuss a matter of which an honorable senator has given notice weeks ahead ? The question of urgency in the case of motions for the adjournment of the Senate is not settled by the  President,  but by honorable senators, and any honorable senator who desires to move the adjournment of the Senate can always induce four others to assist him.

                        <para>.- Nothing is settled by the discussion of a matter on a Supply Bill,, because no definite conclusion upon it is arrived at. Whereas if an honorable senator submits a specific motion an opportunity is given to the Senate to arrive at a decision upon it, and a record of the decision is made in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the Senate.</inline> When honorable senators debate grievances on a Supply Bill they are aware that no decision as to their grievances can be arrived at. It was felt that it would be much better to give honorable senators an opportunity to discuss grievances on the first reading of a Supply Bill than to make provision for a grievance day once a week, or. once a fortnight. I think the Committee will be well advised in adhering to the standing order as now proposed, knowing that it is intended to extend the liberties of honorable senators, and that this amendment has been recommended by the Standing Orders Committee after very careful consideration. The protection is afforded that debate on a motion must be initialed within four weeks. As private business is to be 'taken after dinner it is necessary that the Committee should now report progress, but I suggest to honorable senators, who have private business on the notice-paper, that they might agree to the remainder of the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee being dealt with at a later stage this day. </para>

                <para>In submitting this motion, I desire to affirm that the present system of supplying cable news through the daily press iri Australia is costly, that the conditions associated with it are unfair and oppressive in their operation, and that the news supplied under the system is inadequate, garbled, and inaccurate. It is difficult, without an inquiry, to prove the first assertion that it is costly, but I am satisfied, from information L have received, some of which I am unable to use because it was given to me in confidence, that it is a costly system. It is so costly that we do not get the volume of news we ought to receive, that its dissemination throughout the Commonwealth is extremely limited. The character of the information regarding other parts of the Empire which we might reasonably expect is such that its dissemination ought not to be so limited. The reason why I am unable to give some of the information in my possession is that the persons who have supplied me with it have told me that they would be prejudiced in their business if their names were mentioned, or if the facts were given in such a way that they might be identified as the persons from whom they were obtained. I think, however, that without using this information, I shall be able, before I sit down, to give honorable senators some evidence in support of the contention that the existing system is costly. I can in an indirect way submit evidence on the point from the experience of the Dominion of New Zealand. The </para>

In the Dominion of New Zealand they get their cable news from the same source that we get ours in the Commonwealth. The Parliament of the Dominion sanctioned the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the matter.

                    <para>Before we look at what the Press Association has done for New Zealand, let us have a glance at what New Zealand has done for the press, and incidentally the Press Association. Parliament has done a good deal to encourage the newspaper business. It has admitted printing paper free through the Customs (except for a preferential duty). It has made press cablegrams copyright for eighteen hours after their  receipt, and it has agreed that newspapers shall be carried through the post, and by rail at exceptionally low rates; newspaper exchanges can go free from one newspaper office to another; reporters can travel on the railways at one-quarter the ordinary fares; and press cablegrams are transmitted at rates so low that though they cost the Telegraph Department one-third of its expenditure, they bring in only about one-tenth of its revenue - at least so it was officially stated some years ago. </para>

                    <para>Now let us see what the Press Association is doing for New Zealand. A Select Committee of the House of Representatives in 1896 made a report in which it said, " The evidence laid before the Committee shows that since the passing of the Protection of Telegrams Act in 1882 the whole cable service of the Colony has fallen into the hands of the United Press Association Limited. Prior to that date there were competing associations, and an alternative cable service was supplied by Reuter. All other organizations for the supply of news have dropped out of existence;, and the United Press Association has control of the entire news service from beyond the Colony. The Committee has also ascertained that a combination of the leading papers exists in Australia to supply the associated journals with news from foreign countries. The Press Association of New Zealand is connected with this Australian combinatien, and thus a monopoly exists as between New Zealand and the Australian Colonies, the information being received by the combination in Australia and then passed on to the Press Association in New Zealand. The Press Association appears in the first place to have originated as a co-operative movement on the part of the proprietors of a number of the leading papers. Its nominal capital is <inline font-style="italic">£500,</inline> divided into 500 shares of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> each. The total capital paid upon each share is <inline font-style="italic">as.</inline> 6d., and the calls received up to the 19th November, 1895, amounted to£41 17s. 6d., which represents the total paid-up capital of the association. The uncalled capital is £293 2s. 6d. There are some twenty shareholders in the association, some of whom hold five shares and some twenty, which latter number provides the qualification for a director. The evidence goes on to show that out of no newspapers in the Colony there are about 55 which subscribe to the association as clients, paying annual fees, which are fixed by the association for cables and for inter-provincial telegrams supplied. The subscribers as such have no voice in the control or management of the association, or in the fixing of the entrance or annual fees. Those matters are vested entirely in the shareholders, who appoint the directors. </para>

In a letter addressed to me, and dated Melbourne, 2nd October, 1905, that gentleman - as will be seen by reference to page 3467 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 12th October, of that year - wrote - </para>

                    <para>I vouch for the substantial accuracy of this narrative, which you are free to use as you may deem fit. From 1895 to 1898 I carried on a newspaper at Menzies, W.A. . . . Suddenly, however, about May, 1898, just when public interest in the Spanish-American war was at its height, and on the day when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone's</inline> death was expected, I was informed, without the slightest premonitory hint, that my cable intelligence was to be stopped forthwith. . . . Ultimately, under the duress of circumstances from which there was no escape, I concluded a three years' contract with the syndicate, by which they were to receive a royalty at the rate of ^150 per annum. </para>

                    <para>This contract bound me to use, their cables exclusively, so that I could have been penalized for the publication of a cable message obtained from any other source. A similar exaction was extorted' from the rival journal. This was a crushing charge on small provincial journals having a sale of not more than 700 copies daily ; but the syndicate's agent was adamant. No Shylock ever held more inexorably to his bond. But something even, more intolerable than the royalty impost was to follow. My contract was, it appeared, for the full cable service; and the full service, not any summary of it, the syndicate insisted I must take. This involved the payment of the inland telegraphic rate of rs. 6d. per 100 words on reams of messages which were absolutely useless, and for which the paper had no space. I asked to be allowed to follow the former practice of having the news summarized by my Perth agent. The answer was "No; you must take the cables as we send them, or not at all " - an offer of freedom of contract somewhat after the Thunderbolt manner, but without Thunderbolt's risks. </para>

I come now to the class of news that we get here. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Alfred</inline> Manes, Professor of the Commercial University in Berlin, is reported in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> of  28th  August of the present year, to have said -  " The information you get about us all comes from London. All you get comes through the cables, and what is given is very poor information, and not at all the best. I was really astonished to find that the whole of the information about Europe is given by one man sitting in London, and sending just a few lines about the most important things. From Perth to Wellington it is just the same. I was astonished to find five million people who are very intelligent people, content with this information. If you would have good representatives on the Continent of Europe, you would get valuable help for your social legislation." </para>

                        <para>- I shall take up his statement as to the garbled news we get through our newspapers. I shall quote a case relating to what was probably the most important news which we have had cabled to Australia for some years. I allude to that relating to the Naval scare which some time ago agitated the public mind. It is, I should say, of first rate importance that at any rate, news concerning statements made by a responsible Minister of the Crown in Great Britain should come to us in something like an accurate fashion, especially when that Minister is dealing with such vital relationships as those between Great Britain and European nations, and when the statements reported are alleged to have been made by one holding the position of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. </para>

That is the element of doubt and uncertainty. The first thing we have got to make sure of is our capacity to build. We have got to take stock of the plant in the country, of the power in this country to construct ships of this type in order that when we give orders for ships they may be completed in the shortest possible time.

This cablegram appeared, on the face of it, to indicate that the "Confederates" (Tariff reform extremists) had had their way, and that the Free-traders were under the ban.

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. I know that this combine has been button-holing honorable senators, and lobbying. I am aware that the very newspaper which denounced lobbying here in most emphatic terms has been lobbying during the last week in order to secure the defeat of this motion, and the argument is being used that it is a private business. In this State certain trains are run at a loss in order to give cable news circulation throughout the country. I do not complain of that. But it is a recognition by the State Parliament of the fact that this is not a private, but a public, business. </para>

                        <para>- Education is not a private matter, but a State matter, which affects the State. The Commonwealth allows the press to have cablegrams at a lower rate than other persons in order that news may be disseminated. I ask honorable senators when they are buttonholed to ask the representatives of the combine if they claim protection from the proposed inquiry on the ground that they are engaged in a private business, and' whether they are prepared to give up all the concessions which they now enjoy on the ground that they are conducting a public business and benefiting the people. In the United States, this has been dealt with as public business. Under the Anti-Trust law of the State of Texas the following corporations, co-partnerships, firms, or individuals, are also adjudged monopolies, and subject to all the pains and penalties therein provided - </para>

                        <para>- I remind the honorable senator that this Senate has also passed similar freak legislation. In the Copyright Bill, we inserted a prohibition against the exclusive dealing of this combine, but it was dropped by the Government in another place. Certainly, the Senate did attempt to make the ground of copyright conditional upon the right of the other newspapers to share in the news. I ask the Senate to grant an inquiry into the conditions so that the facts may be ascertained, and perhaps some means suggested by which the news service both within and without the Commonwealth may be better conducted than it is at present. </para>

                        <para>[8.32].  - In submitting this motion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> appealed to the sympathies of honorable senators in connexion with a case which occupied public attention a little time ago. It will be remembered that in  1906  this Parliament passed an Excise Act, the effect of which was to impose Excise duties on certain agricultural machinery in the event of the manufacturers not giving fair and reasonable terms to their employes. One provision was that if on an application by a manufacturer it was shown to the Arbitration Court that fair and reasonable wages were paid an exemption from the Excise might be made in his favour. </para>

Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was paying fair and reasonable wages or not has nothing to do with the issue, which is that the Senate should affirm that the agricultural implement employes are entitled to some compensation in connexion with the expense to which they were put in the Arbitration Court.

I understand that a bill pf costs for£1,127 has been furnished by the legal representative of the unions in connexion with, the arbitration proceedings. Practically what the Senate is asked to do is to approve of the payment of that amount. </para>

                            <para>- I shall endeavour, if it is repeated later, to answer it. I want honorable senators first to view the matter from this stand-point, that the application referred to was, to all intents and purposes, an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> one on the part of the manufacturer to the Court for an exemption. It is quite competent for the Court to call to its help any evidence which it can procure for the purpose of enabling it to determine whether, as a matter of fact, fair and reasonable wages are paid. It is not a question of law which is involved, but of fact. It is usual for the Court to solicit the assistance of representatives of the unions- those who are technically acquainted with the industry - to enable it to arrive at a proper determination. If any question of law had been involved the Court could have asked for legal assistance in order to come to a correct interpretation of the question at issue. I want honorable senators to bear in mind that it was an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> application. As a matter of grace only the unions are permitted to be  represented in such cases and, if I may say so, still more as a matter of grace are legal representatives permitted to appear. </para>

The inquiry is not a cause, it is not an industrial dispute, and I take it to be merely an inquiry in which the duty is imposed upon the  President,  from any source and in any way he can obtain it, provided his method of inquiry is judicial and in open Court, whether the wages are fair and reasonable. But although there are no parties except the applicant, I must recognise that the workmen employed in the factory are persons directly interested. There are other persons indirectly interested. Those are the general body of workers in the same trade. It would be of assistance to me in this inquiry, and it would probably be a better method of representation of the workers and all those interested in the inquiry, if I could have at these inquiries the assistance of the representatives of the Unions to which the men belong. For many reasons it would be much more satisfactory than having representatives from the persons employed. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will pardon me. It is not an established practice. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor permitted it in that case, and might or might not permit it in other cases ; but what I have said must be borne in mind in considering the request now made. So that under such circumstances the Unions could not become entitled to costs at all. What they did was of their own volition, and for their own prospective benefit. The second matter to which I wish to refer is that we are being asked to establish a most serious precedent. I remind honorable senators that Parliament acted in the utmost good faith in exercising what it believed to be a power within its jurisdiction. As has happened in some other cases, the constitutionality of the Statute was successfully challenged. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> proposes, it is to be laid down as a principle that compensation is to be paid to those who may suffer by reason of the unconstitutionality of any law <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> passed by this Parliament, we shall be exposing Parliament to heavy claims for compensation in the future. </para>

                            <para>- We went into the whole of these matters long ago, and it is not worth while to revive them now. I repeat that it would be an intolerable condition of affairs if we were to lay it down as a principle that damages and compensation should, follow where Parliament enacts a law which is subsequently declared to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> I go further and say that if in this particular case we are going to reimburse the workers the large sum of money that is asked for under the motion, it is inevitable that we must likewise compensate the manufacturers. There is no escaping that position. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend can scarcely suggest that the cases under the Electoral Act present the remotest analogy. We are dealing in the present case with a matter which was taken before a judicial tribunal, involving the interpretation of a law. In the cases to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> have referred, the reimbursements were made because of the negligence of a particular officer in the administration of an Act. That is a vastly different thing. An officer of the Government was negligent in the carrying out of his instructions. </para>

                        <para>. -  I hope that the motion will meet with the approval of the majority of the Senate. During the speech made by the Minister of Trade and Customs, I ventured upon one or two pertinent interjections, to which the honorable senator replied by saying that it was of no use to try to cloud the issue. I think that the Minister was endeavouring to cloud the issue. It is just as well to review the whole of the circumstances. Every member of the Senate is familiar with the fact that a fair measure of protection was given to the manufacturers engaged in this particular industry, conditionally on fair and reasonable wages being paid to every one employed in it. The Government provided machinery whereby Excise duty was to be collected from; those who did not .pay fair and reasonable wages. 'We were assured that the method proposed by the Government for regulating the matter was constitutional. In my opinion the duty of the Government at the time was to have collected the Excise and the onus of proving that they were paying fair and reasonable wages should have been cast upon McKay and the other manufacturers. The responsibility for testing the validity of the Act was thrown upon a number of workmen, who, although they were poorly paid, risked their employment to defend an Act of this Parliament. When the case was before the Arbitration Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> had the brazen-faced audacity to submit what he called evidence to show that he was paying fair and reasonable wages to every one in his employ. Those who saw his list of wages paid, are aware that some of the work done in his factory was carried out under the worst form of sweating. The workmen found that they had to defend the Act in defending themselves, and their union was involved in law costs to the extent of hundreds of pounds. I say that it is not right to ask any union that expected to obtain relief under an Act of Parliament to defend its validity. </para>

                        <para>. - I admit at once that this proposal is surrounded with some difficulty. At the same time it is highly desirable that we should separate questions of legality and justice from considerations of personal  sympathy. If the Senate were to agree to this motion, it seems to me that it would establish a precedent the consequences of which it is impossible to foresee.

It is contended that all applications submitted by the employers in Victoria for exemption from paying Excise were proved to be not fair and reasonable in the opinion of the Justice presiding, and in arriving at this conclusion the Justice was materially assisted by the action of the Trades Unions.

                    <para class="block">In order to do this, it is stated that it was necessary to have legal assistance, and the expense incurred by them, with no funds to meet the expenditure, was£1,127. In South Australia there was a similar experience, although not so finally disastrous. The only result the unions obtained for this enormous liability was that they proved to the satisfaction of the respective Justices who heard the cases that they had in both States shown that fair and reasonable wages were not being paid. In addition to these legal costs, individual members of the unions lost considerable time in attending the Courts and. working up the cases. One of their leading officials was employed for nearly two months in collecting evidence, for which he received no remuneration. It is further stated that the members of the unions subscribed among themselves , £255 17s. 2d., which was all spent in organizing in favour of the New Protection. It is claimed for the men that their action was not alone in their own interests, but was for the public weal, and it is in this connexion that your Commissioners call attention to a leading article in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of the 20th May last, which bears out the contention of the representatives of the unions that a living wage, based on the great principle laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Justice</inline> Higgins, is not necessarily in the interests of the wage-earners alone, but of society itself. The article in question says, " Not only the wage-earner, and the wage-payer, but society as well, is profoundly interested in the success of industrial legislation, and the Courts which interpret that legislation. The attempt to regulate wages and conditions of labour according to law must be recognised as one of the most intelligent and creditable efforts ever made by society to safeguard itself from loss and strife. Socially considered, it is protective in its essence, and, at the same time, humanitarian in its incidence; and in order that it may knit more firmly the fabric of society, industrial law must have the most sympathetic interpretation in the industrial Courts..... <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins laid down that great principle in declaring that the living wage should be such as will support the workman and the workman's wife and family in frugal comfort." </para>
                    <para class="block">I shall not say that honorable senators opposite publicly deny a statement of that description ; but I do say that their actions in connexion with legislation . of this kind speak far louder than their words. If they had their way the condition of the workers and of their wives and families would not be such as was so graphically described by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Justice Higgins. </para>

The Federal Parliament is responsible for the creation of the Act, and by a majority of one the High Court is responsible for its being rendered ineffective.

The wages recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins were gazetted by the Government as fair and reasonable. In November, 1907, the Minister of Trade and Customs issued a schedule containing the standard wages laid down, by the Judge. Only two employers were paying those wages, both being small men who employed at the outside only two or three employe's. None of the big employers paid the scheduled rates. Time after time members of Parliament appealed to the Government to do something effective. But the Government coolly ignored the requests made to them. They allowed the amount due by the manufacturers to mount up. </para>

He reminded one of the squid which, when an enemy approaches, makes no attempt to fight, but ejects from its own body a mass of black fluid which obscures the water around it, and enables the squid to escape. The statement of the Minister of Trade and Customs was very much like that. He made no attempt to justify the action of the Government in connexion with the administration of the Excise Act. He simply said that it would be a bad thing if we were to take up questions of this sort which might involve the Commonwealth in considerable expense. </para>

                            <para>- A Board was established some years ago by the Victorian Government, but I understand that the manufacturer who is principally interested shifted his works outside the area to which the Wages Board applied, thus enabling him .to collect labour from any part of Australia, and to work his men any hours he liked for any pay he could induce them to accept. What did the Government do when the manufacturers neglected to pay the wages that had been gazetted? They never attempted to collect a penny of Excise. They knew that the law was being broken. They knew that the proper wages were not being paid. Representations were made to them time after time, but they declined to put the law into operation, and to collect the Excise. The Government knew, very well how the manufacturers had buttonholed members of Parliament, and said that they were prepared to pay fair and reasonable wages if more protection was extended to them. They knew the manufacturers had not carried out their promise. In the face of that, to say that these law-breakers should be compensated for .breaking the law, and that the men who assisted the Government in the public interest to see that the law was carried out, should be penalized to the extent of having to pay their own expenses, is a most remarkable proposition. Some one, by way of interjection, made a remark about the Government paying expenses in connexion with a case which arose under the electoral law. The Minister then sheltered himself under the plea that that was due to the blundering of an official. In other words, because an official under the electoral law made a blunder, the Government were prepared to compensate those who were the victims. But who made the blunder in relation to the law affecting the' harvester Excise? Was it an official in that case? I suppose that the Customs officers were responsible, unless the Minister at the head of the Department refused to allow the officials to take the necessary action. If so, the blunder was made by the Minister who had sworn to administer without fear or favour the law which he himself was a party to passing through the Legislature. It seems to me to be nothing more than a reasonable proposition that if men are put to great expense through the neglect of a Minister to carry out the law, they should be compensated. </para>

If we knew that we should be able to sheet home the blame to the proper quarter. I do not propose to read any more from the report of the Royal Commission. There is, however, one striking passage in which a comparison is made between the wages paid by some manufacturers and the rates laid down in the schedule compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. What I want to do is to put forward the evidence on which this Commission based its recommendation that the amount should be paid. On page 175 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> F. Russell, who, I believe, is the secretary of the men's organization, gave the following evidence: - </para>

                        <para>The union is mainly composed of working men, and I am sorry to have to say that many workers in the industry stand out of the union, and do not assist us, although they share in any benefit secured as the result of our work. We consider that some assistance should be given us to enable us to pay off our debt of £1,127 to the lawyers; otherwise it must be many years before we can pay it off, and it must cripple our operations in the meantime. We are hoping that as the outcome of the inquiry by this Commission, it will be recognised that the action we took was in the interests of the community generally. We claim that by our action we proved that the Constitution was not what it was thought to be, and in that respect we did work which should have been done by the Federal Parliament. We trust that the Commission will recommend to the Parliament that we should be reimbursed some, of our expenses in the matter. As an organization we consider that the object of Federation was to bring about better conditions, not merely for manufacturers, but for the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. From a national stand-point, we say that the States Parliaments are unable to legislate properly in regard to industries, and that in order that industrial conditions in each State shall, as nearly as possible, be brought into line, it is essential that the National Parliament should have control of industrial legislation. </para>

                            Chairman. - What is your chief reason for suggesting that Parliament should bear the costs to which you have been subjected. If Parliament did so, would it not have to bear the cost also of the other side? - Yes; we say that the whole of the costs in the case should be borne by the whole of the community, considering that the litigation was forced upon those engaged in the industry. We had to prove our case, and we did so. When the Act was proved unconstitutional, employers were  able  to evade the regulation. We consider that the whole body politic, and not merely a section of the community, has been benefited by our action, and we, therefore, think that the community as a whole should bear the expense. Another argument in support of our contention, is that we are working men in receipt of only very limited incomes.

                    <para class="block">We can easily understand that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jus,tice</inline> Higgins did not fix what was considered an extortionate wage. On the contrary, after making inquiries wherever he possibly could, and getting evidence throughout Australia, he fixed what he considered to be a fair and reasonable wage from the stand-point of a worker, so that there might be frugal comfort, as he stated, for the worker, his wife, and his family. But not one of the employers paid- this wage. There were only two of them who, as I have said, attempted to pay a wage near the rate. When the workers ask the State to pay their law costs, how are they met? They are met by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> just as if they were asking him for a drink on the pavement, or for something of that sort. He turns round and says: "Oh, yes, I will subscribe." </para>

                            <para>- I am not sure. The honorable senator is suggesting that Ministers who now lay down the dictum that this would be a pernicious principle to adopt were then plastic, and could have been moulded into almost any shape so long as they could keep their portfolios. That may be so. and I would not contradict the honorable senator for a moment. The Government were not tested to that extent, and therefore none of us is able to say definitely to-day whether they would have been sufficiently plastic or not. At any rate, they do not seem to be in that mood now. One must conclude that, having got rid of the support which then kept them in office, they are able to depend absolutely upon their present supporters, and so they have .mustered up sufficient courage to say that in their opinion this is a pernicious principle which, if adopted, would be prejudicial to the interests of the Commonwealth.

                            - It was your duty to tender evidence, in support of what you considered fair and reasonable wages? - Yes. The position was this. The schedules put in by the manufacturers were not, in our opinion, fair and reasonable, and they would have been assumed to be so if our society had not stepped in.

                    </quote><para class="block">If the men had not been prepared to fight the case they would have had no opportunity to take exception to the schedules submitted by the manufacturers, except by going out on strike. I take it that even honorable senators opposite are not continually agitating for a strike. They believe, or at least they profess to believe, that there is a method by which industrial disputes can be settled.' When a union employs the only method which appears to be available - that is to appeal to the Arbitration Court to collect evidence, and to obtain an award - then the Government are not prepared apparently to enforce the law under which the action has been taken, because members of an employers' association are the law-breakers. It is wrong, I submit, to expect those in whose interests legislation was passed to incur a very large expense to induce the Government to enforce the law, or to prove that that law was not what it was pretended to be. I admit that there may be some arguments on the other side of the question. I know that in other States there have been cases of a somewhat similar character, but the Legislatures have never taken the view that because they intend to do a fair thing bv the employes they will have to go put of their' way to compensate those who tried to defeat the legislation, and deprive the country of a large amount of Customs revenue. The cases have always been treated on their merits. A State Parliament has said : "There is a case where there has been neglect of some sort, but we do not say who was responsible. We recognise that owing to the neglect of those who were employed in the interests of the community, you were put to very considerable expense, and we think that the community should bear a portion of it." The case which has been brought before the Senate is a peculiar one. It is not a case where the employers were fighting against a rise in wages, but a case where they stood to win  .£30,000  or  £50,000  of public money, and convert it to their own use. I venture to say that there has never been a case of this description in Australia before. When it is looked at from that point of view, I think it will be recognised that the employers were well ' paid by the enormous sum of which they were able to deprive the Commonwealth. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Yes, and he had been able to form an opinion. It should be borne in mind that the Senate acted, not upon the opinion of any member of the Opposition, but upon the opinion of the Crown Law Department, and of the Prime Minister and other legal members of the Government. It was on their advice that the majority in this Parliament passed that legislation. I know of no case on all fours with that now before the Senate. The Federal Parliament has never been asked to bear' the expenses of unions who have gone into the Arbitration Court in the ordinary way. Numbers of unions have applied to the Arbitration Court in the different States, some have lost and some have won, but they have never applied to the State Governments to pay their legal expenses. The bushworkers 'appealed to the Federal Arbitration Court and won their case, but if they had lost they would not have asked the Federal Parliament to recoup their legal expenses, because they got a fair deal. They sought something from their employers who resisted an increase in wages. The pastoralists of Australia were not in the ' same position as the harvester manufacturers. They did not hold public money in their pockets which they might retain if they could upset the Federal law. That is the great difference between the present case and all other cases that have come before the Arbitration Courts. I should like now to say a word, not as to the Government or the employers, but the men who are interested in this matter. I think they are justified in asking , Parliament to bear a considerable share of the expense to which they were put. I have made personal inquiries about many of them. I am not speaking in this way merely because my sympathy is with unions generally. This is not a party matter. </para>

                            <para>- Every honorable senator on this side is free to express his own opinion on the motion, and I hope that honorable senators opposite are equally free. From inquiries I have made I learn that a number of the men at one time expressed themselves satisfied with the wages they were being paid. They were even prepared to take lower wages than those awarded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. This does not in any way relieve the Government of responsibility, hut it shows that these men realized that it would be impossible for them to retain, their employment if they asked for higher wages. If they refused the '6s. 6d. a day they were being paid, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins said they should be paid 7s., they knew they would find it hard to obtain other employment. A man who goes to work for a low wage does so either because his stomach compels him to do so, or because those dependent upon him are in want. If these men had behind them a strong union they would have realized the advantage of organization. They would not have delayed taking action as they did. It was some considerable time before they attempted to take action to prove that they were entitled to benefit by the legislation passed by this Parliament. lt seems to me that they should realize that there is one thing which can protect them more effectively than an Act of Parliament, and that is a powerful organization amongst themselves to which all of them are loyal. I have been told that a number of these men thought it necessary at election time to have nothing to do with Labour mcn. They were altogether .too common for them. 1 hope they are learning a very useful lesson in connexion with this matter, and that they now realize the amount of trust they can put in the so-called Liberals, whom they have been supporting for a number of years. I hope they will realize that they are likely to get more by supporting men who are in sympathy with them than they will get by supporting those who merely profess to be in sympathy with them. </para>

                        <para>. - The case submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is one of quite an exceptional character. I do not think there was any doubt in the minds of either the majority in both Houses of this Parliament or of the people of Australia with respect to the new Protectionist policy. The fact that the  President  of the Chamber of Manufactures stumped this State from one end to the other as an advocate of the new Protection was a guarantee to the workers that the manufacturers of this State, at least, professed a desire to extend justice to their employes. I have been induced to speak, chiefly because I wish to jay that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who has addressed himself to the motion, cannot avoid his share of responsibility for the position in which these men find themselves to-day. I might almost say that the honorable senator has hardly treated the question seriously. ' He was as" evasive as he could be in the effort to extricate himself from a difficult position. He gave the Senate a long quotation from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Justice O'Connor, to the effect that h"is Honour desired to deal directly with representatives of the manufacturers and the unions, and to exclude lawyers from the case. ' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> conveyed the impression that he regarded the men as being ill-advised in running into expense in connexion with the case, and especially in employing counsel to put their position before the Court. Let me say that they had no option but to procure the assistance of the best counsel available. The manufacturers had applied for exemption for the ' payment of Excise duty. They submitted to the Court their schedules of wages, and engaged the best counsel available to support their claims. What was the position which, in the circumstances, the men were called upon to face? In the first place, they had to depend only upon a weak union. The duty was cast upon them of rebutting the evidence of men who were not free to give evidence according to their conscience. The men engaged in the industry were prevented from forming a union for their defence, and the employers were able to bring into Court men who were prepared to say that they were satisfied with the conditions under which they were working.

In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is undoubtedly responsible for what . I may term the hocussing of the workers in connexion; with the new Protection policy. He declares that there was no necessity for the men to be represented by other than the secretary of their union. It seems to me, however, that he can ill afford to chide the agricultural implement makers' employes with having acted unwisely, seeing that he, as a member of the former Deakin Government, was responsible for compelling the men to employ counsel in such cases. It will be recollected that some time ago, when a certain Bill was before the Senate, I moved that the following amendment should be inserted in it- </para>

                        <para>On the hearing of any application no party shall, except  by  consent of all the parties or  by  leave of the  President,  be represented by counsel or solicitor. </para>

                    <para class="block">Under that amendment it would have been impossible for counsel or solicitor to have appeared before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court without the consent of all the parties to the suit, or of the  President  of that tribunal. But what happened? The only members of this Chamber who supported my proposal to abolish lawyers from the Arbitration Court were members of the Labour Party. I should like to place upon record the names of those honorable senators who made it compulsory for the employes engaged in the agricultural implement industry to employ counsel on their behalf, and thus to incur an indebtedness of  £1,100.  They are as follow : - Senators <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best and  J.  H. Keating, both of whom were members of the then Deakin Government; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir A.</inline> J. Gould, R.  J.  Sayers,  J.  T. Walker, and  J.  H. McColl Senators H. Dobson and S. Fraser also paired against my proposal. Seeing that Parliament has made it mandatory'? not that men shall engage counsel for the purpose of initiating proceedings before the Arbitration Court, but to advise them as -to the best means of rebutting the evidence given there, they had no option but to incur expenditure. Some of the employes who fought this case - who embraced the opportunity to prove what was the constitutional law on the matter - have never been able to obtain re-employment in the industry. For months they have been compelled to idly walk the streets, and some of them have been so boycotted that in sheer desperation they have had to leave the State. I do hope that the Senate - apart from all party considerations - will realize that the case of the members of this union is a particularly hard one. I believe that the men may justly claim that at least some portion of the costs which they have incurred should be borne bv the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> upon having made a very admirable speech from his point of view. . Unfortunately, the whole of his arguments were based upon an absolute fallacy - upon the statement of the secretary of the Agricultural Implement Makers' Employes Union that it was essential that the National Parliament should have control of industrial legislation. That officer might just as well have declared that it was essential, in the interests of the workers of the Commonwealth, that this Parliament should flout the Constitution by wresting from the States the powers which they ought to retain, and by being guilty of a gross injustice. From the moment I heard of that extraordinary measure, the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill, I denounced it as being absolutely unconstitutional. Some honorable senators opposite must have realized that it was a gross violation of the Constitution. Instead of giving the agricultural implement makers' employes who have suffered a guinea - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has offered to' do, and as I would gladly do - what right have I to permit them to say of me, " What a soft-hearted old fool he is to vote  £1,100  of the taxpayers' money to reimburse us " ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> does not believe in his heart that I ought to do that, or that he ought to do it, because at the end of a most admirable advocate's speech he affirmed that the Commonwealth ought at least to pay " a portion " of the indebtedness incurred by the agricultural implement makers' employes. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator quoted too much of that officer's evidence. Such evidence is absolutely worthless. A man who will say it is essential that the industries of the States should be under the control of the Commonwealth might just as well say it is essential that the police of the States should be under the control of the Commonwealth, and that we should pay them 7s. per day. Up to within six months of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act being placed upon the statute-book, there was not a single member of this Parliament who did not know that the industrial affairs of the Commonwealth were vested in the States, and that the Commonwealth had no control over them. But apparently somebody started the idea of the new Protection who thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> would do whatever his Labour allies asked him to do. But how could anybody who understands the difference which exists between the functions which are vested in the States and those which are vested in the Commonwealth deceive himself into the belief that this Parliament is empowered to use the weapon of taxation for the purpose of regulating industrial conditions? </para>

My sympathies are with the agricultural implement makers' employes, and against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> I am endeavouring to argue the question from a strictly legal point of view, and to show that  we must not establish a precedent which we cannot justify. We are trustees of the public, and we ought not to allow our judgment to be warped by considerations of sympathy. I repeat that all the arguments adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> were based upon a fallacy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell talked about the men having been "dragged before the Arbitration Court." Has not the Minister of Trade and Customs pointed out that nothing of the kind occurred? On the contrary, an application was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> in the exact terms of the Act, and the Court was asked to declare that he was conducting his business under fair and reasonable conditions, so that he might be granted exemption from the payment of an Excise duty of  £12  upon every harvester which he manufactured. The employes, realizing that they had a majority in the Parliament which passed this unjustifiable Act, thought that it would be wise for them to fee the best counsel available for the purpose of proving that the Act was constitutional. They were not " dragged before the Court," but went there solely in their own interests, and thus wasted  £1,100.  If they had not gone there, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins would have called the necessary witnesses and the whole case would have terminated just as it did terminate, without the expenditure of a single shilling upon the part of the employes. The men were not parties  to the cause. They chose to obtain leave to intervene for the purpose of showing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline> workmen were not receiving fair wages- although a great many of them were getting fair wages. </para>

                            <para>- In any case, the result would have been the same. But the result of their action was regarded as a triumph for the men. I am not at all impressed by the fact that two of the Justices of the High Court have declared that the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act is quite constitutional. I cannot understand how such a view can be taken bv any person. To my mind, the question is not arguable. If the validity of the Act had to be determined before the Privy Council, I do not think that one member of that body would entertain a doubt upon it. Six months before the Act was passed, there was not a member of this Parliament who did not know that it was unconstitutional. </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe there was a single member of this Parliament who doubted that the control of industrial legislation rested with the States, and could not be taken from them, except by means of an amendment of the Constitution. When honorable senators opposite got a weak Government in power they attempted to take the control of industrial legislation out of the hands of the States my means of an 'Act of Parliament which I really believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> himself must have known was a gross violation of the Constitution. Both Senators Pearce  and Turley are so clear-beaded that they must have known that the Act was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> We are, therefore, asked to pay the legal expenses of some people, because they tried to uphold an unconstitutional Act. I cannot lend myself to a procedure of that kind. I recollect the time when senator after senator got up and said that the union label was a trade mark. I remember denouncing that proposition with all the vehemence of language I was permitted to use. But the Act was passed ; and now that it has been declared to be mere waste paper will any one contend that a person who went before the Court and maintained that the union label was a trade mark should have his expenses paid? If this sort of thing is allowed we may have other outrageous claims made. We may have them made with regard to questions of picketing and boycotting. When a policeman is sent to maintain law and order it may be held that he is sent to stir up strife. </para>

But we may have picketing, not always peaceful, regulated by an Act of Parliament, and claims may be made for the payment of the legal expenses, of those who try to sustain such legislation. The Government themselves must have been perfectly well aware when the Act was passed that they were building on shifting sand. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that it was. I understand that no written record was left by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> but I make the statement now. Every one knows that the Treasury has few estimates of its own. The Treasury deals with the Estimates submitted by other Departments. The stage reached by the late Government when they met Parliament was that the Estimates had only commenced to be compiled by the spending Departments. When the time arrived for the Estimates of the Treasury to be framed, possibly they would have had riot more than half-a-dozen items on them. There was no necessity for a written record of the decision of the Cabinet to be made, because when the Estimates of the Treasury came to be compiled, a sum would have been put down for this purpose. The point which we considered was that Excise was payable by the manufacturers if they did not pay to the men fair and reasonable wages. A large sum of money was recoverable from them by the Government. But no action was taken by the Government. Action had to be taken by the trade union. We thought, therefore, that the union had a right to look to the Government for the expenses to which it had been put in the case. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not desire to prevent a division on this motion, and if I find that honorable senators opposite - who perhaps are more interested in the subject than other honorable senators - do not want  an adjournment of the debate, I shall not move for one. I am prepared to offer a few remarks on the motion, because I have been listening to the debate very carefully. It has interested me vastly. Perhaps I should first pay attention to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said. He made an interesting statement, and, of course, I, and every other honorable senator, believe it. But it would have been very much more instructive to me if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had told us that the late Ministry, when considering this question in Cabinet, had ascertained, or were sure in their own minds, that this sum of £1,100 had actually been paid, or was going, to be paid, by the Labour union on account of costs incurred in the case. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that statement. I have to remark concerning it - without any innuendo whatever - that, so far as I know from what has transpired during the course of this debate, no proof has been offered that the Labour union, or the employes personally, have become liable, without any possibility of escape, for £1,100, or have actually paid any such sum. As an ordinary business man, before I could consent to vote for the payment of £1,100 for this purpose, I should want to be absolutely certain as to its destination, and as to the fact that indebtedness to that extent had been incurred. </para>

                            <para>- Whether it ought or ought not to be paid is not the point with which I am dealing. The consideration that in all probability the Government would not pay the money, induces me not to support the motion. I want also to look into the merits of the question. We have been told that this is a special case. I admit that it is a very special case. It is not special entirely for the reasons given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> and others who support the motion. There is nothing unusual in a man having wasted a great deal of his money in going to law. That sort of thing happens to thousands of people. There is nothing special in having to spend money in endeavouring to get a verdict from a court of law. What were the circumstances in this case? They were that Parliament had passed an Act which purported to confer special benefits upon, a special class. </para>

                            <para>- I grant that the men believed that the Act was good. I merely state that the circumstances were special, that the Act was special, and that a special class was to be specially benefited. With regard to the class, let me remind honorable senators that the men working at this industry were specially treated. There are hundreds of thousands of deserving men in the Commonwealth for whose benefit no special legislation has been passed. There are hundreds of thousands of men who could have derived from such an Act of Parliament no possible material advantage. What was the position of these men? An Act was passed to give them special advantages. lt is true that the Government were very slow to put the Act into operation. In fact it was never properly put into operation at all. We all know where the blame for that lies. But as to one part of the Act - the penalty part - a point was reached when the employers were risking having a serious penalty enforced against them. The employers, in their own interests, took it upon themselves to test the matter of whether the Act was <inline font-style="italic">ultra</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">intra vires.</inline> The object of their application was, of course, to ascertain whether they were liable to be mulcted in the penalties which had accrued. Up to that point the men who were to benefit from the Act had had to do nothing. I do not know whether they ought to be blamed or not. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not necessarily blame the employes because they engaged counsel; but I hold that that was not absolutely necessary. I do not think  that this bill of costs need have been run up. Because the men chose to be represented by counsel before the Arbitration Court, we are told that they lost £1,100. I do not propose to waste words of sympathy, because that would be idle. I have been sorry for many men who have thrown money away in the Law Courts. The case of these workmen is not the first by a long way, and it will not be the last. To a certain extent, they were gambling with so much money, in the hope of getting a very good prize.' If they had succeeded, they would have put themselves into a position vastly better than 'that which nine out of. every ten workmen in the Commonwealth can get into, any way. </para>

Seeing that the employes in this industry were investing £1,100 in the hope of getting a good reward, are we justified in recouping them because they failed ? As a matter of justice, I do not think that we are. Of course, we can all be sorry for them. We cannot dispense justice equally all round if we pay these men. Honorable senators on the other side may say that that should not matter. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friends may say: " Never mind how many others may suffer in comparison, if this is a case of justice, let justice be done." That is not a bad argument. If I could persuade myself that it represented the whole of the case, I should vote for the motion ; but I cannot. I am not going to vote against the motion simply because if these men were reimbursed, they would be getting a benefit which other men would have to be deprived of. In my opinion, they merely invested so much money, and had an excellent risk. Parliament seemed to be entirely on their side. No doubt it seemed perfectly justifiable to them to spend £1,100 or £2,000 on the basis of an Act which had been passed by the Parliament of Australia after full consideration of eminent legal opinions. </para>

                            <para>- T - That is a strange question for the honorable senator to ask. What is the position of the manufacturers ? Their argument is that because of an Act which this Parliament had passed they were threatened with the imposition of a fine amounting to many thousands of pounds, and that in self-defence they had to take a case into Court and test the Act, probably at very much more cost than the men incurred. </para>

                            <para>- These remarks about the manufacturers having all the benefits are vastly interesting to me. 1 welcome an admission that the . protected manufacturers get all the benefits of this scheme of Protection. Unfortunately, these admissions are only made when the Tariff is out of the way, and votes are not to be given. We are asked by Protectionists to note what an abundant harvest the protected manufacturers have made out of the Tariff; and we are positively told that, because - the manufacturers do so benefit, we should not give them bare justice in a case where they have been compelled, by a faulty Act, to incur expense. </para>

I doubt if any man who allows full play to his sense of justice could refuse to vote for a similar motion. I wonder what the mover of this proposal thinks? I have not the slightest doubt that he is imbued with a sense of justice. Does he think that if costs are given to the men, because they have had to test the Act, costs should not also be given to the other side who had to test it also ? I should like him to give me an answer to my question. </para>

                            <para>- I can wait 'if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> wishes to give me an answer when he speaks in reply, but the question is so simple that I think he might have answered it by interjection. For the reasons I have given, I cannot vote for the motion. I have indicated what I may have to do as a consequence of it. I am convinced that it will produce no practical results so far as the men are concerned. It may give those who will be on the winning side in that division a certain amount of satisfaction, but I think it can have no other result. </para>

The men in this case have been most hardly used, and there is no doubt that up to a certain point, justice is on their side. Two things have convinced me that if I am to do my duly to the Commonwealth, I can only give my vote in one direction. </para>

If it is not a question of charity, and if these men have absolute right and justice on their side, will any honorable senator tell me that a Government supposed to specially represent them would decide to give these men only one-half of the amount which they have expended in costs? This is a case in which the men should be paid the whole of their expenses to the last halfpenny, or it is one in which the Government should not be called upon to pay anything. In my opinion, the arguments adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> are irrefutable. They were of such a nature as to make me decide to give my vote with the Government. I feel that if I do not do so, I shall be voting to expend money illegally. We should be governed by the law of the country, and I regret very much that I cannot give my vote, as I should like to do, in support of the motion. I may say that I shall be very pleased to give my contribution to a fund established to recoup the expenses of these men, and an honorable senator beside me is willing to do the same. </para>

                            <para>- I sympathize with the men who are suffering, and with the Minister of Trade and Customs, who, I am sure, if he followed the dictates of his own heart, would be very glad indeed to vote for the motion. In opposing it, he is acting to-night from a stern sense of duty, and perhaps loyalty to the Cabinet. J feel that the men have presented a case of abstract justice. We have made mistakes in the Federal Parliament, and by our mistaken legislation have led them into very heavy legal expenses. If we make mistakes, it seems to me that we ought to pay for them. We should not ask other people to pay for our mistakes. If I made a mistake in the management of my own business, which involved another person in loss, I should feel that it was my duty to make good the loss incurred as a consequence of my error. I should very much rather, as has been suggested, contribute to a fund to defray the expenses of these men. 1 should be prepared to be one of fifty who would give  £10  each towards their expenses; but I feel that, as a matter of abstract justice, I am bound to vote for the motion. T think it is our duty to protect the' revenue; but if Parliament makes mistakes, and allows itself to be rushed into passing ill-advised legislation, when it is told that it is unconstitutional </para>

                        (New South Wales)  [10.54].  - During the debate, there was one speech made which I think met with the approval of every member of the Senate, because it was entirely free from any party complexion, and made no personal attack. I refer ' to the address of

As reference was pointedly made to the matter to-night, I must refer to the accuracy of the statement as to why I voted against the adjournment of the debate this week. I had agreed to the adjournment of the debate because I -was asked to do so, to enable the Minister to properly consider the arguments I had advanced, and to consult his colleagues. I was informed that in another place the Prime Minister had made a statement which placed the consideration of my motion outside the category of common sense, and I felt I should be stultifying myself by voting for an adjournment of the debate. </para>

                            <para>- The statement to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council refers was made months ago - long before I put my notice of motion upon the business-paper. I gave notice of this motion fully six weeks ago, and the answer to which the honorable gentleman alludes was given in reply to a question put by me some time before then.  As a matter of fact, I had forgotten all about that answer. The whole question at issue is one of simple justice. I cannot see any wisdom in the argument that the adoption of my motion would open the door to all sorts of attacks upon the Treasury. Such a contention presupposes that this Parliament will continue to enact legislation which is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution. In conclusion I desire to say one or two words in reply to the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that if the agricultural implement makers' employes are compensated for the expenses which they have incurred, the manufacturers should also be compensated. The speech which he delivered conclusively proved that he did not know anything about the question. He mixed up two totally different sets of legal proceedings, and succeeded in getting himself into a hopeless knot until some of us went to his assistance and disentangled him. He entirely overlooked the fact that the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, which has been declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution, was linked with another Act which placed heavy duties in the pockets of the manufacturers to the extent of scores of thousands of pounds. The issue of a writ by the Commonwealth Government for £20,000 against one . firm alone is conclusive proof of this. I cannot understand how any supporter of the new Protection can vote against my proposal, which merely seeks to give the employes abstract justice, and which does not raise any question of personal difference or party disloyalty. </para>
