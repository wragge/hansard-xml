                        <para>- Some time ago I asked a question about the landing of mails at Fremantle and the administration of the quarantine regulations. I desire to know whether the Minister of Trade and Customs noticed the great delay which took place lately at Fremantle in landing mails from a steamer of the Orient Company, and their declaration that they would not be responsible for the mails if required to discharge them at sea or at some distance from the port. I do not know whether he saw the report in the press, but what I want to know is whether he will endeavour by an amendment of the quarantine regulations to insure less detention of the steamers at that port? </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will recognise that there must be a more careful inspection by the quarantine officers at what is practically the gate of Australia so far as these ships are concerned than elsewhere. If there is a little more delay in making that more thorough investigation, it should not be made a cause of complaint, seeing that the time so occupied will be more than saved at other ports. I had my attention drawn to the matter, and instructed the Director of Quarantine that so soon as his duties would permit, he should go to Fremantle and make a personal inquiry, so that the examination may be reduced to the smallest limits, having regard to complete efficiency. There is no advantage to the Commonwealth in delaying a steamer. Our whole anxiety is to secure expedition, accompanied with a thorough and effective examination by the quarantine officers. </para>

                        <para>- It is not in order to move any amendment which is not strictly relevant to the subject-matter of a Bill. Some time ago a question arose as to the power of amending a principal Act when an amending Bill touching a portion of such an Act was under consideration. It was then clearly laid down by my predecessor in this chair, that an amendment would not be in order unless strictly relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill actually before the Senate. That decision was accepted, but a provision was inserted in the Standing Orders that when an amending Bill was under consideration an instruction might be given to the Committee to amend the principal Act in a direction that was not within the scope of the amending Bill. But an instruction of that character must necessarily be given before a Bill first goes into Committee, and immediately after its second reading. Notice must also be given of the proposition. As that procedure has not been followed in this case, it will not be in order for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to move to recommit the Bill for the purpose of considering such an amendment as he has indicated. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to have this Bill recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering clause  17,  with the object of striking out the provision authorizing justices of the peace to witness signatures to postal votes. I think that honorable senators will agree with me that there are no greater political partisans than are justices of the peace. They are appointed for political reasons. No man is made a justice of the peace in this country unless upon the recommendation of somebody in politics. The services of justices of the peace are undoubtedly taken advantage of at election time. </para>

                    <para>. - Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> cannot be in earnest in hurling accusations against so many thousands of men. throughout Australia. It is simply absurd that a man is not to be trusted to act as a witness under a Bill like this simply because he is a justice of the peace. It is unthinkable that the honorable senator should seriously mean what- he has said. I hope that he will not proceed with his proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposal made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is, in my view, a right and proper one. I speak from personal knowledge of the party manipulation that has occurred in the appointment of justices of the peace in Western Australia. I shall give names, and I challenge honorable senators opposite to disprove my assertions. I shall in the first place mention the name of no less prominent a person than the Commonwealth Treasurer. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was Premier of Western Australia, in preFederal days, he appointed many justices of the peace, and I shall show the undoubted bias that he exercised. I was  President  of the Miners&#39; Association in Kalgoorlie. Considerable inconvenience was caused on the gold-fields in those days because there was a lack of justices of the peace who could sign documents. The association of which I was  president  took the matter up, at the request of a number of its members. There was a discussion at a meeting, and a motion was carried suggesting the names of four persons as fit and proper men to be appointed. These names were sent down to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, as head of the State Government. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; we are making history in the Commonwealth ; but I have been speaking of magistrates who are unpaid. I think I have made it clear that we could not intrust the work of witnessing applications for postal vote certificates to worse hands than those of politically appointed justices of the peace. If the Government desire that this part of the electoral law shall be administered by persons without political bias, they will remove justices of the peace from the lists of authorized witnesses. It is quite true that some persons have been appointed justices of the peace who are known to be friends of the Labour party ; but we desire in this matter that they shall be treated in the same way as the justices of the peace who are known to be our political opponents, because we recognise that political partisans on either side should have no hand in the administration of our electoral law. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> motion for the recommittal of the Bill for the purpose he has suggested. If the honorable senator had proposed that the Bill should be recommitted for the purpose of repealing the postal voting provisions altogether, I should have been prepared to support the proposal heartily. Now that the Senate, in its wisdom, and after a long discussion, has determined to retain the postal voting provisions, I am not prepared to support a proposal for the excision from the list of authorized witnesses of justices of the peace. I entirely agree with Senators Guthrie and de Largie that justices of the peace are appointed as the result of political influence. I scarcely know of a single instance in Western Australia where a justice of the peace does not owe his appointment to the intervention of a member of Parliament. The usual practice followed is for the member for a particular- district to recommend that a certain citizen should receive the commission. Whilst I agree that justices of the peace owe: their appointments to political influence, I am not prepared to go so far as to say that they would be influenced by political partisanship in witnessing applications for postal vote certificates. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> made the statement that as many justices of the peace have been appointed from our side as from the party to whom we are opposed. </para>

I shall mention names also, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, has done. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daglish</inline> was&#39; Labour Premier of Western Australia, his Government, through the representations ot a member of the Federal Parliament, conferred the commission of justice of the peace on every member of this Parliament representing Western Australia, irrespective of his political opinion. They were all made justices for the whole State, and not for any one magisterial division. I compare the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daglish,</inline> as Labour Premier, with that of the gentleman who is Premier of Western Australia to-day.

I refer to it merely to mention the attitude taken up by a Premier holding different political opinions, and to contrast his attitude with that of the gentleman who preceded him in office. As a result of the representations which were made, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has been offered the commission of the peace, but he refused to take it unless every member of the Federal Parliament coming from Western Australia, irrespective of his political views, is similarly appointed. I cannot see my way to vote for the recommittal of the Bill with a view to amending it in the direction desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> although I should be glad to support its recommittal for the purpose of entirely eliminating the postal-voting provisions. Whilst  1  recognise that justices of the peace are invariably appointed as the result of political representations, I am quite prepared to trust them to act impartially as authorized witnesses of postal ballot-papers. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will not press his proposal to a division. Although it is true that political influence is usually operative in connexion with the appointment of justices of the peace, I do not think any one will suggest that a justice of the peace, in witnessing a postal vote, will act other than impartially. To appoint telegraph linesmen as authorized witnesses of postal ballot-papers and to expressly declare that justices of the peace are not fitted to discharge a similar duty, would be a direct insult to our honorary justices. I cannot conceive that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is in earnest in this matter, but if he is,-  1  ask him to reconsider his position. Those who complain that there are not sufficient labour men upon the roll of justices of the peace should recollect that we have only to await the advent of another Labour Ministry to get that defect remedied. </para>

                    <para>. - Upon this matter I take up a similar attitude to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> I cannot vote for the recommittal of the Bill for the purpose of amending it in the direction that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> desires. In my judgment, if we eliminate justices of the peace from the list of persons who are authorized . witnesses of postal ballot-papers, we shall rob the measure of one of its most useful provisions. I should, however, be perfectly prepared to vote for the recommittal of the Bill with a view to the abolition of the postal voting system. But I recognise that on this occasion it is impossible for me to attain my object. If we declare that justices of the peace shall be ineligible to witness postal ballot-papers we shall inconvenience a great many electors. At the last general election I  witnessed at least 500 such papers, and I did so without the slightest bias. Upon many occasions I was 50 or 60 miles from any centre of population, and I witnessed those papers for the purpose of assisting electors to exercise their franchise. Nobody will deny that political influence is exerted in making appointments to the roll of honorary justices. But whilst that is so, the mere fact that under certain circumstances we vest them with power to deprive a citizen of his liberty, is a sufficient reason to justify the belief that they will faithfully discharge their duty as authorized witnesses of postal ballot-papers. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid that the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> is not a valid one. A justice of the peace is appointed by a political class, generally for political purposes, and in his official capacity is empowered to dispense justice from the Bench. In discharging his duties it is very rarely that political considerations can sway his decisions. But even when it comes to a question of dispensing justice, when, for example, a strike occurs, and men are haled before honorary justices to answer a&#39; charge of unruly conduct, we know that vicious sentences are. usually recorded. Unfortunately, this defect in our system of administering justice is unavoidable. We cannot have all paid justices, and consequently we must have honorary justices to deal with minor cases of misdemeanour. But under the postal -voting system which is embodied in this Bill we empower justices of the peace to grant facilities to electors to exercise their franchise. In other words, we place those facilities in the hands of men who are usually bitter political partisans. We lay upon them the responsibility of seeing that the postal votes which they witness do not miscarry. Hitherto the authorized witnesses in connexion with postal ballot-papers have been public servants, who. if they are negligent in the discharge of their duties can be punished. </para>

The discharge of a public servant is a punishment to him, but the removal of a man&#39;s name from the list of justices of the peace would be no punishment. The proposition which has been put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has received some consideration at the hands of men who know what has occurred in connexion with the witnessing of postal ballot-papers - I refer to the chief officers of the Electoral Department. Some time ago an inquiry was held by these officers into the administration of the Electoral Act, and in volume 2 of our <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Papers</inline> for the session of 1904 will be found the result of their investigation, together with their recommendations. At that time a justice of the peace was authorized to witness the signatures of electors to postal ballot-papers.

                        <para>- So far as I can see, nowhere in their report did the Select Committee recommend the putting back of justices of the peace. In every case where they recommended a magistrate as a witness it was a police or stipendiary, or special magistrate. Nowhere, as far as I can see, did they recommend an ordinary justice of the peace. I. do not know what the Minister was referring to when he interjected just now. Unless honorable senators are prepared to shut their eyes to facts, they must recognise that there is a difference between the ordinary administration of justice and the administration of the postal voting system. Every honorable senator surely knows that postal votes are misused, and that the great danger in their use lies in allowing political partisans to intervene. Suppose that I applied for a postal voting certificate, the postmaster, or other public servant, does not come to me and ask me to vote, but the justice of the peace goes round on a canvassing tour and asks electors, especially women, not to trouble to go up on polling day, but to record their votes then? Why? In order that he may make sure that their votes will go in the right direction. What does a canvasser of this type say? He says, &#34;I am a justice of the peace, and can save you the trouble of going to the booth on polling day. You can vote in your own home before me, and the vote will be recorded.&#34; If the vote is not given in the right direction it need not find its way to the ballot-box. </para>

                        <para>- Such canvassing is against the spirit of the Electoral Act, which is, that if a man thinks that he will not be able to attend the polling booth he shall seek out the officer, who is authorized to witness his ballot-paper. It was never intended to create a class of men who would go round canvassing for postal votes and trying to induce electors not to attend the polling booth. I, though a magistrate, intend to vote for a recommittal of the Bill, even if it does throw a slur upon justices of the peace. There is a great body of magistrates who, although they hold political appointments, are not biased, but two or three men can vitiate a whole body. It is always two or three justices of the peace who do the active canvassing in every State. Any senators who deny my statement simply shut their eyes to what they know to be the fact. </para>

When I was elected a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, in  1894,  Charles Cameron Kingston was Premier and Attorney-General, and the rule he adopted was that any man elected to the State Parliament, if he wished, should be made a justice of the peace for the State. </para>

                        <para>- I did not approach <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> ; I did not need to do so. I knew nothing of my appointment as a justice of the peace until my name was gazetted. I do not sit on the bench as often as I could. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will withdraw his motion, because, if he does not, he will be in a hopeless minority, and will be needlessly casting a reflection upon -the actions of representatives of the people. When other justices of the peace were not available, I have been requested to witness signatures, but in no case did I know how the electors voted nor did I wish to know. I think it is absurd for any one to ask us to strike representatives of the people off the list of authorized witnesses. There is prejudice on each side, but to say that justices of the peace, as a class, can be bought, or made use of, for political purposes for weeks is absurd. </para>

                        <para>- What does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> mean by that statement? At one time or other in their lives most of the men on the Bench might have fairly been called working men. But while a man is engaged in labour all day he does not care to be made a justice of the peace or, if appointed, to discharge the duties of the position. The statements of honorable senators on the other side appear to me to be exaggerated. What may be true in connexion with special cases such as those attributed to Western Australia, are not true of Queensland. For quite a number of years the method of enrolling justices of the peace in that State has been that any member of Parliament, or any person, can recommend to the Department the name of a person who he thinks is a suitable person for appointment, and who lives in a locality where more justices of the peace are required. Then the Department, refers the names to the nearest police or stipendiary magistrate, who, of course, is regularly in the employment of the Government, and unless he reports favorably upon the recommendation, the person therein recommended does not get enrolled. In Queensland, quite a large number of justices of the peace, whom I know are, though they may not be called working men, very strong supporters of the Labour party. I dp not think that there is any reasonable ground to suppose that justices of the peace act  unfairly or . improperly in connexion with postal or other voting. There was a case, not long ago, at Charters Towers where a very large number of postal votes were cast. An election petition was presented, and the whole of the objections upheld were based on the ground that the voter posted the ballot-papers twenty-four hours too late. I think that the law is that the votes must be posted to the returning officer forty-eight hours before the poll closes, but nearly all the objections upheld were so dealt with because the voters had posted their votes thirty-six or twenty-four hours before that event. It was pointed out that 800 votes were cast for one party and 450 for the Labour party. It came out in evidence that both&#39; sides were actively canvassing. It is desirable that electors should take a keen interest in politics. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> stated that in Western Australia he witnessed 500 postal votes at the last election, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> mentioned just now that dozens of justices of the peace were out canvassing for them. These statements are somewhat exaggerated. </para>

                        <para>- The number of postal votes cast in Western Australia last election was 1585, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> witnessed 500, the other authorized witnesses must have witnessed only 1085. Therefore these dozens of justices of the peace must have reaped a very small crop, notwithstanding all their labours. These figures lead one to believe that, in their righteous indignation against the postal voting system, honorable senators opposite are prepared to cast a stigma upon a most worthy and honorable class of men. It is true that many justices of the peace may originally have been appointed for political services. But that does not mean that they will always remain on one side in politics. Were the dozens of justices of the peace mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> all canvassing on one side? The other classes of people whom honorable senators opposite would allow to act. as witnesses are also liable to be politically biased. State school teachers have political opinions, and even teachers in provisional schools in Queensland can act as witnesses. Many of these people take a very active interest in politics on one side or the other. Amongst the police, also, there are active partisans. It is, therefore, unfair to cast a stigma upon an honorable body of men, who do their duty according to their ability, whilst ignoring the fact that they are by no means the only persons authorized to act as witnesses under our electoral law who take an active part in politics. </para>

                    <para>- - No matter to what class of men we intrust the duty of acting as witnesses under this measure, some errors will creep in ; but it is very unfair to brand a particular class of men as biased, and to suppose that they would willingly act unjustly. In Queensland, in one town with which I am acquainted, there are over twenty working men, principally members of the Labour party, who are justices of the peace. A man who is appointed a justice of the peace does not necessarily retain the political views that he held at the date of appointment. I know one man who was appointed a justice of the peace by a Labour Government, and is now standing as a candidate against the Labour party. I know another man who was opposed to the Labour party when he was made a justice of the peace, but who is now one of their active supporters. By carrying <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> proposal we should brand the whole of the justices of the peace in this country as unfit to discharge a very simple duty. </para>

                    <para>.- On a former occasion a similar effort was made by a member of the party to which I belong to eliminate justices of the peace from an Electoral Bill then under consideration. I objected to that course then, and I object on the present occasion. If we required that the persons permitted to witness signatures under our electoral system should be strictly impartial in politics, 1 could understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> efforts, because I am well aware that justices of the peace, like other persons enumerated in the Bill, are human, and probably many of them hold strong opinions in politics. But it is wrong to look at this matter from a party view point. </para>

                        <para>- Of course I do not know the facts of the case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. It seems that the Government have done an extraordinary thing. But 1 am inclined to believe that the person in question was dismissed for some other reason than that he stood as a Labour candidate. What we are concerned about now is whether justices of the peace should be given the necessary authority to witness signatures in connexion with our postal ballot system. If any justice of the peace in any State has acted in contravention of our electoral law there is a proper way of dealing with him. He should be struck off the list. But because some justices of the peace are alleged to have done wrong in Western Australia, that is no reason why the whole number of justices of the peace throughout the Commonwealth should be eliminated from this Bill. To do so would be to cast a grossly unfair stigma upon a body of men who are thoroughly capable of carrying out the duties intrusted to them. We intrust certain duties to Commonwealth returning officers. Are all returning officers men who are free from political sympathies? </para>

                        <para>- It is too silly to waste time in discussing such a thing. We are invited to believe that Governments have appointed these men to the commission of the peace as a sop to the Labour party. What sort of a party would it be that would be contented to be fed on such sops? I desire to see justices of the peace given authority to witness applications for postal vote certificates. I am aware that the majority of them do not belong to the Labour camp, but I have every confidence that they will do justice to the positions they hold, and will do only what is right by those who seek their assistance to enable them to vote&#39; by post. </para>

                    <para>. - There were one or two statements made during the discussion to which I should like to reply. It was stated, by way of interjection, that an officer of the Government was dismissed because he stood in Western Australia as a candidate for election to the Senate. I shall put the facts of the case before honorable senators, and leave it to their good sense to say whether the Government did right. The name of the gentleman concerned has been mentioned, and I make no apology for mentioning it again. The case was that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green,</inline> who is a telegraphist in the post-office at Kalgoorlie. </para>

                        <para>- I understood that he was a telegraphist. The important point is that he was also electoral registrar at that place. When he submitted his name, as he had a perfect right to do, for selection by a Labour body as a candidate for election to the Senate, the question naturally arose whether one who was an avowed partisan could, with decorum, retain the position of electoral registrar. If the officer stood for nomination on the party ticket on this side, and retained his position as electoral registrar, I venture to say that a very strong and a justifiable protest would be heard from the opposite benches. What followed in this case was not, as has been stated, that this officer was dismissed the service ; he was merely removed from the position of electoral registrar. </para>

There could be only one electoral registrar, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> declined to do his duty, there were dozens of others prepared to do it for him. I have been surprised to find that there has been so much support for the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> In the discussion of the Bill in Committee an attempt was made to repeal the postal voting provisions, but, once it was decided to retain them, efforts were made to increase the facilities to enable every one entitled to do so to take advantage of this portion of the Act. We enlarged the list of authorized witnesses, and now we have a proposal before the Senate to curtail the list. I wish, to look into some of the reasons advanced for the particular curtailment proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred to a report of the electoral  officers. I reminded the honorable senator by interjection that he had not given the reason for their recommendation which he quoted. The honorable senator said that the report was a long one, and he could not discover that any reason was stated. But I find that in the very last words of the paragraph from which the honorable senator was reading the electoral officers gave the reason why they wished to amend the list, as follows: - </para>

                        <para>- Will the honorable senator tell me that letter-carriers have not their political feelings? We know that they have, and in answer to the suggestion that they might be dismissed, I say that it would be impossible to prove that a letter-carrier in witnessing an application for a postal vote was led away by his poli  tical feelings to favour the chances of the candidate he supported. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is present, I should like to compliment him upon the extreme astuteness which was evidently underlying, if it did not animate, his refusal to accept the honour of the magistracy when it was offered to him. I understand that the honorable senator declined it unless it was also extended to the whole of the representatives of Western Australia in the Federal Parliament. I do not question the honorable senator&#39;s motives, but I think there was a certain amount of method in his self-denial, seeing that what he suggested should be done would have largely added to the number of magistrates of his own party, and would have brought about no addition to the number of magistrates in the ranks of his opponents. </para>

From the discussion which has taken place, and the wholesome remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,I</inline> have not much fear that the motion will be carried. I can scarcely conceive of this Parliament putting such a stigma upon a large body of deserving individuals who, unquestionably, render great public services. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that in any proclamations which may be issued under this Bill the superintendents of our mercantile marine will be included as authorized witnesses of postal votes. In regard to justices of the peace witnessing the signatures of electors to applications for postal vote certificates, I think it will be generally admitted that appointments to the roll of honorary justices are usually made for political reasons, and they use these men politically for all they are worth. I have used my justiceship for my own political purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Surely every honorable senator must recognise that a man owes the position of justice of the peace to the exercise of political influence, and that he has been used for political purposes. As regards the administration of justice, I offer no objection, because no bias can be shown. But in electoral matters the position is different, because the justice of the peace must have certain political bias. I have some knowledge of these political appointments. I received the appointment of justice of the peace long before I was in politics. I know that it was given to me as a sop. </para>

Since then it has been decided not to recommit the Bill, and the original motion for the adoption of the report is now before the Senate. I think that on that motion the honorable senator is within his rights in commenting on any portion of the Bill. </para>

I shall confine myself to the point which I brought before the Minister, regarding the superintendents of mercantile marine. No one can suggest that any class question is involved, because at present these men are State officials, who, I hope, will soon come under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. I want the Minister to give the Senate an assurance that when a proclamation is issued the superintendents of mercantile marine will be included among those who may witness a signature under the Electoral Act. </para>

                        <para>- I was not aware of that. It may be that it will be necessary to have a definition of the term. However, I quite recognise the reasonableness of my honorable friend&#39;s proposal, and will suggest to the Minister of Home Affairs that these persons might be included in the list of authorized witnesses when the Bill is before the other House. With regard to the inquiry of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell, I can assure him that the whole purpose of the addition made yesterday to section 34 of the Act was to prevent such a contingency arising as that which he had in his mind. The object is to safeguard any forms which are outstanding, and which may have been used <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> for the purpose of complying with the requirements of the Act. That was the sole purpose of the amendment, and it will be administered in that way. The honorable senator will notice that the period within which old forms may be held to be good has to be prescribed. The matter is left open, so that the officials, by experience, can determine when the outstanding forms have been exhausted. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sure that the Government must be gratified with the reception of this Bill so far. There certainly has been a little objection taken to it, and I am rather surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> should have been so captious as he was. He seems to be losing that cheery optimism which made him look at the bright side of matters, and he had a doleful picture to present. The Bill is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said, somewhat belated ; but it is possible that the action of the Senate may have partly accounted for the delay in its introduction. It will be remembered that about four years ago the Senate resolved that the High Commissioner should be selected at a joint sitting of the Houses. The other House was asked to concur in the resolution, which, I have no doubt, has deterred various Governments from giving the Senate an opportunity of voting again with regard to the question. It is very gratifying that that contention has not been raised in this debate, and I trust that it will not be raised again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> quoted from a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges in 1901, and from a report by the Agents -General in 1905. Probably no man is more qualified to report on any question than is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges, but his report was made over eight years ago, and since then we have moved very swiftly. Possibly if he were reporting again he might vary his opinions considerably. I have not read the report from the Agents- General, as I only saw it this morning. I should be somewhat chary about accepting all their suggestions. There is no doubt that they are interested parties, who, probably, are not inclined to see their positions slip away from them. We have to decide for ourselves what ought to be done. I was very glad to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> take the high ground which he did in discussing the measure entirely free from party, and which, I think, does him a great deal of credit. We have always recognised that this position has to be made and filled. In fact, it was a postulate of Federation. It was impossible to have Federation and to have our business conducted in the extended sphere which &#39;we would occupy, unless we had in London some one to represent Australia as a whole. From the Imperial and Australian stand-points the appointment of a High Commissioner is now more urgent than ever it was. We are on the verge of a great world-wide movement - probably before long we shall be in the vortex of it - for widening the base of Empire. Formerly that base was only a little island in the northern seas. The base is widening, and before very long it will take in Canada, South Africa, and Australia. As Kipling says: &#34;We are hearing the call of the blood,&#34; and the British people are coming together as they have  never done before. For that reason alone it is necessary that we should have in London a man who could speak for United Australia in tones of authority. We are not content now to simply share the benefits of Empire, but we are making up our mind to also share the burdens of Empire; and so we desire a voice in regard to Imperial matters. Whether it be a question of trade, which is growing immensely, or of defence, which is now looming so large on our horizon, or of racial unity which is coming so rapidly to the front, all these things require that we should be represented in London. In 1907-8 our exports to the United Kingdom were valued at &#163;34,975,579, and our imports at &#163;31,906,447. In the course of ten years our exports increased in value by , &#163;9,638,123, and our imports by &#163;9,111,749, being a total increase of &#163;18,749,870 in the trade between the Old Country and Australia. That is a very large trade, and, therefore, we want representation in London. The total value of our Australian trade is &#163;43,875,223, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> properly stated last night, it must increase. In my opinion our export trade will increase very largely. I believe that with the various movements afoot, and the possibilities of Australia being brought more prominently before other countries, our export trade will be immensely larger in the very near future. </para>

The latter has taken up the question of Tariff Reform, and if it is carried, as I believe it will be, it will help enormously to increase our trade. </para>

                            <para>-  I have travelled over a large portion of the Old Land, and talked to all classes of people. I know that there is only one thing which stopped Tariff Reform coming to the front several years ago, and being carried, and that was the fear of dear food. But if we come to an arrangement with Great Britain with regard to preference for our productions, that will sweep away one of the obstacles to the success of the movement. Our representatives in London can, in a large way, bring the products of this country before the Army and Navy authorities, and see that we get our proper share of the trade in the supply of requisites to them. We require a man in London who will keep in touch with the markets, and familiarise himself with the prices of staple products. We want an Intelligence Department, from which reliable information about Australia can be obtained by British people. When I was in England I was appalled at the colossal ignorance, with regard to this country, of the people whom I met there. Very few knew anything about Australia. They knew that there was such a place, but were not so well informed about it as were our American visitors who came here last year, and who were so profoundly impressed with our great resources. We want to have a place in London where Australian products can be shown. If one goes to the office of any of the State Agents-General, one sees an exhibition of the products of that particular State. But we want the products of Australia as a whole to be exhibited, instead of having them shown in segments. One of the things that struck me when I was travelling through the United States, was the practice of using a portion of their Parliament Houses as show places for the exhibition of the fauna and flora, the minerals and the general products of the State. One State will produce oranges, another potatoes, another barley, and another wheat. Good specimens of the products of each are on view at the various State Parliament Houses. What they are doing in a small way we want to do in a bigger way for this great continent of ours. Then, of course, there is the financial question, about which I do not desire to speak at length, because abler men have dealt with it; but it must be admitted that the establishment of one Commonwealth stock will be of enormous advantage to us. We shall then have a stock in which trustees can have confidence, and there will be a tendency for the rate of interest to become lower. Then there is the great question of immigration. I hope that all parties will agree upon some comprehensive scheme. The rate of immigration into Australia is not greater now than it was fifty years ago. The same number proportionately as came in between 1840 and 1850, come in now. Between 1850 and 1860 there was, of course an enormous influx, owing to the discovery of gold and the desire of every man to get rich quickly. Enormous crowds reached our shores then. But when the gold deposits began to give out, the stream of immigration fell away, and it has never recovered itself since. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Why is that? Because it has never been part of the duty of any particular person to look after immigration. We have made intermittent attempts to attract people; but we have never given effect to a comprehensive scheme and made a determined effort to secure the immigration that this country requires. In the United States, although the Government does not take an active part in attracting immigration, it nevertheless exercises a careful supervision. The great transportation companies by land and sea are, of course, &#34; interested in . taking emigrants to America ; but once they land there the Government take charge of them, and they are most carefully looked after. The consequence is that the population of the United States has risen to close on  90,000,000  of people. In the same way, the Canadian Government has not been a direct factor in attracting emigrants, but has, nevertheless, rendered great assistance. The Canadian-Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway have busied&#34; themselves in inducing emigrants to go ft&#62; Canada. Why ? Because the Canadian-Pacific has  25,000,000  acres of land which was ceded as a means of strengthening the great scheme. It is a wonderful scheme, no doubt. The railway at first traverses  1,000  miles of dry, barren rocks, where scarcely anything will grow ; but then it reaches a country that is worth having. Of course, the land was of no use to the company unless they could get people to occupy it. We should also realize that our railways and our land are of no use unless we bring a large population here. In the United States and Canada, immigration is looked after properly. Men are sent to Great Britain and to the Continental countries. The agents, speak the language of the people amongst whom they go, and when they come across desirable persons they use all their efforts to induce them to leave. There were  400  immigrants in the ship in which I travelled a little while ago. Another ship came into port six hours before I got there, with  600  immigrants. We got in about midnight. By 8 o&#39;clock in the morning these  1,000  immigrants had all been carefully entered up, labelled, examined, and passed. They were met at the boat, provided with refreshments, they and their luggage were checked off, and by noon of the same day a train containing these  1,000  people went rolling off to the west. They were cared for from the moment when they went on board until they arrived at their destination, where they were provided either with land or with employment. We have to adopt some such system if we are to induce people to come to Australia. Last year alone Canada assisted immigration to the extent of an expenditure of  ;&#163;249j939-  Arid Canada is getting her reward. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say. A few years ago, however, immigrants were assisted to the extent of 7s.&#39; per head. I divided the number of immigrants into the total cost, and that is what I found the amount of the subsidy came to. I saw the land upon which the Canadian immigrants are placed. For  1,000  miles- from Toronto to Winnipeg it is poor, barren country, though very picturesque. But from Winnipeg, as far as British Columbia, you meet with great rolling prairies. Some of the land is very good indeed; other parts of it are not so good. I question whether any of it is as good as land which we have to offer in this country. But the immigrants do very well, though they have to work very hard indeed, and can only cultivate, the soil for six months in the year. The conditions are very hard, and it requires a strong man with a hearty constitution to stand the work. An immigrant can get  160  acres for nothing, and can buy other land at from three to five and seven dollars per acre. He gets his title in three years. A great many stay for a time and then sell out; so that while a man only gets  160  acres at first, still, if he. is industrious, he can buy more and can make a very good &#34; do &#34; indeed. The High Commissioner, while he may not be able to enter into the details of an immigration scheme, will have to supervise the work and encourage it. If it is carried on properly by means of a proper staff, I am convinced that, as the possibilities of Australia become better known, and our resources are opened up, we shall be able to divert the stream of emigrants from Canada and the United States to Australia. </para>

In the United States land is being taken up and cultivated now that  20  or  30  years ago was considered to be absolutely worthless. It was written down on the map as desert. There is, for instance, the great Llanoestacado Plain, where formerly hundreds perished, but which is now being settled with a prosperous people. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator. The demand for land in the United States is as keen as it is in Australia, if not keener. I venture to say that in a few years&#39; time scarcely an acre of Government land in America will not have been taken up. We only want to make our resources known, and I believe that, with energetic work, we shall be able to turn the stream of emigration to this country. </para>

                            <para>- The fact that the stream of emigration has not been directed to Australia as it might have been in the past has been due to some extent to the alertness of our rivals. They have been very busily at work, and have been enabled to induce millions of people to emigrate to America and Canada. We must also blame our own. supineness and inertness. It has been, as I have said, no one&#39;s business to induce people to come to Australia, and there .has been 110 energetic and well-directed effort to bring the attractions of Australia under the notice of people desiring to emigrate from the Old Country. There is a very strong impression abroad that we do not want immigrants. We may differ in this Parliament as to how that impression has been created. I do not propose to deal with the reasons for it now. There is no doubt that it exists, and that it has had a very deterrent effect upon those who might otherwise have desired to come to this country. The impression has been fostered by some sections of the press, and perhaps by persons interested, but I speak with personal knowledge when I say that it is very strong and very general in America as well as in Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- Another impression that is abroad- is that we are dreadfully Socialistic in Australia. During my recent visit to the United States and Canada I met men who said : &#34; Are you not dreadfully Socialistic in Australia? Are there not a great many people there who want a common divide, and all that sort of thing?&#34; I replied that we had a Socialist party in Australia, but that we also had a majority of people of common-sense who would not allow Socialistic ideas to be carried too far. These impressions exist, and they must be removed. They can only be removed by some one going from Australia who can speak with authority, and who will be in charge of an institution at which correct information about Australia will be available for. all who seek it. This work cannot be done merely by appointing an official at a high salary and others under him to sit in an office and wait for business. It can only be successfully carried out by an active propaganda and missionary work amongst people in the Old Country who are tired of their present surroundings and wish to go to a new country. If .the transportation companies in the United States and Canada could, for the last twenty or twenty-five years, succeed in bringing over to America from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 people every year, why should not a &#39;strong Government such as we have here be able to do the same when they are in a position to offer intending emigrants better inducements than can be offered either by the United States or by Canada? </para>

He feels that his position is assured to him for life, and he becomes inert and listless. The people who work well are those whose positions depend on the success of their efforts. The people we send to London to carry out a vigorous immigration policy should go there on the understanding that if their efforts are not successful they must make room for some one else. </para>

                            <para>- It certainly is; but I am now only stating facts. Then it is most important that the people invited to come here shall have some definite information about what they are going to do. Tt is of no use to bring&#39; people here with the vague idea that they are going to settle on the land in order &#34;to get a living. They must be brought here with a distinct object in view. They should know where they are going, how they are to get there, and what they are to do when they arrive. These things must be made perfectly plain to them, and the measures adopted for their introduction must be in the nature of a contract, the terms of which should be faithfully fulfilled. We are often told that the Commonwealth Government do not own an acre of land. That is quite true. But we are, I hope, a reasonable people, and the State Governments who do own the land desire settlement quite as much as we do, and probably more, because developmental work rests upon their shoulders more than upon the shoulders of the Government of the Commonwealth. Surely our State and .Commonwealth Governments have sufficient common-sense and patriotism to work together and make the best use of our resources. We have in Australia to-day 1,356,000 acres of land that is unalienated. Some of it is let under lease, but the leases are all terminable within certain periods. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, tout I am now merely showing that there is plenty of room for people in Australia. It should be only a matter of common-sense and business-like arrangement amongst ourselves to bring about a solution of the land settlement question. In the Murray Valley, as I am reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> there is room for millions of people, and abundant water to meet all their needs. The High Commissioner could not do all that is necessary, but he could keep a guiding and a directing hand on the carrying out of an immigration policy. The question of defence is a complement to the immigration question. We must get people to come here if for no other purpose than to enable us to keep the country we have. We have now before this Parliament definite proposals with respect to defence which should be matured and brought into actual operation in the course of a very few years. If the British Army and Navy are to become one all over the world as is proposed, we shall require a confidential medium of communication such as a High Commissioner would be between the Defence authorities here and the Admiralty and the War Office in the Old Land. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> asked last night why we should appoint a High Commissioner, and suggested that the States Agents- General could do the work of a High Commissioner. No State Agent-General could do this work. The honorable senator also said that before we appoint a High Commissioner we should make an arrangement with the States as to what is to be done in future with the existing Agents-General&#39;s Departments. I say that we should first appoint a High Commissioner, and we could then approach the State Governments with a practical proposal, at another Premiers&#39; Conference if that should be convenient, and come to a fair understanding with them. The State Agents-General are not co-operating; in London. They are there not to do  the best they can for Australia. Each is there to do the best he. can for his own State, and the success of his efforts is gauged not by the benefit which accrues to Australia as a whole, but by the benefits secured for his own particular State. &#39; We require to have in London as High Commissioner a man with good platform abilities. The power of the human voice is very great indeed, and we require a man who can command an audience, whether at an after-dinner speech or in one of the large halls in London which hold 30,000 or 40,000 people. We must have a man who can put the case, for this country clearly and convincingly. The High Commissioner must be a man who can keep himself in touch with all classes. He should be no mere social butterfly. He should be able to go amongst the working classes, and encourage them to come out here. He should be easily approachable, and there should be no standoffishness about him. It is wonderful how soon a practical, broad-minded man can make himself popular with all classes. It does not follow that a man who is popular with the upper classes will be unpopular with the lower classes. It is possible for a broad-minded man to be popular with both. Again, the High Commissioner should be an Australian. There has been some talk about the selection of some gentleman at Home, but I do not think the Government would be so foolish as to make any such appointment. We want a patriotic Australian, and one who is at the same time sufficiently an Imperialist to keep in touch with the people at Home. In another place it was contended that the name of the High Commissioner should be inserted in the Bill. A similar contention may be put forward here, but I consider that it would be unfair to ask the Government to do any such thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was generous and fair enough to say that if he were a member of the Government he would not consent to insert the name in the Bill. I believe that the Government will appoint the best man they can find. I should say that of any Government. I believe that the last Federal . Government would in similar circumstances have selected the very best man they could, get for the position independent of party considerations. We should not select a man for this position because of the services he may have rendered in the past, but because of the services, we expect the occupant of this position to render in the future. The duties of the position will be very onerous, and a High Commissioner, in London, determined to do his duty, will have no light task in pushing Australian interests and contending against the conflicting interests and the <inline font-style="italic">vis inertia</inline> he will find in that great city. It should be borne in mind that the first appointment to this post will be the most important to be made. If we make a mistake in the first appointment the consequences .will continue for a very long time. If the first High Commissioner appointed is an unsuitable man and makes a failure of his work, the consequences of his failure will attach to the man by whom he is succeeded, and that man will have a very uphill task to perform. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the High Commissioner will have the confidence of Parliament. If in the first appointment we secure success on proper lines the future will be easy. Something has been said about the cost of the representation of the various States in London. The figures are: - New South Wales,  &#163;10,215 ;  Victoria,  &#163;5,000  ; Queensland,  &#163;8,832 ; </para>

                    <para class="block">South Australia,  &#163;3,532  ; Western Australia,  &#163;6,004;  Tasmania,  &#163;1,410;  or a total of  &#163;34,993.  It is somewhat perplexing to say what the future of the State agencies in London is going to be. I fear that both the Agents-General themselves and the State Governments will be reluctant to alter the existing system. Nobody cares to give up profit, power, and prestige. It seems to me that we shall require a very clear expression of the voice of the people upon this question before we shall accomplish the changes that we desire to effect. Then the whole subject of expenditure is one to which the country should give serious consideration. When Federation was established, we were promised that the States would considerably reduce the cost of government. At that time, it was pointed out that the Commonwealth was taking over the Customs, Defence, and the Post and Telegraph Departments, and to the extent to which the States were being relieved of expenditure they ought to effect economies. For the year  1899-1900,  the revenue of the States from ordinary services amounted to  &#163;2,590,507.  The revenue from special services such as railways and tramways, post office, telegraphs, and telephones&#39;, water supply, and sewerage, during that year amounted to  &#163;13,393,398.  In  1904-5,  the revenue from ordinary services had increased to  &#163;3,428,732,  and in  1907-8 -  which is the last year for which the figures are available - it had still further increased to  &#163;3,601,450.  In.  1904-5,  the revenue from special services amounted to  &#163;i3.476,330&#187;  and in  1907-8  to  &#163;16,242,404.  . The receipts from the sales of land and rentals remained at about the same level, amounting in&#39;  1899-1900  to  &#163;3&#62;5I4,6&#39;54;  in  i9&#176;4-5&#62;  to  &#163;3&#62;256&#62;6o9;  and in  1907-8  to  &#163;3,375&#62;987-  The interest upon loans rose from  &#163;391,549  in  1899-1900  to  &#163;486,691  in  1904-5,  and to  &#163;540,924  in  1907-8.  During  1899-1900,  it must be remembered that the States received no revenue from the Commonwealth, but the next year they received  &#163;7,135,823,  and in  1907-8  the returns to them from Customs and Excise revenue totalled  &#163;8,859,596,  whilst their revenue from other sources rose from  &#163;1,133,146  in  1899-1900  to  &#163;1,930,744  in  1904-5,  and to  &#163;2,247,285  in  1907-8.  Altogether the revenue of the States - despite the fact that they had been relieved of the Customs and Postal Departments - increased from  &#163;28,695,493  in  1899-1900  to  &#163;29,714,929  in 1904-5, and to ,&#163;34,867,646 in 1907-8. Apart from railways and tramways, which return something like working expenses and interest upon their capital cost, the expenditure of the .States increased from &#163;21,540,749 in 1899-1900 to &#163;21,653,764 in 1904-5, and to &#163;22,970,160 in 1907-8. So that the States, instead of reducing expenditure, have actually increased it. </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing that aspect of the matter at the present time. Upon new works, the Department of Trade and Customs expended &#163;1,980 in 1904-5, and &#163;8,972 in 1907-8; the Defence Department expended &#163;200,259 in 1904-5, and &#163;440,918 in 1907-8, whilst the expenditure of the Postal Department increased from &#163;131,829 in 1904-5 to &#163;427,006 in 1907-8. The total expenditure of the Commonwealth increased from &#163;4,322,829 in 1904-5 to &#163;6.162,129 in 1907-8. I mention these facts to emphasize the need which exists for the exercise of extreme care before we commit the Commonwealth to any further expenditure. I need scarcely point out that we are contracting very heavy obligations. We have in operation an Old-age Pensions scheme, which, in a very short time, will cost 10s. per head, and we are about to initiate a defence policy which will cost an equal amount. Do not these circumstances point to .the necessity for adopting a vigorous immigration policy? It is obvious that if we double the number of our people we shall reduce our taxation <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> by 50 per cent. Last year, the office of High Commissioner for New Zealand cost the Dominion &#163;6,756. The High Commissioner for Canada receives a salary of &#163;1,500, or $7,500. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the honorable senator that I looked up the Canadian Estimates for information on this matter only last night. The people of the United States, it is worth noting, never trouble to send a rich ambassador to London. They send the ablest man. The appointment is generally given to a man of talent as a reward for services rendered, but he has infinite possibilities of making himself useful. I do not think that we ought to alter the salary which is provided for in this Bill - at any rate, for the present. During this debate, we have heard a good deal about the necessity for the High Commissioner discharging social functions. I hope that he will attend as few of those functions as possible. I very much doubt whether Australia would benefit from his attendance at such gatherings. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, he could be as sparing in his attendance at them as possible. Very shortly we shall have four great Dependencies represented in London, namely, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, and their united representations upon over-sea matters must carry great weight in the Empire. In the High Commissioner&#39;s office we ought to install only practical men. The people who will visit that office will desire to secure information concerning our mining, agricultural, and manufacturing industries. How can we expect a man who has never earned a penny with his coat off to supply such information? To disseminate knowledge in regard to . the mining industry we require a man who is acquainted with the geology of this country, whilst to supply information upon agricultural matters we need a man who has been upon the soil, and who can tell intending settlers the precise nature of the difficulties which they will be called upon to face. It would be idle to send men to our London office, dressed in black coats and white shirts, who have never done a hard day&#39;s work in their lives. If we select a good man as our High Commissioner, he will do much good for Australia. On the other hand, if we select a poor man he may work incalculable harm. The first occupant of the office will undoubtedly set the pace. If he makes it a rule to attend social functions, and to live at a high rate, his successor will have no option but to do likewise. Our first High Commissioner ought to act as the Scotch say, Ca&#39;canny. There is just one other matter upon which I desire to say a few words. It has reference to the necessity which exists for correcting misrepresentation of the Commonwealth in London. We have these misrepresentations in the press, and in conversations. They are rife all over the place. They came at times from rival newspapers, and at times from what is called the &#34;stinking fish&#34; party. We want in London a man who will give people the exact truth and nothing more, and who will be able to correct slanders and aspersions. When I was at Home, I used to see statements of the most ridiculous kind in the press ; but they went uncontradicted, and people believed them. </para>

The time is opportune for appointing a High Commissioner. We are on excellent terms with Canada, with the United States, and especially with the Old Land. We are gradually attracting attention; and I think that a capable man who would win his way would bring credit to himself and&#39; confer infinite, benefit on this great continent, of which we have the honour to be representatives. </para>

                        <para>. - With regard to this measure, which is of very great importance to the Commonwealth, it may be. said that its success will depend very largely upon the character and the ability of the gentleman who is appointed High Commissioner. I think that the Government should exercise exactly the same care and judgment in selecting a man for this position as they would in choosing a man for appointment to the Bench of the High Court, because in the political and commercial world the High Commissioner will have to exercise functions as important in that relation to Australia as the occupants of the High Court Bench have to discharge with regard &#34;to its people. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> wishes the salary not to be mentioned in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that remark. The Bill provides for a salary of &#163;3,000, and an allowance of &#163;2,000 to cover expenses. Both the Senate and the Government have to consider whether a man who is fit to discharge properly the duties of this high office is likely to be obtained in Australia at the salary stated in the Bill. It will be seen at once that outside a class of Government officials who have made their mark in that capacity, there is possibly not available, at the salary, a man who could fittingly represent Australia as High Commissioner. On the other hand, I agree with the sentiment uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that in the creation of this new office, we have to take into consideration the fact that our expenditure in various Departments is increasing very rapidly, and that we have to exercise economy with prudence. It will be out of place to make any suggestions with regard to picking out a class of appointees. I was glad to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the past or present political position of a man is not to be considered a bar to appointment. At the same time, politics  ought not to be excluded from consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so; and if the honorable senator will pardon me for making the remark, that suggestion emanates from a more or less diseased imagination on his part. I do not think that there is a single party in the Senate who, in dealing with an appointment of this kind, would descend to the very low plane which the honorable senator has just suggested. I believe that the Government will regard the filling of this office from the same high ground and sense of duty and responsibility as they would regard the selection of a Judge for the High Court Bench. </para>

                            <para>- On the other hand, it is suggested that as there are six Agents- General representing the various States, there is no immediate necessity for Australia to appoint a High Commissioner, as the Agents-General can transact all the commercial and political business which is required of them by their respective Governments. I do not agree with the latter objection. To my mind, the continued existence of six Agents-General will be rather a source of conflicting action than of concerted action. We shall not have proper concerted action on behalf of Australia, until we have a High Commissioner, who will, by virtue of his appointment under this measure, have the right to speak in the name of Australia on all matters of common interest thereto. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so.I believe that on the whole they have done very good work for their respective States. It is only within the last nine years that we have had a political entity called Australia, and the importance of appointing a High Commissioner has made itself evident and felt, not only to the Australian community, but in Imperial circles in the Old Country. It was anticipated that, as the logical and necessary outcome of the foundation of the Commonwealth, we should have in diplomatic, political, and commercial circles in London, a representative who would, with the advice of, and under instructions from, the Government, be empowered by Statute to speak for and on behalf of Australia. To me, the appointment of a High Commissioner seems to follow as the necessary and logical consequence, first, of the foundation of the Commonwealth, and, secondly, of the relations which the Commonwealth must necessarily have with the Mother Country - relations whose importance year by year will be of greater interest to us as they are of greater interest to the Empire. The High Commissioner will be in close touch with the highest political circles of the Empire. He will be in equally close touch with the political representatives of the various self-governing portions of the Empire. He will be at the very fountain-head of the great military and naval projects of the various States outside the Empire. In the rapid, and, to some extent menacing, developments which are going on in Europe, and possibly in the East, it is vastly important that Australia and its component parts should have a competent man at the fountain-head to advise us publicly or, if for diplomatic or political reasons that should be necessary, privately, in order to keep us in touch with ali political, social, and other movements both inside and outside the Empire. I do not think that there is a single member of this, or a State Parliament, who would for a moment attempt to maintain the position that these important duties and the responsibilities which devolve therefrom, can be carried out by a single Agent-General, or by a combination of Agents-General, the reason being that they would have no statutory or constitutional right to speak for and on behalf of Australia. The Commonwealth, I repeat, was founded for that amongst other purposes. It will then be asked, and probably some of the States will either ask the question or raise the objection, &#34; What is to become of our Agents-General ? What positions will they occupy?&#34; My answer to that question is that the Agents-General, whatever offices they may occupy, or whatever duties they may have to perform, will be entirely dependent upon the State Legislatures, who will either curtail the powers of their representatives, or transfer some of them to the High Commissioner.  If  they chose to do so, well and good. If they chose not to do so, probably that will be foolish on their part. But I take it that, on the whole, the State Governments reflect State opinion, at least as accurately and as wisely as we reflect the combined opinion of Australia; and that they will gradually recognise that, while it is necessary for political and diplomatic reasons to have a High Commissioner to speak, for and on behalf of all Australia, the principal duty of their Agents- General must be to look after, as they do now, the development of the commercial and trading interests of the States. In other words, I take it that whatever name may be used, the Agents-General will become merely commercial agents for their States; and I can speak, perhaps, quite accurately on behalf of my State. Ever since the institution of Federation, it has been anticipated in the highest political circles in Queensland, and, I believe. by all parties, that sooner or later, a High Commissioner would be appointed, and that as a necessary consequence of such appointment, the Agents-General would be converted more and more into commercial immigration agents. In that respect, it will probably be found that the tendency in Australia will be exactly like that in Canada - that the High Commissioner will gradually assume many of the important political and diplomatic duties which previously had devolved upon the Agents-General. When the States see, as 1 am sure they will see, that these duties can be best carried out through the High Commissioner and his officers, they will, very probably, not withdraw their Agents-General from London, but. constitute them commercial agents. The duties of each Commercial. Agent will be confined to promoting the interests of his own State. <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> the primary production of our States increases, there will be an increasing need for agents in Great Britain. I am perfectly certain that it is not the intention of the Commonwealth Government, by the appointment of a High Commissioner, to seek to diminish the exercise of the powers of the State Commercial Agents. Consequently there is not the slightest fear of friction arising between the representative of the Commonwealth and the representatives of the States. </para>

                            <para>- From my acquaintance with the writings of that learned philosopher, I believe that he held the opinion that it is suicidal for the State to interfere unduly with the industries of a country. But there is a vast difference between a judicious encouragement of the energies of a State and a wild and woolly attempt to force the affairs of private individuals. I have shown conclusively, I think, that there need be no conflict of jurisdiction between the High Commissioner and the agents of the States. Both authorities can work harmoniously together. Such is the case in regard to Canada. When the Dominion Government appointed the Canadian High Commissioner, the provincial Governments were inclined to close their offices in London. But, as commerce increased, so the provincial Administrations gave increasing attention to the needs of their commercial classes, and took greater care in the establishment of agents in Europe. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has pointed out, and as is, indeed, a matter of fact, the population and prosperity of Canada are increasing by leaps and bounds. The experience of Canada should be an incentive to us to go forward, and an incentive to the States, to continue their individual efforts to promote their own interests. It is merely setting up a bogy to pretend that the States will object to what we propose to do. It has been well pointed out that one service which the High Commissioner will be able to perform will be to correct false impressions, sometimes ignorantly, and often, I am afraid, maliciously, circulated against Australia in England. </para>

But let me say this much in answer to the honorable senator : that the book has been under the fire of criticism both in England and in Australia, and I am happy to know that most of the critics praise it very highly for the way in which it deals with some facts ; whilst even hostile critics have given me credit for presenting my case impartially. If a man. submits the case which he has to lay before the public in an honest manner, and his fairness is generally admitted, that is as much as can be expected. I have said that some of the criticism directed against Australia has been ignorant and malicious. It has been urged that the Agents-General could have replied to those attacks. Some of them did correct false impressions; some did not. </para>

                            <para>- I would not say that any Agent-General has circulated literature slandering other States; but I admit that very often an Agent-General, for the sake of gaining some advantage for his State, has issued statements which were the reverse of truth. It is to put an end to that kind of rivalry that we are seeking to create the office of High Commissioner. We shall have in this office one who will stand up for Australia, and whose duty will be to correct at once misrepresentations which are circulated concerning our country. Any person who will read the ignorant misrepresentations contained in . the long-continued attacks on Australian finance by A.  J.  Wilson, in the <inline font-style="italic">Investors&#39; Review</inline> and other publications, after the commercial crisis of 1893, will recognise the need for some authoritative representative of Australia in London. It i.v the duty of the Government to appoint a man powerful enough to make those who start such attacks conscious of the fact that there is close at hand an authority competent to furnish an effective answer. Every one of the writers of the character of A. j. Wilson, although they directed their venom against particular States, nevertheless dragged in the name of Australia. While it may be admitted that legitimate criticism is to be welcomed, and while we should pay heed to warnings given to us by competent authorities concerning weaknesses in our finance or system of government, it is unfair and unjust that the mistakes of individual States should be attributed to the whole of Australia. </para>

Who is the honorable senator that he should stand up and rebuke the sinner? But it is generally that class of man who does that kind of thing. I wish the honorable senator would not leave himself open to these palpable retorts, and so interrupt the thread of my remarks. It is a matter of history that probably the greatest injury done to Australia by a public criticism of the character to which I have referred was done in  1893,  when the whole financial system of Australia was under overhaul by ourselves. Our financial position at the time was made the subject of such severe attacks on the other side of the globe that our public credit was dragged in the mire when a more generous or a more correct analysis of our financial position would have revealed the fact, long before the revelation was made indisputable, that, notwithstanding various mistakes and errors of extravagance that might fairly be urged against nur State Governments, a scientific investigation of our finances showed that, although we were suffering severe reverses, we possessed sufficient resources to pull through even those great difficulties. </para>

                            <para>- All the time there was in the banks of Australia and to the credit of the various Governments sufficient to enable us&#62; to pay  20s.  in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,1</inline> if we were given sufficient breathing time. But public and private creditors were alarmed in the Old Country, and we had no one on the spot who could examine the facts exhaustively and show what was our real financial position at the time. We had no one who could make it clear that there was no reason for the alarm that had been aroused. I anticipate that with the appointment of a High Commissioner, should a similar financial panic arise in future, we shall have a man who will be able immediately and effectively to answer all the objections urged against us, r,nd to put our true financial position before the public. I might be allowed to say, in referring to this matter, that the advertisement of our adversity in  1893  has, perhaps, after all, served as the best proof to the whole of the world that Australia is one of the richest countries on earth, because no other country embarrassed as we were then could have emerged so quickly and so triumphantly from the difficulties of the position in which we were placed. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that there are some who are still suffering directly from the consequences of that financial paralysis. But so long as the world continues, even though we should possess men of the intelligence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> there will be misfortune and undeserved suffering on the part of some. To say that because there will be suffering we should make no effort to prevent it, seems to me to be particularly illogical. We require as High Commissioner a man who is acquainted with our finances and our past political administration, and one who, in such a time of peril, would be in a position to offer such assurances to the public as would prevent a good deal of the suffering to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has referred. Let me give another instance of the injury done to Australia through the lack of a common representation of the States in London. We passed an Immigration Restriction Act in  1902.  I believe honorable senators opposite will not dispute the statement that the party to which they belong were largely, if not entirely, responsible for the passing of that &#39;Act. It contained a section which in its operation inflicted unintentional injustice on some persons who were brought to the shores of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to deal with that suggestion. But since the interjection has been made I may inform the honorable senator that as a result of the incident to which I was about to refer certain provisions of that Act have been repealed so as to prevent the possibility of such a stupidity occurring again in the administration of our immigration restriction law. Much as I differ, from the policy of honorable senators opposite in the matter of immigration, and much as I deplore the results of that policy, I believe that it was intentionally misrepresented when it w7as stated that it was their policy at that time and their unalterable determination to warn off immigrants from the shores of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat that I differ entirely from the policy of the other side with regard to immigration. But I believe that the critics .who hurled that charge against their policy, whether intentionally or not, did a grave injustice, not merely to the party opposite, but to the people and Parliament of Australia. It should be remembered that it was an unfortunate administration of the Act which gave rise to the malicious misrepresentations of our immigration policy to which I have referred. The Opposition are responsible for a policy in this connexion which may be said to be the exclusion of undesirables. That is their immigration policy so far as they have any at all. But it seems to me that it would be a greater evidence of common sense not to devote their attention so much to the exclusion of undesirables a&#38; to the admission of desirables. The malicious misrepresentation of the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act did a great deal of injury to Australia. A campaign of calumny was entered upon, and the administration of the Act was pointed to as an official warning that we did not desire suitable immigration. Unfortunately we had at the time no one on the spot to deal with the misrepresentations. If we had had a High Commissioner in London he could have explained the whole matter in such a way as to stamp out the slanders. For the reasons I have urged we should as soon as possible establish such an office as is contemplated by this Bill and appoint a competent person to fill it. </para>

                            <para>- What is there to prevent that? The Commonwealth Government will be ignoring one of the main objects of the proposed appointment if they do not seek by arrangement with the State Governments the gradual transference to the High Commissioner of many functions at present exclusively in the hands of the State Agents-General. We can assume that the State Governments possess some vestiges of common sense, and will not fail to note the advantages offered to them. If the Commonwealth authority proposes to thrust the High Commissioner upon the State Governments, and to insist that he shall assume the functions of the State Agents-General whether the State authorities desire it or not, the friction which some honorable senators fear will be sure to arise, and there will probably be chaos again. It would not be the first time in the history of the Commonwealth that the Parliament has tried to do a very wise thing in a remarkably stupid manner. But I hope that we have all benefited by the experience of the past; and will be able to avoid causes of friction. There is work to be done in London which only a High Commissioner can do on behalf of Australia, and which cannot be properly done until such an appointment is made as that which is provided for in this Bill. I hope that the Government will have no difficulty in finding a suitable man for the position, and will make a judicious selection in their appointment. </para>

                        <para>. - As I take up an attitude on this question somewhat different from that assumed by the two honorable senators from Tasmania who have already addressed themselves to the second reading of this Bill, I should like to explain first of all that I sympathize with what they have said. In the present state of the finances of Tasmania every representative of that State must keep his eye on the agreement which has been entered into between the State Premiers and the Federal Government in connexion with the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. On the carrying out of .that agreement must very largely depend the attitude which representatives of Tasmania must assume on any proposal involving increased expenditure. I agree with the majority <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> honorable senators who have spoken that it is time such an appointment as is provided for in this Bill was made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> suggestion that the Commonwealth should in any way dictate to the States as to the representation they may deem it necessary to have in the Old Country was somewhat contrary to his usual attitude towards the State Governments. The honorable senator has usually been prepared to protect the independence of the States. If there is one feature of our Constitution more distinct than another it is that under it it is intended that the independence of the States shall continue. While the Commonwealth should perform the work which has been delegated to it, it ought to be careful not to interfere with State responsibilities. Of the usefulness of a High Commissioner in London any man who has been behind the curtain as a member of an Executive Council must be well satisfied. </para>

                            <para>- Long enough to know something about the question which I am discussing. I was very glad to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> whilst filling the office of Minister of Defence in the late Government, learned to appreciate the officer who is at present representing the Commonwealth in London. In Tasmania for a great many years there was a constant struggle over the question of whether the office of Agent-General should be continued. At one time I &#39;know that the representation of that State in London was costing less than&#163;2,000 annually. I venture to say that there was never a representative of that State in the world&#39;s metropolis who did not justify his official existence by the savings which he effected. Recently, Tasmania was exceptionally well represented by a brother of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who very generously undertook to discharge duties of almost a national character for the very small salary of  , &#163;400,  with expenses. There was no year in which the value of the work which he performed - viewing the matter from the most sordid stand-point - did not represent twenty times that amount. Of course, our High Commissioner will be vested with much larger powers than are intrusted to any Agent-General. Whatever salary we may determine to grant him, I certainly do not think that any sum which has been mentioned is too large, in view of the responsibilities which he will have to assume. Whatever views we may entertain in regard to his attendance at social functions, we- cannot allow him to occupy a position which would be unworthy of the Commonwealth. If he is obliged to accept hospitality, the least we can do is to return that hospitality. I rose chiefly to express the hope that any increased expenditure to which we may commit the Commonwealth will be subject to the ratification of the agreement which has been arrived at between the Prime Minister and the State Premiers. </para>

I have received a memorandum on the subject to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has alluded, the effect of which is that the power taken under the Papuan ordinance in question is not a power which in any way varies the contract between the employer and the Government, which provides for security being given by the employer for the payment of wages, and for the sum represented by the cost of returning a labourer to his home. I have the full memorandum in my possession, and the document is at the disposal of the honorable senator if he cares to peruse it. </para>
