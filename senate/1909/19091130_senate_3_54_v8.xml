          <para>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the representatives of the press making public a report of the evidence given before the Select Committee on Press Cable Service. </para>

        <para class="block">That motion has not, of course, been moved, but I find that without waiting to see whether the Senate would grant a suspension of the Standing Orders to enable the publication of evidence to be made, evidence has been published in the press of to-day, and presumably at the instance of the Committee in question. </para>

I submit, sir, that the term " such as are declared by the Parliament" must of necessity mean a declaration of both Chambers in the form of an Act. </para>

              <para>- At present I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> intends to produce a copy of the newspaper or not. Of course, a question might be raised as to whether the standing order applies simply to the publication of matter in a newspaper, or to a statement containing comments which would be a breach of privilege by the newspaper at a particular time. In any case, as the honorable senator has alluded to a report which appeared in a newspaper, it is desirable that he should produce a copy of the newspaper, whether his complaint is against it or the Committee. </para>

              <para>- No. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> misapprehends my argument. Our Standing Orders are useful up to a certain point; and up to a certain point I have cited them as applying to this breach of privilege. But until both Houses of this Parliament have declared what are the powers, privileges, and immunities of members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, we have under the Constitution larger and more enduring powers than any which we have under our Standing Orders, which, after all, relate to matters of detail rather than to the larger questions involving the powers and privileges of members of this Parliament.

            <para>On the 13th April, 1875, complaint was made of the publication in two newspapers of the proceedings, and evidence taken before the Select Committee on Foreign Loans. The publication was declared a breach of privilege, and the printers were ordered to attend. But as it appeared in debate that the publication had not been unauthorized by the Committee they were directed to report the circumstances under which the document had been communicated to the newspapers. </para>

          <para class="block">That is precisely the position which I bring under your notice to-day. I believe that there can be no doubt whatever that this publication has not been unauthorized.

              <para>- As a member of the Senate who always endeavours to observe the rules of Parliament and of the Standing Orders, I deem it my duly to bring this matter forward, not so much as affecting the present instance as to point to a shocking example in a way which may be the means of preventing similar breaches of Parliamentary etiquette and privilege in the future. I have quoted the entry from page  74  of the nth edition of <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> to show that my complaint is not really against the press for publishing these matters, but against the Committee for winking at their publication. It is impossible to suggest that the members of the Committee were not aware that representatives of the press were present at their meeting from time to time, took down evidence in shorthand, and published it from day to day, and the responsibility for the breach of privilege therefore rests with the Committee. The breach of standing order  296,  and of the privileges of the Senate, is confirmed by this resolution of the House of Commons, which will be found at page  466  of the  9th  edition of <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> The entry is as follows - </para>

              <para>- That may be very clever, but it is not funny. I have here a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of to-day, and I again desire to make it perfectly plain that I am not bringing this matter forward as a breach of privilege by any newspaper, simply because, in accordance with the extract which I have quoted from <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> I do not consider that the newspapers were to blame, but that the blame rests with some one else. In order that I might comply with a suggestion which you, sir, made a little while ago, I have brought a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> here, not with any view of making any complaint against the press, because I consider that the press have been led astray by the Committee, and not because of any deliberate intention on their part. I produce the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of to-day containing something over a column of evidence taken by the Select Committee yesterday. I submit it as a proof of my <inline font-style="italic">bona fides,</inline> and not as indicating a desire to challenge the action of the newspaper in publishing that which it was induced to publish by what I deem to be the improper action of the Committee in permitting or inducing, if honorable senators please, the publication of evidence in defiance of our own Standing Orders and of the powers, privileges, and immunities of members of the Senate as conferred upon us by the Constitution. If you think, sir, that I should conclude with a motion I shall do so; but I should prefer, if possible, that the matter should be considered by yourself, and that upon further consideration - because as the thing has been done the matter is not one of urgency - the discussion might be adjourned. </para>

Moreover, we have declared we will lay down our own' practice, and have proceeded to do so, as is shown by the document which you, sir, present to the Senate each session, embodying your rulings. But even supposing that we were . governed by House of Commons precedents, the case cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is an excellent one to show that the Select Committee in question has not offended in .this regard; because the passage which he has read makes it clear that not only was the press authorized to be present, but was authorized to publish a particular document. "That was not done in the present case. In order to make the instance which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has quoted appropriate he should have shown that the Select Committee had by resolution permitted documents to be published. That we have not done. I frankly confess, however, that I had not given this subject that consideration which, perhaps, I should have given to it. There have been other Select Committees of the Senate the Chairmen of which have submitted motions giving power to admit the press. As soon as I was aware that that course had been followed, I took steps to adopt such a procedure in regard to the Press Cable Service Committee. I gave notice of the motion which now stands on the business-paper. </para>

              <para>- As soon as I knew that other Committees had obtained power to give the press permission to publish evidence, I gave notice of motion to that effect. I take it that the power of the Committee to admit the press is' beyond question. The Committee has that power without the sanction of the Senate. The Senate gave the power to the Committee when it was appointed. Singular to say, however, I was deprived of the opportunity of submitting my motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> himself. </para>

Is it not slightly hypocritical, if the honorable senator is anxious that the Committee should have this power, not to permit the motion to be moved? Why did he call not formal " when the motion was read from the Chair? " If an offence has been committed, I submit that it is of a technical character, and that there was no intention whatever to flout the Senate or to assume powers which the Committee had no right to assume. The Committee was not aware that it was doing anything more than was authorized by the Standing Orders. Indeed, if any one has committed a breach of the Standing Orders in divulging documents to the press, it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> himself. </para>

            <para>- - I trust that the Senate will not allow itself to be influenced by any misunderstanding which has arisen between an ex-member of the Select Committee in ques- ' tion and the Committee itself. Any such misunderstanding should, I venture to say, be put entirely outside the discussion at the present juncture. The point to which I wish to direct attention is that which is raised specifically ,by the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> as to whether or not the Select Committee has taken some action in contravention of the Standing Orders. I rather regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the early part of his speech sought to show that the Committee has not in any way contravened the Standing Orders. Towards the conclusion, however, he practically admitted, or expressed a fear, that ' the Committee had done so, and said that he had endeavoured to put matters right by giving notice of the motion which now stands on the business-paper. It appears to me that that was the right action to take, when, through want of knowledge or of thought, or by one of those little oversights which are pardonable, a procedure which is in accordance with the practice of Parliament has been overlooked. But the fact remains that the Committee not merely permitted representatives of the press to be present, and tolerated their presence, but by the adoption of a motion, virtually authorized the publication of reports. ' Therefore, the responsibility for the publication may fairly be charged against the Committee. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has, no doubt, done very many wrong things in his lengthy and distinguished career, but  we are not now dealing with .them. I ask honorable senators to keep extraneous matter out of the discussion. Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was a member of the Committee does not affect the question of whether its action was wrong or right. In his last remark <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did appear to me to touch the keynote of the whole matter. He suggested that possibly the Committee had overlooked the Standing Orders, and, therefore, in order to put matters right, he had tabled a motion. That seemed to me to sum up the whole position. The Committee proceeded innocently, I am prepared to believe, to allow reporters to be present. Discovering its mistake, it did the right thing, and sought an opportunity to get a sanction for the publication of evidence in the future, and to that extent a condonation of a little lapse of which, I think, it had been guilty. It does not seem to me that this is at all a serious matter. The Committee could not have had any sinister motive in doing what it did. I have no doubt that it acted in the best of good faith. In view of the fact that recently we have heard a great deal about secret caucuses and other things, it is, perhaps, not desirable that in a matter in which, to some extent, press interests are concerned, reporters should have been given an opportunity of publishing information. 1 trust that the excellent example set by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will be followed, and that too much time will not be occupied in the discussion of this question. </para>

There may be a little variation between the Standing Orders and common sense, but in this matter I stand by common sense, and I think that the Senate will do the same. I feel quite certain that the Committee has done what was quite right, and seeing that it was appointed to inquire into the doings of the press, mainly at the instigation of the Opposition, it was entirely to their credit that their representatives on the Committee agreed to the admission of reporters to the meetings. </para>

" I am dissatisfied," he added, " with the composition of the Committee, which, judging from the speeches delivered in the Senate, is composed of five members for the prosecution and two on the other side. Sufficient evidence has been taken to show that there is no monopoly as alleged. According to the evidence (as published in the press) it is absolutely clear that the country press does not - as was stated - take any material interest in the. question of -cable news. Something like 1,000 circular letters have been addressed to the country press on the subject, asking for replies to six or eight questions, with the result that about 100 letters have been received, the writers of the majority of which either profess do interest in the questions involved, or are satisfied with the existing arrangement. </para>

          <para class="block">If we are to accept that statement, as I do, as indicating the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> resigned, it appears that he resigned because he thought that the Select Committee had outlived its usefulness, and was goking outside the scope of the inquiry. If he really held that belief, it was his duty to remain and insist that it should not take that course. I venture to say that he will have very great difficulty in showing that it has in any way gone outside the reference from the Senate. With reference to the question of privilege, the Committee was authorized by the Stand* ing Orders to admit strangers if it thought fit. The Senate allows strangers to be present ; but you cannot find any authority in the Standing Orders, or the Constitution for the admission of the press to the Senate. We admit any strangers. They are not labelled pressmen. The representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is not labelled <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> across his chest, nor is any one of the other pressmen labelled. They come in as strangers and exercise their right to take notes, and we cannot prevent them from publishing these notes on their own responsibility. </para>

            <para>. - This is not by any means a simple question. It does involve the authority of Parliament, and I cannot help feeling that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has intensified the difficulty by his statement that he prefers to follow common sense rather than to follow any standing orders. Common sense differs in the opinion of different individuals. If each member of Parliament could set up his own idea of common sense as an authority against the carefully and deliberately considered rules of Parliament, we should have nothing but confusion. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator has said that it is a one-sided Committee, that there were only two senators on it representing one view, and that there were five for the prosecution. In making that statement the honorable senator assumed that the five to whom he referred had made up their minds as to what they would do, and that no matter what evidence might be brought before the Committee those members would give a biased judgment because they represented a certain party in the Senate. Every one should know that this Select Committee was appointed by the whole Senate by ballot. In the circumstances, it is manifestly unfair, and it is also unmanly, to speak of a Select Committee so appointed as being one-sided or biased. Under the Standing Orders the Committee had power to admit strangers. The representatives of the press were neither more nor less than strangers, and there is nothing in the Standing Orders to say that strangers present at a meeting of a Select Committee shall not be permitted to take a report of the proceedings. </para>

I pointed out a few moments ago that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was entitled to make an explanation, and to correct what he regarded as a misrepresentation. That being so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> should accept his explanation, and proceed with the debate. </para>

              <para>- Before calling upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to reply, I should like to make one or two observations. This debate was initiated upon a question as to the position of the Senate in regard to the publication of the evidence taken before a Select Committee appointed by it, without its authority. There can be no doubt as to the meaning of our Standing Orders, and in passing I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that, whilst those Standing Order? direct a certain course to be followed, ii is not open to any honorable senator to disregard them without bringing himself into contempt. The Standing Orders, if they do not in so many words, provide a means by which effect may te given to the wish of any Select Committee in respect of the publication of evidence.  They, at any rate, do not interfere with the inherent powers of the Senate in this respect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has already pointed out how the fullest publicity could have been given to the evidence.

          <para class="block">It has been argued that if strangers are admitted to the proceedings before a Select Committee, that Committee has no power to prevent the publication of notes of evidence which those strangers mav take. In reply to that contention I would point out that any person publishing evidence taken before such a body without authority would, by reason of the prohibition imposed under the standing order which I have just quoted, bring himself into a position of contempt. It would be perfectly open to any honorable senator to submit the matter to the Senate, which could then take steps to prevent a repetition of the offence. </para>

              <para>- The Committee could report the matter to the Senate, if it thought fit to do so. It is not empowered to give permission to publish the evidence, but a motion could have been submitted in the Senate asking that the press be permitted to publish the evidence. The decision of the Committee to admit the press might very well be regarded by the press as permission to publish a report of the evidence taken before it. But the correct course would have been to submit a motion in the first instance, such as that of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has since given notice. It has been argued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that under section  49  of our Constitution this is a power, privilege, or immunity of the Senate which we cannot waive. He also pointed out that we could not define our privileges by standing order. In this latter contention, I quite agree with him. But we may define our practice by standing order. ' If we are to follow the practice of the House of Commons we know that in that House permission is granted to publish evidence taken before Select Committees appointed by it.

            <para>The rules of the House as to the presence of strangers at meetings of Committees are very liberal ; until the Committee withdraws for deliberation, while witnesses or experts are being examined, the proceedings are public. Members of the House who are not upon the Committee would, if they stood upon their rights, be entitled to stay for the discussion, but it is a strict rule of parliamentary etiquette that they also should withdraw before it begins. Now and then a Secret Committee is appointed ; when this is done everybody who is not a member of the Committee, even a member of the House, is kept out. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, where secret Committees are appointed, steps are taken to prevent any person from learning what transpires at their meetings. Had this matter been left to my ruling upon a point of order, the position would have been very much simplified. Before, however, permitting the publication of the evidence taken at this inquiry, the Committee should have first obtained the approval of the Senate. I hope that if in the future, any Select Committee may consider it advisable to have the evidence taken before it is published in the press, it will first take the precaution of obtaining the permission of the Senate. I may suggest that it would be a convenient way of disposing of the subject to permit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> motion to be withdrawn. I am perfectly sure that no one desires to pass a motion involving a censure of the Committee, nor. on the other hand, is it desirable to have it placed on record that a breach of the Standing Orders was not committed in permitting the publication of evidence. The subject having been ventilated, the simplest course would now be for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to withdraw his motion instead of pressing it to a division. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> denies the accuracy of my statement concerning the circular in that interview. Clearly, therefore, I could not have communicated anything to the press that I learnt as a member of the Committee, but was merely drawing on my own imagination. But I decline to be led away from what I clearly laid down in the extract from the 9th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> which I have handed to you, sir, for perusal. The statement there made is to this effect: It had been sought to bring some publishers of newspapers before the House of Commons for publishing evidence taken before a Select Committee; but it appearing that the publication was not unauthorized by the Committee, the Commons took no action. I never dreamt that any one would be unwise enough to suppose that newspapers would refrain from publishing what to all intents and purposes they were invited to publish by resolution of the Committee. Gentlemen of the press do not sit at a table and take notes of evidence merely for their amusement. When they are invited to attend a meeting it is a plain intimation to them that they may publish what takes place. As to my "rushing" to newspapers, the statement to that effect is very unworthy of the honorable senators who made the allegation. They must have read - they may have intentionally or unintentionally forgotten - in both the morning and evening journals, that I at first declined to be interviewed. I said that the matter would probably come before the Senate. It was not until it appeared that there would be no proper opportunity of putting my views forward in the Senate that I gave the interviews to which reference has been made. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps I am in error in doing so. _ Statements were published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> and in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> next morning showing that I objected that a breach of the Standing Orders had been committed in publishing evidence. and that -that was one of my reasons for resigning  my seat on the Committee. It  is admitted that the reports of those interviews were read by members of the Committee. Yet after that they went to Sydney, took evidence there, and permitted the publication of the evidence. Then, in a fit of belated repentance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> puts a notice of motion on the business paper asking - for what? Not for the admission of the press, but for the suspension of the Standing Orders. How did he get the notion that it was necessary to suspend the Standing Orders? This motion was put on the paper days and days after I had, as admitted, challenged the action of the Committee in the daily press. However, the object which I had in view has been amply achieved. I desire nothing more than the proper observance of the rules of the Senate. I consider that it is the duty of every member of the Senate to assist you, sir, in the discharge of your onerous duties as our presiding officer. Having brought this matter forward, I do not desire to press the motion. The subject having been discussed, you have given a ruling which in itself is an ample indorsement for my action. I am now willing to withdraw the motion, which I was not anxious to move. ' I am sure that what has happened will prevent any similar misapprehension in future. </para>

              <para>-  It was a matter of public notoriety that about a thousand copies of the document - I have a copy - were posted all over the Commonwealth. I submit that any general statement of the character of the replies to the questions cannot come within standing order 296, inasmuch as that is not a publication of the document. I did not know the name of a single person or newspaper from which the documents were received, and how then could I have published them? The statement in the motion is of the most general character, so genera] that I am sure no lawyer would dream of any person being called upon to plead to such a proposition. It refers to the contents of documents. But what documents are meant? We have not a single one of the documents before us, but only an allegation that there are documents. Until they are produced, sir, I submit that the motion cannot be entertained, as it is altogether teo vague. Who knows that there are any documents in existence? As a matter of fact, I do not know that one single reply has been received. </para>

              <para>-  We often make statements of a general character, just as it is clear, if I am correctly reported, that I made a statement of a general character. The motion is vague and ' without meaning, since it does not specify what the documents were, or what the disclosure or publication was. I submit that no man in his senses could make a reply to anything so vague as' this is. You, sir, know that no member of the legal profession would dare to summon a person in a quasi-criminal or criminal matter on anything so absurdly vague as this is. Nor in. any civil court could an action be maintained for a moment on a wild, general accusation. I repeat, sir, that the motion is altogether too vague to admit of either a reply from myself or a reasonable consideration at the hands of the Senate. </para>

              <para>- I have nothing to do with the vagueness of the motion. The question I have to consider is whether the matter it deals with comes within standing order 296, which definitely provides that nothing shall be disclosed or published. Now, a matter may be disclosed only, or it may be disclosed and published. The motion states that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> disclosed the contents of documents before the Select Committee, and, therefore, I take it, comes within the standing order. </para>

The honorable senator has presumed, not merely to disclose the proceedings of the Committee, but to practically guess at the contents of the letters which have been referred to,, and he secured the rest of his facts from conversations around the table in the Committeeroom, which were of a private nature. The honorable senator rushed away to the press to publish them. He has published what is incorrect, and has done it in such a way as to show that his desire was to throw ridicule upon the Committee, and prevent the members of it from doing their work. </para>

But it is not a matter to boast of, and I do not think the Leader of the Senate is justified in any way in supporting the honorable senator. I should like to say that the Select Committee carried' out one portion of the standing order very strictly. They did riot deliberate upon any matter until every stranger had left the room. The whole of their deliberations were carried on in private, and it is the secret and private deliberations of the Committee that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has thought himself justified in publishing.

          <para>The Parliament may take over from the States their public debts, or a proportion  thereof,  according to the respective numbers of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and may convert renew or consolidate such debts, or any part thereof ; and the States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted -  and so on. Honorable senators will see that under the section the Commonwealth has the right to exercise one of two options. One option is to take over the State debts as they existed at the time of the establishment of Federation, and the other to take over a proportion thereof according to the respective numbers of their people as shown bv the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. At the time of the establishment of Federation the debts due by the States represented in round numbers the sum of ,£200,000,000. Since then they have increased to nearly ^250,000,000. The object of the Bill is to permit the Commonwealth to take over, not only the debts owing by the States at the time of the establishment of the Commonwealth, but any debts which may be owing by the. States at the time -that the Commonwealth Parliament determines to. take over the State debts. It is clearly within the discretion of this Parliament to say how it -will exercise the option. If this Parliament decided to take over the State debts as existing at the time of the Federation, amounting to ^200,000,000, then, assuming that the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill goes through, as no doubt it will, after crediting the States with their 25s. per head, they would have to refund a sum amounting to £1,500,000 to meet the interest on those transferred debts. But if this Parliament determines to take oyer State debts the interest on which would roughly absorb the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payable to the States under the financial agreement, they would probably make provision for the transfer of debts amounting to £170,000,000, and a small refund from the States to the extent of ,£378,000 would then be necessary to meet the balance of interest. But assuming what is more likely, that should this Bill be passed, Parliament will determine to take over the whole of the State debts then existing, and that they would amount, as they do at present, to about £250,000,000, that would involve in addition to the amount represented by the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payable to the States under the financial agreement a refund by the States under the terms of section 105 to the Commonwealth of a sum of £3,170,000 to meet the interest on the debts so taken over. I wish honorable senators to recognise that this is an enabling and a permissive Bill. It does not propose any compulsion or any limitation upon the discretion of this Parliament in the matter. It simply means that if Parliament thinks proper, then, instead of exercising the option to take oyer State debts amounting to £200,000,000 as existing at the time of the establishment of Federation, it may take- over State debts to the amount of £250,000,000, or to such an amount as may be covered by the debts of the States at the time it determines to take them over. We are all agreed that it was everywhere urged as one of the great advantages of the Federation that it would enable the State debts to be transferred to the Commonwealth, and their conversion into one great Commonwealth stock. It was held that the Commonwealth would be able to borrow money very much more cheaply than could any of the States, and that thereby a large saving in interest would be effected. The idea of the Commonwealth taking over this" vast volume of debt has been reviewed and well thought over by eminent financial authorities who have been consulted on the sub e"t. They all ag-ee that if one great Commonwealth stock were established the Commonwealth would be in a position to borrow at a vew much cheaper rate than would any of the States. </para>

            <para>- The States and the taxpayers would benefit very, greatly as the result of the Commonwealth being able to borrow at the lower rates. In addition I would point out that the conversion of stock of such vast dimensions would necessarily mean the establishment of the Commonwealth on the financial markets, and that would give a high position of credit to any operations by it. Moreover, the whole of this stock could be more economically managed, particularly if it were managed - as I venture  t3  hope it will be - by some non-political body. This Bill, too, will relieve us of a practical difficulty which at p.e.:ent stands in our way. According to the terms of section 105 of the Constitution, it is competent for the Commonwea'th  to take  over the State debts which existed at the time of the establishment of tha Commonwealth. But the practical difficulty which has arisen is that since 'the Federation was established, the States have altered their debts - that considerable loans which were then owing have since been redeemed, and new stocks and new bondholders have been substituted. So that if we attempt to give effect to the Constitution as it stands, we shall experience a serious difficulty in indemnifying bondholders. As an illustration J. would point honorable senators to what has frequently taken place in the several States. Let us suppose that a sum of £5,000,000- which was owing by a State prior to the advent of Federation fell due five years after its establishment. Hitherto the practice has been for the State in question  to  borrow, not £5,000,000, but perhaps-  £6,000,000,  £7,000,000, or, even £8,000,000, with which to redeem the original loan,, and to enable the State  to carry  out fresh undertakings. New stock is thus created and new bondholders brought into being. Contingent troubles of that kind will be overcome by the alteration which honorable senators are now invited to sanction. </para>

            <para>- This Bill does not seek to alter that portion of the Constitution which gives us the option of taking over the State debts as they existed at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or a proportion thereof, according to the respective numbers of the people of the States as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. That option still remains. But the measure will relieve us of the limitation which now exists to takeover only those debts which were owing at the establishment of the Commonwealth, and it will empower us to take over the whole of the debts at any time that we may propose to enter into an arrangement of the kind. There is just one other feature that I may mention in this connexion. It may be said that hitherto there has been an indisposition on the part of the States to transfer their debts to the Commonwealth. But whilst that may have been so in the past I think that the settlement which has been arrived at under the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill will at once remove that difficulty. In other words the reason why the States objected to transfer their debts to the Commonwealth, largely, if not mainly, arose from the fact that they did not know exactly what their financial position after 1910 would be. </para>

            <para>- I am not to be drawn into dealing with that question. There is just one other point which I know will be raised in reference to this Bill - I refer to the question of future borrowing. Of course, we have no power to limit the future borrowing of the States, but when once the Commonwealth takes over the whole of the State debts it may be assumed, according; to the advice which we have received from the highest financiers in the Mother Country, that we shall be in a position to borrow on so much more advantageous terms than will the States that the latter will necessarily be compelled to borrow through us. That will be the natural result. But this is a matter with which Parliament will have to deal when the proper time arrives. It is one which cannot be consummated without the consent of Parliament. Consequently, when the necessary legislation is introduced for taking over the whole or any part of the State debts - I have no doubt that the whole of them will be taken over - Parliament will have to consider this question in its full, broad, and general aspect. Of course, it is well known to honorable senators that in another place the Bill received practically the unanimous assent of honorable members. I believe that there was only one dissentient, and I have not the slightest doubt that this Chamber will see its way to agree to the measure as it is now introduced. </para>

          <para>. - At this late stage of the session and in the hope that the labours of the present. Parliament will soon terminate, it is not my intention to occupy any considerable time in debating this Bill. That will be the sole reason for the brevity of my remarks. I agree with the view which has been expressed by the Minister of Trade and Customs in respect to the possibility of the Commonwealth being able to borrow with much more advantage to Australia than can any of the States, and consequently it is right that this Parliament should put itself in a position to deal with the loan transactions of the States in the near future. But I very much regret that when the Prime Minister and the other Commonwealth representatives were conferring with the State Premiers, they did not deal with this question as well as with the other financial problem, so that, instead of a mere permissive Bill being submitted to the people - a Bill to which effect may be given 50 or 100 years hence - something definite might have been put before them with a view to ascertaining whether they really desire the Commonwealth to take over the State debts and to control borrowing operations in the future. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think there is any reason to object to the carrying of this measure. But at the same time, I assume that there is no intention to carry out any scheme for taking over the debts of the States, and of curtailing their borrowing powers in future, apart from an express agreement of the States themselves? I have always admitted that the credit of the whole Commonwealth is greater than the credit of a single portion of it. Yet, it is possible to inflict great injury upon a growing State by the curtailment of its power of financing. The States will not readily surrender the power of obtaining further loans. I wish to make it clear that one State, at all events - New South Wales - will very jealously guard her right to borrow for the development of her railways and for other public works. </para>

          <para>. - It is a great pity that a question of such importance was not brought forward at an earlier period of the session. It requires more consideration than it is likely to receive now. There is an idea in the minds of some people that when the Commonwealth takes over the debts of the States, it will relieve the States of responsibility with regard to them. It ought, however, to be known that the Commonwealth does not take over the liability at all. It simply takes over the management of the debts. The idea in so doing is that the Commonwealth will be able to manage those debts more cheaply, and to borrow at a lower rate of interest than any single State can. do. The Minister who introduced the Bill, said that the financial authorities are agreed that the Commonwealth can borrow more cheaply than the States. I have seen that statement contradicted. I should like to ask whether, looking at the financial situation as a whole, the credit of Victoria at the present moment is not better than that of all the other States put together. Victoria, with her low debt, her great resources, her comparatively large population, and her relatively small area, stands in a much stronger financial position than does the Commonwealth as a whole. The principal question affecting the taking over of the debts appears to me to be that of the future borrowing of the States. The States are exceedingly unwilling to give up their power of borrowing. I do not blame them. It would be very unwise to place the development of the various portions of Australia, at the present stage of its history, in the hands of a central Government. Centralization is no new thing in this country. At first we had it throughout the entire continent. Then we had it, more or less, in every one of the States. We have it now in Queensland, where as much as possible of public money, public business, public interest - everything! connected with the State's affairs - is centred in Brisbane. We have it in New South Wales where Sydney is made the one centre for the whole State. It is just the same in Victoria. I do not know so much about South Australia; it appears that there is only one possible outlet to the trade and commerce of that State, and that is Adelaide. In Western Australia centralization has done a good deal of evil work, just as in the other States. </para>

            <para>- I do not lay much stress on sinking funds. While a State is borrowing a sinking fund is more or less ot a farce. If a State has given up borrowing and proceeds to establish a sinking fund to pay off its debt, the policy so pursued is reasonable. Otherwise a sinking fund is of very little consequence. The power of borrowing would undoubtedly not be given up by the States unless under very severe pressure. There are two points .of view regarding this question. There is the Commonwealth point of view, and the State point of view. What is the Commonwealth point of view? The Commonwealth takes over the State debts., and in the ultimate is bound to pay the interest. and redemption. Having taken over the debts, it is also bound to see that the liability of the various States is not unduly increased. Apply this principle to the ordinary transactions of business. Say that a man has liabilities to the extent of £1,000. He calls upon someone to guarantee the interest on that amount. Would it not be a reasonable thing' that the guarantor should require that the debtor should agree not to increase his liabilities without his consent? In this case if the Commonwealth takes over the State debts it mav take up the position of saying: "We become responsible for your debts, but you must give us a guarantee that you will not increase your indebtedness without consulting us." </para>

The people of this State are responsible only for their own debts and the interest" upon them. But if this arrangement is carried out Victoria will be liable not only for her own debts, but also for the debts of every other State of theUnion. </para>

            <para>- That must be the position. Look at it from the States' point of' view. The States say, ' ' Our development, so far as concerns railways and works, is very immature. We still need a large number of railways. We need roads, bridges, and a hundred other public works." Probably they would construct these works by means of loan money. A State might legitimately ask, " If we place our borrowing powers in the hands of the Commonwealth, how is that policy of development' to be carried on?" Take Queensland. That is a large State with a comparatively small population, which, however, is rapidly increasing, and I am glad to say it is likely to increase in still greater volume in the near future. </para>

            <para>- And the richest also, I believe. The debt of Queensland is  £44.000,000.  If her population is doubled, the probability is that her debt may be increased to £100,000,000. If the money were well invested I, for one. should never object. We cannot develop this country without railways, and we cannot build railways - unless we completely change our system of financing - without borrowing. When money is needed for the purpose of carrying out reproductive works I, for one, am not opposed to the raising of a loan. I am taking Queensland as an instance of how public opinion there would be affected if an attempt were made to restrict its borrowing power. The people of that State might very well say, " If we place the power of borrowing in the hands of the Commonwealth that will simply mean that. New South Wales and Victoria, being more populous States, and sending a larger number to the House of Representatives, might be able to block any loan proposals of ours." That might be done through jealousy. We know that sometimes one State becomes Jealous of another. If New South Wales, for instance, saw that Queensland was drawing population over the border by her policy of throwing lands open, and all that sort of thing, she might become envious, and say, "We will stop this exodus." </para>

            <para>- I have always been a State Righter where I thought that it was to the advantage of the States that their rights should be conserved. A man may be in favour of the Commonwealth extending its powers in one direction, and opposed to that being done in another direction. That is what I wish to impress upon the honorable senator. There are many difficulties in the way of settling this question on an amicable basis as between the States and the Commonwealth. The first thing we have to understand is, that if the Commonwealth takes over the debts, the States will benefit more largely than will the Commonwealth by the transaction, because, if the experts are right, there will be a saving in the interest. I do not know that there will be any saving, so far as paying back the principal is concerned, because, on examining a return which was furnished some time ago, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, I find that whereas the interest payable on the debts renewed by Victoria is less, the capital sum of the debts is more. </para>

            <para>- I think it is more than likely it will. In any case, that is a matter which only the future can settle. It will depend very largely on the state of the money market when the conversion is attempted. But there is another aspect of the question which appeals to me very forcibly, and it is that if the Commonwealth takes over the debts, and, as a natural consequence, becomes responsible for the interest, then the payment of  25s.  per head per annum will become an additional subject of dispute between the States and the Commonwealth within a very short period. As I pointed out the other evening, the Commonwealth will have to cast about in one direction or another for added revenue. That must be clear to every one who has given the slightest consideration to the financial position. No matter what happens within the next few years, the States will insist upon keeping the  Commonwealth  to the agreement to pay  25s.  per head per annum. They will have acquired a vested interest in that payment, and the struggle to continue it in perpetuity will, I have no doubt, be a very keen and very bitter one. If any attempt is made by the Commonwealth to impose direct taxation, no matter what form it may take, the Commonwealth will at once be met with the objection that that field of taxation is a State preserve, and ought not to be invaded. So that if the State Governments can bring it about, the Commonwealth will be compelled to look to Customs and Excise for any additional revenue which it may require. And that being the case, the question is indissolubly involved with the industrial life of Australia, because upon the kind of Tariff we have will, so far as I can see, hinge very largely the development of this country. I look upon the Bill, therefore, as being important from that point of view, and a very great deal, I think, will depend upon the kind of representatives we may have in future Parliaments. The great national struggle within the next few years will be on the subject of direct as against indirect taxation - between those who wish to raise money from Customs and Excise, and those who desire to lift some portion of the heavy burden which now lies upon the shoulders of the people, and to tax wealth rather than poverty. I make these few remarks to show that, so far as I am concerned, this is not the simple question which it appears to be upon the surface ; that other questions of very much greater consequence to the people of Australia than even this is are involved, and that, to my mind, the industrial and social development of this continent will depend very much upon the method adopted in the ultimate settlement of it. </para>

          <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is endeavouring to jump a fence before it is reached, because this is not a Bill to take over specific debts. The Constitution enabled the Commonwealth to take over the State debts as existing in 1900, but since then the position has changed. This is simply a permissive Bill, under which the Commonwealth will have power to take over, not only the pre-Federation debts, but also debts which have been incurred since then or which may be incurred hereafter. But before any step in that direction can be taken, there must be a Bill passed to define particularly what the Commonwealth proposes to do, and then, of course, the question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has raised to-day will naturally come up for discussion. As we have not arrived at that stage, I do not propose to discuss the matter. </para>

          <para>. - I have some doubt as to whether the extra power which the Commonwealth is seeking to acquire is stated in sufficient detail. Since Federation the Commonwealth has had power to take over the State debts as existing in 1900, or a proportion of them ; but the question is whether it has the right to take over State debts individually and in a piecemeal way. I hold that if a particular State debt is about to fall due, the Commonwealth should have full power to intervene and exchange Commonwealth bonds for the State bonds and see whether such a business transaction would be advantageous. </para>

            <para>- That seems to me to be very bad business. From time to time State debentures have fallen due, amounting in one case, I think, to between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000. In that case, if we had possessed sufficient power, we could have taken over that debt and ascertained whether an advantage would result from the conversion ; in other words, whether the Commonwealth credit would insure cheaper borrowing of money. If we take up any financial newspaper which quotes the prices of State debentures, we can gauge the average value of the various stocks on their term and rate of interest. If a particular debt which was falling due were transferred to the Commonwealth and an advantage was secured by the transaction, in comparison with the average price of all other debentures, we would get something like a test as to whether the Commonwealth credit was better than that of the individual States. Undoubtedly a joint and several bond ought to be better than the individual bond of a State, but we find a great diversity in the prices of stock. What the reason of that may be, I do not know. </para>

            <para>- I am referring to stocks at the same rate of interest, and with the same currency. Whether there may be a fashionable stock in finance or not, I do not know. But we find frequently that the stocks of some States are more valuable than those of others. There is a false idea in the public mind as to the amount of the State indebtedness. I think that the plan of reckoning the public debts of the States on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis is  altogether wrong. If Queensland had only a few thousand inhabitants to-morrow, it would have far more resources to pay its indebtedness than would Tasmania with a population of 180,000 persons. </para>

            <para>- No; but when a State has such great natural resources as, say, Queensland, it has a right to borrow, not merely on the credit of the number of individuals who happen to be there at a particular time, but to a certain extent on that credit plus the possession of enormous resources. I could have wished, when this alteration of the Constitution was proposed, that power would have been sought for this Parliament to take over the State debts piecemeal, as we might in that way have ascertained what I think we ought to know - that is, the financial credit of the Commonwealth as a whole as compared with that of the separate States. </para>

          <para>- I should like to say a word or two on this important measure, which may affect the borrowing of £200,000,000 or of from £240,000,000 to £250,000,000. I quite understand that this is a permissive Bill; that the people of Australia are to be asked, if they think fit, to enable this Parliament to take over, not a portion only, but the whole of the debts of the States. I regard the measure, at this stage, in the light of an abstract resolution, and I shall not oppose it. But, while I shall not oppose the submission of this matter to the people by referendum, I wish it to be distinctly understood that the advice which I shall give the people of Queensland, and the votes which I may hereafter cast in the Senate, will depend entirely upon the nature of the scheme' proposed for the transfer of the State debts. A disturbing factor in the consideration of this question has been the fact that the various schemes which have been proposed from time to time for the taking over of the State debts have, in my opinion, been ridiculously unsound. They would be prejudicial to the States, and probably also to the Commonwealth. If I thought that the present or any future Parliament were to be bound in any way to give effect to any of those schemes, I should not assent to the second reading of this Bill. The Minister of Trade and Customs, speaking on behalf of the Government, has explained that by the referendum proposed, the opinion of the people is to be sought as to the desirable ness of this Parliament taking over a portion or the whole of the State debts, and that it is to be left to the people, and to this Parliament afterwards, to say whether they will approve of the machinery proposed for the purpose. It must be understood, therefore, that the position I take up in connexion with this measure is to be regarded as without prejudice to anything I may think if desirable to do hereafter when a concrete scheme for the transfer of the State debts is proposed. If the people agree to amend the Constitution in the way proposed in this Bill, I hope that the Government will proceed at once to have a thorough investigation made into the whole question. Any scheme that may be submitted to Parliament as a result of that investigation must be dealt with upon its merits. But so far as the proposal to take over the debts of the States may be said to indicate a desire to interfere in any way with the borrowing powers of the States, I shall be prepared to resist it, and' to advise the people to resist it I shall advise the people to be very careful not to diminish in any way the powers at present possessed by the State Parliaments to carry out a borrowing policy. I shall ask the people of Queensland to be on their guard against any proposal which would interfere with the borrowing powers of the State Parliaments. I recognise that there is not the slightest attempt being made in this Bill to interfere with the borrowing powers of the State Parliaments. </para>

          <para>- I think We may assume that the State Premiers and the Federal Government, in agreeing to the appointment of the Commission, expected that it would bring about some practical result, and I am endeavouring to find out what would happen if the Commission reported that it would not be advisable for the Commonwealth to take over the debts of the States. We must remember that various opinions, are held on this subject, and some weighty financial authorities contend that the credit of at least some of the States is as good, if not superior, to that of the Commonwealth. My own opinion is that once the Commonwealth became established as a borrower on the London market, Commonwealth stock would be regarded as having a broader security than the stock of any individual State. The late Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J.</inline> H. Carruthers, was strongly of opinion that no advantage would be gained by the taking over of the State debts by the Commonwealth. He even questioned our power under the Constitution to take over the debts of the States. If the Commission to which I have referred reports that no advantage is to be gained by the taking over of the State debts by the Commonwealth, then we are indulging now in a little legislative pastime which can lead to no practical result. In any case, I intend to help in the passing of this Bill, because I think, it is worth our while to see whether we cannot economize in connexion with our loans. If we can accept the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, we have been quite indifferent to our own interests in not having taken action in this matter long ago. The right honorable gentleman has estimated that by the consolidation of the £202,000,000 of State debts outstanding when the, Federation was established, we could effect a saving in interest of no less than £26,000,000 in the course of fifty years by securing a reduction of J per cent, in the interest charged upon the loans. If we could effect such a saving in fifty years, when the last of these State loans would fall due, that should of itself be sufficient to induce us to pass this measure, and secure for the Commonwealth Parliament the authority to take over the State debts. On the question of interfering with the borrowing powers of the State, I think that we should have to institute some form of supervision over their borrowing powers. </para>

We must have money. I have got this great Coolgardie Water Scheme on, and although I have not commenced it, it will ruin the country and ruin the Government not to go on with it." They said, " It is impossible to place a loan for you on the market ; we can give you an overdraft of£500,000, but no more." I said, "Can I go anywhere else?" They said, " You can go where you like to try if you can get the money." At that time Victoria could not touch the market at all, and the market was practically closed to all Australia. </para>

            <para>- In some of the States money has been borrowed for which there was absolutely no warrant. I believe that, as a necessary complement to taking over the indebtedness of the States, some body should be created upon which the States and the Commonwealth should be represented, to control future borrowing. Then, if the States exceeded proper bounds, that body would be able to say to them, " We believe that you are indulging in a wild-cat policy of borrowing - a policy which will inevitably make its effect felt when the Commonwealth approaches the London money market for loans with which to carry out necessary works." We cannot logically take over the indebtedness of Australia for the purpose of securing an increased advantage to the taxpayers of this country unless we devise some means of preventing a reversion to that foolish policy which has been so much in evidence in the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is one who is well skilled in the art of finance. He has stated that he has even written articles upon the subject. I am sure he will admit that in years past State Governments have embarked upon a wild career of loan finance. Recognising the ill effects which flow from such a policy, it should be incumbent upon the Commonwealth to interfere whenever any State or States attempted to borrow money to the detriment of Australia. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator did not suffer as I did when, in the early nineties, about150,000 men were thrown out of work as the result of the State Governments having the London market closed to them except by the payment of ruinous rates, consequent upon the extravagant borrowing policy which they had previously adopted. I wish to prevent a recurrence of that. Of course, I recognise that it is, a difficult thing to get <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> to profit by past bitter experience. If I should occupy a seat in this Chamber when it is seriously proposed to take over the State debts, I shall not sanction, either by my voice or my vote, taking over any portion of that indebtedness unless some check be imposed upon the future borrowing capacity of the States. In their own interests some such check is necessary. If a Council of Finance were created, as has been suggested, no State or combination of States would ever dream of standing in the way of another State which was using borrowed money wisely in the development of its own territory. But it is an old saying that a burnt child dreads the fire, and I venture to say that if in the future the State Governments were permitted to embark upon a foolish public works policy, thousands of persons would be compelled to leave Australia. I shall support the Bill, but I hope we shall see that in the future the States do not launch upon a wild-cat loan policy such as that ot which we were witnesses in the early nineties. </para>

But the point which we have now to consider is how that may best be done. It is not proposed that-we should take over all the debts at once. We must take them over on such dates as they mature. </para>

          <para>. - In this Bill it is not proposed to do anything at all. It merely asks that the Commonwealth shall be empowered by the people to do something. It is within the knowledge of everybody that the Constitution Act contains a provision that the Commonwealth, of its own volition, may assume responsibility for the whole of the State debts as they existed at the establishment of the Federation. But it makes no provision for future borrowings by the States or for taking over further debts which may have been contracted bv them. I agree that this Bill is necessary. If we are to take over any of the debts of. the States, we ought to be vested with power to take over the whole nf those debts. I do not think it is wise to take' over a portion of them and to allow another portion to be retained by the States. <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> discussing a Bill of this kind, it is necessary that we should clearly understand what is to be the future policy of the Commonwealth. I have no desire to "ee the Commonwealth take over a single shilling of the debts of the States unless some restriction can be imposed upon their power of future borrowing. I wish to give an illustration of what might be a good course for us to pursue. In Queensland the State- Government is the sole borrowing authority. It borrows not only sufficient for its own requirements, but also sufficient for the requirements of the various local authorities, such as Waterworks Boards, Harbor Boards, Municipal Councils, Shires, and other local concerns. It seems to me that the Commonwealth might very well follow the example of Queensland in this connexion. In that State, too, the local authorities can borrow only in proportion to their revenue, and the purposes for which any money is borrowed must be approved by the central Government. After it has been borrowed, the authority for whom it is borrowed must not only pay the interest upon it, but a sufficient sum to wipe out the total indebtedness within a specified period - a period which varies from twenty - eight to forty years. I think that that is a very good principle. If the Commonwealth is going to take over the State debts, a similar principle should be applied to the future borrowings of the States. If by taking over those debts we are merely going to assume a burden of £250,000,060 and allow the States to go in for another saturnalia of borrowing, no good whatever will result. On the other hand, if we are going to consolidate the State debts, and thus effect a saving which will effectually extinguish them, I am entirely at one with that policy. But [ wish to point out that the proposal to take over the whole of the State debts does not find much favour with the Premiers. Apparently all of them wish to hug those debts to their bosoms as if they were something which invested them with importance in the eyes of the world. But I desire to view this matter from the point of view of the people of Australia. The people occupy a very precarious position in regard to these debts, because, as a matter of fact, the works upon which this £250,000,000 has been expended do not return sufficient to pav the total interest bill. Queensland has to contribute £750,000 annually out of general taxation to meet the shortage of interest upon money which has been borrowed by that State. Most of the other States have also to make up a deficiency in interest. The result is that a portion of the people are unduly taxed to make good a benefit derived by another section of the community. I do not think that is wise. With the exception of Western Australia, I doubt if any State in the Commonwealth has made provision for wiping out the debts. </para>

            <para>- I would not contradict the honorable senator, but probably I should not believe him. It has been calculated that if the Commonwealth took over and consolidated the debts of the States, and saved J per cent, in the total interest payable, it would be able, by devoting that saving to a sinking fund, to wipe out the whole of the present indebtedness of Australia in sixty years. Every one must admit that that would be a. most desirable thing to accomplish. A further calculation has been made, and is .authentically correct, that if we could save <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> per cent, per annum on the amount qf interest now payable on the ,£250-000-000 of debt, and devoted the saving to a sinking fund, we should wipe out the existing debt in eighty-seven years. </para>

            <para>- If as the result of consolidating the debts of the States, we simply permitted them to indulge in another saturnalia of borrowing, the benefit to the taxpayers would not be very great. Therefore I believe that when the debts are taken over some restriction should be imposed upon the borrowing of the Commonwealth. That restriction need not take a harsh form. We might adopt the principle which has been pursued by the States in connexion with their local authorities. In Queensland a local authority is allowed to borrow through the central Government, provided they make provision for interest and a certain payment to a sinking fund to wipe out the debt in forty years. If that principle were adopted by the Commonwealth in relation to the States, I do not think any one would have any objection to their borrowing on an unlimited scale, because" they could not afford to spend the borrowed money on other than absolutely reproductive works. A very great advantage would thus accrue. In the first place, we should not be taxing the people one iota; secondly, we should be saving the taxpayers a considerable amount of money ; and, thirdly, we should enhance the credit of the Commonwealth very considerably, and that would result in greater savings in the near future. But these benefits can only be secured if borrowing be accompanied by an adequate sinking fund. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> during the earlier part of my speech took occasion to contradict a statement of mine to the effect that the only State in the Commonwealth which had anything in the nature of a sinking fund worth talking about was Western Australia. He said that New South Wales had several sinking funds. </para>

            <para>- Probably: The total sinking fund amounts to  £223,001.  Honorable senators must not overlook that  £1  ! It is very important ! South Australia has a much 'better sinking fund; but <inline font-style="italic">Western</inline> Australia is the only State which has anything like an adequate one. With a total indebtedness of  £20,500,000,  she has a sinking fund of nearly  £2,000,000.  In face of those figures, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will admit that he was not justified in contradicting my statement. I shall vote for the second reading of this Bill. I believe that it is much better for us to take- over the total indebtedness of the States rather than those which existed at the time of Federation. But I shall do my level best, whether inside or outside the Commonwealth Parliament, to provide that in connexion with all future borrowings there shall be  a  sinking fund that is adequate and effective. </para>

        <para class="block">I shall not give my consent to the borrowing of a single farthing except on that condition. There has been too much borrowing in the past, which has led to wasteful extravagance, and in some cases to corruption. Works have been constructed which could not by any stretch of imagination be regarded as reproductive. All sorts of wild-cat schemes have been entered upon, and there have been inevitable times of depression together with foolish booms, owing to undue borrowing. All these evils can be avoided without retarding the development of Australia in the slightest degree. Therefore, while I am in favour of the Bill, i wish it to be distinctly understood that I only vote for it because I believe that if the power for which we are now asking is properly and wisely administered we can wipe out the present indebtedness of Australia and restrict the total indebtedness which will be placed upon the people in future. </para>

          <para>-53]- - There is but one point to which I desire to address myself, and I mention it because several honorable senators have referred to- a subject which, it seems to me, does not properly arise in connexion with the Bill. The point is that a limitation should be placed upon State borrowing if the Commonwealth exercises the power for which this Bill asks. I merely desire to say, lest it should be assumed that all the members of the party to which I belong hold that view, that I do not. I should be prepared to leave the States absolutely free as to their future borrowing. If we cannot secure an advantage by the taking over of the debts of the Commonwealth, there is no reason why we should take them over. The only reason I have ever entertained for wishing to take them over is that it is assumed, rightly or wrongly, that the Commonwealth will be able to borrow cheaper. If we can borrow cheaper, would the taxpayers of any State allow their Government to go into the money market independently and pay more for their money? I do not think that there is the slightest need for any restriction. If what we assume is going to be realized there will be no need to place a restriction upon the States. Therefore, my view is that the States should be left absolutely free. </para>

I believe that the absence of such legislation has prevented the Department from granting many pensions in New South Wales which otherwise would have been granted. 1 am under the impression that Western Australia has an Act which was copied from the New South Wales Act creating the Miners Accident Relief Fund.

          <para>.- As the Minister does not seem to be very clear as to the exact reason for bringing in this Bill, I suggest that we ought to have a definite understanding before it is passed. In Bendigo we have a Miners Accident Fund called the Watson Miners Sustentation Fund, which was started by a gentleman with an annual subscription of £150 for ten years. It is maintained by contributions from the miners and outside subscriptions. I want it to be made very clear that the principle which it is desired to apply to the Miners Accident Relief Fund of New South Wales shall also apply not only to the fund I mentioned, but to all funds throughout Australia for the benefit of miners. It is quite possible that in Western Australia and other States there may not be cases parallel with the three cases which have arisen in New South Wales, but there is no doubt that as time goes on such cases will arise. It would be a great pity if any cases of that kind were to arise in recess, because they could not be dealt with for at least six months. I ask the Minister to cause an inquiry to be made so that before the third reading of the Bill is moved, he may be in a position to assure the Senate  that there will be no cases arising in any part of Australia which cannot be dealt  with under its provisions. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) [8.10]. - I have been rather taken aback by the uncertainty of the Minister's statement. If some one is sent to " devil" amongst the Statutes in the Library, it should not take more than half-an-hour to discover whether there are any other funds of this kind in existence in any of the States. If  there are, they should be included in this Bill. We do not want to make a perfect patchwork quilt of our old-age pension legislation, nor do we want to pass a measure which will not cover  payments  from all funds of this kind, as that might mean that certain applications for old-age pensions could not be properly dealt with until next session. It would be a great pity to pass this Bill without feeling absolutely assured that it will meet the conditions existing in all of the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> seems to think that because no claims in connexion with a similar difficulty have arisen in Western Australia that is a proof that there is no legislation in that State which would affect the matter in the same way. We know that great delay has occurred in the issue of pension certificates in Western Australia, and it is only recently that any large number have been issued in that State. In the circumstances, I cannot agree that, because no claims raising this difficulty have come under  review bv the Registrar of Pensions in Western Australia, that is a proof that  no  legislation similar tr&gt; that of the Miners Accident Relief Act of New South Wales has been passed in Western Australia. I shall be glad to support the Bill, though I would have preferred that it should have dealt with a matter to which I called attention before, when I proposed to give a. wider scope to individual thrift than is given by the existing Act. Under the New South Wales Old-age Pensions <inline font-style="italic">Act</inline> allowance was made for property up to the value °f <inline font-style="italic">£w°&gt;</inline> but under the Commonwealth Act allowance is made only for property of the value of £100. T think that this matter might have been dealt with in this Bill.  and  if it were not so late in the session I should be prepared to move for an instruction to the Committee on the Bill to amend it in the direction I have indicated. At this late stage of the session I am afraid it would be useless to move in that way. </para>

I' see that the New South Wales Miners Accident Relief Fund is specially singled' out for exemption under the Bill. But 1 am aware of my own knowledge that in Western Australia there is an accident fund connected with the coal-mining industry, and provided for under the Coal Mines Regulation Act. The fund is not precisely the same as the " Miners Accident Relief Fund of New South Wale,. The Government of Western Australia does n;t contribute any portion of the fund. It is made up of a contribution by the coal-mine proprietors of one  halfpenny  per ton on all marketable coal raised, and by a  contribution  of 6d. per week from all miners employed in the industry. Under the law provision is made for an allowance from the fund in case of accident of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per week during total incapacity. </para>

            <para>- I wish to know whether, in the event of a man who has been maimed for life by an accident in a Western Australian coal mine, and who is receiving £1 per week from the fund to which I have referred, that would be considered as income which might prevent the payment of an old-age pension in full. If the Minister is not clear on that point. I suggest that it would be well to delay the passing of this measure. </para>

I cannot speak definitely ; but it would seem to me that the case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> would be covered by the provisions of the existing Act. I admit that it is not a complete answer; but it is some proof that no fund similar to the Miners Accident Relief Fund of New South Wales exists in New South Wales, that this question has not been raised in connexion with any application for an old-age pension in that State. Under the existing Act, the income of a claimant for an old-age pension from any source must be accounted for. A pensioner is not with that income to receive more than  £52  per annum, and under the Act " income " is defined in this way -  " Income " means any moneys valuable consideration or profits earned derived or received by any person for his own use or benefit by any means from any source whatever, whether in or out of the Commonwealth, and shall be deemed to include personal earnings, but not any payment - </para>

If there be no objection I should like to say a word or two upon the amendment which has just been read. It proposes to substitute three Electoral Commissioners for one for the purpose of distributing the States into divisions. Honorable senators will recollect that when the Electoral Bill was before the Senate this matter was very fully debated, and I think I am correct in saying that opinions were very much divided as to the advisableness of appointing one or three Commissioners for this very important work. I do not wish to say anything which can be construed into a reflection upon any gentleman who has been appointed to discharge this duty. But in these great Australian States, which possess such enormous areas and in which so many matters have to be considered, it has been thought by the other Chamber that the element of safety would be secured: if, instead of intrusting this work to one individual, it were intrusted to three. </para>

          <para>. - The substitution of "five" for "seven" in the amendment made by another place, refers to the distance from a polling-place which it is necessary an elector shall be to establish his right to vote by post. There is no particular virtue in a number, and five miles has simply been submitted as a compromise. In the principal Act of 1902 the limit was fixed at five miles, but under the amending. Act of 1905 an endeavour was made to increase the distance to ten miles. The Senate agreed to the ten-miles limit, but the House of Representatives reduced it to seven miles. In the Bill which is now under consideration the limit of seven miles was continued by the Senate, but in the other Chamber an effort was made to reduce it to three miles. The Minister therefore agreed to a compromise of five miles, which seems to me to represent the mean as between conflicting opinions.I therefore ask the Committee to accept it, and accordingly move - </para>

          <para>. - I  see no  reason  to find  fault with this new clause. It was inserted at the instance  of  a member  of  the Labour party, and  it  seems  to me to  commend itself  to  common sense. In the first place,  it  provides that any person who wilfully disturbs a public meeting shall  be  liable  to  punishment. Now that the matter has been put  in  that way I can  see no  objection  to  the proposition. In a Democratic country public meetings are essential  to  enable candidates to explain their views, seeing that the object  of  their candidature  is to  obtain votes, not for themselves, but  in  support  of  the views which they advocate. It  is  not possible for them  to do  that unless they are allowed freedom to continue their addresses without interruption. The only persons to whom the clause will apply will be persons who attend a public meeting for the express purpose of preventing a mari from enunciating his views. It seems te me that unless there are any open advocates for disturbing public meetings, this clause ought to find a ready acceptance at the hands of the Committee. I move - </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MCGREGOR</inline>(South Australia) £8.40]. - I hope that this amendment will be rejected, but not because I object to punish persons who wilfully disturb public meetings. I think that that is a very wrong thing to do. But in the administration of our Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act the greatest difficulty experienced is in interpreting the duties of certain individuals such as police officers and magistrates. If a person at an election meeting interjected, or asked questions, or did some other perfectly legitimate thing, he might, nevertheless, in the opinion of a policeman or of the  chairman,  or of a magistrate, be guilty of an offence. A magistrate might so determine in consequence of what he had had for breakfast. We have been able to get on very well in the past at political meetings without a stringent provision of this 'kind. Were I addressing a political meeting and could not carry the audience with me, I should consider that I ought to " shut up." That is good advice to any candidate. Those who address political meetings ought to be able, by their common sense, to command attention. An individual may, however, mount a platform and insult the intelligence of the audi,ence to such an extent that they would be provoked to interrupt, and nearly every one of them might render themselves liable to the penalties imposed by this clause. </para>

            <para>- It may be annoying to be prevented from addressing a meeting, but, nevertheless, this is a dangerous clause to insert. We do not know how it will operate. It would be a pity to introduce such an innovation. The honorable member of another place who originated the clause is such an extraordinary character that we always expect something out of the common from him. But the provision comes to us with a bad recommendation, and is entirely unnecessary. It would amount to a declaration that Australian public meetings are the most disorderly in the world, because  1  do not know of any country in which there is a similar law. </para>

Any disorderliness that is likely to occur at a public meeting may well be left to the crowd itself. It is surely superfluous to make. an elector liable to a £5 penalty or a month's imprisonment for endeavouring to elicit information. </para>

            <para>- The clause places too much power in the hands of magistrates, who are usually partisans. An unruly interjector may safely be left to the crowd itself. The effect of a crowd upon an interjector who really has nothing to interject about is wonderful. We can, however, easily imagine a public man to be so unpopular by reason of his political career as to be deserving of severe treatment at the hands of the electors. I remember a Minister of the Crown who was not allowed to speak for two hours at a public meeting in Western Australia. </para>

            <para>- I remember the time when the daily newspapers of Queensland used to have big headings pointing out where audiences had risen and prevented Labour men from speaking. I recognise that if the people in a constituency cannot vote down a man it is of no use to try to howl him down. The clause as it stands is an unwarrantable interference with the rights of the people. There is nobody who will deny that any person at  a  public meeting has the right to say " Hear, hear," or to cheer. Undoubtedly he also has the right to express disapproval by; hooting. </para>

            <para>- The audience could cheer continuously for two hours and' thus prevent the delivery of the speech. It has often been reported that a celebrated orator was unable for several minutes to address the meeting because of the cheers being renewed again and again. If cheers are renewed often enough that will as effectually prevent a man from speaking  as  would hooting.

            <para>- The honorable senator cannot have the right to accept admiration on the one hand, and the right to fine the man who disapproves of him on the other. I hold that in fairness the clause should not be allowed to stand. It is only once in three years that the electors have an opportunity to express their opinions about their representatives, and the clause is a distinct blow at the exercise of that right. We are asked to say, " We are superior to the people. We have the right to blackguard the people; to sail into Parliament under false pretences and then sell them," as many honorable senators have done, but the electors have not the right to say a word, not even to " Boo," when their suffrages are sought. Apparently the Parliament wants to have the people not only handcuffed, but even tongue-tied. At one time my honorable friends want to put a financial strait-jacket on the people, and at. another time to put a gag on them at political meetings. It is a ridiculous clause. </para>

          <para>. - I have been in Australia for many years and have attended a fairly large number of political meetings, but I have never observed the necessity for enacting a provision of this character. We have managed to get along very well so far without it. Whether it is meant as an auxiliary to other legislation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has assisted to pass, I do not know. It appears to me to be offering a direct insult to the people. It practically tells them that they are not capable of judging what is proper conduct at a public gathering. </para>

            <para>- No. The clause will place in the hands of one man the right to say whether a person has exceeded the limits of proper conduct at a public meeting. The  chairman  of a meeting composed of 2,000 or 3,000 persons will be asked to say whether the penalty shall be enforced against 500 or 600, who, in the opinion of some individual, have been misconducting themselves, although probably they might have had just cause for making ten times as much disturbance as they did. Not long ago in the Old Country, particularly in Ireland, if two men happened to be disorderly, they were " run in " at once. Are my honorable friends getting afraid of their own legislation and their own conduct, now that they are on the eve of a general election, when they will be called upon to justify themselves to the people? Are they endeavouring, by means of the gag, to prevent the people from expressing what they think of their legislators, or are they merely trying to gratuitously insult the people? </para>

            <para>- The Bill is now in charge of the Minister, and it is from him I want to know who is to judge as to what is proper conduct at a public meeting. If a man is saying something which I think is "tommy-rot," I have a perfect right to tell him that it is. Or if he is trying to deceive me, I have a perfect right to tell him that I think he is a deceiver. No law ought to prevent me from addressing such a remark to a representative in a public place. </para>

            <para>- My experience here is that sometimes the man who is listening is the best judge of what is "tommy-rot." In my opinion the persons present at a public meeting have a right to express themselves as they desire. I believe that whenever there has been a disturbance at a public meeting in Australia there has always been a just cause for it. I hope that the Committee will not pass the clause. </para>

I have an idea that, although it may have been moved in another place by a particular honorable member, its genesis is to be found some where else.

            <para>- I do. I frankly say that when the present Government go before the enraged electors of Australia the power to impose a  £5  fine will not prevent some of their meetings from being disorderly. Does any one believe that it would be possible to prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> from interjecting at a meeting addressed by a Labour candidate ? The honorable senator would not be present at such a meeting for ten minutes before he would be liable to a month's imprisonment under this clause. Treating the matter seriously, any member of this Senate might be present at a meeting held by a candidate to whose past political career he might think it right to refer. He might feel perfectly justified in putting a legitimate question to the candidate on the subject. We have to remember that a candidate who knows anything at all of electioneering will take very good care that the  chairman  of his meeting, if biased at all, shall be biased in his favour. </para>

He would prefer that the incident should be buried. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> would' persist, would rise again and again with his question, the  chairman  might call him to order, and then his name might be taken by a policeman, and an information lodged against him. The case would go before a justice of the peace, and we know that in most instances justices of the peace owe appointments to their fealty to a certain political party. Who would be the witnesses called? The  chairman  of the meeting would come forward and give evidence, and the man in the dock would be the man who defied him. How could the  chairman  of the meeting be considered an impartial witness ? </para>

            <para>- I frankly say that I believe that at the next general elections there will be some very stormy meetings. I have heard of disturbances at public meetings. Only a little while ago a public meeting was called at the Melbourne Town Hall, which was addressed by the Minister of Trade and Customs. That was a meeting attended by leading citizens, persons who would expect to be called right-thinking citizens, and who were eminently respectable. _ A certain proposition was put to the meeting, and a perfectly respectable young man got up and in an orderly fashion walked towards the platform and asked leave to put an amendment to the meeting. We have all heard of British fair play, and the right of free speech, but what happened to this young man who was conforming with the usual practice of public meetings? He was thrown neck and crop from the platform by men who in this city are supposed to be the guardians of law and order. He was booted from one end of the hall to the other, and eventually pushed out of the hall and on to the footpath, and the man who got up to second hi.s amendment was treated in the same fashion. I suppose if the  chairman  of that meeting had subsequently been brought before a bench of justices of the peace for disturbing the peace, every member of the bench would have had an apoplectic fit. Yet it was the  chairman  of the meeting who disturbed the peace, and not the man who tried in an orderly way to submit an amendment. We have to remember that this clause would be brought into operation at a time when party feeling was running high. No justification has been given for the insertion of such a provision, and its existence in- our law would be more likely to generate disorder than to prevent it. I believe that the imposition of a fine or the committal of a person to prison under it would be nothing less than an outrage. Honorable senators opposite have, by their interjections, suggested that it is the Labour party that is going to suffer under this clause. </para>

I should like to put this view before the Committee. The only opportunity which the average elector has of eliciting information directly from a man seeking election is at election times. His only opportunity of bringing the past political history of the candidate before his fellow electors is at election times. </para>

            <para>- Honorable senators talk of men being stifled and not being allowed to speak. But at election times the daily press stifle men every day of the week. What did the daily press of Victoria do at the last Federal election? Is it not a fact that, so far as they could, they prevented the electors of Victoria from knowing that there were any Labour candidates in the field? They did not publish the names of Labour candidates as amongst those seeking election. Is it not a fact that they did not publish a line of the speeches of Labour candidates, and that, so far as they could, they gagged every candidate who dared to come forward in the interests of Labour? Will honorable senators opposite support a similar clause for the punishment of the press who stifle and gag candidates for election ? </para>

            <para>- I do not care who proposed it. It is very extreme and very foolish: My experience is that there is always some cause for disturbances that take place at political meetings. I remind the Committee that a visitor to a recent Congress held in Australia stated, as the result of his experience of the Melbourne Cup crowd of over 100,000 people, that in his opinion the Australian people are amongst the most orderly to be met with in any part of the world. Every one must agree that our Australian citizens are well-behaved. But, at some meetings men become almost frantic, who, on ordinary occasions, are amongst the most mild-mannered of our citizens. This is often due to the fact that they must give expression to their resentment at some of the utterances of a candidate. On one occasion, a few years ago, the then Premier of Victoria was not permitted to utter a word at a public meeting in the suburbs of Melbourne. Next day the newspapers referred to the bad behaviour of those present at the meeting, but they did not report the opening remarks of the candidate, who deliberately set the meeting on its hind legs by addressing those present as " insects." One honorable senator has said that he believes this clause is necessary, because he has been howled down. I remember that a candidate at the last Senate election in this State quoted the report of another candidate's speech. It was incorrect, and he was. howled down by the audience. He asked why the audience howled at him, and a young man explained that the report be quoted was not a correct report of the statement of the rival candidate on the previous night. The candidate in question then apologized to the audience and to the rival candidate for having misquoted him. He publicly apologized, and said that he thanked them for the correction. But he made the same statement at eighty more meetings held in Victoria. Who is going to interpret the meaning of "disorderly conduct "? Is it not " disorderly conduct " at a public meeting for a body of100 or 200 men to unanimously hoot a candidate? Again, indignation is frequently aroused at public meetings by the political twister - the man who will not give a direct answer to a question. I have heard honorable senators in this chamber boast of how they have misled the electors. I say that the electors, at least, have a right to expect candidates to be truthful. If it were possible for me to control individuals, no political supporter of mine would ever make a noise at a public meeting of my opponent, because I recognise that the best way to create sympathy for a candidate is to raise a clamour against him. Some gentlemen are in this Parliament to-day merely because they were never permitted to give expression to their political opinions. Who usually presides at public meetings?" A few moments ago the Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that he knew of no instance in which partisans occupied the chair. Personally, I think I should be cute enough not to permit a political opponent to preside at any meeting of mine. Yesterday's Melbourne papers contained an accusation by the  chairman  of the bench at Footscray, that a couple of political appointments had recently, been made to the magistracy. To-night the Attorney-General of this State practically contradicts that statement. But those who live in the district, and know the circumstances, are quite satisfied that the appointments in question are of a political character. Do we not all know that justices are generally appointed on the nomination of the local member of Parliament? Yet under this clause these gentlemen would be called upon to determine what was " disorderly conduct." I do not object to the  chairman  of a public meeting being called upon to decide this question simply because he is a partisan. I hold that a man who has no political opinions is not a man at all. </para>

            <para>- The  chairman,  the leader of the meeting, the man who is responsible for maintaining order at the meeting. When I first came forward as a candidate for Parliamentary honours my opinions were not known, and at my second meeting a band of music was stationed outside the door of the hall which I had engaged to prevent me from being heard. I waited for half-an-hour, and ultimately my opponent was persuaded to ask the band which he had engaged to move a few doors further on. But notwithstanding that experience, I obtained a good many votes in that portion of the constituency. That was my first experience of the necessity which exists for empowering the  chairman  of a public meeting to punish persons who create disorder at such meetings. I hope that the Government will adhere to the clause. </para>

          <para>. - I should not have risen but for the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who said that this clause was probably introduced by the Government because in its absence they, feared to meet the enraged electors of Australia. In the first place it has not been introduced by the Government, and,' in the second, the Government do not fear to meet the electors. No orderly man in Australia need fear the adoption of this provision. The only persons who have reason to fear it are those who are deliberately disorderly at public meetings. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has declared that a candidate is sometimes to blame for the disorder which occurs at the meeting which he is addressing. I admit that. Candidates do make statements in regard to parties which they ought not to make. But sometimes it happens that a candidate, by uttering the bitterest of truths in regard to a party, impels those who do not like his statements to create a disturbance in order to prevent them from going forth to the people. Who is to be the judge of what is " disorderly conduct " in a case of that sort? Obviously the  chairman  of the gathering. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has stated that his reason for resisting this clause is that he does not think there is a bench in Australia which would do justice to the accused in such circumstances. </para>

          <para>.- I regret that the Government have seen fit to support the amendment now under discussion. It is altogether unnecessary, and also too elastic in its terms. During the life of the Commonwealth, there has never been a demand from the people for legislation of this kind. I am not aware that there is such a provision in the legislation of any country. It is true that election meetings are at times more or less sultry ; but no bones have been broken, and I have not heard of any serious damage being done to any one. </para>

            <para>- I 'da not remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid has ever complained, or tried to pass legislation of so harsh a character for his own protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> supports the clause on the ground that on one occasion when he was addressing an election meeting, there was a band of music outside the hall. Probably that band was more useful in attracting a larger audience than would otherwise have been in attendance. But if .the musical folk of Tasmania are inclined to serenade the honorable senator, how will this amendment protect him ? The band can play outside his meeting "till the cows come home," and the new clause will not penalize them. If it were strictly interpreted, political meetings in this country would either become too funereal for endurance, or - the gaols would not be large enough to hold those who would be punished for giving vent to their feelings. Too much power is proposed to be given to the chairmen of meetings, and benches of magistrates. At meetings called by the party to which I belong, we have never objected to any interjection, nor have we ever had to resort to the expedient of holding meetings to which admission was by- ticket. Those who do that confess themselves afraid to meet the people who are opposed to them. </para>

            <para>- That is another insult to the people at whom this amendment is aimed. Not long ago, a meeting in Melbourne was addressed by the Prime Minister and his followers. Admission was by ticket. Afterwards, a meeting was held by the Labour party in the very same building. It was crowded to the doors, and there was good order from beginning Lo end. When the present Government was formed, we invited Ministerial supporters to hold meetings throughout the country in opposition to those which we were holding. They declined the challenge, because they know that the pulse of the people was against them. It is because they fear that at the next election the people will give public expression to their views regarding the Fusion Government and its supporters, that this amendment is being supported. </para>

The amendment puts into the hands of magistrates a power to be exercised at a time when the minds of the people will be inflamed by political feeling - the very worst time for such a power to be exercised. It will be a blemish on our electoral law, and is quite out of place. Those who vote for it must be held responsible for it, and for casting a reflection on the intelligence of the people. </para>

          <para>. - I rise to suggest a little amendment which, if it does not meet with the wishes of my honorable friends opposite, will tone down their opposition very much, and that is to substitute " any" for " the " in the paragraph dealing with the penalty. It will be seen that it refers to the polling place of the division in which the elector is enrolled. As under the electoral law an elector is entitled to vote at more than one polling place, I want to make that provision apply to any polling places at which he is entitled to vote. </para>
