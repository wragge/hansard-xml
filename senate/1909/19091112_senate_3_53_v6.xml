                        <para>- If the honorable senator thinks that the amendment, if inserted, would not have any effect or influence, I consider that we should insert a provision which would not be &#34; piffle.&#34; It is extremely desirable that such an intimation of public opinion as that which is embodied in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> should be made in the Defence Act. Hitherto there has been a tendency on the part of the officers of the Defence Force to attire themselves in a most extravagant and ridiculous fashion. They have been jeered at by boys, made the subject of many witty comments in the press, and generally subjected to the ridicule, and, in a great measure, to the contempt, of the man in the street. We should put our Defence Force on a plain business footing, , without any parade, show, or extravagance so far as the uniforms of the officers or the men are concerned. Apart altogether from the undesirability of men engaged in the defence of the country arraying themselves in magnificent attire, either at their own or at the country&#39;s expense, there is another aspect to be considered. If officers are to be permitted or expected to so attire themselves, then only the sons of rich men can become officers. After the experience we have had of how inefficiently the British Army is officered, and what a useless gang of men its officers are, we should pause. </para>

                        <para>- In the Boer War they incurred the ridicule and the contempt of every trained officer in Europe. Such things as were carried on in the British Army would not be tolerated in the army of Germany for a single instant. That is solely owing to the fact that the officers of the British Army are, with very few exceptions, drawn wholly from one class - the monied class, the aristocrats, who look upon being members of the Army as being something which gives them a certain added status in society. </para>

                        <para>- I began by pointing out that if the extravagant system of arraying the officers of the Defence Force which has hitherto been in vogue here is permitted to continue, then our officers can be drawn only from one section of society. I have pointed out that that section has conspicuously failed in its duties in Great Britain; and the inference is that if such a thing is permitted here, it will also fail. But there is a wider outlook than that, and that is that the career of an officer ought to be open to the humblest man in the community. If an officer&#39;s uniforms are to cost <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50</inline> or &#163;100, if he is to be set out like a gaudy peacock, for purposes of show only, not for purposes of defensive use, then only men of means can afford to become officers, and our choice must be limited to that section of society. Is it the desire of honorable senators that our Defence Force should be officered only from the middle and upper classes, if we have such classes here? I know that honorable senators on the other side desire that the officering should be strictly limited to professional and commercial men. I have not the slightest doubt that the very idea of an ordinary workman becoming an officer is enough to give them.  fits. But if we are to have an effective Defence Force, then the position of officer ought to be open to every member of it, and the only way to bring that about is to sweep away those trappings which have been so conspicuous in the past. For that reason, if there were no other, I think it desirable that the Committee should agree to the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> says that this is merely &#34; piffle.&#34; I should like to know why he thinks it is &#34;piffle&#34;? What does the word mean? Is it in Johnson&#39;s dictionary ? If the honorable senator means that we desire that there shall be no frills, and no unnecessary ornamentation in connexion with the uniform of the Defence Forces, I agree with him. Such &#34; piffle &#34; as that is unnecessary. Not only so, but it is wholly undesirable. I appeal to honorable senators either to agree to the amendment, or to suggest an improvement upon it. Surely we can do something to place it on record in the statute-book that the people of the Commonwealth desire nothing in the way of unnecessary ornamentation in connexion with the Defence Forces of this country. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;10.46&#93;. - The ridiculous harangue to which we have just listened would be highly proper for delivery on the Yarra bank, but it was stupendously out of place in a deliberative chamber, where men do not come together merely for the sake of inflaming the passions of the ignorant by the use of expressions and references that have not the smallest foundation in fact, and exist merely in the fevered or diseased imagination of those who utter them. &#34; Diseased imagination &#34; is a proper term under the circumstances, I think. The honorable senator tried to twist an observation which I used just now. He attempted to make it appear that I applied the very well-known word &#34;piffle &#34; to the costumes of our Defence Forces. The honorable senator surely cannot be so hopelessly ignorant&#34; as not to know what I meant. Perhaps it is that he is suffering from an attack of radical rabies.

                        <para>- I was trying to explain that all the costumes that are worn by the members of any defence force in the world are those which are ordered by the chief authority, whatever that may be. Whether civil, military, or naval uniforms are worn, they are worn&#39; in accordance with regulations. All the war services in every civilized land on this earth wear uniforms. It seems to me quite possible that some honorable senators do not comprehend why uniforms are worn. Merely .because the Boers, in their war with Great Britain, did not wear uniforms, it seems&#39; to be assumed that they are not necessary. But Great Britain was the only nation in the world that would have permitted men to fight without uniforms on terms of equality of usage. Any other nation would have dealt with the Boer prisoners, not as prisoners of war, but as murderers, and would have strung them up ; because, wearing no uniforms, they did not wear the livery of military service that permits the killing of an enemy as lawful. </para>

                        <para>- By any other nation in the world, prisoners who had been fighting out of uniform would, I say, have been treated as murderers and strung up to the first tree. If honorable senators opposite do not know these things, it simply shows their prejudice and lack of essential knowledge. During the Franco-Prussian war, the &#34;free-shooters&#34; of the French nation were invariably shot down as dogs, or hung to the nearest tree, because they were not in uniform. It is one of the broadest and best known rules of civilized warfare that a man must wear a uniform or livery to indicate that he is authorized to kill without committing crime. </para>

It has been the custom in every civilized nation, for I do not know how long, for the different branches of the military and naval services to wear uniforms that render them distinct and easily recognised. The Artillery wear one garb, the Mounted Troops another, the Infantry a third, and so forth. In the long-established armies of the world, there is nothing dearer to the honour and the enthusiastic feeling of soldiers than  the trappings that indicate historical incidents which have distinguished the regiments that wear them. I do not for the moment recollect the regiment in the British Army that wears a ribbon attachment of some sort on the back of the neck as well as at the throat. Why? .Those bits of ribbons are worn as a reminder of an occasion when the men of the regiment, very few in number, fought back to back in Egypt against <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> whole strength of an immensely superior French force. </para>

                        <para>- I thank my honorable friend for the correction. I think field-glasses were included. At any rate, I am certain that there were boots, belts, and similar articles of equipment, such as are necessary to make an officer fit to perform his duties in the field. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> were about. to travel, in his private capacity, from here to London&#39;, I suppose he would want a. few pounds&#39; worth of clothes. He would not like to be restricted to one shirt, a single pair of trousers, one suit of pyjamas, and so forth. He would want a few other things. He would absolutely require a hat. He would positively need a cap. For a certainty he would wish to have a pair of boots. </para>

                        <para>- And I can do without feather heads such as my honorable friend shows himself to be. We must not permit ourselves to be led away by speeches that indicate that officers wear  different clothing from men in the ranks. There is only one set of officers that wear feathers, such as are so often referred to; and they are the officers of the General Staff. Whilst Major-General Hutton cut down very largely indeed the cost of uniforms for all ranks, he augmented the cost of the uniforms of the members of his own staff, to such an extent indeed as caused an outcry to be made privately. I have been spoken to by certain victims of this order of Major-General Hutton, one of whom complained very much to me because he had to pay 18 guineas for a coat. That sort of thing is absurd. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator means to refer to the blind cords which &#34;Curly&#34; Hutton put on every one he could manage to hang them on, I admit that they are ridiculous. If those are what are objected to, let them go by all means. There is a matter about which I promised last night to speak when I had the opportunity, and I have the opportunity now. I refer to some remarks which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the very unfortunate speech which he delivered yesterday. I have heard of men &#34; playing to the gallery,&#34; but I witnessed yesterday an ex-Minister of the Crown speaking to the gutter. It is deplorable that an ex-Minister should come here with a very large amount of ignorance, or a very small stock of knowledge, and seek to inflame honorable and well-meaning gentlemen like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> That honorable senator made a speech in all good faith which showed that he had been led astray by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,,</inline> and he delivered himself of observations which I am quite sure his whole career in this Chamber forbids the belief that he would have delivered if he had known the facts. </para>

                        <para>- Let us get somewhere nearer the temple of truth. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> specifically referred to the R.A.A.* men, but he told us that the professionally-employed men were not being prepared for war, but were being taught to ride sets of quadrilles, or to, do dancing master&#39;s work for the pleasure of the ladies of officers who occupied certain exalted positions. Those may not be the exact words which the honorable senator used, but they represent the true meaning of what he said with the object of inflaming the minds of those who do not understand the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Does not the honorable senator know very well that there are such things as military sports? Does he not know that competitions take place in military forces that are not conducted on positively battle lines? Is he aware that if this absurd declaration of his was embodied in the Bill it would absolutely prevent the drilling of men in barrack-yards, because barrack-yard drill is not used on the field of battle? If, in time of peace, the men are to discharge only the duties which they would be called upon to discharge in time of war, they will have very little to do. The object of the evolutions carried out at military sports is to enable the men concerned in them to achieve the highest possible perfection in certain training. Of course,  I  know to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred. It was to that innocent, interesting, and highly instructive training for what is known as a &#34;musical ride.&#34; The horses and men are taught to perform so accurately and step so perfectly together that a most beautiful and harmonious evolution can be performed with a degree of nicety which is indicative of the best discipline and training of both men and horses. What about driving competitions which are carried out at military sports, where men drive at  a  walk, a trot, and a gallop as closely as possible to certain pegs or - other slight  obstacles. That is regarded as excellent training. Have not guns to be taken in action along hillsides, and on the brink of precipices where half an inch would mean the difference between a successful movement and a tragedy on the rocks below ? If men and horses are- trained in exact movements and with absolute precision, is that to be brought forward here as a subject for ridicule, and to afford an excuse for assailing even the wives and daughters of persons concerned who witnessed the performance? Are honorable senators so ignorant of military matters as to suppose that from the time the soldier gets out of bed in the morning until he gets into the  blankets  again at night he is doing nothing tout engaging in drill and military duties? Are there not some hours of leisure, in which these innocent and graceful arts may be acquired? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator should let me finish my sentence, and should not make himself ridiculous. I pointed out that a private wears no badge of rank on his sleeve, whilst a corporal or sergeant does, and that officers wear badges of rank on their shoulders, or on their cuffs, under a system introduced by Major-General Hutton, which, however, I am glad to say, is going out of fashion, because it was a stupid arrangement under which, if <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> officer stood with his hands behind his back, you could not tell what his rank was. You could not say whether he was your junior or senior, and so did not know how to approach him properly. When the officer&#39;s badge of rank is worn on  the  shoulder it is possible for any one approaching him to recognise his rank, and observe the niceties of military etiquette that are absolutely necessary if order and discipline is to be maintained in the forces. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment requires to be supplemented by an interpretation clause. In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of his proposed new section he speaks of &#34; the training, equipment, clothing, and all other provisions involving public expenditure.&#34; Will some one come along and tell me what part of that is English, and what part of it is gibberish.? I do not see how it can be contended that either training, equipment, or clothing is &#34; provisions.&#34; It seems to me that some words must have been omitted in the framing of the paragraph. I think that possibly it was intended to use the word &#34;rations,&#34; and then the word &#34;other&#34; should be omitted. The line would then read, &#34; the training, equipment, clothing, and all rations involving public expenditure.&#34; If that is not what is meant, I do not know what the paragraph means, nor do I believe does anybody else. The thing is ridiculous, and the amendment, if agreed to, would be opposed to the rest of the Bill. I am disposed to raise the point of order that it proposes the enactment of a provision for universal compulsory military service as an amendment of a Bill which provides merely for limited compulsory service. Perhaps it will save trouble if 1 raise that point of order now. I direct the attention of the  Chairman  to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposes by way of amendment the insertion of a declaration that &#34; it is the duty of every Australian citizen&#34; - meaning universal service - &#34; to assist in the defence of Australia in time of war, and in time of peace to be so trained, as to fit him to perform such a duty.&#34; Under the existing Defence Act provision is made for universal military service in time of. war, and I specially direct attention to the provision in the amendment for universal training of men in time of peace.  I submit that it is not competent for the honorable senator to propose an amendment which would alter the whole policy of the measure. The old form of the motion for the committal of a Bill was &#34; That the House go into Committee to consider the Bill in detail.&#34; It is not the business of this Committee to alter the entire character of this Bill, but to consider its provisions in detail, and I submit that an amendment which seeks the enactment of a policy totally different from that embodied in the Bill which was submitted to this Committee for consideration in detail, is out of order. </para>

                        <para>-  On the point of order I submit, sir, that there is. nothing in any one of the paragraphs of the proposed new section which is outside the scope of the Bill. It might be argued that they would have the effect of extending its scope. I do not think that that is so. But, even if they did, that would not make them out of order, as all that is required is that they should be relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. I propose to say, for instance, that it is the duty of every Australian citizen to defend his country. That is practically contained in almost every provision of the Bill. I speak of the &#34; creation and maintenance of an efficient Defence Force.&#34; That is the very object of the Bill, I refer in another paragraph to training, equipment, and clothing. </para>

                        <para>-  The point of order raised is a fine one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of his amendment is seeking to reverse the principle of the Bill, the second reading of which has been passed by the Senate. I must say that if the honorable senator succeeds in carrying it he will have taken the Bill out of the hands of the Government. If the Committee approves of the amendment they will have recorded a vote against the Government. The honorable senator is trying, under the specious guise of his amendment, to introduce a declaration which is against the whole spirit of the measure. In other words, under a plausible disguise this amendment strikes at the whole policy which is embodied in the Bill. The honorable senator is particularly ingenious in the way in which he attacks the measure. Yet nobody has insisted more strongly than he has done that the Bill should be considered absolutely free from party feeling. </para>

                    will therefore see that standing order 415 does not apply to an objection which is taken to the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees. Where such an objection is taken, it must be at once referred to the  President,  who, after hearing the views of honorable senators upon it, must give his decision. Unless objection be taken to that decision it is binding, and the Committee will resume its work. But if objection be taken to the decision of the  President,  the debate upon his ruling will be automatically adjourned until the next day of sitting, unless the Senate decides that the matter is one requiring immediate determination.

                <para class="block">That is a clear declaration that there are male inhabitants exempt under the Act, but the paragraph to which I take exception specifies that every Australian citizen shall in time of peace be trained for war. I submit that that is in direct violation of a provision of the Bill which was referred to the Committee. The object of the Committee stage is to consider the details of a measure and not to alter its character and scope. I submit that the paragraph distinctly enlarges the scope of service of every Australian male and requires his training in time of peace, which is a proposition directly opposed to the principles and intentions of the measure. I submit that the only manner in which it would have been possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to have got his proposal before the Committee would have been by carrying an instruction. An instruction is, I submit, a direction that the Committee is to do certain things which are outside the ordinary course of procedure. I hold that the paragraph is exactly on all fours with that proposition, that it seeks to alter the number of those who are to serve, and that such a proposal cannot even be considered in Committee except by an instruction. </para>

                        <para>-  The Bill repeals section 60 of the Act, and enacts a different provision. Therefore both the Act and the Bill say that in time of war every male Australian is liable to be called on to serve. Clause11 seeks to substitute the following provision for section 60 :  - </para>

                        <para>-  Will the honorable senator deny that if the Committee is in favour of making training universal it has the power to&#39; do so? The very fact that we have in the Bill certain qualifications presupposes that the Committee has the power to strike them out. Clearly, if we have the power to so amend&#39; proposed new section 125 as to make training universal, any honorable senator has the right to propose an amendment setting forth a principle on which the administration of the Act shall proceed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is clearly in a difficulty. He is asking you, sir, to rule that we cannot do by means of my amendment what we could do directly in connexion with proposed new section 125. We could so alter that provision as to say that only youths between twenty and twenty-one years of age, or persons between eighteen and eighty years of age shall be trained, or strike out any qualifications as to the years. The qualifications  are within the scope of the Bill, and relevant to its subject-matter. If you, sir, should rule that we cannot insert a declaratory clause to the effect that it is the duty of every Australian citizen in time of peace to be trained, we shall be placed in a difficulty when we come to deal with proposed new section 125. </para>

I would point out to you, sir, that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of my amendment does not seek to enact anything, but merely to lay down &#60;l principle which shall guide the Minister in the administration of the Act. It sets forth a guiding principle in connexion with the .Defence Forces of Australia. The matter seems to be so clear, sir, that I feel sure that you will sustain the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees. </para>

                        <para>- Previous speakers seem to regard this matter as one of extreme simplicity. But I find myself in a little difficulty in determining on which side the merits of the case rest. First of all, a point which must be borne in mind in arriving at a decision is whether paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> has any meaning, whether it is anything more than a mere platitude. If it is simply a declaration and means nothing, can it be opposed to any principle of the Bill? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it might be like a chip in porridge, but it cannot be in opposition to a principle of the Bill. The view I take of it is that it does not mean anything, but is a mere pious declaration that every citizen ought to be good and to discharge his duty to the country. If that is so, 1 cannot share the view put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that it is opposed to a provision of the Bill. At the same time, taking the other view of the case, that the amendment does mean something, and seeks to place a specific obligation on a citizen, it seems to me that we have to take into consideration proposed new section 125. That provision is not limited to all male inhabitants of Australia except those who are exempted, but it is confined to youths from twelve to twenty-six years of age. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> if adopted, would increase the number of persons liable to be trained. The whole crux of the matter is, I think, as to whether it is a declaration or not. I regard it as a declaration. It would be inoperative as having no substance other than the expression of an opinion as to what a good citizen ought to do. That being so, I find a little difficulty in regarding it as being out of order. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I was going to point out. The question of whether paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> is a pious declaration has nothing .to do with the point of order. The only question to be considered is how it bears upon proposed new section 125, which provides for certain exemptions from military training. If it is competent for the Committee to knock out those exemptions, or to alter them in any way, how can any declaration made at this stage of the Bill be in conflict with that provision which really does not exist until it is passed ? The point of order raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is so fine that I do not think that any sensible member of the Senate can see anything in it. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the question we have to consider is whether the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is within the scope of the Bill. This is a measure to make provision for defence. It seems to me, therefore, that anything that relates to defence is within the scope of the Bill. In Committee we have power to make this measure almost anything we like so far as it pertains to defence. The point at issue is whether the amendment is relevant to defence. If it be, it is within the scope of the Bill. The question whether the amendment is useful can be discussed hereafter. The  Chairman  of Committees was, however, obviously right, in my opinion, in ruling that the amendment - wise or unwise; useless or useful - was within the scope of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The question that has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is not so easy to determine as might perhaps be imagined. We have first to answer the question1 - What is the subject-matter of the Bill under consideration? The subject-matter of the Bill is the defence of Australia. It is perfectly true that it is only proposed that men up to the age of twenty - six shall be liable to undergo a regular period of training. But we have also to bear in mind that the Bill is to be read and construed in conjunction with the original Act. Although it would not be in order to amend the original Act in a manner beyond the scope of the present Bill, it is nevertheless a fair subject for consideration whether the words proposed to be inserted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> are in conflict with the general provisions of the Defence Act, and also whether they go beyond the intentions of the Senate when the motion for the second reading of the Bill was agreed to. I take it that it will be perfectly competent for honorable senators, when Part 12 of the Bill is reached, to follow the course indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> That is to say, they may amend the Bill in such a way as to provide that all male inhabitants of Australia who are British subjects, and have resided in the country six months, shall be liable to be trained as prescribed. The subject-matter of the Bill is wide, and it is quite in order to make it more comprehensive than it may at present be considered to be. The question arises as to whether the new clause proposed to be inserted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would be effective: As has been observed, the amendment is little more than declaratory. It can have no binding effect upon any individual in the community. It simply lays down that - </para>

                <para class="block">It does not appear to me that that is an enforceable provision. It is comparable with the preambles which we used to have attached to Bills in the old days. A preamble recited - &#34; Whereas it is desirable &#34; to do so and so; and then were enumerated the purposes of the measure, after which cam/; the operative portions of it. The enacting portion of the Bill might or might not embrace all that was included in the preamble, but the mere fact that the preamble embraced more than the operative portion provided for did not render the preamble operative. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> proposed new clause may be regarded as something like a preamble rather than as an enacting clause. But is it relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill ? There must be a certain amount of relevancy, as the clause relates to the defence of Australia, and the training, equipment, and clothing of troops. After giving the matter as full consideration as I could - because the point  if  order has been sprung upon me without warning - I am inclined to uphold the rul-ing given by the  Chairman  of Committees, that it is competent for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to submit the amendment under consideration. </para>

He wishes to preserve the Minister from inconvenience. But it does not appear to me that the proposed new section is likely to be of any advantage to the Minister. Rather would it land him in difficulties. The proposed new section attempts to lay down four principles. The first is that it is the du.i.y of every Australian citizen, not only to assist in the defence of Australia in time of war, but &#34; in time of peace to be so trained as to fit him to perform such duty.&#34; I am not prepared to agree to that as a principle. I agree thai: it is the duty of every citizen to assist in the defence of the country in time of war, but I am not prepared to allow that it is the duty of every citizen to drill in time of peace. </para>

                        <para>- Then I object to that. In time of war the country is welcome to my services, whatever they may be worth. But I do not wish to be put to the inconvenience of going out to drill every year, and there are many &#34;old buffers&#34;&#39; like me in the same position. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> seems to be superfluous. What is the use of it?

                <para class="block">With regard to equipment and clothing, I quite admit that in time of war the simpler the uniform the better. It is necessary to have some mark to distinguish officers, but otherwise the war clothing of our troops should not be unnecessarily expensive. But at the same time we do not want our men to go into the field as General Cronje did in the Boer War, in an old-fashioned top hat and a frock coat. We want our men and officers to be properly uniformed. As to the uniforms of officers in times of peace, I hold that if it is right for the Commonwealth to provide the uniform of the soldier it is equally right to provide the uniform of the officer. If a man has the capacity, the ability, and the enthusiasm to render good service as an officer, why should not his country pay for his uniform? </para>

                        <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> reminds me, a man might claim that public necessity demanded that he should be moved, and that would be another source of discontent and confusion. The Military Board should be left to decide all these things, and the Minister following their advice should then be held responsible. I do not see the necessity for hampering the Bill with the declaration of these four principles. It is, I think, a unique proposal to ask for the insertion at the beginning of a Bill of a clause laying down principles of administration. The principles which should guide the administration of every Act of Parliament, and of this measure if it be passed, are those of justice, equity, and righteousness. So far as paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the amendment is concerned, I cannot agree that it is the duty of every citizen to undergo military training every year. I believe that the last paragraph could only have the effect of creating disturbance, and I feel that I must in consequence vote against the proposed new clause. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> &#39;s speech has really raised the question whether it is worth our while to have any Defence Force at all. Unless we have a fighting machine capable of performing the work required of it, should it ever be necessary for us to defend Australia, we might just as well have no Defence Force. We have for years been wasting a tremendous amount of money upon a totally inefficient force. In order that the force established under this Bill shall be efficient. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposes that the members of it shall be called upon to undergo a certain amount of training.

                        <para>-- -I should be given the same latitude that has been allowed to other honorable senators to debate this question. It is well known that the Minister of Defence has for years expressed himself against the principle of compulsory military training. I mention the matter in order to show that the Bill is the product of a combination of confused ideas on the subject of defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has proposed his new clause in order to make the measure harmonious. It is absolutely necessary to lay down the principles which should be followed in the administration of the measure. On the question of uniform I may say that in accordance with international usage men in the field, if they are to be recognised as belligerents, must wear some dis tinct feature of dress, indicating a uniform. That has been laid down, I think, by the Geneva Convention. It was laid down by the Convention that a number or mark indicating a regiment or military organization attached as a fixture to, it might be a civilian&#39;s coat, is all that is necessary to comply with the international law. It has been argued, for instance, that a belt would not be sufficient, because it might be so readily removed, and could not be regarded as a fixture. There can be no doubt that it would be wise for us to lay it down as a principle that the dress of our forces shall be of an inexpensive character, lt is not necessary that in the matter of uniform we should have the frill which has been criticised and made the subject of ridicule in the p&#39;ast. We shall be taking a very sensible course if we do away with that. I have heard the professional soldier declare more than once that it is the amateur and not the professional soldier who desires all the gewgaws and ornaments of dress. The professional soldier claims that the person whom it is most difficult to induce to take a common-sense view of the question of uniform is the honorary colonel, who likes to parade himself once a month, or oftener, in some ostentatious dress. As it is proposed that . we should undertake a more gigantic task than any attempted in the  past, and should train every able-bodied man in the community, honorable senators must recognise that it would be quite beyond our financial ability to provide uniforms on anything like the scale hitherto adopted. That being so, it would be a great mistake if, in this measure, we were to recognise anything in the way of expensive uniforms, especially in view of the fact that if our men appeared in the field even in the dress of civilians, so long as they wore attached, as a fixture, to their coats or hats the number of the regiment or company to which they belonged, they would comply with the resolution of the Geneva Convention. I submit that the proposed new section lays down principles which should be followed in the Bill, and are necessary in order to make it a workable measure. </para>

                    (New South Wales)  ri2.i2&#93;.  - I wish to draw attention to the fact that the Defence Act of 1903, with which this measure is to be incorporated, contains a preamble which is very much like paragraph

                <para>That paragraph and the preamble of the Act of 1903 differ only in one point, though perhaps the difference is rather a significant one.

                        <para>- That is one of the arts of war in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has become very proficient. In addressing himself to this question he declared that our officers did not wear gaudy uniforms - (hat their uniforms were the same as those of the men, except that they had certain distinguishing marks. Upon looking  into this question, I find that the statement of the honorable senator is entirely in conflict with the testimony of Major-General Hoad, the Inspector-General of the Commonwealth Forces. But we need not go to any outside authority to learn that the uniforms of officers of our Defence Force are too expensive to be within the reach of our humblest citizens. We all know that every time this Parliament is opened there is a display of military uniforms in this chamber which is positively dazzling. Those uniforms are more gaudy than is the dress of any peacock that ever elevated its tail to call forth the admiration of a crowd. Upon beholding such a formidable array of gold tassel, the first thought which would occur to. any individual like myself, who has spent the best portion of his life in gold-mining operations, is that he would like to put the wearers through a battery, and pan them off in order to see how much of the precious metal they would return per ton. In his annual report for 1907, Major-General Hoad, under the heading of uniforms, says - </para>

                    <para>The dress regulations should be revised, with a view to reducing the cost of the uniforms with which the officers are required to provide themselves. The following shows the present approximate cost to young officers on joining the Infantry or Light Horse. It will be noted that some of the articles are shown as optional, but no officer cares to attend parades dressed differently from comrades. </para>

                <para>Therefore, in reality, none of the articles are optional. If a man is not to be sent to Coventry, he has to dress in the same way as his brother officers. Major-General Hoad states that the approximate cost of the uniforms of a lieutenant of infantry - an officer of the lowest rank - is &#163;39 16s. 6d. That is the amount which he has to expend upon a single outfit, and if that outfit should get spoiled he has to re-incur that expenditure. We must also recollect that as he rose in the forces, the cost of his uniforms would increase. For regiments for which scarlet is full dress, the total cost of an officer&#39;s uniforms is . &#163;44 8s. 6d. ; whilst the cost of the uniforms of a lieutenant of Light Horse is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;41</inline> os. 6d.

I would ask honorable senators if it is not desirable that every position in our Defence Forces shall be open to any man, no matter what may be his rank in life, so long as he is competent to fill it? As a general principle, nobody will deny that. Yet honorable senators who oppose this amendment will throw difficulties in the way of giving effect to that principle. </para>

                        <para>- Those honorable senators who will vote to retain unnecessary expenditure upon military dress. The average man in Australia does not earn &#163;2 per week. As a matter of fact, the majority do not average that amount. How can such a man incur an expenditure of more than <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;4.0</inline> upon uniforms? Yet he may be the most capable man in the whole of our Defence Force. Do we not know that the greatest men in- the world have risen from the ranks? Every honorable senator who came to the city this morning from the suburbs by train is aware that the application of steam to locomotives was introduced by a boy who started life by earning fourpence a day. If we continue a system of gaudy and expensive uniforms in the case of the officers of our Defence Forces, we shall limit our choice of officers to the snobocracy of Australia - to men who wish to ape all sorts of ridiculous pageantry which would have been abolished centuries ago by any sensible people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has declared that he likes a little show. </para>

                        <para>- What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> really likes is to preserve the officer-ships of our Defence Forces to the snobocracy of Australia. To be a good fighter, a good organizer, or a good strategist, does not necessitate a man wearing a cap which costs 17s. 6d., the bulk of the expenditure upon which is represented by a few feathers.  His  brains will .be just as capable if he does not wear that cap as they will be if he does wear it. In Australia the majority do not belong to the leisured class, but are wage earners, and I maintain that if we exclude them from becoming officers in our Defence Forces we shall restrict our choice of officers very seriously. We must all recognise that though an army may be thoroughly brave - though it may possess all the merits with which it is possible to endow it - if it be incapably led it must inevitably meet with disaster. Consequently, no limit should be imposed on our choice if we are to secure the most capable men. If we are going to restrict that choice to a small section of the community in order that the positions occupied by officers may be secured by the representatives of wealth, our Defence Forces will be rendered incapable and ineffective. I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment, and I shall endeavour to remove from the Bill every provision which makes for show. I want to see the measure made an effective one, and in order that it may be effective the humblest man in the community should be able to attain the highest rank. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has already expressed his willingness to withdraw paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of his proposed new section. Seeing that&#39; he has arrived at such a complaisant state of mind, I would suggest to him that he should also consider the advisableness of withdrawing sub-clause 1 of the clause. In the course of his argument the honorable senator affirmed that with certain limitations proposed new section 125 of this Bill practically covers the ground which he wishes to cover&#39;. That being so, it is surely unnecessary to again traverse it. Just now, I asked him to define what he meant by &#34; citizen.&#34; I put the same question to him again. The term used .throughout the Bill is &#34; male inhabitants.&#34; Now, the word &#34;citizen&#34; includes something more than our male inhabitants. Surely he doe&#39;s not wish to drill our women. </para>

                        <para>- But the amendment says that it is the duty of every Australian citizen ,to train. I feel perfectly satisfied that my honorable friend used the word in a sense which is perfectly understandable and which we are all apt to inadvertently employ, but I suggest that the word is in sharp contradistinction to the phrase &#34; male inhabitants,&#34; which is used throughout the Bill. If the amendment were adopted it might be assumed that as the phrase &#34; male inhabitants &#34; was used elsewhere in the Act obviously the phrase &#34;every Australian citizen&#34; was meant to go beyond the males and to include the females. With regard to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> I contend that it would be inoperative. It is indefinite, and everything would depend entirely upon the opinion of the Minister and the temper of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Every Minister is more or less amenable to the influence of the public sentiment of the day and the sentiment of Parliament, to which, of course, he is responsible. In the absence of a definite instruction in the amendment it would be left to the Minister to determine what was necessary or unnecessary, just as it might suit him. One Minister, for instance, might say, &#34; I shall abolish bands. Not a penny of public money shall be spent on a band, because that is not absolutely necessary for war.&#34; But another Minister might say, &#34; I believe that a band is desirable and advantageous as promoting training in time of peace and being useful on the march in time of war. &#39; &#39; Each Minister could decide the matter for himself. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> if he would abolish bands? </para>

                        <para>- I am trying to point out how difficult it is to do more than leave the matter to the determination of the Minister, with a knowledge that Parliament could always voice a protest when necessary. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I would not abolish bands, nor do I think any one else would. We should leave all such matters to be determined by the common sense of the Minister, who, of course, would realize that he must pay some reasonable regard to the sentiment of Parliament and that of the community at large. In view of the indefiniteness of the terms employed and the fact that they are merely broad declarations, I ask the honorable senator to withdraw the amendment. </para>

It simply expresses the opinion that it is the duty of every Australian citizen to assist in the defence of Australia in time of war. If that is not the duty of every citizen, upon what section should it devolve? If it is admitted that that duty belongs to every citizen, then he certainly should endeavour to obtain the opportunity of being trained in order to enable him to effectually defend Australia in time of stress. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is a member of a party which has been chiefly instrumental in preventing a peaceful invasion of Australia by Asiatics. He is now called upon to consider a measure intended to prevent a hostile invasion. We are in close &#34;proximity to Eastern nations, and, as regards one of them, a treaty will secure our safety for the next five years. The treaty  cannot absolutely secure our safety, because the nation in question has been known not to pay much attention to treaties. It cannot be disputed that there is the danger of a hostile invasion by those people whom we have by our legislation prevented from coming here and taking  possession  of Australia in a peaceful manner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell objects to young Australians being trained to serve in time of war. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator mean to suggest that in the case of&#34; a sudden emergency or invasion, we should wait for a general, election to be held before taking any steps to defend Australia r because that is what the objection implies? Regarding paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> I think it is an equally valuable provision, because, if it is the duty of every citizen to take his part in the defence of his country, it ought to be open to him to rise to the highest office in the Defence Force. If the uniforms of certain officers were to cost a very large sum, it would not be possible for  every  citizen, no matter what his natural military ability might be, to aspire to an office in the citizen army. But paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> if adopted, would declare that officers should not incur any expense beyond that which is incurred by every private. </para>

                        <para>- An attractive uniform conduces to the popularity of an army. We see that in connexion with the cadets. A boy is not content with a badge on his arm or cap, but likes to wear a suit that shows that he is a cadet. The service will not be made popular by condemning men to wear clothes which they do not like. </para>

                        <para>- Well, the traditions of the red coat are not to be despised. I like to see a regiment in. red coats. But at the same time, red is not a serviceable colour ; it is too conspicuous in war. The main point is that public sentiment must be respected. One of the main defects in this Bill, in my opinion, is that it makes no provision for keeping men who have undergone training in touch with the forces. They should not be allowed to drift. I should like to see a clause inserted requiring men up to the age of, say, forty-five to put in some drills every year. Changes in military tactics, evolutions, and armaments are continually being made. If a man has been trained as a gunner, he should be kept well informed about changes in gun construction and manipulation. </para>

                        <para>- My caucus is myself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell himself has been kicking over the traces on this question and is not prepared to bow down to his party caucus. I feel strongly upon the necessity for providing an efficient defence of Australia, and desire to make this Bill serviceable to that end. It has been said that opportunities are not afforded for working men to become officers. Such has not been the case in Queensland. Some of our young men have devoted time, energy, and money to perfecting themselves; in military matters, and all honour is due to them. Some of our most efficient officers are working men. Even in the British Army it is possible for a man to rise from the ranks. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hector</inline> McDonald was a ranker and so was Major-General Finn. </para>

                    <para>. - The criticism to which my amendment has been subjected has been of an unpractical character, and I have a right to complain that it has not been directed to the amendment itself. I was not surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> diatribes. The honorable senator belongs to a time now happily fast passing away, when the Volunteer Forces of the country were looked upon as being established for merely ornamental and social purposes.. The Bill before us is evidence that we are now called upon to face a much sterner condition of things. We have been playing at soldiers in the past, but the introduction of this measure and the support it has received make it clear that it is generally recognised that we have now to deal with a very serious matter. It is admitted that what we require is a practical, and not a comic opera, force. We do not require a pretty force, a force which men might join because it would enable them to wear smart uniforms. We need now a force for defence, and we should provide for nothing but what would be effective for that purpose. It was astonishing to me to listen to an honorable senator, who poses as an expert in defence matters, justifying the training of troops in musical rides. </para>

                        <para>- After the honorable senators&#39; justification of useless drills and ceremonies, it would not astonish me to hear him justify anything. Some honorable senators, in dealing with the paragraph referring to clothing, have justified the retention of existing uniforms because of their historic associations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> justified the retention of the red coat on the ground of the patriotic sentiment expressed in the reference to &#34; the thin red line.&#34; If we follow up historic associations, we shall find that, at the battle of Agincourt, the British soldiers fought with lances, in coats of mail and chain armour. Historic association would justify a return to lances, coats of mail, and chain armour, and to kilts, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell reminds me. </para>

                        <para>- It would justify the use of the bow and arrow. As a matter of fact, one of the British regiments today wears a sort of cuirass of polished steel, not because it would stop a bullet or a sword thrust, but because of some historic association connected with the regiment. When drafts from that regiment went to South Africa to take part in the Boer war, they did not take their cuirasses with them on to the battlefield ; they did not take them even as far as Cape Town. </para>

                        <para>- I have to confess that the music of the bagpipes does not stir up a martial spirit in me; it tempts me to retreat, rather than to advance. There is a strong reason for the insertion of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of my amendment, which has not yet been touched upon. We shall require a large number of officers for the proposed new force. Under existing conditions, a number of captains may go up for examination to fill a vacancy for a major, and five or six of them may pass. A practice has been followed in the past that where a captain has passed a brilliant examination for. the rank of major, if there has been no vacancy to which he could be appointed, he has been made a major &#34; supernumerary to the establishment.&#34; He would hold the rank, but not the command, of a major, and would have to wait until some major dropped out, into whose place he might step. No one can doubt that the enthusiastic officers of the force will desire to go into the fighting line. But, as the Minister recognised in his speech on the second reading of the Bill, it is just as necessary that the first line of reserve should be fully officered with capable men. Immediately war is proclaimed, the first line of reserve would step into the fighting line. If five men passed the examination for a major, and there was a vacancy only for one in the fighting line, do honorable senators think that the other four would willingly accept positions in the first line reserve? </para>

                        <para>- It is not a question of what they ought to do. I know that this matter has given rise to a great deal of soreness in the past. The making of these appointments &#34; supernumerary to the establishment &#34; has led men to believe that they have a sort of pre-emptive right to certain positions, and I have used the words &#34;in the public interest &#34; in my amendment, not as Senators Pulsford and Vardon have supposed, for the benefit of the men, but for the benefit of the Minister. I wish the Minister to be able to say, should the circumstances justify it, that a man who has passed his examination and is qualified to go into the fighting line, shall, although he may not wish to do so, go into the first line reserve, because the public interest requires it. With reference to the allotment to different arms of the service, honorable senators will find, if they make inquiry from any officer of the Head-quarters Staff, that some arms of the service are more popular than others. It is necessary to refuse applications to join some branches of the service, while it is difficult to keep others up to their full strength. My amendment would be a clear direction to the Minister in this matter that he should be guided by the public interest, and not by outside influence or the desire of a particular individual, or of the people of a particular district. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter for the consideration of a particular corps ; not for the Department. Difficulties in connexion with uniforms are of gradual growth, and are not to be charged to a particular Minister or officer. It is suggested, for instance, that one regiment should have a particular stripe or button to distinguish it from any other. I have here the official memorandum, supplied by the Quartermaster-General to myself as Minister of Defence, on the question of uniforms. It includes a list of the things required ; for instance, for a second lieutenant&#39;s uniforms. There are two kinds of uniform. One is the service uniform,, which the men would wear in time of war, and it is not an unattractive uniform. I venture to say that the khaki service uniform is smart and attractive when properly made and worn. </para>

                        <para>- I intend merely to quote from it the list of articles connected with the uniforms which an officer must have, and the list which is optional. There can be no breach of confidence in that, because the particulars might be obtained from the regulations. I have no intention to quote any of the statements or expressions of opinion given in the memorandum, because I recognise that it would not be right to do so, seeing that it was prepared for my information as Minister of Defence. In the list of things required for the service uniform, there is not very much to cavil at. The only thing that might be regarded as unnecessary is the brown scabbard and sword knot. It might be argued that that could be dispensed with. It was dispensed with in South Africa. But in the_ Russo-Japanese war the Japanese wore their swords. I refer now to the full-dress uniform. </para>

                        <para>- My remarks are aimed at the abolition of the full-dress uniform. The other articles which constitute this full dress are - a steel scabbard and sword which costs <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 13s., a sword knot which costs 12s. 6d., breast lines and pads which cost <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 10s., and a sword belt and slings which cost 15s., making a total expenditure of ^17 5s. 6d. Not a penny of that expenditure can be justified as, clothing, which is required &#34;as a preparation for war.&#34; It can be justified only on the ground that it is necessary to supply a more attractive uniform to officers for parade purposes. The admission that we can maintain a voluntary force only by adopting an attractive uniform, is the most wholesale condemnation of the voluntary system which we can have. Do I understand the Government to say that without these attractive uniforms we cannot maintain a voluntary force ? </para>

                        <para>- Then the use of these extravagant uniforms cannot be justified. I come now to the articles in the full-dress uniform of a second lieutenant of militia infantry, which are optional. They consist of a mess dress which costs &#163;&#38;, a drill jacket which costs <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> dress boots which cost <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> is., and a waterproof cape which costs <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 12s. 6d., making a grand total of ^44 2s. 6d. I do not think that the proposed new section will result _ in the abolition of these uniforms, but it will certainly be a direction to the Minister of Defence to abolish them. If, for example, in the framing of his regulations it were proposed that a sash should be worn, he would have to ask himself, &#34;What has the wearing of a sash to do with making preparations for war &#34; ? As the article could not withstand that test he would have to abandon it. In order- to obtain the true opinion of the Committee upon the various paragraphs of the proposed new section I ask honorable senators to allow the enacting words to pass upon the voices. A division can then be taken upon each separate paragraph. If the whole of these paragraphs are excised, there will then be no necessity for the enacting words which can also be struck out. I do not intend to press paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline></para>

It will be readily recognised that through the ballot-box the electors have practically declared that every citizen should be prepared to defend Australia. </para>

                        <para>-  1  do not desire to hear that qualification. It is the wish of Australia that every citizen should be trained to defend his country in time of trouble. But if we adopted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St</inline> Ledger&#39;s line of reasoning, we should have to wait until perhaps an invading force was in possession of Port Darwin, or had blown Thursday Island off the map, before every citizen shouldered arms. We should then have merely an undisciplined force instead of a well-trained and well-organized army. In other words we should have to depend, as our ancestors did years ago, upon a press gang. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator takes a different view, and, in se doing, is asserting his independence. That circumstance in itself shows that members of the Labour party are not caucus-ridden. Coming to the question of uniforms, I cannot understand what is the* use of a gaudy uniform. This morning I listened attentively to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who desires to maintain the old system of military frills and trappings. But will he say that a military uniform ever won a battle? I question whether the soldiers who fought on the Boer side in the Boer War would have been better men if &#39; they had. possessed the military fripperies which were worn by the British soldiery. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senators will take the trouble to recall the first two or three decisive battles of that conflict, when the Empire was confronted with a very serious situation on account of the Boers proving victorious, they will recollect that during those battles a great number of British officers were killed. They will also remember that the reason assigned for this was that those officers wore gaudy uniforms - amongst other things a great red sash - which made them prominent targets for the quick eyes of the Boer marksmen. And as soon as the Imperial authorities understood the situation, they relieved the officers of many of their trappings, particularly of the red sash, which made an officer a prominent target for the Boer sharpshooters. I admit that in time: &#39;of war it is necessary to have a smart service dress, not a cumbersome one; but who will tell me that in democratic Australia the uniforms of an officer should cost from ^25 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;44</inline> ? A working man who is desirous of doing his duty to the country, and who is receiving a weekly remuneration of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,</inline> is expected to be able to pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;44</inline> for uniforms. No matter how great his ability or intelligence may be, he cannot rise above the position of an ordinary private unless he can afford to tuy these expensive uniforms. If it is the desire of the Ministry to reserve the higher positions in the Citizen Defence Force for certain persons, the sooner the Bill is thrown into the waste-paper basket the better it will be for the country. I have every desire to assist to pass a proper measure, and the sooner I see an efficient Defence Act on the statute-book the better I shall be pleased. But it should certainly afford to every man a chance to rise from the lowest to the highest position, and1 handicap no one. Let us look beyond the Military Department for a moment. Australia offers to every citizen the opportunity to rise from the humblest station to the highest possible position within the gift of the people. Why, then, should we handicap a citizen in the Defence Force? It is well known that many persons will not be able to rise in our army if they are to be subjected to a heavy cost for uniforms. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but that is no reason why we should follow an ironbound custom. I believe that if &#34; Fighting Mac &#34; were alive to-day, and were asked for his opinion, he would support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> If it is adopted it will make the measure more democratic than it is, and afford  to every citizen who enters the Defence Force an opportunity to rise from the ranks to the highest position, without being called upon to pay a sum ranging from &#163;25 to&#163;44 for uniforms which are absolutely unnecessary. I would remind the Minister that uniforms have never been known to win a fight. What we need is a body of well-trained men, trained from boyhood until they have reached manhood, willing to fight and able to shoot straight. </para>

                    <para>A man may get a smattering of his drill and may be able to intelligently pass an examination ; but he is then only at the beginning of his business. If in existing circumstances it takes a long time to produce a non-commissioned officer, how much longer time is required to turn out a competent officer? I admit that it is most difficult to get suitable officers. When I commanded a regiment in Australia it was most difficult to obtain from the regiment officers whom the men could respect, and in whom I could have confidence. </para>

                <para class="block">As there is such difficulty in getting officers, we should make the conditions as easy as possible. It is well known that the average worker does not care much about writing letters. The pursuit of a vocation involving physical labour causes a man to get out of practice in writing. The consequence is that many &#39;a soldier, who would be well able to pass a practical examination, would shrink from submitting himself to one requiring theoretical knowledge and facility in writing answers to questions. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator wishes to prevent the young horny-handed from being able to rise in the ranks which he himself adorned for so many years, why does he not say so in plain English ? Many a man who would not care about submitting himself to a written examination would be able to answer all the questions on matters of practical military work which were put to him. I have been told that it is not always the men who are well grounded in theory who are the most competent leaders in the field. The best officer is he who knows his practical work, and who can inspire his men with confidence in him. There is nothing in my amendment which can lead any one to believe that I desire that an officer should be unable to write or read orders. I desire that an officer shall be examined in matters concerned with his work in the field an the ordinary duties of the rank to which he aspires. </para>

                        <para>- It is so rare for a man to rise from the ranks in the British Army that when one does his name is known all over the world. The reason for this is that there is a military caste in the&#39; Old Country who desire to retain all commissions for themselves. We do not want that kind of thing in Australia, and for that reason the amendment should be accepted. It does not say that a man shall be given promotion merely because he has a practical knowledge of the work he would be called upon to perform in the position to which he aspires. It provides also that he must have a sufficient knowledge of reading and writing to be able to carry out the duties of the position. </para>

                        <para>- I have known many instances of the exercise of influence in securing admissions into the Public Services of the States. It is stated that influence can be used effectually even in connexion with admissions to the Commonwealth Public Service. I have denied that, but I have been told that influence has been exercised even under our rigid system in quite a number of cases. No practical knowledge is required of those seeking to enter the Public Service, and the theoretical examination to which candidates are subjected is the only examination which they, are required to pass.  But in the Defence Force all promotions must be by examination. A man might not be able to go very far in that service, but no obstacle should be placed in the way of his securing the two or three positions for which he is fitted. We have been told that it is very hard to get officers, and it will not be any easier in the future than it has been in the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out that years of training are required to fit men for some positions in the forces. It is true that the amendment was not accepted in another place, but that is no reason why it should not be accepted here. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator proposes to substitute an oral for a written examination, but he does not see that if those dealing with the matter wished to do so it would be as easy for them to set a trap for some unfortunate man by the one form of examination as by the other. We must leave the standard to be determined by those responsible for the administration of the Act. How is it possible to lay down in this Bill the lines on which the examinations shall proceed? </para>

                        <para>- I have already said that if from any sinister motive there was a desire to block certain candidates it could be done as easily by one method of examination as by the other. The day when a writing test was an object of terror, because writing was an accomplishment of the few, has gone by. We have a public school system in operation in Australia, the effects of which are manifest, and the men now coming forward to join the Defence Force are able to read and write reasonably well. In trie case of the majority it would be an advantage to them to have questions set before them in writing, because they would not be asked to answer them on the spur of the moment. They would have the eye to assist the mind in discerning what was meant, and would have time to prepare their answers. </para>

                        <para>- That is what the amendment means. What may be in the minds of honorable senators opposite may &#39;be something quite different. They now raise an entirely different question. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> merely means to affirm that no candidate should be ruled out who, having the requisite knowledge, cannot write well, I agree with him. </para>

                        <para>- What does it mean? This amendment would give no protection to the man who writes badly. He must do some of his examination in writing, and in spite of this amendment it would be possible to rule him out. I say that if the object of honorable senators, opposite is to prevent a candidate from being ruled out on the ground of bad writing, though his writing might be legible and his written answers correct, it would be possible under the amendment to rule him out for bad writing. I am sure that that is not what honorable senators desire. I urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> to withdraw the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> will withdraw his amendment. I have rarely found him reasonable in these matters. If honorable senators desire to provide some protection for those who, because, perhaps, of their ordinary occupations, write badly, I am with them. I should be willing to accept an amendment which would give that protection, but I say that the amendment! which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has proposed will not effect what honorable senators opposite desire. If the amendment be adopted there will be absolutely nothing to prevent a candidate from being&#39; failed at an examination because he writes badly. On the other hand, it will provide any sinister-minded Board of Examiners with an opportunity to block any particular candidate whose qualifications they may regard as deficient. Unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is prepared to withdraw his amendment I shall have no option but to divide the Committee upon it. </para>

It declares that .they shall be framed &#39;with an eye to what is required of an officer in the field. I have in my mind a case in which a candidate passed a good examination in all other subjects, but made some lamentable mistakes in spelling. He exceeded the number of mistakes in spelling which was allowed- </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me marvellous that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> can still argue that written work means writing. I say that a candidate&#39;s written work might, from the standpoint of handwriting, be the most awful thing imaginable, and yet it might be magnificent written work. Take as an illustration a leading article in a newspaper. Usually such articles are written in an execrable hand, which nobody but a trained compositor can read, but they are, nevertheless, splendid written work. On the other hand, a man who would never be able to do the same class of work might write absolute copper-plate. When the Bill speaks of &#34;written work&#34; it merely means the answers which are given by candidates to the questions put to them - quite apart from the merits of their handwriting. I do not intend to labour the point. I have already been told that I am dense, but, nevertheless, I think that my view is the correct one. The amendment would not protect a candidate from being judged from the stand-point of his handwriting alone. </para>

                        <para>- Their retention would allow a little snobbishness to be introduced in connexion with the Naval Forces. I am informed that a certain amount of pressure has been brought to bear, especially in Victoria, by a number of persons who are organized into a yacht club. They object to doing the work of the ordinary person so far as the Militia is concerned, but they are prepared to volunteer, provided that they are not to be compelled to do the full term of training which the average person will be required to do. Under these conditions, they are prepared to volunteer. </para>

                        <para>- The man who enters the Defence Force as a volunteer does his work without receiving much remuneration. Certainly, he gets some remuneration, but not a great deal ; and he is not called upon to do the necessary amount of training or make himself anything like as effective as a man who goes into the Militia. If the object of this Bill is to render men efficient, we do not need the volunteer system at all. We want those who care to go into the Naval Forces to make themselves as proficient as possible. It is very hard to get men proficient in connexion with the Naval Militia. The Old Country had a system by which men could become members of the Naval Reserve. But they had to put in a month&#39;s continuous training every year, for which they were paid &#163;11s. a week. A large part of the force was composed of persons connected with the maritime marine, who received, in addition, a retaining fee of&#163;6 a year, or, in all, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> 4s. If the latter wished to leave England for a voyage which would keep them away more than twelve months, they had to get what was practically a permit before they could sign on, and on their return from a voyage lasting, say, two years, they could not draw any money until they had put in two months&#39; continuous training. Of course, they became fairly efficient. But a man belonging to class A will have to put in only twenty-one days of continuous training, of which eighteen must be in periods of not less than six days&#39; continuous training afloat. Class B covers stokers chiefly. Regulation 99, relating to naval volunteers, is as follows :  - </para>
