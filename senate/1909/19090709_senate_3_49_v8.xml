                        <para>- I do not agree with the prayer of the petitions. I do not believe in unification, but when petitions in favour of unification, or anything else, are presented to this Parliament on behalf of 58,000 electors, that I consider is an important fact in our national life, and one which should receive recognition by printing the petitions in the papers of one House or the other. It should be remembered that, whether we agree with this movement or not, it is part of the national life of Australia. Our national life as it is reflected in Parliament is embodied in the printed papers, and not in those which are deposited in the archives and forgotten. We should see that our parliamentary papers are as nearly as we can make them a reflection of the various expressions of public opinion which come before the Senate or the other House from time to time. It would be a regrettable thing if these petitions were not printed. It may be that they represent the beginning of a movement which is going to have big effects in Australia. We must recognise that there are strong arguments behind this movement for unification. In fact, they are so strong that they have assisted a sister Dominion to adopt that principle. </para>

                        <para>- I only desire to say, sir, that this is not a movement which has no substance, but one which has such substance that a neighbouring Dominion has practically adopted unification rather than Federation. I hope that honorable senators will not object to the printing of these petitions simply because they do not agree with their prayer.. Unless there are good and valid reasons to the contrary, I would like the Printing Committee to agree to my amendment, so that there may be a record on the Journals of one House or the other that such petitions were presented. </para>

There are times when honorable senators are obliged to take an opportunity of this kind to contradict false impressions about their attitude on public questions.

                        <para>- I thank you, sir, for pointing out where I was straying. By the printing of these documents many false impressions may be removed. For instance, there is an impression that the Labour party favours unification. The printing of the petitions will show that it does not. The State which I represent is undoubtedly against unification, and the printing of the petitions will furnish very good reasons for the attitude which has been taken up by its representatives here, and by, I think, all the members of the Opposition. I should like to see the documents printed, if for nothing else than to make that fact clear. </para>

                    <para>. - As a member of the Printing Committee, I wish to say that not one of the reasons which have been assigned as the probable ground for that body not recommending the printing of these petitions is correct. The fact is that a majority of the Printing Committee were opposed to their being printed. A motion which I moved to that effect was defeated bv five votes to four. Those who desire to ascertain why my motion was defeated should direct their inquiries to those members of the Printing Committee who constituted the majority. I, for my part, considered that in the future the petitions might be regarded as valuable historical documents, and that as such they should find a place among our parliamentary papers. I hold that, no matter whether anybody agrees with the prayer of the petitions or has any desire to further or retard their object, undoubtedly as valuable historical records they should be included in the records of Parliament. There is a further slight misconception which ought to be removed. From reading the Printing Committee's report, one would imagine that the petitions were merely in favour of unification. To convey such an impression is misleading, because the prayer is that a referendum be taken for the purpose of ascertaining whether a majority of the electors are in favour of unification and reconstruction. The documents ought to be printed. I took up that attitude as a member of the Printing Committee. The majority of that body who were opposed to the printing of the documents were, without exception, supporters of the present Government, whilst the minority, as usual, consisted of members of the Labour party. I shall support the printing of the petitions. I do not think that it is fair to saddle the entire Printing Committee with blame for having refused to recommend that they be printed, seeing that the facts are as I have stated. </para>

                            is always very apt at interjections. If he will permit me to proceed in my own way, we shall get along very much better. I think it is desirable that Parliament should know the number of accidents that have happened in the Commonwealth Public Service, the nature of those accidents, how they were caused, and the defects which caused them. Those defects might be remedied. Then it is exceedingly desirable that we should know what compensation has been paid in connexion with accidents where compensation has been paid at all. We ought to be in possession of the facts connected with every accident that happens in Commonwealth employment. The objection urged by the  Chairman  of the Printing Committee to the printing of the document in question is that the cost thus involved would be out of all proportion to the utility of the document. I submit that the information set out in the return is necessary to the proper conduct of Commonwealth affairs.

                        <para>- But its usefulness would be very much enhanced if it were printed and placed upon the ordinary records of the Senate. If it be deposited in the archives, probably nobody but myself will know of its existence. I think that such a document would prove very useful if the Commonwealth ever sought to establish an accident insurance fund in connexion with its employes. It would then have some data upon which to work, and in that way Commonwealth business would be very greatly facilitated. I suggested to the  Chairman  of the Printing Committee that if the details of each accident mentioned in the return were not printed, at least the summary should be printed, which sets out the number of fatal accidents that have occurred, and the amount of compensation that has been paid. To that suggestion, he replied that the printing of the summary would be useless if the other portion of the return were not printed. " Very well," I said in answer to him, " let us have the other portion printed, too." I think I have shown that his objection to the printing of the return upon the ground that the cost thus involved would be out of all proportion to the utility of the document goes by the board. If a document is useful in facilitating the conduct of public business, I do not think that the question of expense should be considered at all. A return was called for some time ago as to the number of officers in the Commonwealth Public Service who were in receipt of more than £300 per annum. That is information which any honorable senator could secure for himself by becoming the possessor of the Public Service list, without putting the Commonwealth to any expense whatever. Yet the Printing Committee thought it desirable to have that document printed. Surely if information of that description is to be printed, we ought to have the information for which I ask printed? What does it matter how many officers in our Public Service are in receipt of more than .£300 a year ? They are probably worth the money, and are being paid for services duly rendered. I repeat that there ought to be some information in the records of the Senate that a document showing the number of accidents which have happened to members of the Commonwealth Public Service is in existence, and how access to. it can be obtained. </para>

No arrangement, however, was made that they should be bound together and sent out to the private addresses of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the documents have been ordered to be printed elsewhere. That seems to me a much more desirable course than that the Senate should order them, to be printed. While I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as to the extreme undesirability of unification, I say that it is not wise that we should take a purely party view of proposals contained in documents presented to this Parliament. Whilst we may strongly dissent from the contents of many papers, the circumstances ought not to be regarded as the one factor in determining whether they should be printed or not. But, inasmuch as these petitions were never presented to the Senate, and that they have already been ordered to be printed elsewhere, I think it is extremely undesirable that we should take action in the matter. . Why should we order the printing of documents of which we know nothing? Either the petitions were not deemed of sufficient importance, or this Senate  was not deemed of sufficient importance to warrant the petitions being fathered here. For that reason I object to the Senate ordering them to be printed. </para>

                        <para>- The work of the Printing Committee has always been carried out, having regard to the one object for which it was appointed, namely, economy. There are four members of the Labour party on the Committee - Messrs. Givens, Croft, Findley, and Henderson. The three other honorable senators who belong to it are Messrs. Cameron, Macfarlane, and myself. I have never seen the shadow of an effort on the part of any member to deal with any proposal other than from the point of view of the purpose for which the Committee was appointed. Its work is well, carefully, and properly done, and I object to work being revised in the Senate in the way now proposed. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> proposal be carried I shall forthwith resign my position on the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- Owing to the voluminous and constantly changing nature of these rules, it would involve an enormous expenditure if, every time a fresh rule was issued, a new bound volume was published. Even if the rules were reissued in a bound form quarterly or half yearly, the undertaking could not be entered upon lightly. But while I draw attention to this disability, I should like to inform the Senate that the matter is now being carefully inquired into in order to determine if it is possible to devise some means whereby the convenience of honorable senators may be served, whilst not involving the Commonwealth in great expense. It is not a matter to be disposed of by simply saying that we can have the statutory rules bound, indexed, and distributed, for the reasons that I have given. If. however, it is possible to devise means by which the statutory rules can be issued in a handy and convenient form, at reasonable expense, an effort will be made to do it. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not exactly understand the extent of the return which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> desires to have printed, nor do I know what new information it contains. But I am of opinion that it ought to be available to honorable senators. I wish to point out to members of the Printing Committee that any member of the Senate or of another place can defeat anything which they may do in the direction of economy by simply obtaining a document which is not printed and, on a motion for the adjournment, or at the first reading stage of a Supply Bill, reading it, and thus putting it into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The question is which 'method is the more advisable and1 economical. I should be sorry if the Printing Committee carried economy to too great an extent. I should also be sorry if amendments for the printing of . documents in opposition to the recommendation of the Printing Committee were carried too often. But there is 'no reflection upon the Committee if at different times certain honorable senators may deem it necessary to dissent from their recommendations. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> meant to reflect upon either the ability or good intentions of the Committee. I am certain that they honestly endeavour to carry out their work in the best interests of the Commonwealth. But when an honorable senator attaches much importance to a document, which he thinks may be required in the near future when serious questions may arise, I am not going to turn my back upon him and oppose, the printing of it. Therefore I feel bound to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> although always ready to admit that the Printing Committee does its duty exceedingly well. </para>

                    <para>. - The attitude assumed by the members of the Printing Committee towards their report is simply that they express the opinion that certain papers are worth printing. We also put on record our view that other papers are not so valuable, and we place the word " No recommendation" against them. If, however, the Senate desires to make a recommendation with regard to any of those papers, it has a right to do so. The Printing Committee has no complaint whatever to make against that course. It is just as well that the Senate should know that the paper which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is anxious to have printed was very carefully considered by the Committee. I take up the same ground as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> did. The information contained in the paper is already available. I take it for granted that these accidents are recorded and tabulated elsewhere. Luckily the accidents have not been numerous, and they affect only one Commonwealth Department, that of Trade and Customs, in which there have been ten minor accidents and one fatal accident, on account of which the sum of ^148 was paid in compensation. This accident took place in Victoria, and I venture to say that there is an official record of it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that Tasmania is so far behind the age as to have no care whatever for humanity. In face of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is a resident of Tasmania, I am satisfied that that State has arrived at the stage when its citizens have some regard for their responsibilities towards each other. In South Australia there were ho accidents, and in Tasmania there were ten. No compensation was paid in that State, because none of the accidents were fatal. If we looked up the records in Tasmania I suppose we should find among the accidents, such cases as that a civil servant sprained his finger whilst sharpening a pencil, and that another, whose boots were somewhat worn, managed to run a nail into his foot, and', in all probability, was given one day's leave of absence on full pay. The return would make a volume of considerable size. In Western Australia there were four accidents; but I know  where I can find a record of the particulars of every one of them. In New South Wales 261 accidents were recorded, and I know where I could find a record of each of them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, there have been 261 accidents to Commonwealth employes in New South Wales, since the beginning of the Federation. The records show that four were fatal, for which the Commonwealth has paid, in compensation, the sum of £451 16s. 6d. I find that in one case a man fell from a horse, and got leave of absence on full pay for one day. In many other cases the accidents were equally trivial. I have gone carefully into the return, and, as I believe it would be a waste of money to print it, I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">In submitting the motion, I need hardly do more than remind honorable senators that the Government regard it as an obligation to suspend further Government business in the Senate until the motion of want of confidence, which is being debated in the House of Representatives, be disposed of. When that will be, probably my honorable friends on the other side can form as just an estimate as I can. It does seem inadvisable that the Senate should adjourn until later than the next ordinary day of sitting, Wednesday next. The Government cannot be held responsible for continuing the debate upon the Ministerial statement in the Senate any longer than was necessary. As honorable members opposite appeared to be ready to go out on strike, perhaps they will be a little surprised at being locked out. I do not wish to say anything further. </para>

We can, therefore, say that the Government were responsible for taking up most of the time in the debate. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Government might have been a little fairer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger than they were yesterday afternoon. After the other ten speakers on the Government side had said what they had to say, they evidently considered themselves free to go where they liked, with the result that honorable senators opposite were unable to keep a quorum to conduct the business of the Senate. It was very unfair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger that such a fine anti-Socialistic oration as that which he attempted to deliver, should have been nipped in the bud. The honorable senator is a well-known anti-Socialist orator. He delivers what the press call lecturettes to the fine society ladies who are putting in their spare time, in a political sense, by organizing lectures, and the honorable senator is the principal entertainer. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly do not wish, sir, to run counter to your ruling, but I thought that a very brief reference to the matter would be permitted to pass without question. On a certain occasion, the  speaker  was very careful to point out that the quotation he was making was placed between inverted commas, because he did not wish, I suppose, to use the remark in its very bald form. Perhaps I may be permitted to apply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger a similar remark between inverted commas, and it is - " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger was damned badly treated." Of course, sir, I wish the remark to appear between inverted commas. The honorable senator has been badly treated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and the other ten speakers on his side of the chamber, who were absent when he was speaking last night. </para>

Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger let the Opposition whip know that there was likely to be a scant attendance, and that the Leader of the Senate would be absent, and could not maintain a quorum to keep business going, I would have done my best to secure for him <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> opportunity to speak. </para>

Honorable senators on this side all know their duty too well to allow themselves to be dictated to by any honorable senator as to when they shall be present or absent. But there is another aspect of the question to which I wish to drawattention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger comes from Queensland. What will the people of that State say when they learn that one of their brilliant representatives here could not get a hearing in the Senate? </para>

In fairness to that State, its representatives here should not be treated in the manner in which he was treated last night. There is an election coming on. </para>

                        <para>- And no doubt the Employers' Federation party will expect to get some support from Queensland. It is scarcely fair to that party that the Government should treat one of its brilliant lights as they did last night. What support can that party expect to receive from Queensland when it is recalled that its leading representative on the anti-Socialist ticket was unable to get a hearing here for his oration? </para>

                        <para>- There was business to be done last night, but the Government were unable to keep a quorum. What hope have they of being able to keep a quorum in the future? I believe that last night's incident is an honest indication of how people in the country regard the position. The Senate is disgusted with the attitude of the Government, and the country is, I hold, equally disgusted. Instead of asking for an adjournment now they ought to be asking for a dissolution, in order to ascertain public opinion. I intend to " assist " them until they do decide to appeal to the country. </para>

Last night we got an opportunity of that kind. On next sitting day we may get another opportunity, but whenever it may arise it will be availed of by members of the Opposition. We recognise that the Government have no right to be occupying their present position. We hold that they reached the Ministerial benches by a piece of political hypocrisy ; by the adoption of tactics which, so far as I am aware, have never before been practised against a Government. </para>

                        <para>- Thank goodness we have now all our opponents in one bag. The position which other States have got into recently by the formation of an Employers' Federation Government is nothing new to Western Australia, because it has obtained there for a number of years. The employers in our State have always been in opposition to Labour. For years there has never been more that one party opposing Labour, and, notwithstanding the excuse put forward by the pseudo-Liberals, it was because Labour was raiding the seats of such Liberals that a member of the present Protectionist Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, has been opposed to Labour at every Federal election. He has been contesting their seats with Liberals even when they have been supporting the Government of which he was a member. </para>

                        <para>- I do not consider it audacity at all. I have never com plained of it. I am simply recounting what has happened at every Federal election in Western Australia. Members of this Government have complained that we were attacking their seats. That complaint has been made over and over again in Western Australia by no less a light than the present Treasurer. We made no complaint, but the so-called Liberals complained of our action. They put forward as their only excuse for joining the Employers' Federation Government that Labour men were attacking their seats. It is the most miserable and paltry excuse which any man could possibly advance for deserting his so-called Liberal principles. I think that I have now made my attitude quite plain. I do not wish to disguise it. Nothing is to be gained by the practice of political hypocrisy. I have recognised the position that has obtained from a Western Australian stand-point for a considerable time. In that State we have never asked for quarter from our political opponents, and certainly we should receive none. In the same way, I do not intend to offer any quarter to the present Government, or to those with whom we have been fighting strenuously for years. When I find a Government practising political hypocrisy, I say that it is our duty to expose it. Only by so doing can the public learn the true position. Had the present occupants of the Treasury benches tabled an amendment upon the Address-in-Reply, to the effect that the Fisher Government were deserving of censure for their failure to offer a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain - which was the one reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> urged that this Parliament should be convened earlier than usual - I might have had some more regard for them than I have. But instead of doing so, a. supporter of the present Government in another place was put up to prevent the discussion of that very matter. I have every reason to complain that no proposal has been submitted in favour of the presentation of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> by the present Government, seeing that it was the one reason which they urged why Parliament should be called together much earlier than May. The only way in which such a proposal could be adequately discussed would be by permitting of an appeal being made to the electors. I am satisfied that the people of Western Australia are almost unanimously opposed to any such proposal. It is true that the Government  have made a sort of left-handed offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the Old Country. Having sand-bagged the late Administration, and having obtained a three weeks' adjournment of Parliament, they offered a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain. Such tactics can be properly rewarded only by allowing the electors to express their opinions of those who practice them. The Government are now in office, and are consequently in a position to control the elections, but despite this manifest advantage, we invite them even now to face the country. We are so satisfied that it is against them that even under the most adverse circumstances the Labour party could not fail to improve their position in this Parliament. If they are so secure in their seats, why do they not accept our invitation, especially in view of the fact that the daily press is behind them? If the Ministry lacked the powerful influence of that daily press they would be the most hopeless politicians imaginable. It requires a good cause to withstand the attacks and misrepresentations of the daily newspapers. That good cause is represented by the platform of the Labour party. We have to fight the entire press of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is a fond hope. I know many gentlemen of the press who entertain similar views to my. own. I believe that the time is not far distant when the Labour party will be rich enough to provide those men with an opportunity to write according to their honest convictions. It is idle to deny that they have not now to write to suit their employers. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> were a newspaper proprietor would he give a! Labour journalist liberty to write for his newspaper according to Labour ideals? The idea is too absurd. If a Labour daily newspaper were established to-morrow it would certainly instruct its employes how they should write. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger who, I am sorry to say, is somewhat of a briefless lawyer, whether he has ever declined a brief, no matter from what side the offer may have emanated? </para>

I hope that I shall soon be in a position to congratulate many of them upon writing their convictions from the Labour side of political questions. We intend to prevent this Government from occupying the Ministerial benches one day longer than we can possibly prevent them. They have gagged Parliament so far by preventing the discussion of the very business that we were called together to transact. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so thin skinned as to mind an interjection, but, all the same, I think that there should be something like decency in debate, and that an honorable senator should not make such an observation the moment he comes into the chamber. I only hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> will talk in that way to me outside. We have all been very much disappointed that the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> question and the defence question generally have not received that amount of attention that should have been devoted to them. It is evidently a very important question, and it should have been fully dealt with apart from all party feeling. </para>

                        <para>- I have been here every day. It was due to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger's oration that the Senate was counted out yesterday. Had I known that there was a danger of a count-out, I should have been only too happy to keep a quorum for him. There is no denying the fact, however, that we have not yet had an opportunity of expressing the opinion of the Senate on the whole question of defence. It ought not to be a party question, but it has been made a party question by the present Government. They threw the late Government out on their defence policy. If, when they met Parliament, they had introduced the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> question straight away, and dealt with it on its. merits, the business of the country would have proceeded in a much more satisfactory manner. We are now in a state of confusion - not fusion - because that course was not taken. </para>

                        <para>- I hold that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> more than any other honorable senator, is responsible for the position, because it was his duty as Leader of the Senate, to introduce the question. The late Government laid their elaborate defence proposals before the country, and I believe that the country will indorse their policy. Indeed, some honorable senators on the Government side indorse it. Why, then, was the late Government dispossessed? The country will not lose sight of the circumstances when it is afforded an opportunity of expressing its opinion. I shall not prolong my remarks, because by doing so I should simply play into the hands of the Government. I desire that other senators should have an opportunity to speak to-day, and shall content myself at this stage with observing that the Government, instead of opposing a short adjournment, should have consulted the interests, of the country by soliciting a full discussion of the defence problem. </para>

                    As I have just returned from the Old Country, I take this opportunity of saying a few words on the situation, with the object of explaining the position in which I find myself. For many years I have been an active opponent of the present Prime Minister. I now sit as a supporter of the Government of which he is the head, because I feel that it is necessary to have proper responsible government in Australia, and to have in office a Ministry supported by one party. There should be only two parties in this Parliament. The time has come when the Labour party should go to the country distinct from all other parties. I quite recognise that.

I shall sit on this side as a supporter of the Ministry as far as my late leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, and others associated with him are prepared to follow out its policy. I shall occupy an independent position on many questions, and especially if the opinions and the policy of the old Deakin Government should be emphatically forced on the country . </para>

                        <para>- Yes; to meet their wishes. After the great delay which has taken place in proceeding with business, I hope that when we meet again, I presume on Wednesday next, the motion of want of confidence will have been disposed of in another place. It will be a great pity if, after coming hundreds of miles to do the business of the country, and after everything has been said that can possibly be said against poor <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> we should still have to listen to a repetition of the same old story.- I credit honorable senators opposite with a desire, according to their own views, to do the business of the country : but I hope they will change their tactics. They appear at present to regard it as their duty to prevent business being done. I hope that if this kind of thing is much longer continued, the Government will avail themselves of the powers they have, and will enforce what, by some persons, is called "the gag." The country expects us to do our duty, and it is felt that we are at present wasting time, and time is something which cannot be recalled. </para>

What would happen then, would merely be that honorable senators opposite would be gagged, as well as honorable senators on this side. I have had some experience of " the gag," and I have never regretted it. In nearly every Parliament in which it has been applied,' it has been proved that its application has worked in. the interests of the minority. We are in the minority now, and we shall not be intimidated, even by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> or if the Government take the honorable senator's advice, and apply "the gag,"' to us on every possible occasion. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the slightest idea whether honorable senators opposite intend to use it or not. That is  something which they must decide for themselves. I was very glad to listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> brief, straightforward, and honest, pronouncement. The honorable senator said that the Prime Minister has behind him a past which does not commend him in respect to the future. I do not propose to say anything about the Prime Minister. All that needs to be said has been said in this chamber more ably than I should ever be able to say it. When a piece of work is well done, it is of no use for an amateur to come along and dab a piece on here and a piece on there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has, for the edification of the people of the Commonwealth, constructed a beautiful mosaic of the brilliant record of the Prime Minister, which, I think, it would be just as well to leave as it is. I was glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> say that he regarded most of the nebulous statement put before the Senate by the Government as padding. The honorable senator mentioned a portion of it of which he does not approve. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> has always been opposed to Labour ; but we have no quarrel with him, or with any man who has been consistently and honestly opposed to the policy we advocate. Our trouble has been, not with such men, but with men who have endeavoured to use the Labour party for their own ends. Some men have succeeded in doing so. Many have attained positions which, but for the assistance of the Labour party, they never would have attained, because they were despised and distrusted by the party with whom they associated themselves after they had got into Parliament on the shoulders of Labour. These are the men to whom the Labour party are opposed, because they believe that such men are not politically honest; that many of them have attained their positions by false pretences, misrepresentation, and, in many cases, by something worse. They decline to have anything to do with people of that character. We have heard of the failure of the Government yesterday to keep a quorum. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger gets up to speak, honorable senators know very well that, in all probability, they are in for four or five hours'' talk, and if there is any public business which they wish to discuss, they usually take advantage of such an opportunity to discuss it outside. I remember that, on many occasions, honorable senators opposite, when in Opposition, wished to have their little caucus meetings outside the chamber, and Labour members of the Senate used to keep a quorum. It was probable that honorable .senators on this side yesterday desired to do the same thing, but I preferred to make a martyr of myself for what 1 considered a public duty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, as I remained here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> would not be able to chasten others in this way if he had not been dodging about the lobbies himself. Honorable senators on the other side had occupied most of the time in the debate, and honorable senators on this side might very well have been allowed to hold a little meeting on public business. By calling the attention of the  President  to the fact that there was not a quorum present, I did what I could to secure an audience for the honorable senator who was addressing the Senate. Neither the  President  nor I could have been expected to do anymore. We have no right to wander through the lobbies, catch hold of honorable senators, and bring them in here, if they do not desire to come. Evidently a number of Ministerial supporters did not think it worth their while to pay any attention to the speech which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger was trying to deliver  I do not think that the reason has yet been given why the Government did not think it worth while to maintain a quorum for honorable senators on their own side. I believe that the real reason appeared in last evening's <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> It said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> had decided to reply to the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> but that the Prime Minister had instructed him not to do so. That, to my mind, is why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger was made the scapegoat of his own party last night. </para>

I think that may be said without derogating from the abilities of other honorable senators. Those statements had reference to the reasons and methods adopted, and the manner of bringing about the fusion of parties. Some of them hit very hard quite a number of the present Ministers. </para>

That, I think, was the hardest thing said of him. It seemed to me that any well constituted Government would have replied to an indictment of that kind, especially when it came from their own side of the Chamber. One could easily have understood that any Government who had a shred of respect for themselves, for those who were supporting them, and for the alleged policy they had submitted, would have seen that some Minister did reply to the indictment, both in their own interest and in the interest of 'their supporters. </para>

No discredit is due to any man who makes the best of a bad job. We can not all speak like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> did. But if any honorable senators had risen to refute the charges he had made, whatever ability they displayed, they would have got credit for at least trying to defend their own honour and character. We had a right to expect an answer from a Minister. But what do we find? While they have a champion who says, "Yes, I am prepared to get up and meet the man who has traduced our public characters, who' described us as hollow hypocrites and public frauds," a note comes along from the Prime Minister to this effect, " Kindly take no notice of it. It is a thing which does not matter in public life." </para>

                        <para>- Have we come to this stage in the public life of Australia that the characters of public men when traduced are not worth being defended? Is that a position which has ever been taken up in a State Parliament? No speech of such importance as the one delivered here by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> the other night has ever been made in a State Parliament without having been replied to in nearly every case by the most prominent Minister present. That is the course which naturally people expect to be taken, because in their opinion the Parliament and the Government owe a duty to the country. I believe that the public will say that some effort should have been made by the Government to refute the charges made against them. Yet we had the spectacle of a Minister who was anxious to take on the job being set down by his chief, who did not reckon it worth while that his own character or the character of his Government,or the character of his supporters, should be defended. Perhaps he did not think that there was any one capable of effectively defending the Government. He may have thought that they were so bad that it was an impossible task to undertake. Whether that was so or not I do not know ; but the action of the Prime Minister speaks for itself. I believe that the Government were anxious to obtain a count-out last night because they did not wish to reply to statements made here by an honorable senator with whom many of them were associated for a long time, whose marked ability is recognised throughout the Commonwealth, and who, at any rate, carried the respect of members of the Labour party when he led the Reid-McLean Government here by reason of the ability he displayed, the courtesy he showed, and the consideration he evinced for all members of the Senate. That was the principal reason why, in my opinion, the debate was allowed to fall through. If the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> had not been delivered I feel quite satisfied that the Government would have kept a quorum last night, to any hour, so that we could listen to the splendid material which had been collected from all quarters of the globe, and was being poured out here for the edification of honorable senators. What the public should know is that the count-out was due, not to honorable senators holding meetings or to anything of that description, but to the fact that there was no possible defence to be offered to the statements, the charges, and the allegations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that the Government wanted to get a count-out and succeeded in their desire. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the motion is put I desire to say a few words with regard to yesterday's incident. I wish to speak with absolute frankness to the members of the Senate and to those beyond its walls. There need be no misunderstanding as to what took place here yesterday, or as to the reason which induced the action taken by honorable senators, both on the other side and on this side. When we saw the spectacle of one member of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> manfully holding the fort, occasionally receiving the light horseman who came in from the outskirts of the campaign like a telegraph messenger, with reports as to how to deport himself and what to do while a council of war was being held immediately beyond the doors of the chamber ; and when we found that another member of the Opposition, who had not been made acquainted with the scheme of operations, was hysterically warned to leave when he ventured innocently to stray into the chamber, it was obvious to any one what tactics were being adopted. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, he was too much; he did his work too well. We have to consider what was the matter before the Senate. Had it been Government business which called for consideration in Government time, I venture to say that those who honour us with their confidence would have seen that a quorum was maintained to attend to that business. My honorable friends on the other side will, I believe, find that whenever any Government business is sought to be carried on, there are enough honorable senators on this side who will conceive it to be their duty to maintain a quorum. </para>

                        <para>- No; for this simple reason : that so far as the Government and the country were concerned, sufficient time had already been occupied with the consideration of the motion. The real trouble with my honorable friends opposite is that, although, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie stated, some six of them had spoken, eight more were waiting with speeches bulging out of their pockets, and ready to be delivered next week. </para>

                        <para>- We recognised that unless a termination was put to the debate yesterday, the whole of next week would be consumed by the delivery of speeches such as those which have caused the midnight oil bill of this city to go up to enormous figures. We knew that there was not one page of a volume of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in the Parliamentary Library which had not been turned down and dog-eared -the result of the investigations which have been going on for the last week or two ; and that the delivery of. all this collected matter was to be spread over the whole of next week. As it appeared yesterday that the Labour party were inclined to go on strike; that, although it was their duty to be here, only one out of fourteen could venture , to be present for any length of time, I wish that fact to go forth. One of our Standing Orders requires that when a count-out takes place the names of honorable senators who are present must be recorded. Now, in the official record of those present when the count-out occurred last night, the only member of the Opposition whose name appears is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> But there were ten Ministerialists in attendance. I purposely abstained from being present, because if political warfare in this Chamber is to resolve itself into manoeuvring tactics, the Government are not going to be left behind. There was no reason why the debate upon the Ministerial statement of policy should have been continued for  a  single moment longer than it was. </para>

                        <para>- I am not complaining. Having fallen into the pit which they themselves digged, the Labour Opposition wished to show that there was an obligation on the part of the Government to keep that debate going. _ They will have some difficulty, I fear, in establishing their claim. I wish now to deal with a statement which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, and which fairly illustrates the frankness that characterizes honorable, senators opposite. He declared that eleven supporters of the Government had spoken upon the Ministerial statement of policy as against eight members of the Opposition. I say at once that in his calculation he has included <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> jas 'a Ministerial supporter, and there is not one single word in that honor-, able senator's speech which justifies his inclusion in any party. The Government would be undoubtedly glad of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> support. I wish again to draw attention to the deliberate attempt which is being made by the Opposition to count out the'"Senate&gt; and to throw the onus on the Government. If they wish to intimate to the constituencies that whilst- they are prepared to sit here- </para>

                        <para>- This violent party in Opposition can launch charges, against individuals, but it is not game to stand up when there is a prospect of replying to those charges. It will make villainous attacks upon its opponents, but it will afterwards slink away like a whipped hound. If I were not in this Chamber I should be tempted to describe the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, by the use of language which you, sir, would deem to be unparliamentary. The honorable senator affirmed that eleven Government supporters had addressed themselves to the Ministerial statement, as against only eight~members of the Labour party. He forgot to point out that in his calculation he had included as Ministerialists, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> ' He also omitted to mention that the time occupied by the members of the Labour party who spoke upon that question was as two hours to one compared with that occupied by Ministerialists. And surely in this instance time is the very essence of the comparison. Honorable senators opposite must be fudged by their transparently laboured efforts to consume time. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> spoke this morning he occupied more than three or four times the time that was taken up by Senators Walker and Macfarlane. I wish the country clearly to understand the tactics which are being resorted to by the Opposition, and to intimate that if such tactics are continued it may be necessary for the Government to adequately meet and defeat them. Although, before this Parliament met there were ' thunderings and threats that Government business would ' be stopped - threats which have been repeated here - the official head of that party has since expressed a desire to proceed with business. I ask the country to contrast that expressed desire with the tactics of the Opposition, which is not present on this occasion. </para>
