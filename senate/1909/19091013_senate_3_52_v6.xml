                    <para>. - A matter which involves tens of thousands of pounds of revenue may fairly be called a matter of urgency. Nevertheless,  I  am sorry to have had to move the adjournment of the Senate.  I  would not have done so but that  I  see no other way of putting the matter before the Chamber in the presence of the fact that my inquiries are mainly met by more or less Departmental bluff. It is not a matter of policy, but simply a matter of administration. Since Federation the Customs have delivered to the tobacco industry large quantities of dutiable goods without collecting any duty thereon, quite contrary,  I  am sure, to the intention of members of both Houses. Let me briefly explain the position. The importers of manufactured tobacco must pay a duty of £392 per ton. What the Australian manufacturer has to pat is divided into two portions. First he must pay Customs duty on the material which he uses, and then Excise duty on his product. The Customs duty comes to £224 per ton, but the Australian maker uses an average of 15 per cent. of Australian leaf, on which he pays no duty, so that the average amount of Customs duty which he pays is £190 per ton. Then he pays Excise duty on the completed product, that is £112, making a total of £302. Therefore, he is left with a margin of £90. That is the lowest estimate of the margin, because there are several other things up his sleeve. In the first place, unstemmed tobacco is subject to a reduction of £56 in the duty. In the second place, if the manufacturer makes his tobacco by hand, instead of by machine, he pays £28 per ton less Excise duty. In the third place, the margins between the duties on cigars and cigarettes are very much larger than in the case of tobacco. In the fourth place, the duty on imported tobacco is levied on the weight, " including the weight of tags, labels, and other attachments," whereas the local maker escapes by paying duty on the net weight. This last matter seems to be only a small one, but when the duties range up to some hundreds of pounds per ton, even this is of some value. Roughly, the industry may be said to work under cover of margins which range from £100 <inline font-style="italic">to £200</inline> per ton; and if the quantity of product which the industry sells in Australia paid duty at the same rate as does the imported product, the revenue would benefit to the extent of between £400,000 and £500,000. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly it is. I am not quarrelling with that position to-day. I am merely attempting to show that a definite procedure has been laid down by Parliament, and that the Customs administration are ignoring that procedure by heaping upon the tobacco industry favours the granting of which this Parliament has never sanctioned. That is the point to which I wish to direct special attention. </para>

                        <para>- That is the only point which I wish to make. The Australian tobacco industry is supposed to pay taxation in two forms - first, by way of Customs duties upon its materials, and, secondly, by way of an Excise upon its product. "But it is being permitted to escape a considerable proportion of the Customs duties to which it is liable, upon the ground that it is paying the Excise duty. That is to say, it is not being called upon to pay the whole amount of the duties chargeable under the Customs Tariff, simply because it is paying the duty which the law has declared it shall pay in the form of Excise upon its product. In this connexion, honorable senators should bear in mind the list which was read in the Senate a few days ago of the quantities of various ingredients which the industry is permitted to import free of duty. I need not recapitulate the items contained in that list. From the information which was given by the Minister of Trade and Customs, it appears that the weight of these goods reached no less than 530 tons. I would remind honorable senators that the duty properly chargeable upon these articles amounted to ^18,000, and, further, that if this weight of tobacco leaf had been used, in lieu of these substitutes, £79,000 more -would have been paid into the public Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- Very likely. But that is not my point. I wish to know where the Customs officials derive their authority to go behind the provisions of our Customs Tariff Act, and to deliver these goods to the tobacco industry free of duty. Section 24 of the Excise Act of 1901 reads - </para>

                <para>I venture to say that no member of the Senate, or of the House of Representatives, ever anticipated that this innocent-looking provision would be used by the Customs authorities in the way that it has been used. I take it that it was accepted by all as a provision pertaining to an Excise duty, which was1 clearly the only charge intended to be levied. Let me now come to the Customs Act. Honorable senators know perfectly well that it is the wish of  Parliament that that Act should be administered in a very stern spirit, and  that wherever any question arises as to the amount of duty chargeable upon any commodity, the doubt must always be decided in favour of the Crown. Section 138 of the Customs Act reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>If any goods enumerated in the Tariff are, or can be, classed under two or more names, headings, or descriptions, with a resulting difference as to duty, duty shall be charged when it is a difference between liability to, or freedom from, duty, and the higher or highest of the duties applicable shall be charged when it is a difference as to two or more duties. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that the instructions to our Customs officials, that the largest amount of duty must be collected, are emphatic. The next section reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Whenever any goods are imported which, in the opinion of the Minister, are a substitute for any dutiable goods, or are intended to be, or can be, used as such substitute, or for any purpose for which such dutiable goods can be used, or for any similar purpose, the Minister may, by <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice, direct that such first mentioned goods shall be charged with the duty chargeable upon such dutiable goods, and the same shall be so charged accordingly. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That provision, too, is very clear and emphatic, and I should interpret it as meaning that if in the manufacture of tobacco a material is used which under the Customs Tariff Act is subject to a less duty thar is tobacco leaf, the duty which is chargeable upon tobacco leaf shall be levied upon the substitute for it. The Customs authorities, however, have not adopted that course. They have not even collected the smaller duty to which these goods are liable under our Customs Tariff, but have delivered them to the tobacco industry free. Now, the spirit in which that Act should be administered is well known to all of us, but I cannot illustrate it better than by. citing a <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice which appeared on 15th November, 1901, within a few weeks of the introduction of the first Commonwealth Tariff. That notice reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>By virtue of the powers conferred by section 139 of the Customs Act, I do hereby direct that " Rice Straw " shall be charged the same rate of duty as Broom Corn Millet, such " Rice Straw" being, in my opinion, a substitute for Broom Corn Millet. </para>

                <para>Now, broom corn millet and rice straw are very humble articles of commerce, but it will be seen that one of these articles was  not permitted to escape duty by reason of the fact that it might be used in lieu of the other article. The Customs authorities have really condemned "their own administration 'by making these concessions to the most highly protected industry in Australia, and by refusing to make similar concessions to other industries. If these can legally be made to the wealthy tobacco industry I should like to know why they cannot legally be made .to the less wealthy brewing industry, which not only pays the Excise chargeable upon its products, but also the duties which are levied upon sugar, beer, and hops, under our Customs Tariff. I freely admit that the Department has acted throughout in good faith, but I submit that the regulations which I have read are such that if the procedure which has been adopted in the case of the tobacco industry had been placed before Parliament, Parliament . would have negatived it. Parliament would have said that the Customs Tariff Act applied to these goods, and that the duties thereon must be collected; if, indeed, it did not say that the higher duties were to be levied. To me it seems that the Department of Trade and Customs itself is not quite sure of its ground, because honorable senators will remember that in reply to my question the Department appended a clause that  was  quite uncalled for, by way nf justification, saying that it must be remembered that these goods paid the Excise duty. But paying the Excise duty does not clear them from paying another duty which Parliament has said they must pay. I might as well engage a vehicle for a two-hours' drive, paying by the hour, and then pay the man for the second hour, and refuse to pay for the first, on the ground that I had paid for the second. That seems to be the spirit observed by the Department of Trade and Customs  in dealing with the tobacco industry. I suggest that the Minister should take this matter into very serious consideration. He should consider whether he has sufficient power to do what is being done. I would ask, further, as I asked briefly last week, that the whole matter should be put before the Minister's colleague, the Attorney-General, for an expression of his opinion as to the legality or otherwise of what is being done. Even if the practice is found to be legal, I suggest .that something still remains for the Minister to consider. </para>

                    <para>[2.52]. - My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> is reviving a very ancient question. I remember that, as Minister of Customs in the State of Victoria in 1895-6, I had to go very fully into the matter. After the most careful consideration I came to the conclusion that there was wisdom in making an exemption in favour of ingredients, such as is now being made by the Commonwealth. I can speak from personal knowledge only of the State ot Victoria, but we have also the experience of other States. Early in the history of the Commonwealth it was determined by the Minister of Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> after very careful consideration, to exempt the ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco from the payment of duty. As honorable senators are perhaps aware, the Excise Act 1901 provides that excisable goods and goods liable to duties of Customs may, in prescribed cases and subject to the prescribed conditions, be delivered free of duty, or subject to such lower duty as may be prescribed, for use in the manufacture of excisable goods. </para>

                        <para>- For the moment I am not quite sure. 1 only remember that the ingredients were exempt. After the introduction of the Commonwealth Tariff, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> after full consideration of all the facts, recommended for the approval of the Governor-General in Council that glucose, spirits, glycerine, liquorice, sugar, spice, starch, starch flour, cigarette paper, cork manufactured tips, flavouring essences, essential oils, and tags should be delivered free of duty for the manufacture of tobacco. In  1905  the whole question was reviewed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, who was then Minister of Trade and Customs, with the result that the previous policy was approved and certain other articles were added to the list of exemptions; namely, saccharine, dried orange peel, fruit juice, vaseline, and petroleum jelly. </para>

                        <para>- I will, however, show what has been the effect upon the revenue. What has been done has been done, not merely as a matter of administration, as has been suggested, but also as a definite matter of policy. It has been done in accordance with the spirit of the policy of Protection which has been embodied in the Tariff. The result has been exceedingly satisfactory. I have not the statistics in regard to all the States. Exempting Queensland for the moment, there are employed in the tobacco industry in the other States something like  3,300  persons receiving a yearly wage of something like  £220,000  or  £230,000. </para>

                        <para>- The encouragement of the industry was the distinct object and policy of our Tariff. The principle which has been followed is not a new one. It is a principle which was previously in force in some of the States. It is a principle which has been in force during the whole period of Federation. When my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> says that Parliament knew nothing about what was done, I reply that the regulations to carry out this principle were, of course, laid upon the table of both Houses of Parliament in the ordinary way. </para>

                        <para>- That may be ; but what my honorable friend says does not affect the argument that I am putting before the Senate. When the regulations were laid upon the table of the Senate, it was competent for any senator to. take exception to them.. They were tabled in  1902.  The honorable senator then had the fullest opportunity of saying whether, in his opinion, the principle followed was a sound or a wrong one. Since that time, moreover, Parliament has revised the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>-I am talking of the principle, and my honorable friend cannot get away from that. In Great Britain also certain ingredients which are not dutiable, are used, as in our case, in the manufacture of tobacco. So we, adopting the British practice, are allowing the ingredients to come in free of duty. If the ingredients were charged duty in the ordinary way, they would have to pay£18,000 or£19,000, but as our practice is to charge on the weight of tobacco, the ingredients having been put into the article, and being necessary for the purpose of making it smokable- </para>

                        <para>- I am only giving my honorable friends the benefit of expert advice. These ingredients, I am advised, are essential to making tobacco smokable. As the tobacco is charged by the gross weight the extra Excise duty which goes to the revenue, is estimated at <inline font-style="italic">£60,000.</inline> It will be seen that we realize three times the duty which would otherwise be charged. </para>

                        <para>- In view of many years' experience, I think it would be unwise to disturb a practice which is working well, and I think, satisfactorily. It is founded on experience, and no just reason has been put forward why it should be disturbed. Of course, if my honorable friends think that it will be fair and just to alter the practice, and incidentally to aim a blow at the industry, that is another matter. It is probable that the consumer would be the first to suffer. I do not know that my honorable friend made any other statement which calls for comment or remark. I think that as Parliament acted with its eyes open it would be very unwise to disturb the present arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- Probably before the discussion is closed the honorable senator will understand the position. I, as a Protectionist, desire that a protected industry should treat every other industry fairly. The tobacco industry is not the only one we have. When the Minister was referring to the remission of" duties on ingredients used in England by tobacco manufacturers, I was surprised that he did not recognise the difference between England and Australia. Take, for instance, sugar. England is not a sugar-producing country ; but, as every one knows, Australia is. In view of the amount of protection which is afforded to tobacco manufacturers, if they pass by white-grown sugar, and use sugar grown by black labour in Mauritius or Java or China, and get a remission of the duty, it is a mean and contemptible action on their part. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell to look at the matter from that aspect. </para>

                        <para>- It all bears on the same question. The Minister has stated that if these ingredients were not used the tobacco would not be smoked in Australia. That is nonsense, as I am sure he knows. On board a man-of-war leaf is served out to the sailors, who manufacture tobacco without using molasses or spirits, or liquorice or printer's ink, or any of the other numerous ingredients which are used by the Australian manufacturers, and theirs is better smoking tobacco than is the Australian article.

                <para>Parliament that the people would not have the article unless they did use the ingredients, and that they are only trying to suit the public taste. Why do tobacco manufacturers use such ingredients as_ liquorice or spirit or sugar, or any other cheap article? Is it done to suit the public taste? On the contrary, is it not done in order to get a larger profit? When it is mentioned that they would have to pay from lod. to is. 6d. or is.  10d.  for leaf, cannot the Minister see the object of the tobacco manufacturers? It is they who create the public taste. In the navy no adulterants are used in the manufacture of tobacco, and it is more wholesome and more palatable than the adulterated article which is jut on to the Australian market. 1 object to the local makers getting any remission of duty when it is detrimental to the productions of other industries. More attention ought to- be paid to the manufacture of tobacco and other articles here than is now paid; In the interests of the consumers an investigation should be made into the accuracy of the - statements of manufacturers who use cheap ingredients. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is to be thanked for the action which he has taken. If he did not take this step seven years ago, probably it was because the remission of duty did not seem to him or any one else such a grievous crime as it now appears to be. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to put the position to Protectionists. Do they not think that they are doing an injustice to a number of other industries just as deserving as the tobacco industry? The fact that the latter is rapidly eliminating oversea competition shows that the Tariff is amply protecting it. But how does it treat other industries? I venture to say that Australia, the home of the vine, can produce as good spirits as can any other country. Spirits are sold as cheaply here as elsewhere. Yet the tobacco industry  imported 12,000 odd gallons of spirits in one year. Why ? Simply in order that they might obtain a cheaper and probably inferior spirit from outside the 'Commonwealth. In doing that they injure an established local industry. When we were dealing with the Tariff <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> put up a good fight, and succeeded in getting a high duty on liquorice imposed in order to assist the manufacture of confectionery. Why should not the tobacco manufacturers use locally made liquorice? Will the Protectionists here say that it is an inferior article? Will they contend that the tobacco manufacturers should be encouraged to go outside the Commonwealth for liquorice? If they .do, look at the position into which they force themselves. According to that argument the local boot manufacturer should get his leather duty free. If the local tobacco manufacturer is to get spirits and liquorice duty free, why should not <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> local boot manufacturer get his leather duty free? Why, too, should not the leather manufacturer get his hides duty free? Although we have a starch industry which is competing successfully against the imported article, yet tobacco manufacturers imported 1,120 lbs. of starch. Again, we have paid a very high price to establish a sugar industry, yet the tobacco manufacturers, in order to avoid paying a higher price in the Commonwealth, imported 184 tons of sugar. According to the Minister, we cannot even produce the little tin tags which are put on the tobacco; We are told that if we produce these articles and compel the tobacco manufacturers to use them, we shall ruin the tobacco industry. That . is the most peculiar Protectionist argument that I have ever heard. Not many years ago the honorable senator told us that Protection cheapened prices. If Protection does not raise prices then there is no need to allow tobacco manufacturers to import these ingredients duty free. </para>

                        <para>- The question has been raised quite, recently by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> and if Parliament thinks it is a reversal of a good policy, it does not matter whether the practice has prevailed' for seven or twenty-seven years. The tobacco manufacturers also use imported' cork, although there is a factory in this city which is supplying cork in various forms to other industries. Although we can manu- facture paper in the Commonwealth, yet the tobacco manufacturers imported no less than £2,272 worth. I venture to think that millions of tags could be purchased for £100. In one year no less than £1,797 worth of tags was imported, and probably the tobacco manufacturers had them printed outside the Commonwealth in order to dodge giving work to the local printers. This practice is resorted to by manufacturers who are making an immense fortune. There are no manufacturers in the whole gamut of protected industries who are making as large profits as they are. It is also questionable whether these ingredients are required. On that point the Tobacco Commission took evidence. Our information was that in England none of these flavourings are used. Practically  the only ingredients which are used there are sugar and water and in some cases spirits. English manufacturers do not use essences, petroleum jelly or starch. Perhaps the Minister will admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> 'Cameron is one of the best authorities on tobacco manufacture in the Commonwealth.

                <para class="block">I pursued a little inquiry upon this subject on my own account, and I will tell honorable senators the real reason why these ingredients are used in the manufacture of tobacco. The tobacco leaf, when it is sold, is quite dry. But it is of a spongy character, and is therefore placed in a steam box where it is able to absorb water to an extent almost equivalent to the weight of the leaf itself. The problem which then faces the manufacturer is, "How much of that moisture can I retain in the leaf, whilst still producing a tobacco which, in our warm climate, will not develop a fungoid growth, and thus spoil?" The manufacturers have discovered that by the introduction of spirits, liquorice, starch, petroleum jelly, &amp;c, they can counteract the .development of fungoid growth, whilst at the same time putting a tremendous quantity of moisture into their tobacco. So that these ingredients are not at all necessary to the flavouring of the tobacco, but are used merely for the purpose of enabling manufacturers to sell moisture in lieu of leaf. To assist in bringing about that result, the Customs authorities are permitting them to introduce these commodities free of duty. </para>

                        <para>- Of course. The bulk of our Australian tobacco is composed of one-half imported leaf, and one-half locally-grown leaf. The imported leaf pays a duty of is. 9d. per pound. But, later, it is manufactures into tobacco, and in that form also pays "the Excise duty. So that, if the tobacco industry abandoned the use of all these ingredients, their place would be taken by imported leaf and Australian leaf in equal proportions ; therefore, we should still collect the same amount of Customs duty, plus the Excise dirty. The result would, in that case, be more beneficial to the public revenue. </para>

                    <para>. - The "Minister of Trade and Customs never fairly faced the position which I put in reference to this matter. T emphasized the fact that the Customs administration was unfair, in that whilst it allowed the wealthiest industry in Australia to import large quantities of various commodities free of duty, it refused to extend a similar concession to the brewing industry. The Minister did not think it well to reply to that aspect of the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I absolutely dispute that statement. I say further that Parliament might .never have known what was taking place. I am sorry that the question of Protection in any shape or form has been introduced into this debate. In my opening remarks I pointed out that Parliament had placed the tobacco industry in a certain position, and that it had accorded to it a very lavish measure of Protection. I complained that our Customs administration exceeded the provisions of our Customs Act by granting concessions of which Parliament knew absolutely nothing. The Minister of Trade and Customs has referred to the practice which existed in Victoria prior to Federation. He may have been familiar with the course which has been adopted, but I say that when the Customs Tariff Bill was before Parliament, there should have been a Ministerial explanation of it. We ought to have been told that if we adopted the proposals then put before us, we should be called upon to sacrifice a great many thousands of pounds of the public revenue. 1 had not then the remotest idea that it was intended to adopt the course which has been followed. I would further point out that the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice making these regulations operative is dated  4th  July,  1002,  and that it is made retrospective as from  9th  October of the previous year. In other words, for ten months after the introduction of the Tariff, on the  8th  October,  1901,  the tobacco industry was allowed to import these commodities free without the knowledge of Parliament. That is not right. There is no honorable senator who has a greater esteem for the head of the Customs Department than I have. I think that the Commonwealth has every reason to be proud of having a man of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston's</inline> parts. But I say that he has made a mistake, and that successive Ministers of Trade and Customs have made a mistake. It was only after the lapse of several years that I discovered that this procedure was being adopted, although I am pretty familiar with what is being done under our Customs laws. Upon every occasion that' I have made an inquiry in reference to it, I have been met with more or less bluff. Only last week,  the Minister of Trade and Customs urged the same view which he has urged to-day, namely, that because these commodities are included in the weight of tobacco upon which duty is ultimately paid, they therefore pay the duty. I would also direct attention to the fact that the honorable gentleman did not reply to my suggestion that the matter, as one of law, should be brought under the notice of the Attorney-General. I would again impress upon him the desirableness of taking that step.I ask leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

                    <para>- Everybody will admit that this is an exceedingly important and absolutely essential provision. I suggest that the prohibition should be absolute. It is a good and proper prohibition. No High Commissioner ought to be even within reach of temptation, or be placed in the position of having to ask the permission or authority of the Minister ; and the Minister ought not to be placed in the position of having to exercise any discretion in such a matter. Therefore, 1 trust that my honorable friend will see that it is desirable to make the prohibition absolute by striking out the words "except as prescribed or allowed by the Minister." Then again, the words " or hold any other office or employment " require some definition to make them workable. For instance, there is such a position as that of a trustee. The High Commissioner might be appointed a trustee under a will or in connexion with the administration of some other affairs. I do not expect that it is intended to disqualify the holder of the office from accepting such a position. Trustees nowadays are permitted to receive emoluments. There used to be an idea that a trustee should not be paid, though he performed onerous duties.</para>

                        <para>- Such an amendment would leave an opening which would probably not be availed of freely. But still, we do not desire to leave an opening at all. The prohibition should be quite effective. I think it is necessary to retain the words. The difficulty suggested as to whether the term " office " is not loose, commends itself to me, but I can hardly suggest at the moment words which would, while preventing the High Commissioner from accepting outside employment, still leave him free to discharge such duties as those of trustee. I do not attach much importance to the words " except as prescribed or allowed by the Minister," because no Government would be likely to give its sanction to the High Commissioner acting in such a capacity unless under peculiar circumstances. For instance, a body might be formed for philanthropic purposes, but might consider it desirable to be incorporated as a company. </para>

                <para>I recognise the force of what has been said by the Vice-President of the Executive Council about philanthropic bodies. In South Australia, however, we incorporate such bodies as institutions; they are not called companies. We use the phrase " Such and Such an Institution (Incorporated)." A company is a body which is incorporated for the purpose of gain. I thoroughly agree with my honorable friend, however, that it is absolutely laudable in every sense that this clause should be effectively carried out. With regard to the other point which I have raised, I suggest that if we leave out the words "office or" we shall avoid any trouble in connexion with a position of trustee or executor. </para>

                    <para>. - The Bill which we are now called upon to consider is in one sense rather peculiar. I do not know whether the attention of the  President  has been directed to it, but I anticipate that some difficulty may arise when we reach the Committee stage, unless a deficiency in the copies we have before us is in the meantime supplied. At the end of the Bill space is left for a first schedule. The words "text of agreement" are used, but no agreement is provided. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has contemplated what may happen if he allows this Bill to get into Committee without bringing forward the agreement; but I venture to say, sir, that if you were appealed to on a point of order, you would hold that the agreement would not be within the scope of the Bill if it were sought to insert it at that stage. One can see, however, from reading the Bill through that the agreement mentioned is a vital part of it. We are, therefore, asked to pass the second reading of a Bill which at present does not contain a word of the essential agreement. The history of the negotiations has been sketched by the Vice-  President  of the Executive Council. Parliament declared that a certain area should contain the future Federal Capital' city. The New South Wales Parliament have passed a series of resolutions intimating their willingness to hand over to the Federal Parliament an area, which, however, is not the territory that was asked for. The New South Wales Parliament practically say to the Federal Parliament, " We are prepared to give you something that you did not ask for, and to refuse you something that you did ask for.

                        <para>- Personally, I think that what New South Wales has offered is in some respects better than the territory recommended. But we are in this unfortunate position. On the map exhibited in the Senate Chamber is shown at a glance the request made by the Federal Government to the State Government, based on the advice of experts. On that map we see represented an area embracing the watershed of the Molonglo and Queanbeyan Rivers. Those rivers are absolutely essential, not for the domestic supply of the Capital city, but for any water scheme which may be required to beautify the city - such as a supply for an artificial lake or anything of that kind. The New South Wales Government say, " Instead of giving you the watershed of the Molonglo and Queanbeyan rivers, we will give you water-rights over those areas." Whatever they mean by water-rights is to be embodied in an agreement which the Government propose to make a schedule to this Bill. Obviously it is of first-rate importance that the Senate, before it agrees to accept another area than that recommended by experts, should know exactly how we stand, in regard to the Molonglo and Queanbeyan watersheds. Because, whilst we may be safeguarded with respect to the domestic supply furnished by the Cotter River, it is nevertheless very important that in a dry country like Australia, and especially in an inland district like Yass-Canberra, we should have such a supply of water available for beautification purposes as would enable the Capital city to be improved by artificial lakes. The Government say that what we have obtained from the New South Wales Government gives us that assurance. Let us consider what is offered. There is an agreement, some clauses of which are not yet finally drafted - a tentative agreement - which provides that the New South Wales Government undertake to give to the Commonwealth Government water-rights over the Molonglo and Queanbeyan areas. Now, I will put it to the lawyers in the Senate - what is meant by water rights? Surely water rights over an area mean, amongst other things, the right to safeguard that area against pollution. Of course the matter of pollution is not of first importance when we are not dealing with a domestic supply. But if we are going to obtain water for beautification purposes we should have it as pure as possible, and it should not be allowed to be made turbid by means of disturbance or pollution. The State Government have police powers over all the water areas in that Territory. I take it, therefore, that they will have the right to say to a resident in a water-shed area, ' ' You shall not carry on an industry which will pollute the river or create a nuisance." If they say that they hand over to the Commonwealth their powers in regard to water rights, does it mean that they surrender the power to intervene with a view to preventing the pollution of water ? </para>

Suppose that the Commonwealth authorities say that the water in a river is being polluted and call upon the State Government to exercise their power, and that the latter say that in their opinion the water is not being polluted. Cannot honorable senators see that immediately a cause of friction will arise between the two authorities ? One will have to be the judge of the question and the other the arbiter. Obviously, in such circumstances, an appeal would have to be made by the Commonwealth to the High Court. </para>

If New South Wales is really handing over to the Commonwealth the water-rights of this area it should hand over its police powers in regard to the water therein. But it is doing nothing of the kind. All that it undertakes to do is to exercise its police powers in the direction of seeing that there shall be no pollution of  these waters. </para>

                        <para>- We shall have a repetition of the difficulty with regard to the use of the waters of the Murray River. The Constitution provides for a reasonable use et those waters provided that the interests of navigation are safeguarded. New South Wales and Victoria are using an ever and ever increasing quantity, and South Australia complains that those States are using such a quantity as to impair the navigability of the river. There we have the divided authority bringing about friction to such an extent that South Australia is about to appeal to the High Court to ascertain what is a reasonable use of the waters. I do not suggest that the Commonwealth should ask for the whole of the rights over the territory. I do not see any reason why we should stand by the Advisory Board's proposition. We do not want to take in a greater area than is necessary for Commonwealth purposes. But if the Molonglo catchment area is desirable for the purpose of beautifying the city and providing a subsidiary supply for ornamental purposes New South Wales should be asked to surrender to trie Commonwealth the whole of its rights regarding the water. That would not, I should think, interfere with settlement in any way. It does seem peculiar to me that the State Government are undertaking to reserve from sale or lease all the Crown lands within the catchment area. If any honorable senator will look at the map on the wall he will see that the greater part of the area is already sold. I do not know what particular benefit there can be in retaining the little portion which is unsold. So far as <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> can see it might as well be sold. To retain the small white patches depicted on the left side of the map and keep them out of use does not seem to me to be a vital matter. If we are to accept the area we should have full police powers over the water, not a sort of divided control. In the past we have had a lot of friction. Surely it is well to avoid friction in future. If New South Wales is in earnest, as I believe it is; if it intends to keep these waters free from pollution, why should it not give the Commonwealth power to act in that direction? That would not interfere with the rights of the State, or with its extension or development. The Commonwealth would merely have that control over the citizens of New South Wales living on the water-shed area necessary to prevent the pollution of water. I am not asking for sovereign rights as regards the Molonglo River, nor do I think that they are necessary. What it is necessary to do is to take full power to prevent the pollution of water. I have read the correspondence on this question which has passed between the Commonwealth and New South Wales. Certainly the Premier of that State has climbed down considerably from the attitude which he assumed a year or two back. But in his letters there is still a tone which seems to indicate that we are acting the part of a suppliant. Take, for instance, his letter of the 26th September, dealing with the proposed alteration of the area. After recapitulating what has led up to the change, he says - </para>

                        <para>- I have never wavered in my belief that Yass-Canberra is not the best site which could be chosen. I still believe, and will continue to believe, that Dalgety was by far the best site. I regret exceedingly that the last decision of the Senate has rendered the choice of Dalgety impossible. On a previous occasion I announced that I, as a member of the Fisher Government, was prepared to abide loyally by the choice of Parliament. But I do so with considerable misgiving, and also with a shade of annoyance, because in the New South Wales Parliament those of us who had been consistent believers in Dalgety were spoken of in a manner which I think was most insulting, which reflected very little credit on the users of the language, and which certainly did not give us any credit for honesty of purpose or sincerity. Here, for instance, is a statement which was made by a member of the Legislative Assembly - </para>

                        <para>- It was used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> A. Holman, a leading member. He ought to have been ashamed of himself when he made" the statement, because it was casting a serious reflection upon a large number of the members of this Parliament, including those who subordinated their better judgment in order to bring about a settlement of this question. Again we find this gentleman urging the Premier of New South Wales to accept an alternative amendment, and that was to offer to the Commonwealth either the area proposed by the Government or the area which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> and others outlined. Practically he said, " The people in the' Federal Parliament are not in earnest, and if you give them a pretext they will use it as a means of delaying the settlement of the question." That was a slander on this Parliament. I do not believe that there are half-a-dozen members in either House who do not sincerely desire to bring about an early settlement. There are some who have openly stated that in their opinion the time for establishing a Federal capital is premature, but even these I contend have been honest in voting for the selection of a site. They did not all vote for Dalgety. Some of those who voted for Yass-Canberra were not in favour of an' immediate settlement of the question. I believe that those who voted for Dalgety honestly believed that it was the best site which could be chosen. The Vice-President of the Executive Council did not tell the Senate the reasons which impelled the New South Wales Government to withdraw the Molongloand Queanbeyan area from the offer. He certainly indicated that in that area there was not the value for Federal purposes which we might anticipate, but we have not heard any adequate reasons for the withdrawal of it. I know that it would add considerably 1o the cost if we had to re-purchase the privately-owned lands in the area. That is one reason why I am prepared to wait, but that is not put forward as a reason. </para>

                        <para>- I read the report of the debate in the State Parliament, but I did not observe that any reasons were given for the course proposed. There seemed to be an understanding which wa&amp; not expressed. In this Bill there is no mention of territory for a railway line to Jervis Bay or of territory at that place. One of the reasons which induced some honorable senators to vote for Yass-Canberra was the possibility of an undertaking that the Federal capital would have an outlet to Jervis Bay, and an area on its shore. But no provision of that kind is made in the Bill. We can only assume that the two things will be provided for in the agreement. We have been supplied with papers which show that an area of two square miles at Jervis Bay is proposed to be surrendered. But if honorable senators will turn to the map they will observe how small that area is. Owing to the contour of the bay there will be less than three-quarters of a mile between the shore and the back of the area to be surrendered for a port. That is altogether inadequate.  1  have circulated an amendment dealing with that proposition, because I think that if we are in earnest we should have such an area as would enable the Commonwealth to have a port of some extent, leaving room for development. At present the Bill is silent on that point. I can only assume that before we reach the Committee stage we shall have an opportunity to consider the question. I shall not further debate the Bill. Provided that the Government see that the Commonwealth is granted the necessary police powers to enable it to protect the waters of the Queanbeyan and other rivers from pollution, I think that the position which has been put before us by the New South Wales Government is a better one than is that which was first submitted by the Advisory Board. I shall require to be satisfied upon the point before I vote for the third reading of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. I was one of those who were sceptical upon that point, and I attacked the supposed defect rather vigorously. The result of that attack has been the submission of further reports, which are of an eminently satisfactory character. These reports come from reliable sources, and we must assume that no State Government would allow reports of a misleading nature to be placed in our hands. The reports assure us that the water supply at Yass-Canberra is ample for all purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Infinitely. I am sorry that that remark should astonish my honorable friend, but it expresses my opinion. In supporting the proposal to advance this question one step further, with a view to removing it from the Commonwealth political atmosphere, where it has been somewhat of an irritant for a long while, I have no regrets as to the past, and no apprehension as to the future. At the same time, I am sorry we have not before us, in the first schedule to the Bill, the agreement with New South Wales, which we are expected to ratify and confirm. Doubtless we shall have it before us prior to the Bill being advanced beyond its present stage. Certainly we ought to have it, before we get beyond the title of the Bill in Committee, because it is scarcely reasonable to ask us to confirm, an agreement which we have not seen. One does not like to apply the common expression in reference to buying a pig in. a poke to the action of the Government, but that is what my honorable friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, with all his great eloquence and with that persuasiveness of which he is a master, is asking us to do. I would urge him to get this omission from the first schedule of the Bill rectified, so that we may have before us the instrument which we shall ratify and confirm by giving our assent to the second reading of this measure. I do not know whether we shall be able to make amendments in the agreement in Committee, or whether we shall be expected to swallow it holus-bolus, as honorable members are expected to swallow another agreement elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- The question of the water-rights which it is proposed to grant to the Commonwealth is one. which requires very grave consideration. I understand that the Advisory Board have recommended that the area indicated in the plan hanging in the most easterly position in the chamber should be handed over to the Commonwealth. The area includes Canberra, and the portion resembling a human leg in shape, without the thigh, embraces the bed of the Cotter River. I confess that I do not like the area, which resembles a horseshoe. I think it would be better to have a more compact area, such as is indicated in the plan which is suspended on the wall of the Senate to the west of the other diagram. But there can be no doubt that the acceptance of the area shown in the other map will most effectually prevent the possibility of doubt and friction arising hereafter in regard to our water rights. My belief is that the reports which have been submitted to us may be absolutely relied upon, so that we need entertain no fear that we cannot secure an abundant water supply for domestic use from the Cotter River alone. That being the case, the other sources of supply within that area are really in the nature of a reserve sup ply. To some extent, that mitigates any apprehensions which we might otherwise have in regard to our acceptance of the area which has been offered to us by the New South Wales Parliament - a compact area which does not embrace the Molonglo watershed - in preference to the area that has been outlined by the Advisory Board, which will give us, in addition to the Capital site, the other rivers which have been mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- I am rather inclined to take that view myself. I am not quite satisfied as to the precise language which is to be employed in transferring to the Commonwealth the area and rights which it is proposed to transfer. From the second resolution of the State Parliament it would appear that State sovereignty, and the exclusive use and control of the rivers included in the area not actually to be transferred to the Commonwealth, are to be retained by New South Wales. State sovereignty, and, what is of more importance, the riparian rights of settlers along the Molonglo and Queanbeyan Rivers, are to be absolutely preserved to New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred to the question of the pollution of the waters of these streams, which is a very important one. If these rivers flow through federal territory, the Commonwealth would have the common-law right to prevent their pollution in the absence of any special statutory provision. A settler on the banks of one of these streams would have the right to protect himself against the pollution of the water by a settler higher up. The Commonwealth water rights will have to be clearly defined ; otherwise a joyful vista of litigation may be opened up, which, in some quarters, would be deplored. The difficulty which I see is that most of the land contained in these watershed areas, appears to have been alienated by New South Wales. In that case, every owner of land abutting on these streams will have his boundary represented by the centres of the channels. </para>

                        <para>- I do. The circumstance merely shows what a patriotic lot of settlers there are in New South Wales, seeing that they are prepared to part with their rights for nothing. New South Wales has been cruelly maligned in the past ; and I am glad to know that she is to be rehabilitated in the eyes of the nation. The statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council certainly gets rid of the stronger point which I was suggesting. But if the settlers have a right to use the land alongside these streams, to the edge of the channel, they also have a right to use the water which flows past their property. </para>

                        <para>- That necessarily would be so. But the Commonwealth, as a legal entity, would be entitled to protect itself by the ordinary legal machinery from interference with its right to a pure and abundant supply of water from the upper streams of the territory. Whatever rights it may be granted in the waters coming down these rivers, will be subject to the present riparian rights of the settlers along them, even in the restricted way to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has directed attention. But those rights exist. The power and control of the State over that area would not be diminished, and those rights could not be interfered with. That is a point which will have to be considered. The Bill declares that this general control should be " subject to the requirements of the Commonwealth." If that expression be properly defined, it may be used in the agreement, and in the subsequent legislation enacted by the Commonwealth and New South Wales Parliaments with a view to preventing difficulty arising hereafter. Unless that is done, I shall pause before assenting to an agreement which is couched in such general terms. Our consolation, however, is that this is merely one step towards the final settlement of this question. I take it that unless the agreement is much more clearly defined than I anticipate it will be, a good many more steps will be necessary before we actually settle the title of the Commonwealth to this territory, and determine the rights which are to be conferred upon it, especially in relation to. this reserve water supply. I hope that the agreement will be of a very definite character in respect of what is meant by " the requirements of. the Commonwealth." Unless those words are clearly defined, the question of what are the requirements of the Commonwealth will always be a matter for judicial determination. In South Australia at the present time we are experiencing great difficulty with New South Wales and Victoria in regard to the use of the Murray waters. We know that in the Constitution an attempt was made to introduce a satisfactory definition. We thought we used terms that were clear enough. The expression used in one section was that " fair and reasonable use " of the waters for conservation and irrigation on the part of any States interested was not to be interfered with. On the other hand, we contemplated that we had provided for the maintenance of the navigability of the River Murray. In my view, whilst irrigation is in this country of more importance than navigability in some respects, still South Australia is entitled to have the navigability of the River Murray maintained in its fullest sense. I therefore think that the term " fair and reasonable use " of the waters of the river for irrigation must be interpreted by reference to that just right on the part of South Australia. I mention that simply for the purpose of showing that, although at the moment, for the purpose of adopting a course of action which may be in the best interests of Australia, we may be content with words which have a merely pious significance - such as " fair and reasonable" and "just requirements of the Commonwealth " - still that will not be enough to insure the National water-rights in respect of this area unless more accurate and precise definitions are adopted. Therefore, whilst I am quite prepared to discuss this measure in a general way, I realize that we are discussing it under difficulties when we have not the agreement before us. We cannot deal freely with what the Government desire us to do with any great confidence until we know what we are going to do. The fourth clause in the resolutions of the New South Wales Parliament provides that the State shall protect from pollution the waters of the Molonglo and Queanbeyan rivers. As I have said, when the Commonwealth becomes the owner of the lands through which these rivers eventually flow, it would be entitled to protect itself against the pollution of them by proprietors of land in their upper courses. But there can be no objection to taking, at the same time, an obligation from the State of New South Wales in aid of our right to protect the rivers from pollution. Then the Commonwealth would have two strings to its bow. It would have its ordinary common-law remedy of protecting from pollution the waters which come to it, and also a remedy against New South Wales if that State did not do its duty in discharging the condition contained in the resolution to which I have alluded. But the Senate may very well be careful as to the so-called water rights, to see that they are properly defined. As every lawyer knows, there is no more difficult and troublesome branch of the law than that which has regard to water-rights. I may add that there is no branch of the law which is more ill-defined and more difficult to pronounce an opinion upon. Therefore, I suggest to my honorable friend in charge of the Bill that before he goes any further he should get the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> - who is very conversant with this question of water-rights by reason of his exhaustive and able investigation of the River Murray matter - to consider carefully the question which has been raised bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> with whose caution I entirely agree. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, with the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> should be able to satisfy us that precision and clearness have been obtained to such an extent that the possibilities 'of litigation and trouble with New South Wales are avoided. It would be a very great pity if we adopted an agreement which would be provocative of a long and bitter dispute, which might keep open the Capital site question for generations to come. As to the other matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> affecting Jervis Bay, whilst I have no objection to the residents in the Federal Capital area having access to a seaport or a watering-place not too far away, still I never have entertained the view that it is necessary that the Capital of the Commonwealth of Australia should be a seaport town. I do not believe that it should. I like the idea of having our Capital well in the interior of the country. I have never been much moved by the argument that the Capital city should be a great commercial port. But, at the same time, I agree with my honorable friend that if there is to be access to Jervis Bay, the agreement should insure us "control over the line of communication - that is, a railway - to the Bay. I cannot at present go quite so far as my honorable friend does in suggesting that an amendment should be made providing that a considerable area at Jervis Bay should be handed over as part of the Federal territory. I have no objection to that if the New South Wales Government chooses to agree to it. But I doubt whether I should be prepared to force such a demand upon them just now.' It is enough for us to get the Federal territory. If we can, in addition, agree that we shall obtain access to the seaboard, that may be quite sufficient for our purpose. Possibly, a Commonwealth wharf would be useful, but I should be very sorry indeed to see a sort of commercial adjunct to the Federal Capital . established at Jervis Bay. I want the Federal Capital to be far removed from the possibility of bombardment from the sea, and I do not want to see anything like a commercial port established in connexion with it. It would be a misfortune to have a port under the control of the Federal Parliament. These are all the observations I wish to make. If a division is to be taken on 'the second reading now, I shall only consent to it with the reservation that the agreement must be discussed in its details, and be subject to amendment, if necessary, when we get into Committee. But I should very much prefer that, before we adopt the second reading, and in principle ratify the agreement, we should enjoy the humble privilege of knowing what the agreement we are adopting really is. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator wishes to fire off interjections at me he will probably get a Roland for his Oliver which he will not appreciate. I consider that Dalgety was the best site offered in New South Wales. I was largely influenced in favour of that view by the fact that Dalgety unquestionably has an unrivalled water supply. There is no other river in New South Wales which can compare with the Snowy as a source of water supply for a great city. The Snowy River at Dalgety comes down in great volume from the Snowy Mountains, and furnishes a copious supply of the priest and best water. Another recommendation which weighed with me was that Dalgety is situated in what is at present, comparatively speaking, a wilderness, though a country capable of development in the highest degree. I believe that if Dalgety had been selected it would have meant adding a new province to Australia. It would have completely opened up the south-eastern corner of New South Wales and the north-eastern corner of Victoria. Thus an advantage would have been conferred on the whole Commonwealth. A population of 250,000 would probably have teen settled in that locality within a comparatively short time. But the Federal Parliament having decided to adopt another area, I shall not offer any factious opposition to the passage of this Bill. After voicing my opinion I shall do all I can to enable the measure to become law. Looking over the papers which have been circulated in reference to the Capital site, I must say that the Government has not been lax in supplying us with all available information. Studying the documents with care I have to admit that many of the objections which I formerly had to the selection of Yass-Canberra have now been removed. In the first place, we now have it on unimpeachable evidence that the water supply can be considered as fairly adequate to the requirements of a city such as we hope the Capital of the Commonwealth will become. That is a very important point. On that ground alone a strong objection which I had to the selection of Yass-Canberra, is to a great extent removed. But I see an objection to the alternative scheme which has been placed before us. The New South Wales Government guarantee that the waters of the rivers flowing through the Federal territory shall be kept free from pollution. But as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has very cogently urged, riparian rights are very difficult to define. I am of opinion that there is nothing which will give the Commonwealth absolute power to insure those rivers against pollution except the possession of sovereign rights over the territories through which they flow. </para>

                        <para>- I desire that the Commonwealth shall be protected from friction with any State. We have had too much trouble of that kind. It would not be advantageous to the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth that we should have any more friction. Unless we possess sovereign rights over the areas through which these rivers flow, we shall have to rely upon the administrative action of New South Wales. The members representing the localities affected in the New South Wales Parliament would be pulling this way and that, urging private rights and State rights as against Commonwealth rights ; and it might well be that the rights of the Commonwealth would disappear in the struggle. The Commonwealth Parliament would not be represented in the New South. Wales Legislature, where the question would be finally decided. For that reason, I am rather inclined to think that the original scheme was the better one, because it would have given us not only absolute control over the Cotter River territory, but absolute control over the rivers flowing through the Commonwealth territory in other directions. We should thus have been enabled to insure those rivers against pollution. It must be apparent to anybody that if rivers flowing through a city became polluted the public health is likely to suffer. Unless we have sovereign rights over the territory through which- they flow we cannot be certain that they will not be polluted. That is why I prefer the original scheme to the alternative one now offered to us. It is true that the New South Wales Government have promised to give us a right of access to Jervis Bay ; but the opportunity they give us for developing the territory there is of the most meagre character. We are offered a territory of two square miles at Jervis Bay. The time may come when it may seem desirable that, the Commonwealth instead ot establishing naval dockyards within the territories of States, should undertake shipbuilding within its own territory. </para>

                        <para>- Already we have a dispute as to where the torpedo boat which has been ordered in sections shall be put together. Hardly a week passes without questions on the subject being asked in the other House. We know that there is a strong movement to have the work done in Melbourne, but the Williamstown people point out that theirs is the best site in Australia for the purpose. We have even been told that there is no place which possesses such* fine facilities for doing the work ns do the Newport Railway Workshops. We have the Melbourne press arguing most strenuously that the claims of Melbourne and Williamstown should not be overlooked. The Premier of New South Wales, on the other hand, says that there will be "a fine old row " if anything of the kind is attempted. The aim of this Parliament should be to avoid the possibility of the occurrence of such rows. This work is not the business of New South Wales or Victoria, of Sydney or Williamstown, but the business of Australia. To avoid the possibility of friction and rows the Commonwealth should do the work on its own territory. In the past we have had too many of these Inter-State jealousies, and it is time that they were stopped. I hope that the Government will insist that a naval dockyard shall be established on Commonwealth territory. We were told as one of the arguments why Canberra should be selected, that for the purpose of naval training or manoeuvres there was no finer bay iri Australia than Jervis Bay. It was urged that the British Squadron in Australian waters used to go there every year for practice. If these arguments were sound - and I think that to some extent they were - we should have on the shores of that bay a place for a dockyard for the navy which we hope to build, and a place for establishing ship-building yards. On our territory we should have every facility for doing the work which is required by the people to be done for the service of Australia. I do not intend to debate the second reading of the Bill at length, because this question has been so often before the Senate, and the <inline font-style="italic">-pros</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">cons</inline> have been discussed in so much detail that there is nothing new to be said on either side. There is, however, a very grave oversight to which I desire to draw attention. Clause 8 contains a provision that the laws of New South Wales are to apply to the territory until such time as this Parliament otherwise provides. That in my opinion is essential, because otherwise from the moment that the Commonwealth took over the territory until this Parliament enacted some laws it would be a sort of happy hunting ground for everybody, and we should have no law except the common law of the Empire. There is another equally important matter .which has been omitted. The Bill provides that on a day to be hereafter named by proclamation the territory shall become vested absolutely in the Commonwealth. From that moment every citizen in the territory will be a citizen of the Commonwealth only, not a citizen of New South Wales. Every one of these citizens will continue to use dutiable goods, but to whom is the amount of the Customs duties thereon to be paid? </para>

                        <para>- We have to consider this Bill in view of the laws as they are, not as they may be. We have no guarantee as to what the law on this subject will be next year. We have no right to assume that any Bill will become law. We should legislate for things as they are at present. Even if what the Minister assumes should prove correct, it will not be an injury to the Bill to make the provision which I have suggested. In Committee, I shall move an amendment in that direction, but I would much prefer that the Government should submit the necessary provision. I do not know what the population of the suggested territory may be, but, be it 500, or 1,000, or 5,000, the revenue derived therefrom must belong to the Commonwealth, and the State must have no claim upon it. I think it is not asking too much to ask the Minister that that should be done. If possible, I shall try to substitute Dalgety for Canberra. But, if I fail to make that substitution, I shall give the Minister every possible assistance to pass the Bill, and I hope that, after it becomes law, there will not be an hour's unnecessary delay in arranging matters, so that the Commonwealth Parliament and Government can be housed on Federal Territory at as early a date as possible. </para>

                        <para>- I think that almost every 'member of the Senate who had the privilege of listening to that exposition of its principles will admit that the Minister failed to understand what the Bill really means. There are certainly one or two principles involved which any one might understand. It is very difficult for a layman to discuss a measure which, apparently, from beginning to end bristles with legal technicalities. But there is at least one thing which I think that even a lay mind can thoroughly understand, and that is that the appointment of the InterState Commission under the provisions of the Bill will be fatal to the adoption of some of the industrial principles which many of us have advocated for years. It would appear that the Government have hit upon a plan for wiping out existing provisions regarding industrial legislation, and relieving themselves of the responsibility of carrying into effect principles which some of them have advocated for the past few years. They have designed the Bill, I think, to relieve themselves of the necessity of having to go further with their new Protection proposals. By this means they will get a body of men, who, like the Dublin Corporation, will stand in a position to be uninjured in either body or soul for the term of seven years. By the creation of that body, the Government will be entirely relieved of all their pledges in regard to industrial matters. Of course, there are one or two Ministers, perhaps more, who have always professed a very strong opposition to industrial provision? which their colleagues have heartily supported. It appears to me that the Ministry have brought in this measure in order that, both individually and collectively, they may be entirely relieved from the promises which they have made on various platforms and in Parliament, where some Ministers have expressed themselves emphatically in favour of adopting a system which would insure an equal protection to employer and employe. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the slightest idea, but I suspect that those members of the Government who expressed themselves as being desirous of doing this justice were simply playing for the position which they then . held.- They are now prepared to abandon the whole of their protestations, and walk behind colleagues who never did have any intention of giving industrial protection to the workers of Australia. That is the only logical view which I can take of the Bill, and certainly it is the only construction which I can put upon the speech which was delivered by the Minister of Trade and Customs in moving its second reading.  His  one object appeared to be to avoid a straightout declaration as to what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the industrial welfare of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That was certainly his aim. When some members of the present Government, who were members of a former Deakin Administration, professed their anxiety to assist those who are engaged in the lower grades of industry, I was willing to help them, and with that end in view, I gave them nev hearty support. But now that some of them are desirous of abandoning every principle which they have avowed upon the floor of this Chamber, it is time for me to reconsider my position. Their expressions of sincerity in regard to the new Protection will have to be very different from what they have been hitherto before I can support this measure. It appears to me that the Government wish to create an Inter-State Commission merely for the purpose of bolstering up a few worn-out politicians who have rendered faithful service to a certain section in this Parliament. The Government are seeking to find a way out of political life for these individuals for a . period of seven years. </para>

The Government desire to provide them with offices in which they will have power to keep those who are employed in our Australian industries in the grovelling position which they have occupied for years. In other words, the Commission will simply be a sort of glorified council of the Employers' Federation, and its every act will be in the direction of strengthening that organization, whilst the worker and his anticipation that he would derive some benefit from the operation of a policy of new Protection, will be entirely blotted out. </para>

                    <para>. - The Bill with which we are dealing would, perhaps, never have seen the light had it not been for the political changes which occurred at the commencement of the present session. It is true that an Inter-State Commission Bill was introduced into the first Commonwealth Parliament, because at that time preferential and differential rates were operative, . unfair railway and wharfage rates, and harbor dues, which were interfering with trade as between the States, and which were designed for that very purpose. But, as the result of the introduction of that Bill, the Railways Commissioners of the different States met in  1905,  and abolished differential railway rates. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that differential wharfage rates are operative, but they .are not of serious consequence. In America, the evil which the appointment of an Inter-State Commission was intended to remedy was that of differential railway rates. The possibility of the re-imposition of similar rates here does exist, if the Railways Commissioners chose to tear up the agreement at which they have arrived. But what was the force which impelled them to arrive at that agreement? It was the knowledge that this Parliament has power to create an Inter-State Commission. Therefore, until we have proof that there is a likelihood of the Railways Commissioners abrogating the agreement at which they have arrived, we ought not to be in a hurry to establish this costly tribunal. The amount which it is proposed to pay to its members in salaries alone is <inline font-style="italic">£6,500</inline> a year, so that I venture to say the total cost of the institution will be about £30,000 annually. For the sake of an imaginary break away from the existing agreement, is it worth while setting up such a costly Commission? </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that. That is another reason why we do not need to establish this secondary tribunal. Of course, I can quite understand the view which was entertained by the members of the Federal Convention in respect of this matter. The knowledge that differential rates existed in each of the States, and the experience of America in this connexion, doubtless impelled them to embody in the Constitution provision for the appointment of an Inter-State Commission. But I would point out that whereas in America the railways are owned by private companies, in Australia they are owned by the people. Consequently, there was reason for the creation of a similar tribunal in America, which does not exist here. We all recognise that public opinion is growing more hostile to attempts to drag trade to other than its geographical outlet. If we regard this Bill merely as one which is intended to provide for the functions which would be ordinarily discharged by an Inter-State Commission, its consideration may very well be deferred. There is nothing to be gained by passing it. It embodies a costly and unnecessary scheme. I venture to say that the real reason for its introduction is a desire to save the face of the Government on the question of the new Protection. They promised that they would establish some sort of tribunal to deal with that question. They do not desire to deal with it upon its merits, and consequently they propose to tack it on to the Inter-State Commission provisions of this Bill. They seek to tack on to clauses relating to the appointment of an Inter- State Commission, provisions relating to industrial matters, in the hope that by so doing they may secure the support of both sections in this Parliament, and thus insure the passing of the Bill. In moving the second reading of the measure, the Minister of Trade and Customs declared that the policy of new Protection had been operative for years prior to the passing of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. That policy may have been recognised theoretically, but effect had never been given to it. He also stated that the Tariff Commission had recommended that the workers in our industries as well as the manufacturers should be protected, thus implying that the introduction of the new Protection was based upon that recommendation. If the honorable gentleman is not better informed than that, he ought to be. As a matter of fact, the idea underlying the new Protection was first proposed in the House of Representatives by' a member of the Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> when the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act was under consideration. Prior to that, I took action in the Senate, and secured a recognition of that doctrine in the Sugar Bounties Act. That is the Statute in which legislative expression was first given to the principle of the new Protection. Subsequently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> took similar action in reference to the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Bill. As a matter of fact, a Bill which was prepared by the former Deakin Government was actually held in abeyance for several weeks, pending the formulation of a. scheme by the Labour party to give effect to the new Protection. </para>

                        <para>- The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act was passed to deal with a special case. The plan embodied in that Act was afterwards taken up by the Labour party, worked out in detail, and suggested to the Government, which adopted it. The Minister of Trade and Customs also said that from certain interjections from this side of the chamber he inferred that the Labour party had apparently swung round in regard to their administration of Wages Boards. That was an unfair statement. We have not changed our attitude regarding Wages Boards. In the State of Victoria particularly the Labour party has enthusiastically supported Wages Boards, though it is dissatisfied with the sort of Boards, which have been established. In Western Australia we have had no admiration for . the Wages Board system. We have fought strongly for an Arbitration Court, which has done excellent work. The bulk of the Western Australian industries, both rural and urban, are working under the Arbitration Court to-day. I say also that, in proportion to our population, the awards of the Arbitration Court in Western Australia extend over a greater area than do the decisions of the Wages Boards in Victoria. The Minister referred to a recent award of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins as a reason impelling us to swing round in  favour of an Arbitration Court. He referred to that award as a passing circumstance. I regard it as marking an epoch in the industrial history of Australia. I do that, not because, it was the award of an Arbitration Court, but because it expressed a vital principle which in industrial matters will, I venture to say, hold more and more the imagination of the people of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins laid it down as an axiom that a fair and reasonable wage is such a wage as will enable a man, with his wife and family, to live up to a reasonable standard <inline font-style="italic">0i</inline> comfort, to make provision for sickness and old age, and to educate and bring up children as they ought to be reared. This was the first time in the industrial history of Australia that any Court had laid down that axiom, and it was a statement of principle which has since been regarded by every other Industrial Court in Australia. It constituted a challenge upon which every other Industrial Court has had to express itself. I shall deal later with some comparisons between the decisions of Arbitration Courts in reference to that principle. The Minister also said that the Labour Government were very indefinite in regard to this subject. In the Governor-General's speech, however, there was this paragraph - </para>

                        <para>- What can we expect from Tasmania? A few weeks ago a Factory Bill was discussed in the Tasmanian Parliament. The Labour party tried to introduce into the measure the Wages Board provisions of Victoria. The Tasmanian Government opposed the amendment, and said that they intended at a later date to bring in a Wages Board proposal. But what is the present position of the Tasmanian Government which promised the Prime Minister to deal with this question? It has already been challenged, and was only saved from political extinction last week by two members staying away when the division took place. </para>

                        <para>- Take the case of the paper-making industry. It is a protected industry. A proposal was brought forward to establish a Wages Board. It was pointed out in debate thai there were adult women getting from 13s. od. to 25s. a week, and adult men getting not more than 38s. a week. It was urged that a Wages Board should be established to secure higher wages for the employes. ' The proposal was carried in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and sent up to the Legislative Council. But that body rejected it by a large majority. Can honorable senators believe that a Legislative Council which refused to give the paper-making industry a Board, would be likely to support a measure, the object of which would be to enlarge the area of industrial legislation? Can we believe that such a body would give to the Federal authority a greater power than it would establish within its own State? The Minister of Trade and Customs must think we are simple if he believes he. can induce us to accept any statement of the kind. In South Australia, where there is a Wages Board system the Legislative Council is just as hostile to the establishment of more Boards as is the Legislative Council of Victoria. The system was delayed for years in that State through the Legislative Council refusing to pass the necessary regulations. In Tasmania there is a Legislative Council than which we cannot expect to find a more perfect example of Conservatism anywhere. How can we expect that a legislative body over which the Government have little or no control would be willing to hand over further industrial power to the Federation? I come to another difficulty in connexion with this matter. Let' us assume that one or two of the States make the necessary references to the Commonwealth Parliament. Under the terms of the Constitution the Bill now under consideration will then apply to those States and those only. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> in his speech blundered once or twice in dealing with that point. He made the statement that if one or two' States made the- reference and others did not, the Inter- State Commission would apply to those that took no action, as well as to those which did. </para>

                        <para>- Why not alter the Constitution in the first place? We might by an alteration make the chain complete forthwith. That is the right way to proceed. If we cannot make the chain complete we have no right even to pass this measure. If, of course, the people prefer to leave the matter of industrial legislation entirely to the States, they can do so. But if the great bulk of the people want to make the chain of industrial legislation complete, the right and honest way is to alter the Constitution, giving the necessary power to the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that the Constitution makes it possible to adopt this method. But what is the impelling reason for interfering in industrial matters at all? Is it not a fact that through the absence of industrial regulations in one State an unfair advantage is given to it over other States? The force behind the cry for new Protection was that we should have one area for Tariff Protection and one for industrial Protection. This Bill does not provide for that. It still leaves it open for any State to refuse to give the Commonwealth power to legislate, and if any State decline to refer the subject to us this Bill will not apply to that State. </para>

                        <para>- So far as any useful purpose will be served, until all the States make the reference to this Parliament, this Bill might as well not be passed. Does not the Minister see my point, that we shall be no " forrader" until that event happens? Until then there will be a gap in the fence. If an appeal is made to prevent unfair Inter-State competition, nothing can be done until all the States have made the reference. Therefore, this Bill, if passed, will be simply futile legislation, and cannot possibly accomplish its object. We should waif until all the States have acted. </para>

                        <para>- Apart altogether from the industrial aspect of the question, there will be considerable opposition to Western Australia surrendering to the Commonwealth any of its industrial powers, even the power of revision. There will be a sort of combined opposition offered to a proposal of the kind - the opposition of those who oppose any passing of industrial powers to the Commonwealth, and the opposition of those who think that this legislation is futile and inadequate. That opposition will be felt in every State Parliament. In so far as it professes to. introduce new Protection, this Bill is an altogether inadequate machine for the purpose. </para>

                        <para>- That is the statement of a man who thinks that the resources of civilization are exhausted. If that is the case this Parliament ought to be dissolved. But the very fact of our passing laws is an affirmation of the principle that the resources of civilization are not exhausted. In his speech the Minister of Trade and Customs stated that the Wages Boards of Victoria apply to  68,000  workers. If he will permit me to say so, that was rather a slipshod way of stating the position. In his report for  1909,  the Chief Inspector of Factories shows that the employes in the registered factories number  76,210,  and that rates of pay have only been fixed for 55.000, that is for  73  per cent. of the total number. There are fifty-nine Boards, who represent  67,000  workers, but wages have been fixed for only 55,000 employes. There are fifty-one determinations in force. In order to show how limited is the jurisdiction of the Wages Boards, let me point, out that, on page 17 of his report, the Chief Inspector of Factories states that the Agricultural Implements Board applies to cities and towns, to the railway riding of the Shire of Braybrook, and to portion of the Shire of Bungaree. That is typical of a number of industries. The Factories Act has a very limited application. Although there are 76,210 employes in the registered factories, yet, according to a return issued 'by the Government Statist, there are 93,808 employes in the manufactories of the State, so that practically only one-half of the employes in the manufacturing industries are under Wages Board determinations. I find that the wages paid represent 21 per cent, of the value of production, and that the average wage is <inline font-style="italic">£68</inline> per year. The Wages Board system of Victoria has one great weakness. A Wages Board has no power to limit the number of apprentices. This is so great an evil that it was stated on oath before the Arbitration Court the other day that in some factories there are twelve apprentices and improvers to seven journeymen. That is a serious position, because it means that a large number of immature tradesmen are being turned out, and that boys are doing a lot of work which men should do. Any man who has had much experience of industry knows that there are two ways by which labour can be exploited, namely, either by low wages and long hours or by employing a number of boys in place of men. The Wages Boards of this State are absolutely without power to deal with the excessive use of boy labour. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the South Australian Act is modelled on the Victorian Act. A further weakness of the Wages Boards system of Victoria is the limitation of districts. Let- me give a few instances. The artificial manure trade applies to cities and towns and to part of the shires of Braybrook and Moorabbin. The Wages Board fixed the wage at 40s. 6d. per week ; an appeal was made by the employers to the Appeal Court consisting of a Judge of the Supreme Court, and the wage was fixed at 36s. per week for adults. Again, the boot trade applies to cities and towns, and to the boroughs of Eaglehawk, Kew, Geelong West, Newtown, Chilwell, and Sebastopol. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but it only confirms my statement as to the impossibility of making Australia one fiscal area and one industrial area. In the case of the stripper harvester industry, a firm was established at Ballarat, and the proprietor was charged with having deliberately shifted his works for the purpose of escaping an award, so far as moulders were concerned, to a shire outside the scope of the Wages Board. Whether he did it for that purpose or not, he did for some time escape the determination of the Wages Board. Under this Bill, the law in Victoria, as in other States, will remain as it is. It will not alter in one iota the State law, which will still be unlimited, and allow an appeal to the Court. At some trouble, I ascertained what wages the Boards have awarded. I found that the average wages range from 28s.10d. to 66s.10d. per week for adult males, and from 10s.11d. to 43s. 9d. per. week for adult females. The average wage for all employes is <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 7s. 6d. per week.I now come to the question of the Appeal Court; and it is a most serious question. </para>

                        <para>- I have pointed out that, even in the State arena, whilst the Arbitration Court deals with wages, hours of labour, and regulation of apprentices, it leaves a tremendous amount of material which is dealt with by means of the Factories Act. In Western Australia, we differentiate between the two in that way. Our Factories Act deals with the general industrial conditions. Sanitation, space, protection of machinery, are of vital importance to the worker, as every man who has been inside a factory knows. These things we are prepared to leave to the State, but the hours of labour, the rates of wages, and the number of apprentices, are the elements which determine InterState competition; and these we say should be dealt with by Federal enactment. </para>

                        <para>- It would take too long to tell the honorable senator what is in my mind. I will content myself with saying that it can be done, either by means of a stamp duty, or by fixing a selling price. I now come to a further weakness which marks the Wages Boards of Victoria and South Australia, and which will probably apply to the projected Wages Boards in Tasmania. I presume that the model Bill will be based very largely upon the Victorian and South Australian Acts. This Bill contemplates that an appeal can only be made to the Inter-State Commission, on the motion of a Court, and, therefore, an Appeal Court or an Arbitration Court is necessary. Having had his wages fixed, an employe will be subject to an appeal to the Industrial Appeal Court; but there he cannot claim a wage which will enable him to marry and keep his wife and children. The very first principle laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins - that "mere passing circumstance" which the Minister referred to - is wiped out. In the fellmongers' case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a'Beckett laid it down clearly that there can be no marriage recognised by the Wages Boards of Victoria. </para>

                <para>Sitting for the first time in the Court of Industrial Appeals, I am asked by the employes in the fellmongers trade to revise a determination as to the hours of labour and the rates of payment. </para>
                <para>In entering upon this duty I have to determine the principles which should guide me in discharging it, and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hood, the first Judge of the Court, I find the greatest difficulty in discovering from the Act what Parliament intended to be the governing considerations for the Special Boards and for the Court that hears appeals from them. (He here quotes from Justice Hood's previous decision :  - " I take the current as the only fixed factor and make it the starting point. If nothing is said against it, I assume that it is correct. That assumption, however, can be displaced with the utmost ease. It would vanish if it was shown that the current rate had been arrived at by reason of combination or oppression or over competition either amongst employers or employed, or if any serious change in the previously existing state of things was proved..... ") </para>
                <para>I was urged, as was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hood, to fix a new standard on a liberal estimate of human needs, and of the provision for them which should constitute the just reward of labour, though doing so might cause an industrial upheaval which would shake all industries within the operation of the Act. </para>
                <para>I answer, as my predecessor did, that on reading the Act I can find no indication of any intention that Wages Boards should resort , to such a radical readjustment of the relations of employers and employed ; and, as I have said, the Act intended Wages Boards, not Judges of the Supreme Court, to settle those matters. . . . I now proceed to consider the demand for an increase of wages. </para>
                <para>One of the grounds set out in the demand is that the cost of living has increased during the last five years. . . (after dealing with evidence as to cost of living increased) .... it does not follow that an all round increase of wages should be enforced under these Acts whenever a rise in the cost of living occurs. (He then points out section 122 of Act compels him to take into consideration effect of award on industry.) </para>
                <para class="block">That is important, in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins took quite a different view. Section 122 amounts to a mandate that an industry must pay its employe's a living wage. Here he refers to the arguments of counsel in the following terms - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in the Harvester case has shown what " fair and reasonable " mean. That is, a wage which will support in frugal comfort, not only the employe himself, but his wife and three children. This wage at the present cost of living cannot be less than 42s. a week. You must, therefore, in devising the present determination, begin, by giving the man placed lowest in it 42s. a week. This argument ... of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> is supported by reference to the judicial pronouncement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon, of South Australia, sitting as Judge of the Industrial Court of Appeals under an Act almost the same as ours. . . . The decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, sitting in a Federal Court, under a Federal Act, does not bind me, and if I dissented from it I ought not to follow it. But my construction of our Act involves no dissent from the attractive doctrines of the Harvester case. I concur in all that is there said of what is necessary to constitute the frugal comfort of the working man. On the evidence as to household expenses before me, evidence of the same character as that which was before Justice Higgins, I think that the 42s. per week fixed by him is a proper allowance......... The discussion of whether a living wage was intended to be prescribed is of no practical importance unless" living wage " in section 122 means a wage sufficient to support a man, his wife and family, for there can be no doubt that the minimum of 36s. is more than a living wage for the man himself . Looking at the object of section 122, I think the living wage there contemplated is a personal wage. It is a section to safeguard an endangered industry, to preserve it from destruction, and it would be a strange way of doing so to insist as a condition to its existence, that the least  it should pay to any of its employes should be a wage large enough to support a man, his wife, and family. ... As a matter of construction, I say that the Act does not prescribe as the lowest wage to be fixed by a Wages Board, a wage which will support a man and his wife and family in frugal comfort. There is no appeal from my decision. If I have misconstrued the Act, Parliament alone can correct my mistake. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Here is a Judge who, upon the evidence, declared that there was absolute proof that a man could not maintain a wife and family if he received less than 42s. per week, and yet the Act recognises that he has no power to award that wage. In Other words, the industry must be his first consideration. He is not allowed to consider what constitutes a living wage. </para>

                        <para>- As an interesting sequel to the fellmongers' case the judicial report of which I was dealing with before the adjournment for dinner, and bearing upon the Minister's interjection that what I referred to in that case would be rectified under this Bill, let me inform honorable senators that the Fellmongers' Union appealed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, who, the Minister says, is prepared to give us the power to remedy the defect. They drew his attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a'Beckett's ruling in the case. Honorable senators will find that it is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 22nd June, 1909, that a reply was sent to the Fellmongers' Union through the Chief Inspector of Factories, who, after arguing the <inline font-style="italic">pros</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">cons</inline> of the case, says, referring to the Minister - </para>

                <para class="block">The request of the union was that the disability pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a'Beckett should be removed, and that in deciding what was a living wage the. Court should have the power to take into consideration the position of a married man with a wife and family. It is on record, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> declined to alter the Victorian Factories and Shops Act in that direction. If, after considering a formal request made to them, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> and his Government were of opinion that no such alteration of the Act should be made, what authority have we for assuming that they are now of a different opinion? We have no authority fo assuming that the Victorian Factories and Shops Act will be amended in such a. way as to enable Victorian workers to secure a wage on which they would be justified in marrying. I propose to quote from the " Report of the Agreement, Resolutions, Proceedings and Debates of the Inter-State Conference, held at Melbourne in August, 1909," statements appearing on pages 12 and 13 which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> Premier of New South Wales, and spokesman on this question at the Conference.

                        I take it that it will be confined to the exact point where Inter State competition exists, and that in so far as the local tribunal cannot adjust the matter it should be left to a body charged with larger powers for the purpose. The other negative condition is that the mere fact of a difference of wages should not in itself be a ground for giving this body jurisdiction.

                        <para>- I point out that until the matter is brought before the InterState Commission it is impossible to argue why the wages were fixed at a different rate in the two States. If a difference of wages is not to justify an appeal to the Inter-State Commission, those concerned can never get there to argue how it is that the wages differ in the different States. Suppose, for instance, that the fellmongers in Victoria were dissatisfied with their conditions under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a'Beckett's award, and asked him to move the ' InterState Commission. He would ask: "On what ground?" The reply would be, " On the ground that our wages' are not as high as are the wages paid in New South. Wales." Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> a'Beckett would say, " That does not of itself prove unfair competition; it might be due to a difference in the cost of living." </para>

                        <para>- The representatives of the workers might be against it; but by the vote of the  chairman  of the Wages Board such a rate of wages might be fixed. It might be represented to the  chairman  of a Wages Board that by fixing a certain rate of wages the whole of the industry would be centred in the State to which he belonged. I desire now to quote another case bearing on this question. I refer to the bootmakers' wages case which is before the Federal Arbitration Court in Melbourne. I quote from a report appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 2nd October, 1909. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins is reported to have said - </para>

                    <para>It appears that the State tribunals are sadly hampered in their task of giving proper conditions of labour by the fact that in other States the conditions are low, and to award what seems proper would aid the manufacturers in the other States in underselling and give them an advantage in Inter-State competition. Judge Heydon,  President  of the New South Wales Court, felt this difficulty, and expressed it clearly in the Boot Operatives' ease, viz. : - " We feel that if our hands had been free we would have given most of the boot trade journeymen gs. per day or <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 14s. per week. . . . We have wished to see our way to do this, but we have come to the conclusion that in common fairness to our employers (New South Wales employers) we cannot do it. If the Commonwealth Court of Arbitration had been dealing with this case it would have had all the conditions .in all the cities of Australia under its notice, and can it be supposed for an instant that unless some distinct difference in conditions calling for a differential wage had appeared, it would have put the manufacturers of Sydney under more onerous terms than the manufacturers of Melbourne." The New South Wales Court therefore was compelled to fix the wage at 8s. (as in Victoria) instead of 9s. as it wished ; but it added as part of the award that if the Victorian Wages Board should increase the Victorian wage the New South Wales wage should automatically follow it up to the wage of gs. per day. </para>

                <para class="block">In that case we have a sample of the way in which this Bill would operate as compared with the operation of the- new Protection proposals of the late Government. Under those proposals, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon's words, the tribunal would have had the conditions in all the capital cities of Australia before them and would have fixed a wage just to all competitors and differing only according to the different conditions obtaining in the several States. What would happen under the proposal of the present Government if an appeal were made to the court to send a matter on to the Inter-State Commission? The InterState Commission would not be a judge, as the Arbitration Court is of the merits of the wages fixed. It would not be a judge as to whether a certain wage was a sufficient award for labour, whether it was a living wage or a fair and reasonable wage. All that the Inter- State Commission could say would be: "What wage are we to fix to bring about a removal of the unfair competition?" So limited would be the powers of the Inter-State Commission that if it were proved that in Victoria there was an area outside the Wages Board jurisdiction in which sweating was rampant, the Commission would be absolutely powerless to extend its award to that area. I m'ake that statement on the strength of what I find in clause 50 of the Bill which provides that - </para>
                <para>The Commission may, of its own motion or on the application of any person interested, vary any determination by it under this Part ; Provided that the determination shall not " be extended as to its subject-matter or as to the area of its application, except pursuant to a reference by a Court of a State at the instance of a State Industrial Authority. </para>
                <para class="block">That is to say that if the Appeal Court of Victoria which has refused to extend the jurisdiction of a Wages Board to a particular part of the State asked the Inter-State Commission to do something which it had deliberately abstained from doing itself, the Inter-State Commission would be clothed with the power to do it ; but not otherwise.

                <para>I am justified in saying that this Bill is a mere hypocritical pretence and contains none of the real principles of the new Protection.

We are, however, under a certain disadvantage; the Minister says that I have only quoted statements anterior to the adoption of the Government scheme. Whose fault is that? I cannot quote the Conference debates. I cannot quote the reasons that led to this Inter-State Commission Bill being submitted to Parliament. The fault is that of the Minister and the Government to which he belongs. They cannot produce a report of the debates which took place at the Conference. No official record of them was kept. Evidently something so disgraceful took place that, for the first time in the history of such Conferences, no record was kept. Yet the Minister now taunts me with being unable to quote the speeches delivered at the Conference. He and his colleagues took are that we should never have an opportunity of quoting from them. I should very much like to have a report before me. I find, for instance, the following skeleton report of a meeting of the Conference on page xi. - </para>

                    <para>One of the arguments that is used, and can be used effectively in the future, is that if the States have the power by their respective Constitutions to create machinery to adjust industrial disputes within their own. boundaries, and they either do not do it or do it ineffectively, the Commonwealth is not only justified in stepping in but has the obligation cast on it to step in and create the necessary machinery to provide for that blank. So what I wish to point out at this stage is that if the Tasmanian Government can see their way to take the necessary action to establish industrial machinery for that State, then we have destroyed and removed the only substantial argument that has been advanced hitherto in favour of vesting the Commonwealth generally with industrial powers which the States now enjoy. </para>

                    <para>I say that is a real danger that has to be faced by all the States, and in so far as that branch of the case is concerned, if our friends in Tasmania can see their way to announce that they will take action in the future, it will enable all the States to stand solidly and to announce to those who make the advances on the Commonwealth side that 'the States have got the power to deal with industrial matters, that the States are entitled to reserve to themselves that power under the Constitution, and that until it is shown that there has been some inherent failure in the machinery of the States there is no justification for this move to shear them of their industrial rights. I have had some practical experience of the working of the arbitration tribunals in New South Wales for some years past, both through taking an active part in the Court itself and through being head for some years of the department administering the Arbitration Act, and I am quite satisfied from my own experience that in New South Wales we have got ample machinery, and at all events, if the machinery is not sufficient, that we have got ample power in the Constitution to enlarge the scope of these tribunals to enable them to give all reasonable redress in connexion with all branches of industrial life. Over and above the powers which the State tribunals enjoy of adjusting a dispute between the actual parties before them who may be some particular employers and employes, they have the power to extend the scope and the area of the award they make to all those neighbourhoods where competition exists and where the conditions of life are of a like character. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>In nearly all instances where the trade before the Court or the Board is one of' Inter-State interest the State tribunals have full power to adjust the position, because the rule, as far as I can see - I am taking one or two cases - is that the employes when they bring their cases before the Court usually begin by quoting wages in adjoining States as a foundation for some relief in the local Court. </para>

                        : If the wages in the adjoining States are higher they are quoted by the men. So far as the employers are concerned, if the wages paid in the adjoining State are higher, and the manufacturers there have to bear the further cost of freight and transfer to the local State, as a rule the employers do not offer much resistance to considering, an increase of wages in their own State. It usually happens that they are able to compete successfully with the adjoining State, which is then paying a higher wage, and, as far as my experience goes, there is not much difficulty in those cases. But the difficulty arises - and this, I think, is what
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline>
                        had in his mind when he made these proposals - where the wages in the adjoining State are lower. Where the same business people carry on trades in their own State, and in the local State the employer at once says, " We are now faced with the fact that our competitors in the adjoining State are able to hold their own in our markets in this particular form of industry, and they have the further advantage that they are only called upon to pay a wage less than we are now paying. Therefore, if the men succeed in their request that we are to still further increase the wages here, and to that extent further handicap ourselves, the trade cannot carry on." But, in all those cases, the position is usually dealt with in a practical manner because the parties invariably produce evidence of the cost of production of the article in the adjoining State, and they quote the wages paid in the adjoining State.

                <para class="block">That goes to show that, in so far as the Bill does anything to adjust wages, that is already done by the Wages Boards. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> states that these principles now guide the Wages Boards in fixing the wages. Another phase of the question is dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> on page 12,  in these words - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>There are these two classes of cases in which competition exists. In one case the wage that is paid by the competing State is very much lower than that paid by the complaining State, and there is no power in the competing State by which the Wages Board or the Industrial Court can adjust these wages. Then there is the second case, where the wages may be equal for the same class of work, but the competing State employs a different kind of worker from the complaining State. If I may still quote the boot trade as an illustration, the view taken, I understand, by the boot manufacturers in New South Wales, is that, however much the local Court may adjust these matters in laying down what is a fair wage, even if they equalize the wages paid by Victoria they cannot control Victoria, as she employs a larger number of apprentices, which makes the cost of the article less. In New South Wales the manufacturer has to employ apprentices in a very different ratio. It is possible that a case of this kind may arise in the future as between State and State where competition exists, where the conditions cannot be equalized, and where the result is unfair to one or the other. It does seem that there is what I might call a gap in our local industrial powers, a gap that we cannot bridge over, and the suggestion is that in this case, where there is such competition that is unfair in the sense of being unreasonable and cannot be adjusted, there should be a power reserved for some other body to come in and adjust that particular difficulty, making its determination obligatory on the parties concerned. That is really the essence of this proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's.</inline> In the first place, he differs from the movement enforced some months ago, which was to confirm the Commonwealth jurisdiction and power with regard to industrial matters, although confined to the State itself. </para>

And the third point to which I think he is agreeable, and on which we ourselves, at all events as States, should be insistent, is that even if these two propositions were established there should be no power given for the third body to intervene unless the Inter-State competition is not only, injurious, but is of an unreasonable character, and cannot be adjusted by the States concerned. </para>

                    <para>The only true criteria that I can see my way very well to lay down at present are these - that if the disparity in wages between the two States concerned is so great as to be <inline font-style="italic">primâ facie</inline> evidence of unfair payment in the State with the lower wage, that might be a ground for saying that the conditions are unfair, and that there is unfair competition, as for instance, if there were a case, as I quoted in the boot trade, where although wages are equal, the conditions of employment are such that one State has privileges which another State cannot concede to its own employes. Then, if we arrive at the position, from certain definite facts, that there is evidence of unfair competition between the States in that sense* the next question is how should action be taken? I have seen statements in the press that there is an impression abroad that the Commonwealth has asked the States to agree, and the States are inclined to agree, to the constitution of a Commonwealth tribunal in the nature of a Court of Appeal from State tribunals. </para>

                <para>Well, so far as I am concerned, I would be absolutely against any proceeding of that kind, and if we cannot regulate this matter so as to avoid all the dangers of making this Commonwealth tribunal a Court of Appeal, I think we would be far better off in leaving it entirely alone, because if you are going to make the Commonwealth tribunal a Court of Appeal, and leave the right of appeal, as is now done, to one of the parties concerned, you will find that an inclination will arise to transfer to the Commonwealth the jurisdiction in all industrial matters - </para>

                    recognised the rising tide, but with his Partington mop he purposes to sweep it back - and that in every case the employes, unless they get what they want, which may be injurious to the employer, will take steps to appeal to the Commonwealth Court. We know that a Court of Appeal is always the Court which practically determines the conditions that we are to deal with, and if there be a Court of Appeal over and above our State tribunals in the hands of the Commonwealth, that only means indirectly shearing our State tribunals of the right they now enjoy of exercising ultimate power. Therefore, to give the right of appeal to the parties, to be always invoked by the losing side, Would be, as I say, to open the door to the destruction of our rights as to industrial matters. The only safeguard that occurs to me, and I think, to a large extent,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline>
                    will be prepared to agree with this, is to have some judicial authority as the only channel and the only motive power for invoking the aid of the Commonwealth tribunal - that is, to remove the power from both parties in the dispute and leave it to some responsible person of standing and judicial character who is there not for party purposes but to ascertain whether, as a matter of fact, a real hardship exists owing to InterState competition of an unfair character. We have in most of the States at the, present time officers who would conform to those requirements. There is a Judge of the Arbitration Court in Western Australia. We have in New South Wales a Judge of the Industrial Court somewhat similar in character. They are both men of standing, and men whose judgment is relied upon. But in the other States, where there are Wages Boards presided over by chairmen, there is not the same character of individual presiding over those various Boards.

Where the tribunal is a Wages Board pure and simple the  chairman,  of course, may be just a layman- he may be a business man or he may be a police magistrate, but he seldom is a Judge in any jurisdiction, and to leave the power of moving the Commonwealth tribunal to the  chairman  of a Wages Board, who might not realize the full responsibility of his action, might also open the door to dangerous results. What I have in my mind is that this permission to move the Commonwealth tribunal should be granted only on the authority or certificate Of a Judge of the Industrial Court or Arbitration Court, where there is one, and where the supreme head is not a Judge then upon the authority of a Judge of the Supreme Court. In that way I think we would have protection afforded to the various States, and to the parties with a just cause, and we also meet the position that where there is a real cause for the Commonwealth interposing that will be given effect to.

Having done that, the Judge may make a reference to the Inter- State Commission, and the latter, to the extent of the area affected - which may be only a limited one - may then adjust the rates which are operative in the various States.

                    <para>If we give effect to any suggestion to make the interpretation of industrial law uniform, we may open wide the door to giving control to the Commonwealth. Once that power is given a large inroad is made with regard to the powers of the States in remaining matters. If we confine it to special cases of the character outlined, then we are doing no wrong to ourselves - there is no violation of State rights, and we supply machinery for a gap that apparently from time to time may exist. I think, myself, in some instances when these facts are brought before the States concerned in a practical way, they would be able, through the  power  of Inter-State community, to adjust matters. Cases may arise in which that is not practical or is not desired, and to meet special cases of unfair competition through reasons that the complaining States cannot control, we are  asked to give power to the Commonwealth tribunal to step in. The last stage of this general sketch is as to what form this so-called Commonwealth tribunal should take. </para>

I know that his own personal feeling was that they would be quite content if the moving party was somebody responsible, such as a Judge presiding over an industrial tribunal or a Judge of one of the higher jurisdictions of the State. I want to say, by way of a final word, that I recognise this as a most difficult question. We are trenching on dangerous ground, and while I can see a logical reason for asking for certain additional powers to meet certain deficiencies which the State machinery cannot supply, at the same time we must conserve the State Constitutions from any encroachment of a serious character, and the granting of these powers should be surrounded by very strict safeguards. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will take the trouble to write to the secretaries of the labour bureaux in the different States, he can easily get that information. They keep their registers, and endeavour, as far as possible, to find employment for those who are unemployed. Will the Inter-State Commission be availed of to a greater extent in that connexion than are the labour bureaux of the States? I also learn, from a perusal of the Bill, that the Commission is to inquire into matters affecting population and industrial conditions and immigration. I say that all these provisions represent only so much flapdoodle, which is intended to be used at the next general election. They will then be trotted forward in the hope that the electors may not know that these matters are already being dealt with by efficient bodies. The Bill, so far as it relates to the creation of an Inter-State Commission, is unnecessary. The causes which might call for it do not exist. An agreement regulating our railway freights is already operative, and there is no indication that it is likely to be repealed. The Bill offers no redress in the matter of industrial conditions to the workers throughout the Commonwealth. At the last general election, they asked the Prime Minister for bread, and he now proposes to give them a bundle of statistics. They ask him to give effect to his pledges in respect to the new Protection, and in reply he says, " I will not listen to you until you can prove to the satisfaction of a Judge of the Supreme Court that Inter-State competition of an injurious character prevails.

                        <para>- Who will be affected by unfair competition? Take the fellmongery case, to which I have already made reference. In that case, was the Victorian worker affected by outside competition ? No. He was affected by the sweating which was being practised within his own State. In a limited number of cases, the employers will be able to gain access to the Inter- State Commission, but the employes will never be able to do so. </para>

I say that when they go before a State Court to move it, they will not present their case under this Bill, but under the law of the State - the model Bill proposed by the State Premiers. This Bill will come into operation only when the Judge of the Appeal Court or of the Arbitration Court, as the case may be, says, "1 think there is a case for reference to the Inter-State Commission.

                        <para>- They might or might not do so. The honorable senator has diverted me from the. point that I intended to make. Where a body of workers have approached a Wages Board and that Board has awarded them something less than a living wage, say 36s. a week, as in the fellmongering industry in Victoria, they can go to the Appeal Court and say, " We appeal to you to allow us to appear before the Inter-State Commission." What will the Appeal Court say? The Court will say, " You have to establish your case. You have to prove that you are being unfairly competed with by workers in other States." They cannot possibly do that. If they said, " In New South Wales workers are paid 45s. per week for the work for which we receive 36s.", the reply would be, " There is no necessity for an appeal to the Inter-State Commission so far as you are concerned. It is the workers in New South Wales who are suffering from unfair competition, and it is the New </para>

I have pointed out that the employes, the persons whom we desire to assist, the people of whom it has been said that they are not getting their fair share of Protection, are prevented under the Bill even from asking for it. The only people who, under this Bill, could approach the Inter-State Commission are those who are already getting a fair share of Protection. </para>

                        <para>- Suppose we assume that the Wages Board in the boot-making industry of Victoria has made an award and fixed a wage higher than that paid in the industry in New South Wales. The Board would have done that with a full knowledge of the wages fixed in New South Wales. The employers may say, " You have fixed a wage which is 6s. per week more than the wage paid in New South Wales. This has had the effect of bringing about unfair competition, and we, therefore, wish to appeal to the Inter-State Commission. You are a State industrial authority, and, as such, we wish you to move the Appeal Court to state a case for the Inter-State Commission." As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said, if the members of the Wages Board agree to do so, they will censure themselves. They will have to say, " We have fixed a wage which is unfair to you, because it produces unfair competition with you. We shall, therefore, grant your prayer, and will move the Appeal Court to send the matter on to the Inter-State Commission." </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator forget the quotations which I have made from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade's</inline> speech, in which he pointed out that in dealing with these matters Wages Boards are always governed by the wages fixed in other States ? I have been led into making a longer speech than I intended. I have done so because I have felt that the question is very intricate and involved, and because I believe the Bill has been deliberately put forward for the purpose of misleading the electors of Australia. I believe it is intended to induce the workers to believe that they will be getting some fulfilment of the promises made to them by the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> and others, at the last Federal election, that they would be given some of the advantages of Protection. The Government say that this Bill embodies the new Protection, that it is a redemption of their promises, and I have felt it to be my duty to expose the hollowness and insincerity of the measure. I have no fault to find with other provisions of the Bill. It seems to me to be modelled very much on the lines of a previous Inter-State Commission Bill. For such purposes I believe that the Bill is unnecessary. The Minister of Trade and Customs did not give a single instance to show that the measure is required for those purposes. I think it might very well be put on one side and that it certainly should not be passed this session. </para>

If it were only because we have been given an opportunity to listen to that honorable senator's speech we should be thankful that the second reading was not carried this afternoon. It is evident that there is a conspiracy of silence amongst the supporters of the Ministry. I do not intend to occupy the time of the Senate at great length in dealing with this measure. I have gone through the various clauses very carefully, and have come to the conclusion that the Bill bears on its face the imprint of the Fusion. In my opinion, the word in this connexion means fear. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that if it becomes law the Bill will bring about confusion. The Minister of Trade and Customs, in moving the second reading of the measure, said that in  1901  a similar Bill was introduced. It was shelved on that occasion, because Parliament considered at the time that such a Bill was premature. I am of the opinion that a similar objection can be urged against this Bill. The Minister certainly did not advance a single argument why such a Bill should become law. He enumerated what he considered the' good points in the Bill, and said that it was wide and comprehensive; but I should like to say that it is very wide of the particular purpose for which the Minister tried to convince the Senate it was intended, namely to confer upon the workers of Australia the benefits of the new Protection. I have here a memorandum circulated by the Minister, and on which his speech was based. It is a summary of English and American legislation. On going through it I find that the only thing we have to depend on is the fact that in England and America similar legislation has been passed for the regulation of freights, railway rates, and so oh. In proof of that I quote from the speech delivered by the Minister in moving the second reading of the measure. Referring to the powers of the proposed Inter-State Commission the honorable senator said - </para>

                    <para>The Commission, according to the terms of the Bill, will have jurisdiction over transport and carriage on land and water, so far as InterState trade is concerned. In England, there is a similar or corresponding body, which has full and like control over railways, canals, and ships chartered by railway companies in connexion with their traffic. In the United States, there is also an Inter-State Commission, which has full and complete jurisdiction over land and water carriage when both are used and are under common' control, management, or arrangement for the continuous carriage or shipment of goods; but the Inter-State Commission of the United States has not jurisdiction over exclusively water, as apart from land traffic. </para>

                <para class="block">That was the first portion of the Minister's speech, in which he tried to justify the second reading of this Bill. Further on he said - </para>

                    <para>In respect to English legislation, we draw upon the Railway- Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845, thc Railway and Canal Act of 1854, the Regulation of Railways Act of 1873, and particularly upon the  Railway  and Canal Traffic Act of 1888. ' The -Railway Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845 contains what is called an equality section, which provides that tolls shall at all times be charged equally to all persons at the same rates. The Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1854 especially dealt with undue preference and traffic facilities; and, amongst other things, provided that no company should make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to, or in favour of, any particular person or company or any particular description of traffic. Under the Act of 1873, provision was made for the appointment of three Railway Commissioners of whom one was to be of experience in the law, and one of experience in railways; but that section was subsequently altered in the Act of 1888, to which I shall afterwards refer. </para>

                <para>I quote the exact words use'd by the Minister in order to prove that the basis of this Bill is really the regulation of railway and shipping traffic between the States. But while that is the real purpose, the measure is held up to the public gaze as one which will give to the people what has long been promised, a corollary to the last Tariff in the shape of new Protection. The Minister also said - </para>
                <quote>

                </quote>
                <para>Once we leave that phase of the situation, however, we are done with the Bill as a utilitarian measure. It has been said that the Bill is subject to constitutional limitations. That, to my mind, . is the key of the arch. There is a doubt about the legality of the measure. But even supposing that its general provisions are legal, 1 should like to know how we can constitutionally or legally over-ride the decision of the High Court on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' award in the McKay Harvester case. I am assuming that the Government are serious, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is convinced that if his Bill becomes law the Inter-State Commission will have power to enforce new Protection regulations. No doubt, the Minister will tell us in his reply that the real object of the Bill is to give practical effect to the new Protection idea. But I fail to see how such a policy will be forwarded by the passage of the measure. While it contains provisions enabling the Commission' to prescribe reasonable and just shipping and railway freights it does not contain specific powers for the prescription of fair and reasonable wages for workers in various industries. If the intention of the Ministry really be to establish the new Protection principle the Bill is in that regard entirely useless. It is simply » piece of waste paper. The Government are doing nothing better than throwing dust in the eyes of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said that the most controversial portion of the measure is Part V. I agree with him. Indeed, that is the vital part. But I am afraid that it will leave us exactly where we axe with respect to industrial legislation. We have been told that a model Bill has been framed by the Premiers. The Minister assures us that the Premiers have agreed to facilitate the passage of that model Bill through the State Parliaments. But even if they have agreed to do so, does the Minister himself think for  a moment that the model Bill will be passed by the Legislatures of the States? I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is so foolish as to believe such a thing. He says that the Government are prepared to trust the Premiers. No doubt they are gentlemen of honour and of integrity. But a few months ago the same Minister, when in charge of the Tariff, told us that he was prepared to trust the manufacturers. </para>

He was a senator upon whom no one could depend. The Minister says that he is prepared to trust the Premiers of the States. I have pointed out that the trust which the same Minister reposed in the manufacturers was misplaced. He was relying upon a broken reed. So soon as the Tariff was passed what did we see? We had the spectacle of the manufacturers backing up <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> in his appeal from the decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in the Harvester case. There the manufacturers had a chance to prove their sincerity. They clamoured loud and long for a Protective Tariff. They besieged the lobbies and asked the members of both Houses to vote for Protective duties. They held out to the Government, as well as to members of Parliament generally, a promise that if the Tariff became law they would share with the workers the benefits of the Protection which they received. But on the very first opportunity which presented itself they tested the validity of an Act of this Parliament which would have conferred upon the worker a fair share of the Protection afforded to the manufacturer. </para>

                        <para>- The reason why 1 was dissatisfied with the last Deakin Government was that after they got the Tariff passed they would not put their idea of new Protection before us at all. I now come to the question of the Wages Boards and industrial tribunals for which this Bill provides. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has already shown that there are States in which there is no industrial tribunal. I do not want to again refer to the case of Tasmania, as it has been quoted so often. True it is that the. Premier has promised that legislation will be introduced in order to bring about the establishment of an industrial tribunal of some sort. Whether it will be a Wages Board or an Industrial Court I know not. Even suppose that he is willing to carry' out his promise, it must not be forgotten that in every State there is a Legislative Council, in other words a stumbling block to the effective working of the industrial " part of this Bill. Whilst the Legislative. Councils are constituted on their present basis, there is not the slightest possibility of the measure, even though it contained all the essentials of new Protection - which it does not - being put into operation. In his opening speech the Minister said that the Government were relying on the Wages Boards, which honorable senators on the opposite side were trying to discredit. 1 presume that he was referring to the members of the Labour Opposition. I have never heard a Labour man in this or any other Parliament try to discredit' a Wages Board. What I have heard, and what I know, is that in some of the States where Wages Boards exist there is an Appeal Court which entirely destroys the utility or .the benefit of the system. I do not think that Australia furnishes a better case to illustrate my argument than the case of the bakers in Victoria. The Wages Board was composed of a number of men, every one of whom had a technical knowledge of the industry. After deliberating long and carefully the Board decided that the wages of the bakers should be <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 14s. per week. An appeal was made by the master-bakers to a Judge of the Supreme Court, who, of course, cannot be expected to have a technical knowledge of every industry and of every phase of an industry in connexion with which he is called upon to adjudicate. His Honor decided to annul the determination of the Board, and fixed the wages at <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. per week. </para>

If the Labour party can be accused of anything, then in the words of the Minister they can be accused of discrediting an appeal from a Wages Board to a gentleman who cannot possibly have a technical knowledge of all the points in dispute between the parties. If the dispute in a case ended with the determination of the Wages Board there would be no greater advocate of Wages Boards than myself. But the system in vogue in Victoria is, I hold, dangerous. During the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> a great deal of interest centred round the course of appeal from a Wages Board to the Inter-State Commission. I do not desire to elaborate the point, but merely to quote a few lines, which, to my mind, put the whole case in a nutshell. On page 13 of the report of the Inter-State Conference honorable senators will find this passage - </para>

Where the tribunal is a Wages Board pure and simple the chairman, of course, may be just a layman - he may be a business man or he may be a police magistrate, but he seldom is a Judge in any jurisdiction, and to leave the power of moving the Commonwealth tribunal to the  chairman  of a Wages Board, who might not realize the full responsibility of his action, might also open the door to dangerous results.

For the moment I have had no quarrel with that dictum, but I should like - if it were possible to do so - to enforce it also against our competitors in the markets of the world.

                        <para>- As a lawyer, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger knows perfectly well that a difference of opinion exists amongst legal authorities in respect of that phase of the question. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court has already awarded "fair and reasonable" wages in industries which do not come within the scope of the Tariff. But I am now dealing only with the new Protection phase of this Bill. To my mind, there is only one way in which the benefits of new Protection can be conferred on the workers of Australia. </para>

I would remind him, too, of the utterance of his chief, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> who affirmed that there is only one way in which this question can be settled. After the High Court had given its judgment in the McKay case, the Prime Minister said that there was yet another tribunal to which he might appeal, meaning the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>-  I am sorry that I did. I shall not uphold him again. I think it is the duty of the Senate to secure, the immediate remission of the question of the new Protection to the people. I fail to see by what process of reasoning the Government conclude that this Bill can in any way override or set aside the decision of the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has declared that if the agreement with the State Premiers be not carried out, a new situation will be created. I do not think that it will. Things will be <inline font-style="italic">in</inline><inline font-style="italic">statu quo.</inline> The Government have no power to compel the State Parliaments, which at present are the real arbiters of the situation, so far as Part V. of the Bill is concerned, to agree to the provisos therein contained. The most manly course to adopt would be to introduce another Bill providing for. an amendment of the Constitution, and thus give the electors an opportunity of saying whether, or not the modern idea of the new Protection shall be at once put into operation. The Government are evading the situation. In conclusion, I must express the hope that, before the second reading of the Bill is carried, fair consideration will be given to its provisions. I trust that the argument's advanced by the Minister of Trade and Customs will be carefully analyzed, in so far as they relate to that part of the Bill which purports to give effect to the new Protection. I hope that the Government will reconsider their position so far as that portion of the measure is concerned. </para>
