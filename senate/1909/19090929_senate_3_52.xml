              <para>- I desire to draw attention to a matter which occurred after this sitting was opened. I find that the Standing Orders have not been observed to-day in proceeding with the business. I think it will be admitted that the maintenance of the Standing Orders is a duty which devolves upon every honorable senator, and that we should very jealously guard against any breach of them. Immediately after you read prayers this afternoon, sir, you announced that you would suspend the sitting of the Senate, and that it would reassemble at a quarter  to 8 o&#39;clock, and thereupon you proceeded to leave the chamber. I hold that your action was contrary to the Standing Orders and the procedure of the Senate, and a breach of the privileges of honorable senators. I am taking this step, not out of pique or any feeling of that kind, because I may explain that honorable senators generally had no intention of delaying the proceedings this afternoon to an extent which would have prevented any one from attending the party in the Parliament gardens. I am constrained to take this action, sir, because I hold that if a precedent of this kind were once established, the liberties or privileges of honorable senators might be encroached upon very seriously ; that you might, in fact, suspend the business of the Senate at any moment you chose. If von can act in this way to-day, why should you not do so tomorrow ? By that means the business could be brought into a state of confusion, and I think, therefore, that honorable senators will recognise that your action this afternoon should not be allowed to pass without protest. I take this opportunity of entering my protest against the manner in which the business of the Senate was interrupted this afternoon. I hold that the proper method of procedure was for you, sir. either to get the consent of the Senate to suspend the sitting or to leave it to the Minister in charge to submit a motion. As the consent of the Senate to an interruption of the business was not obtained, so far as I know, I hold that you took upon yourself a power which the Standing Orders do not vest in you. For these reasons I enter my protest, so that a bad precedent may not be quoted in the future. </para>

I wish to point out that the circumstances which obtained this afternoon were of a peculiar character, and that there is no warrant for believing that the action which I then took involved any breach of decorum, order, or privilege, or that it was an interference with the rights of honorable senators. It is the duty of the Chair, as far as possible, to interpret the wishes of honorable senators, and, as far as possible, to. give effect to them.

It was held on behalf of the Parliament, and a number of distinguished visitors were invited to attend it. To this party every honorable member of both Houses was also invited. I hold in my hand a list of the members of the Senate, and upon referring to it I find, that only three of them declined to avail themselves of the invitation. Two of these honorable senators are absent from this State, and a third, who is present, stated that he had no desire to interfere with the wishes of honorable senators. When I found that this garden party was to be held at  3  o&#39;clock this afternoon, after an adjournment of the Senate for ten days, I most assuredly understood that I would be consulting the wishes of honorable senators by intimating that it was my intention to suspend the sitting until a quarter to  8  o&#39;clock this evening. Possibly some honorable senators may consider that, under such circumstances, a motion for -an adjournment should have been submitted, but seeing that they had an opportunity of intimating whether they desired. to be in attendance at the Parliament Gardens this afternoon. I thought that, as  President,  I would surely be within my rights in acting as honorable senators had clearly indicated they desired me to act. </para>

              <para>- I would point out to the honorable senator that it has been the practice here. There have been occasions when a <inline font-style="italic">hiatus</inline> has occurred in the consideration of business, and at such times, instead of the adjournment of the Senate having been moved, the  President  has merely said that he would suspend the sitting until a certain hour, when business would be proceeded with. That is the procedure which was adopted this afternoon. Regarding the period of the suspension of the sitting, I may say that I had ascertained that there was to be no meeting of the other Chamber this afternoon. </para>

They knew that, as the  President  had some duties to perform at the function to which I have alluded, it was quite impossible for the Senate to resume its sitting until some two or three hours had elapsed.

              <para>- Instead of fixing the period for the resumption of the sitting at  6  o&#39;clock, I had ascertained from the Government that it would be a convenience to honorable senators generally , if it were not resumed until a quarter to  8  o&#39;clock. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has interjected that this is special pleading on my part. I wish to indulge in no special pleading. I desire to tell honorable senators a. plain, unvarnished tale regarding the reasons underlying the action which I took - reasons which I think will commend themselves to the Senate. Before determining to adopt the course which I took, I ascertained the wish of honorable senators, because I realized that if a considerable section of them were averse to a suspension of the sitting, it would not be fair for the Chair to take upon itself the responsibility of running counter to their wishes. But, in view of the replies received to the invitations which had been issued, and seeing that there was no opportunity before the Senate re-assembled to-day of consulting honorable senators as to what should be done, I certainly thought that I was adopting a course of action which would commend itself to them as being the simplest to take. </para>

            <para>. - I am sure that the Senate will appreciate the tone adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie in placing this motion before it. If he assumes - as he evidently does - that there has been a violation of the privileges of the Senate, it was unquestionably, not merely his privilege, but his duty, to bring the matter forward. Consequently no one will resent his action. But I wish to point out that he appears to be under a slight misapprehension as to what has taken place. The whole of his statement was based upon the supposition that some violation of the privileges of the Senate had occurred - that in some way or other an effort had been made to frustrate the wishes of honorable senators. I. say that the action of the  President  this afternoon was clearly taken, not with a view to violating any privilege of honorable senators, or of  frustrating their wish, but with a view to giving effect to their wish. </para>

              <para>- When we recollect the occasion for which a suspension of the sitting was sought, I cannot conceive that any honorable senator would have raised a protest against the adoption of that course. We were merely performing a simple act of courtesy to bur visitors. That being so, I get back to my original point. I assume that it was the clear wish and intention of the Senate to extend that act of courtesy to our visitors. Therefore, the most that can be said is that a wrong course was adopted to bring the suspension about. The  President  has stated very fully and frankly that, having made himself acquainted with the fact that a majority of honorable senators were desirous of having an adjournment to attend the little function, he assumed that the view of honorable senators generally was more or less known, although their opinion had not been taken collectively. Under the circumstances, we are. clearly entitled to accept the President&#39;s statement - I for one do so - that he thought that he was falling in with the wishes of the Senate. </para>

              <para>- I did. There was clearly a general desire to adjourn this afternoon. The sole question is, then, What was the best method of giving effect to that wish? I have already stated that, in view of what has happened, I have no hesitation in saying that another course might well have been followed. But these are the thoughts which come to one from the knowledge that is acquired after the event. Clearly the  President  was of opinion that he was consulting the wishes of honorable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has performed a duty that he con* sidered rested upon him in taking steps to place a protest on record. But, in view of the statement of the  President,  I would ask him not to press his motion -to a division. . It has served its purpose, and we have had an opportunity of hearing a frank statement from the  President.  T freely take some measure of responsibility upon myself. I made it my business to ascertain that honorable senators generally were in favour of an adjournment. The worst that can be charged against any one is that, it having been ascertained that the Senate wished to adjourn, the  President  took the most expeditious method of giving effect to that wish. Under these circumstances, I ask my honorable friend to withdraw his motion. </para>

            <para>. - I am glad that both the honorable senators who have spoken to the motion have refrained from imparting any heat into the debate. The question before us is merely one of procedure. I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has performed a service to the Senate in bringing the matter forward. It is always unpleasant to do a thing of this kind, and no man likes to undertake an unpleasant task&#39;. It is much easier to be suave. But what has happened might have serious consequences if a precedent were to be established. We have to remember that it is by our practice we establish precedents ; and if what has happened to-day were permitted to go unchallenged, it might become a recognised custom. I have to complain that you, sir -acting, no doubt, with the best intentions, and, as you have said, with a desire to meet the wishes of a majority of the Senate - did not give someintimation to those of us who sit on this side of the chamber that you intended to take the course that you followed. The VicePresident of the Executive Council was good enough to intimate to me this morning that he proposed to move the adjournment of the Senate as soon as it met; and he asked me whether I could ascertain what honorable senators sitting on this side thought. I gave him the assurance that honorable senators who sit with me generally desired to fall in with the wishes of the majority, but that there were one or two who objected, and desired to voice their objections. I told him, however, that those honorable senators had assured me that they had no intention of extending their remarks beyond a few minutes. In view of that assurance, no time would have been lost if a motion for the adjournment had been moved in the ordinary way. I am sure that those whogave the assurance to me would not have departed from it. In about ten minutes the Senate would have adjourned. If the Leader of the Government had made up his mind not to submit a motion, I consider that it would have been an act of courtesy to those who sit on this side of the chamber, as well as to those who support the Government, if you, sir, had said that, by leave of the Senate, you intended to take the course that you did take. Had that been done, an opportunity would have been afforded to those honorable senators who objected to give voice to their objections, although it is probable that, had you asked leave, those honorable senators who were going to speak, would have waived their right. But you did not give any honorable senator an opportunity to make a protest. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is to be asked to withdraw his motion, there should be an understanding. I feel sure that you, sir, are sufficiently jealous of the rights of the Senate to see the justice of the proposition I am going to make. I put it to you that it is only fair that, if the motion be withdrawn, you should give the Senate an assurance that you will not regard what has happened to-day as a precedent. If, at any time, it may be thought desirable, even bv a majority of honorable senators, that there should be a suspension of a sitting, I trust that it will be understood that the  President,  even with the knowledge that he has a majority behind him, will not, without leave, take that course. </para>

              <para>- I quite recognise that. But still, the practice that has been established is a very inconvenient one. I ask you, therefore, whether you do not think that you should state that you do not desire to regard what has occurred as a precedent, and that, in future, you will ask leave of the Senate before suspending a sitting. If a statement of that kind be made, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie might see his way to withdraw his motion. But if that is not to be done, and the precedent established to-day is to stand, I, for one, strongly object. I was one of those who desired to see an adjournment to-day ; but still I protest against a sitting being suspended without leave. I suggest, therefore, that we could get out of an awkward difficulty by an undertaking such as I have suggested being made. </para>

I have listened carefully to your explanation, sir, but I am still under the impression that you took a course of action, which, if followed in future, would reduce theSenate to the position of being, instead of the most Democratic deliberative Chamber in Australia, really an autocratic one. The proper course to pursue, in my opinion, would have been for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to ask leave to submit a motion adjourning the Senate to a certain time.

              <para>- The VicePresident of the Executive Council has himself pleaded guilty to a neglect of duty, and, personally, I do not think that the  President  is as much to blame in this n&#39;atter as is the Leader of the Senate. It would have been wise for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to ask leave to move for a suspension of the sessional orders to enable the sitting to te suspended until a quarter to 8 o&#39;clock. You, sir, took the business out of the honorable senator&#39;s hands, and out of the hands of the Senate. If this is to be regarded as a precedent, we do not know where it may land us. In another place, quite a different procedure was followed. Honorable members were consulted, and they agreed to meet this morning, in order to make up for the loss of time this afternoon. We assembled at half -past 2 o&#39;clock, after a fortnight&#39;s adjournment, and, instead of proceeding with business, you, sir, rose and arbitrarily suspended everything. You may have done so with the best intention, but you did not consult the members of the Senate, and that being so, I think it is right that a protest should be lodged  against your action, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has taken the right course in calling your attention, and the attention of honorable senators, to what I believe was a distinct violation of the privileges of members of the Senate. </para>

            <para>. - I thought that we should have had some announcement from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in connexion with this matter. I thought we should have had an assurance that what was done this afternoon will not be regarded by you as a precedent. If that assurance is given, I shall be prepared to withdraw my motion, otherwise I shall be obliged to press it to a division. I view the matter quite apart from any question of lawn parties or of frustrating the wishes of honorable senators. I view it as a question affecting the rights and privileges of the Senate. I can assure honorable senators that I have not lightly raised the question, and I had no pleasure in submittingmy motion. I have taken action in the performance of what I hold to be a duty placed on the shoulders of every member of the Senates The Government may see the importance of the matter later. If the Standing Orders can be violated to-day, they may be violated tomorrow, and every other day, inthesame way. </para>

              <para>- It is, of course, equally a reflection on them. However, I do not agree with the honorable senator, and though I have often felt disposed to dispute a point with the  President,  I have ever been ready to obey his ruling when he has called me to order. On this occasion, the violation of the rules hasbeen so obvious that I consider we should have been neglecting our duty if we did not protest against the action taken by the  President  this; afternoon. Some honorable senators may think that, as the intention of themajority of honorable senators had bttn made known by the replies receivedto a certain invitation, that was sufficient to justify the disregard of the Standing Orders, but I am far from faking that view. There is nothing in the Standing Orders which refers to matters outside the business of this House.. We have no standing order dealing with garden parties, or anything of that kind, and the desire of honorable senators in such a matter does not affect the question. When you, sir, took the action you did this afternoon, I was not sure whether it was a greater violation of the duties of the Leader of the Senate or of the privileges of honorable senators. I naturally looked to the Leader of the Senate to move in the usual way. If a motion had been submitted for a temporary adjournment, there would have been little or no opposition. to it. I think that it was the duty rather of the Leader of the House than my duty to take the action I have taken this evening.

              <para>- Those of us who did not intend to be present had nowish to act the part of kill- joys, or to prevent other honorable senators from attending. That, however, is not the point. The point is that the Standing Orders have been disregarded, and they are our only guide in matters of this kind. It may suit honorable senators on the other side to ignore the violation of the Standing Orders on this occasion, but this is a boomerang, which may come home to them. </para>

I have already explained the circumstances in which I acted as I did this afternoon. I assumed that, after my explanation, honorable senators would have realized that I had fully recognisedtheir rights, and was only endeavouring to facilitate their wishes. A question has been raised as to the power of the Chair to suspend a sitting. There is no standing order which gives that power, directly or indirectly. The  President  is supposed to use a certain amount of discretion and judgment in any course of action which he may take, always having regard, of course, to the fact that the wishes of honorable senators must, substantially, be complied with. In the Senate a suspension of a sitting has on many occasions taken place, as I have stated, where it was necessary, in order to fill up a certain amount of time for which no business was available, or because it was not desirable to proceed. I hold in my hand a copy of our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which shows that the convenience of honorable senators was similarly consulted on one occasion when they were invited to a luncheon at Government House. It is recorded here that the sitting was suspended from 12.45 to 3 p.m. </para>

          <para class="block">I am only concerned to quote these few extracts. I have not had time to get the matter investigated more fully, in order that honorable senators may see that this is not a new practice which is creeping in. I also want to point out that if the  President,  whoever he might be, agreed to abandon a course of action which he considered was fairly within his rights, and in the interests of honorable senators, in order to insure the withdrawal of a motion which naturally it is unpleasant, at any rate to the Chair, to have submitted, he would be unworthy of the position which he occupied. My attitudeI have explained  fully, and I did hope that honorable senators would have accepted my explanation as a reasonable one, and that even if exception could be taken to it, an adverse motion would not be pressed. If I felt that I had been unduly interfering with the position of honorable senators, I should Say at once that they would be perfectly right in passing the motion, unless I was prepared to say that I had made a mistake. But I cannot honestly say that I think my action was improper in the circumstances. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable  senator insists upon his right, it appears to me that it is quite within his power under standing order 102 to do what he wishes, although I think that it is very much more desirable to follow the routine which is laid down in standing order 62. Ap  parently there is a conflict between these two standing orders, and it therefore becomes my duty to read them together as well as I can. </para>

          <para>. - It may be well that I should state the position with regard to this clause as it presents itself to me. The discussion on the last occasion when the Bill was before us made it appear that a number of honorable senators were anxious to abolish voting by post. Others were apparently desirous of introducing some modification or safeguard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment distinctly raises the question whether or not voting by post should be retained. I merely desire to point out to the honorable senator that if his amendment be defeated, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of proposed new section 109 will have to stand as at present. </para>

            <para>- It has. Magistrates were &#34;appointed specially for the purpose of witnessing postal votes. Each party at that time naturally desired to poll as many votes as possible. The Labour party were not able to get as many votes as they wanted in the ordinary way, and they went round and tried to get votes by post. Both parties did the same sort of thing. If a party is beaten, however, I do not think that it is right for it to cry out and try to put blame on the other side. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> admit that postal voting was worked by both parties to the utmost. As many votes as possible were secured. A sufficient number of persons had not been appointed Vo witness postal votes, and the Government of the day appointed special magistrates. I make that statement without fear of contradiction. </para>

            <para>- I do not approve of the amendment. In the interior of Queensland, and no doubt in many districts in the other States, settlers have taken il selections distant.  30  or  40  miles from the nearest polling-place. Is it reasonable to ask a selector so situated, or his wife, to attend at the polling-place to record his or her vote? Do honorable senators opposite desire to enable the electors of Australia to vote, or is it their intention to prevent them from voting? I believe that every elector should be afforded an opportunity to record his vote, and many in remote districts, at a great distance from the polling-places, will be prevented from doing so if they are not permitted to vote by post. I thought that honorable senators opposite were anxious that every elector should be able to record his vote, and if they are they will not do away with the postal voting provisions. Are they prepared to tell their constituents that they tried to prevent people living at a distance from a pollingplace from recording their votes? I agree that in this matter we should consider the interests of sailors employed on our coast, but we should consider also the electors who, but for the existence of the postal voting provisions, might have to lose two days in travelling  30  or  40  miles to record their votes. </para>

            <para>- The postal voting provisions need not affect the secrecy or the purity of the ballot. I have witnessed many postal votes, and I never knew, or tried to know, how the electors voted. If a person witnessing a postal vote tried to discover how the elector voted, he would be false to his oath, and whether he were a. justice of the peace or a civil servant, he should be hounded out of the. country. I say that the electors in the back-blocks of Australia are justly entitled to vote by post; that is in fact a right. To de- prive them of that right would be a Conservative, and not a. Democratic, measure. They are the people . who are opening up the country, and we have to depend upon them more than upon the residents of the cities and towns. </para>

            <para>- I am speaking of what I know to be facts from my experience as a returning officer at the first Federal elections, and on many other occasions. Though I was not in accord with the political views of some of the candidates, they all complimented me upon the way in which I carried out my duties. A returning officer who knows- his duty takes no side at an election, and an electoral official who does take a side at an election, and tries to discover how an elector has voted should, if he is a justice of the peace, be removed from the Commission, or, if he is a civil servant, be discharged from his office. The number of electors who would be prevented from recording their votes if they were compelled to attend at a pollingbooth is greater than honorable senators opposite imagine. Honorable senators rightly ask why the seamen on our coast should not be able to exercise the franchise. They can do so under the postal voting provisions, but if these are repealed they will be deprived of that right. I am surprised that honorable senators who call themselves Labour men and Democrats should wish to do anything which would deprive electors of their right to vote. </para>

            <para>-I am aware of that. I also recognise its value to seamen, but I say that it is of even more value to settlers in the back country. Why should honorable senators propose to penalize settlers in outside districts by making it necessary for them to lose two days in travelling to the nearest polling-place to record their votes? In my own district there are men and women who would have to travel 50 or 60 miles if they were obliged to record their votes at a polling-place. I hope the Committee will not agree to deprive the electors of the right to vote by post, and that the Minister will adhere to the Bill as it stands. </para>

        <para class="block">The object of my amendment is to provide additional facilities for those in the back country whom these provisions of the Act were intended to serve. Figures have been quoted here which showed very clearly that the postal voting provisions have been mostly availed of by town residents, which, of course, was contrary to the intention of Parliament. My desire is to meet the case of those who have experienced the greatest difficulty in recording their votes on polling day. I have in my mind the case of a new centre in the Black Range district of Western Australia which had no polling place. In order to  get  facilities far voting the residents, who numbered considerably over one hundred, had to make application to the returning officer at Coolgardie, which in itself occupied a week. Next they had to wait until their ballot-papers were posted and returned, which again occupied a week; and then they had to send down their votes, which occupied a further week. In short, they had to think about the election three weeks prior to the polling day. I ask the Minister to accept my amendment so as to enable such persons to apply to the nearest electoral registrar, and thus save three weeks. In the case I cited over one hundred persons were disfranchised simply because they failed to take action three weeks before polling day. As a rule people have quite enough to do to wrestle with their own difficulties and problems without having time to think of an event three weeks before it is to happen. I believe that if this amendment is made it will provide a great convenience to electors in remote situations whom the postal voting provisions were intended to accommodate. I do not think that any difficulty could possibly arise from its adoption. At present the electoral registrars are intrusted with the custody of ballot-papers and have to account for them. There should be no material difference between intrusting them with the issue of postal voting certificates and postal votes and intrusting them with ballot-papers on polling day. </para>

          <para>. - There is a good deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> says as to the necessity of giving greater facilities to people in remote districts to get postal votingpapers. Take a place like Mareeba, which is away over the ranges at the back of Cairns. If a woman, for reasons best known to herself, wants a postal ballot-paper she has to send an application from Mareeba to Cairns, which, roughly speaking, takes about twenty-four hours by fail. Then the application has to be transmitted from Cairns to Townsville, which takes fortyeight hours by steamer. The registrar in Townsville, who is in charge of an immense area, will probably take a little time to deal with the application. Assuming, however, that he acts in the shortest possible time, he will have the ballot-paper sent forward perhaps within two or three days,, because steamers do not leave everyday for Cairns. From Cairns it has <inline font-style="italic">ia</inline> go a long journey by railway over the ranges. IT the applicant happens to live on the outskirts of Mareeba, which is occupied by a b&#39;ig scattered mining population, she has .to seek for a justice of the peace or other &#39; qualified person to witness the ballot-paper before it can be used. Next it has to .be .posted at Mareeba, from whence it is forwarded by railway to Cairns, and thence by steamer to Townsville, arriving there by polling day. Surely that case will enable honorable senators to realize how,, in many instances, it&#39; is an absolute physical impossibility for an elector to obtain the benefit of the postal voting provisions unless the postmaster is not to miss a moment and the registrar at Townsville is waiting almost on the wharf for the application to arrive so that he can stamp it and send it back. It rr.ay be suggested that the case I have put is rather far-fetched, but I know that at the last election in Queensland seventy or eighty voters in the Wide Bay district were unable to get postal ballot-papers and return them in time. They were living at some distance from the head of a railway line, and the result was that a considerable number of them had to remain on their farms and look after their. homes while the other half drove to the nearest polling place to vote. I have made a suggestion to the 1 Department, which I believe it is willing </para>

        <para class="block">I  to accept. I suggest that while we cannot allow everybody to issue postal voting certificates, the date on which the post-office stamp is put on a postal vote should be considered the date on which that vote was recorded, and that it should be so accepted at the office of the registrar for the district. Once a post-office stamp is affixed the vote is in the hands of the Government, and cannot be- touched, and the elector should be treated as having voted before the -ballot actually closed, </para>

            <para>- No. I confess that at one time I favoured the proposal which&#39; is now under consideration. But since then I have come to recognise the danger that is inherent in it. If we cannot facilitate the issue of postal vote certificates we can facilitate their return to the registrars of divisions. I suggest that as soon as an elector has voted by means of the postal vote certificate he should be called upon to deposit that certificate in the post-office, and that the date stamped upon it should be regarded as the date upon which it was returned to the divisional registrar. In the absence of such a provision the electors at Mareeba, for instance, who delayed posting their ballot-papers for a few days, would find themselves disfranchised, because, in the ordinary course, those papers could not reach Townsville before the poll had closed. I would suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> should consider that aspect of the matter. </para>

            <para>- Then the honorable senator evidently desires to penalize those who live in sparsely-populated districts because of the corrupt practices of persons resident in more densely -populated areas. I would point out that there is a great danger underlying his proposition. He seeks to insert in this clause the words &#34; Electoral Registrar &#34; with a view to enabling an application for a postal vote to be directed either to a returning officer or to an electoral registrar for a division. Is he aware that in. some divisions there are twenty-six electoral registrars. </para>

In such circumstances, how is it possible to post notices showing the particular subdivisions for which persons are enrolled? It is obvious that only one postal vote certificate should be issued to any elector. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Lynch</inline> desires that the elector should be permitted to apply to the nearest electoral registrar. Can he not conceive of two such officers being equi-distant from an elector, and of both, in the best of good faith, issuing postal vote certificates ?

            <para>- But where impersonation is attempted the individual has to present himself in person, and he is thus always in danger of being detected. The position, however, is very different in dealing with forms which are signed by electors and dropped into the post. There, the opportunity for detection is not nearly so great. The reason why it is proposed to limit these applications to returning officers is that they are the individuals who ought to have charge of the ballot-papers, and who ought to be saddled with more responsibility than ought a great many of our electoral registrars. They are in a position to know better than is anybody else whether more than one postal vote certificate has been issued to an elector. The postal ballotpaper is not intended to convenience the officers who are intrusted with the control&#39; of our electoral machinery, but is intended to convenience the elector himself. What is the objection urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to the provision which is contained in the Bill? He has pointed out that because electors are prone to put off till to-morrow what might be done to-day, their postal votes may not reach the returning officer before the poll has closed. Now, under the existing law, the time allowed to elapse between the issue of the writ for an election and polling day is about 35 days. I venture to say that if it were extended to 350 days some electors would not post their ballot-papers until the last moment, and others would not return them until they were too late. The Bill provides electors with every reasonable facility for exercising the franchise. </para>

            <para>- It marks a departure from the path of rectitude.  1  desire the entire abolition of postal voting. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> presents all the dangers to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has directed attention, and seeks to extend a system which I regard as absolutely unholy. Even if it were adopted, it would not meet the position that the honorable senator desires to meet. The man outback is the person for whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> desires to provide facilities. But my experience of the man outback is that he is interested in elections, and is the least likely person to allow the opportunity of exercising the franchise to go by default. </para>

But the postal voting system encourages the organization of agencies for canvassing the city slums, with the consequence that the greater number of postal votes are recorded in the densely populated places, and not in the back country. </para>

            <para>- I&#39; am prepared to provide every facility for women to vote. As for sailors, a vessel on which a man is working is for the time being his city, and, therefore, a special ballot-box should be provided for his convenience. Passengers also could record their votes on board. But I object to the extension of postal voting in a manner that is likely to lead to corrupt practices. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> amendment grave dangers would arise. There are districts in which there are twenty or more electoral registrars. Under this amendment it would be possible for one elector to write to three or four electoral registrars, not one of whom would know what the others had done, and, consequently, one person might exercise two or three postal votes. So anxious am I that this system should not be abused that I should even be prepared to make one person entirely responsible for postal votes throughout the Commonwealth. In any case I must vote against the amendment. </para>

But there is a suggestion which I should like&#39; to make to the Minister. The vast distances which have to be traversed in Queensland make postal voting almost a necessity. In order to increase the facilities the suggestion has been thrown out that a postal vote should be allowed to be counted even if it reached the returning officer some days after the close of the poll, provided it bore upon it the postal stamp of the date of the election, or a date previous to the election. If that suggestion could be adopted it would meet the case of electors in the sparsely populated portions of States vast in area, and of those electors who are likely to be ill and consequently unable to go to the poll on election day. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator must have very little experience of human beings if he is not aware that some persons do know on occasions when they are likely to be ill. There may not be sufficient time for an application for a postal certificate to go to the returning officer, for the certificate to be received by the elector, and for it to be transmitted again to the returning officer, before the declaration of the poll. But if the suggestion that has been thrown out could be adopted, the convenience of electors in such situations would be met. There are places like Chillagoe, Irvingbank, and Cooktown, which are very far removed from the central polling places of the electorates to which they belong. Though the names of those towns may be merely geographical expressions to some honorable senators, there are many places so situated in Queensland, and I da.re say also in Western Australia. </para>

            <para>- Precisely. If it commended itself to the judgment of the Committee to impose a time limit, that might be done. But the adoption of such a suggestion would afford considerable facilities to many of our electors in the scattered districts. We trust the honesty and integrity of our post-office officials in the handling of thousands of pounds. Surely, then, we can trust the officers to do their duty in carefully stamping postal certificates ; and when the postal stamp is duly impressed on a certificate, notwithstanding that it is received after the close of the poll, the vote should, in such instances as I have mentioned, be permitted to be counted.I do not know whether an amendment to carry out this idea can be moved at present ; but, if not, I shall at the proper time press the suggestion upon the Minister. </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. At present, the returning officer is made responsible, and all postal votes must be issued by him. If every electoral registrar were permitted to issue postal votes, one would not know what votes had been issued by another, and a man who had obtained a postal vote certificate from an electoral registrar might later on record a vote at a polling booth, or some one else might record a vote in his name. I am satisfied that neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> nor any other member of the Senate desires to open the door to impersonation, but I am afraid that, if the amendment were carried, opportunities would be afforded for impersonation and fraud. I hope that after the discussion which has taken place, the honorable senator will not press his amendment. </para>

        <para class="block">The effect of the amendment would be that the head teacher, whether of a temporary, a provisional, or a State school, would be an authorized witness to an. application for a postal vote certificate. In Queensland, and I believe also in Western Australia, because of the technical difference between a State school and a provisional school, some doubt arose as to whether the head teacher of a temporary or provisional school could attest an application for a postal vote certificate, and, in consequence, some electors were unable to avail themselves of the facilities afforded by the postal voting provisions. </para>

        <para class="block">My reason for moving the amendment is that our State Departments often carry out public works far from any settlement, and in such places the other authorized witnesses provided for in the proposed new section would not be available to men engaged on these works who might desire to take advantage of the postal vote.

            <para>- I should say. so. So many public works are being carried out in remote districts by the State Departments that I admit it is difficult to define an officer in charge of these works, but without some such provision as Idesire to make by the amendment, a number of electors may be disfranchised. The necessity for some such amendment was made very evident at the last election in Western Australia. Unless we extend the list of authorized witnesses in the way I have suggested, the facilities afforded by the postal voting provisions will be denied to those who are best entitled to them. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. I shall be very glad to listen to any suggestion with a view to improving the form in which it is submitted. </para>

I believe that the amendment submitted by the honorable senator is more comprehensive than that which I have circulated. There might be some difficulty in defining &#34;officer&#34; under the honorable senator&#39;s amendment, and it might, perhaps, be better if the word were qualified, as I have qualified it in my proposed amendment, by the addition of the words &#34; permanently employed.&#34; Perhaps with that addition the Vice-President of the Executive Council might have no objection to the amendment. </para>

            <para>- While both amendments are good, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s is the more comprehensive. I have suggested that all railway station- masters and night officers-in-charge permanently employed in the Railway Departments in any of&#39; the States should be authorized witnesses for the purpose of the postal voting provisions. My reason for making the suggestion is that in many of the sparsely populated districts of Australia it would be possible to secure the services of a station-master or officerincharge of a station, where the services of a justice of the peace, a State school teacher, or of any of the other competent witnesses provided for in the proposed new section, would not be available. </para>

            <para>- I will not say that they are the worst witnesses we could have, but they are not .always the most available. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. goes further than I proposed to go by including all officers in charge of public works amongst the persons who should be authorized witnesses. In such States as Queensland and Western Australia, where the centres of population are often very far apart, officers permanently in the employ of public Departments are frequently in charge of numbers of men engaged in carrying out public works. Their services might be availed of to enable the men working under them, at a distance, from any railwaystation, to record their votes by post, and that is why I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment would be an improvement on my own. Of course, if I had my way, there would1, in future, be no postalvoting at all. But now that the Committee, in its wisdom, has determined .that the provision shall remain, I think that there is a chance of widening the scope and the utility of the clause. T believe that the Minister is willing to accede to our desire to afford these greater facilities, and that if the two suggested amendments were embodied in one proposal it might be accepted. </para>

The latter portion of his proposal refers to all officers in charge of public works. I asked him to define what he meant by an officer, and when I inquired whether he called a maintenance man an officer, he said, &#34;certainly.&#34;  r  think that he was quite right in giving that answer. But that means that a single maintenance man - not a man in charge of a gang of men, but a man working entirely on his own, as many men have to do - would, under the amendment, become an authorized witness. I cannot conceive that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie meant that, because if we agreed to his proposal we might as well abolish the whole list of authorized witnesses and simply say that anybody may be a witness. </para>

            <para>- This amendment does not say that the man is to be in charge of other men. The sole thing is that he is to be in charge of a public work.  It may . be a State public work, because in New South Wales it&#39; frequently happens that a carpenter or a painter is despatched&#39; up -country to repair a postoffice. For the time being he is in charge of that work, but, under this amendment, is he to be regarded as an authorized witness ? I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie meant that. I wish to show what a wide interpretation it is possible to apply to- the words of the amendment. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I ask the honorable senator to withdraw his amendment and the Committee to accept the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> which will make a very useful addition to the list of &#39; authorized witnesses. When it is accepted I think it must be allowed that the list is fairly ample and liberal. Experience, of course, may suggest that some additions are necessary, but at present I think that we should not put in additions which contain in themselves a possible element of danger. </para>

          <para>. - It will be remembered that this clause contained a point which caused some rather close reasoning, and that its consideration was adjourned with an assurance that I would consultthe authorities on the matter. I have done so, but I anticipate that there is material for a debate perhaps a little longer than we should like to undertake to-night, and, therefore, I ask the Committee to report progress. </para>
