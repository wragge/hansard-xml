            <para>. - In discussing the programme submitted by the present Government one is particularly struck with the fact that it contains little or nothing which gives any hope to the great masses of the people. It distinctly shows a desire to help all classes in Australia save the working classes. There. seems to be hardly any wish on the part of Ministers to even go to the extent of promising that something shall be done in that direction. </para>

              <para>- I am not aware that the Labour party have made that statement, but it is certainly true that the programme includes matters which are common to all parties. I do not, however, propose to occupy time in discussing those items of a national character which are common to all parties and to all persons who desire to see the development of the nation of Australia. I want to discuss more particularly the points wherein parties differ. The programme of the Government has been divided under three heads, namely, &#34; Industrial,&#34; &#34; Defence,&#34; and &#34; Finance.&#34; In the first place I find something in the nature of a promise to the workers that there shall be established a Board of Trade, which will be the pivot of several industrial measures or powers. It must be distinctly understood that a clear promise was given to the workers that, whatever party might be in power, they should be allowed to participate in the protection given at the Customs House to manufacturers in the form of receiving  increased wages in very many industries. But  what  do we find? The present Prime Minister had no hesitation whatever in stating that it was a simple question, and was merely a matter of levying an Excise duty or granting a rebate to those manufacturers who observed certain conditions. A little later, however, we found that he was not only willing, but . anxious, to provide new Protection for the workers by an amendment to the Constitution. What do we find to-day ? The workers are promised a levelling up,&#39; but there is no suggestion to <inline font-style="italic">empower</inline> the proposed Board of Trade to increase the rate of wages in any industry extending throughout Australia. In this programme it is proposed that wherever there is a conflict between the wages ruling in two States, or in one State and other States, there may be a levelling up, but where a sweating rate exists in any industry&#39; in all the States no levelling up is even suggested. I could name many industries which are not only receiving protection at the Customs House, but which could not possibly be dealt with under this programme. It contains an item which is of promise to the workers! Referring to the Inter-State Commission, we are told that - </para>

          <para class="block">Whilst I shall not be found voting against any scheme to provide for insurance against unemployment, I, as a representative of the working classes, have no enthusiasm to waste on a proposal bf this character. What does that paragraph&#39; mean ? It is an admission that under the existing system the governing powers of Australia are incompetent to abolish unemployment. The idea of a Government in the twentieth century admitting the fact that .it is beyond their power to provide employment for the men and women of the country is certainly some-  thing&#39; new, and very significant. Why do men work ? They toil to produce wealth. In turn, the distribution of that wealth means material comfort to the workers. The value to the Commonwealth of  ti  worker in regular employment has been variously estimated. It should be the duty of every Government in Australia to see that the whole of the workers are given employment by .which they may be able to maintain themselves and their families, and add to the material prosperity of the country. However, in spite of the numbers behind them, the present Government apparently confess that it is quite impossible, under any proposal they are able to submit, to abolish unemployment. That may be satisfactory to workers of the class whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> lias referred to ; but it will not be satisfactory to the thousands of unemployed in Australia to-day. I regret that the Government should be so hopeless of satisfactory results from their programme. It will not give any satisfaction to those who are unemployed in Australia to-day- to learn that the Government confess their inability to abolish the causes of unemployment. </para>

              <para>- I do not propose to enter upon a discussion of details. I merely say that the present Coalition Government hold out no hope to the workers that they will be able to abolish unemployment. The confession is somewhat unlike the Leader of the present Government, who, in the past, whatever pro&#39;posals he may have submitted, has always been prepared with plenty of promises calculated to delude the people. Wherever in the Ministerial statement there is a reference to the appointment of a Board of Trade, the development of markets, the appointment of a High Commissioner, or to any matter affecting the interests of the trading and manufacturing sections of the community, the Government say, distinctly, that they are going to do something. But in every reference to a matter affecting the workers, they say that they are going to. study it. No doubt they will continue to promise and go on studying measures which would be of advantage to the workers who, in the meantime, will be permitted to starve. Side by side with the admission by the Government that &#39;they are unable to suggest anything which will abolish unemployment, the unemployed will derive little satisfaction from the&#39; following statement : - </para>

          <para>The Fisher programme, enunciated at  Gympie, was. described by the present Prime Minister as &#34;a pious aspiration.&#34; What sort of a pious aspiration is it to express a  hope  that the State Governments, who have hitherto refused to co-operate with the Federal authorities in the matter of  immigra- lion, will now do so by making lands available for persons who might be induced to come to Australia. So far, the State Governments have shown little desire to make lands available, not merely for immigrants, but for those who are in Australia at the present time. Only yesterday, in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cotter,</inline> the. honorable member for Richmond, brought under the notice of that body the case of a man who was deluded into coming to this country by statements made by a responsible officer in the employ of the Victorian Government. That man, apparently, is now to be left by the same State Government to starve in Melbourne. This is the kind of thing which the present Federal Government is going to propose for the benefit of the workers of Australia. Under the heading of &#34; Industrial,&#34; I also find reference to some measures, which would have been proceeded with had there been no change of Government. No matter what Government may be in power, I hope that the measure proposed to reduce the qualification of residents for obtaining a,n old-age pension from twenty-five to twenty years, will be carried. I can safely say that had the Fisher Government remained in office, such a measure would have teen amongst the very first introduced this session. Some little time ago, the present Minister of Trade and Customs, as Leader of the Government &#39;in- the Senate, introduced the Australian Industries Preservation Bill. At that time, there was no doubt in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> or in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> that the proposed law would be effective. Some of us raised such doubt, and we were told that  there was not the slightest doubt that the : measure, if passed, would prevent the development of trusts in Australia. Since that time the Australian Industries Preservation Act has been tested and found wanting. What is the position of the Government to-day? Do the present Prime  Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs undertake, as they did twelve months ago, to abolish, trusts and prevent their development in Australia? No, today they propose the introduction of a Bill providing for the prohibition of inequitable rebates by trusts and combines. What does this mean? It means that the Government acknowledge to-day that they are unable to prevent the development of trusts. Instead of amending the existing Act, or introducing a new and more drastic measure to prevent the development of trusts in Australia, the Government are going to permit the existence of trusts, and will merely prevent them from granting rebates. </para>

              <para>- I find nothing in the Ministerial statement before us to indicate that the Government intend to prevent trusts from coming into operation in Australia. We know that there are many differences of opinion existing between members of the present Government, and even between the two representatives of the Government in the Senate. We can only judge of what the Government intend tq do by the statement put before us, and there is nothing in it to indicate that they are really going to tackle the trusts problem at all. In another paragraph of the statement we are informed that&#39; the Government are going in for a new departure. The expression is somewhat Deakinesque. One member of the Cabinet, .who has been touring Victoria, advocated as strongly as he could the borrowing of money by the Commonwealth, but in this Ministerial statement the Government make reference only to a &#34; new departure.&#34; Why do they not intimate that they intend to commit the Commonwealth to a borrowing policy? I have no hesitation in saying that if in the interim a strong public opposition to such a policy be developed, the Government will find some other method of explaining what is now familiarly known as &#34;a new departure.&#34; Then, when they are asked why they have departed from their announced policy they will be ready with the solemn assurance that the &#34;new departure&#34; did not refer to any borrowing proposal whatever. It is rather remarkable that some members of the Government are being permitted to wander throughout the Commonwealth advocating a policy which their colleagues do not indorse. </para>

              <para>- Among the very modest members of this Chamber is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> I have heard one or two claims made by honorable senators, but I had no idea that the Senate contained such an intellectual giant as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> until I heard him1 make the rather astounding statement the other night, that so great was the gulf between his own mental ability and that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> that he had accomplished more in a single hour than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> could achieve in a thousand years. That modest declaration reminds me of a public meeting which I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Trenwith</inline> address at Ballarat some time ago, a.t which he affirmed that he had practically brought the Labour party into existence, and that he had maintained it for years, although subsequently he claimed that he had accomplished more than all the members of the Labour party combined. As is well known, Ballarat is a strong Liberal constituency, but, despite this fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> received only about two votes in it for every five cast in favour of the Labour party, thus evidencing that his innate modesty is really very helpful to us. </para>

            <para>- I have no objection to the Vice-President of the Executive Council playing it against me if he can. I have never been absent from this chamber when any question upon which I was pledged to my constituents was- under consideration, or when any proposal affecting the &#39; welfare of the masses was being discussed. The Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act was placed upon the statute-book in the face of direct opposition on the part of the Deakin Government. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Play-</inline> ford and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who represented the Government in this Chamber at the time, voted against the measure, notwithstanding that the Administration to which they belonged subsequently claimed - for the purpose of securing what votes they could from the labouring classes - that they were the great exponents of the new Protection. The award given by the Minister of Trade and Customs in connexion with the employes in the distilling industry was of the most literal character. &#39;lt was the first occasion upon which clerical workers had had their wages regulated by law throughout the Commonwealth. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> the great champion of labour, who has done more for the workers in one hour than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> could accomplish in a thousand years, did not take the trouble even to vote upon that measure. At all events, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> can say, &#34; I have succeeded in carrying a law in the Commonwealth which did materially improve the condition of _ the workers, and which did bring comfort to the homes of some people &#34; ; whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> can only say that he neglected his duty, and failed to stand up for his principles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> may take refuge behind the fact that the provision in question was declared unconstitutional by the High Court. </para>

It may interest honorable senators if I&#39; read &#39;the following letter which I have received from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston,</inline> the Comptroller-General of Customs - </para>

            <para>All instructions issued under the <inline font-style="italic">Excise Tariff Aci</inline> 1906 relating to wages paid by distillers were withdrawn on the 7th July, 1908. At the same time, I believe these wages are still being paid by Joshua&#39;s, and, I fancy, other &#39; distillers. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">Honorable senators opposite know Joshua, who is the chief of their party at the present time. Whether that Act was constitutional or not, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> by means of it, succeeded in securing a permanent increase of the wages of the men engaged in the industry in the State of Victoria, whilst this great power, this creator of the Labour movement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> did absolutely nothing to bring about this improved condition of things. Now I wish to deal with a few notes upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith&#39;s</inline> speech of last week. I was astounded at the honorable senator&#39;s attitude and bearing. It was my good fortune to arrive in this great and marvellous city of Melbourne on a very memorable day in the history of &#34;the workers of Australia. It was during the great maritime strike, which was largely organized and controlled by the same honorable senator. . I was but a boy then, but I can remember a. few incidents very well. One of my recollections is of walking through Melbourne, to Flinders Park and seeing armed men in the streets. These armed men had been called out at the instance of the present Prime Minister of Australia. They had instructions from their chief,  Colonel Price,  to &#34;Fire low and lay them OUt. After a while I reached the scene of  a  great meeting. There was one man then who stood out as the champion of the workers. The impression which I received at that time has never been wiped out of my memory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> then declared the right of men to organize, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> strike, and to fight to obtain just conditions of labour. He urged the workers to organize both politically and industrially. When the capitalists at that period asked why workers struck, and why they did not send representatives to Parliament, among the earliest advocates of that policy was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> He was elected, and advocated the claims of the workers in the Legislative Assembly of this State. Having thus become a champion of Labour, he now claims that he created the Parliamentary Labour party. It must be admitted that he occupied at that time probably the highest position that it was possible for the workers of this country to confer upon him. I believe that he enjoyed the absolute confidence of every worker in Australia. We subsequently found him leading a party of very earnest men, some of them extremely able advocates of the Labour cause. The honorable senator alleges that he never left the Labour party. </para><interjection>

              <para>- An Old-age Pensions Act had been in existence in Victoria, under which the maximum pension payable was 10s. per week. I understand that that Act was limited in its operation. At the end of the period for which it was enacted, it was necessary to introduce a new Bill, which, however, was practically a measure to continue the old Act. The new Bill was introduced by the Liberal Government of which the honorable senator was a member. But they did not propose to continue the old-age pension of 10s.per week. They actually proposed to cut down the amount to 7s. per week. The honor able senator voted for the payment of a pension of 7s. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirton,</inline> the member for Ballarat West, if I recall the facts rightly, moved to strike out the word &#34; seven,&#34; with the intention of substituting &#34;ten.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> voted against that proposal. Then the Liberal. Government, which, like most Liberal Governments, was as tricky as possible, moved to insert the word &#34; eight.&#34; Again the honorable senator, when he could, not secure a pension of 7s. per week, voted for a pension of 8s. as against a pension of 10s. </para>

              <para>-  The honorable senator ought to know that the first Bill proposed a pension of 7s. per week, as in New Zealand. Being near Christmas, it was interjected : &#34; Oh, it is Christmastime, give them10s. a week this time.&#34; It was only an experiment. It was not passed as a pension of10s. per week. The original proposal was a pension of 7s. a week, and just as a good-natured act at Christmas time, as it was only a tentative measure, the pension was made10s. a week. </para>

              <para>- Good nature indeed ! I have always understood, and regret to learn otherwise, that the honorable senator advocated an old-age pension as the just right of every individual, Yet he says that the Assembly allowed a pension of 10s. a week to go through in good nature. I have never heard of the Conservatives in any Parliament doing anything of that kind before through good nature. If Conservatives in Victoria goodnaturedly granted 3s. a week more than they would otherwise have done, what becomes of the honorable senator&#39;s claim that they would not have voted10s. a week as good-naturedly as 7 s. or 8s.? There is no justification for saying that the Upper House, which voted10s. a week on one occasion, would not have voted similarly, on another occasion. At all events, if the honorable senator had been the strong earnest advocate that he had been in previous years, of the right of old people, he would have said first : &#34; Let us try for a pension of10s. a week. If the Upper House will not pass that, we will have to accept the inevitable.&#34; Can he refer me to any speech which he made on those lines at that time? </para>

I want to deal now with a few points of the address he delivered here the other day. Of course, it is impossible for me to deal with the whole of his speech. In the few notes I took, I have tried to preserve intact his exact meaning. I trust that he will not think for a moment that I desire to misrepresent his views.

I was led to believe that we could rely upon him for absolute support of all ideals of Labour. But what is the use of aspirations? Though I do not want to rob the honorable senator of credit for his share of the work he did in creating the Labour party, I would point out that other men have given more time and thought, and done much more practical work than he has ever done in that direction. Let me, in all friendliness, ask him this question. Apart from the fact that he worked and spoke on behalf of certain principles, in common with other persons, what record has he to show that he accomplished anything in the form of legislation beyond that secured by the indirect pressure which the Labour party has brought to bear upon various Governments? I heard the honorable senator claim that he was the first person to bring into existence in Victoria the minimum rate of wage. It is certainly true that he was the first to move in that direction, but he should have been just to his colleagues, as he expects them to be just to him in return. Is it not a fact that he was invited in the name of the Labour party to move in that direction ? </para><interjection>

We are thankful that he strove to prevent the fusion of parties being effected. Why did he make that effort? Was it because in his opinion the programme of the Labour party was sound or unsound ? I take it that it was because he considered that our programme was a sound one. Did he believe that the enactment of the principles enunciated at Gympie would be beneficial to Australia ? If he did, then he only did his duty in trying to prevent the Fisher Government from being dispossessed. But what do we find? While the great Democratic party to which he claims to belong,, those who are known in this State as the &#34; good as Labour men,&#34; have accused the members of the Labour party from time to time - I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has - of bartering their conscience in the caucus, will he say why he sits on the other side, why he is prepared to give any support to the Coalition Government? </para><interjection>

              <para>- Presently I will state the honorable senator&#39;s reason. In view of the fact that his action at the caucus meeting indicated his belief that at that period the Fisher Government was the best one for Australia, that is an admission from his own lips that he has betrayed his principles to abide by the majority decision of the so-called Liberal party. I do not blame the honorable senator for abiding bv a majority decision, because I do not think that there is any room for individuals in our system of party government. Knowing that he believes in party government, and expressed his belief at the Federal Convention, I do not blame him. I only want to make it quite clear that it is impossible for him to belong to the &#39;so-called Liberal party, to the fusion party, and at the same time to claim the allegiance, the confidence, and the trust of the members of the Labour party. This is what he said - </para>

As recently as seven or eight weeks ago, he advocated equality of payment for services rendered irrespective of sex. He has always been a militant trade unionist. He has held ideals in sympathy with those of the Labour party, and yet in all sincerity the honorable senator now tells the Senate, the people of Australia, and particularly the people of Victoria, that the men who are to-day sitting behind the Deakin Government desire to form an alliance in sympathy with many of the views which he and members of the Labour party have held for many years. </para><interjection>

If the honorable senator did not believe in, and strenuously voted against, the fusion, and if he would have voted for the Labour Government, had it been possible to take the vote in this chamber, and if he admits that, against the dictates of his own judgment and conscience, he voted in a caucus that was not the caucus of the Labour party, he must further admit that he was a member of a caucus sufficiently powerful to compel him to vote against his own judgment and conscience. </para>

On one or two convenient occasions, when acting as Whip to the last Deakin Government, the honorable senator&#39;s back was very prominent when the division bells were ringing. I need not mention specific instances, because the honorable senator is aware that what I say is only tpo true. If that is the kind of support he intends to give the Fusion Government, they will find him a very candid friend, whose support will not be of very much use to them. </para>

              <para>- Then I am unable to understand the portion of the Gympie programme to which the honorable senator objects. From his silence I can only infer that he agrees with the whole of that programme. If that be so, why is he not upon this side of the Senate, assisting to eject from office those who will not make  that policy the law of the country? No accusation of maladministration has ever been levied against the Fisher Government - it was simply the Gympie programme, with the prospect of a progressive land tax, which brought about their downfall. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> indorses the whole of that programme there must have been betrayal in his heart when he agreed to support the present Administration. The Government have intimated, as distinctly as the Deakinesque language employed in the Ministerial statement will permit one to interpret it, that they intend to initiate a borrowing policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> does not believe in a borrowing policy. Yet he is willing to support the retention in office of a Government that will - if the necessary numbers can be secured - make the Commonwealth the seventh borrower in Australia.

That being the case, is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> quite sure that he has secured a free hand in regard to Protection which he has advocated for so many years? And if both those gentlemen are at liberty to exercise a free hand upon the fiscal question, what about the difficulties that will be created when we come to seriously consider Tariff anomalies ? I can quite understand a man reaching a stage at which it becomes manifest to him that he has been working upon wrong lines, and when accordingly he becomes converted, but I cannot understand a great body of men who have been students of political history for many years becoming converted holus-bolus to the political ideas entertained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline></para>

              <para>- I should have hastened but for the delay occasioned by the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> Before the advent of the present Government there were three parties in this Parliament - the Liberal party, the wreckage of various other parties, and the Labour party. By his silence <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has indorsed the whole of the programme of the Fisher Government. Some of the members of the so-called Democratic party to which he claims to belong evidently believe that that programme would not be a bad thing if they were only secure in their seats. But, as evidencing how sincere they are in their belief that it is in the best interests of the country, we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> and the whole of his party, now in the grip of those who have .for years fought so vigorously against every ideal formerly held by them:. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#39;Trenwith</inline> indicate one principle which made him a power in Victoria, one ideal, one plank in his platform which the majority of the supporters of the present Government have not consistently opposed? I know of none. Consequently, there must be a big sacrifice of principle, and that being so, I take it that the minority, and not the majority, will be called upon to make the sacrifice. </para>

              <para>- I am afraid that the fuse will be burning during the next few months, and that about March next it will reach the powder. Then some persons will, go up. I am not sure that they will be. the Conservatives who represent Conservative seats, or Labour men, who represent Labour constituencies. Probably they will be those who are sitting on a rail in Labour constituencies, because they will not obtain &#39; the Conservative vote. Let me conclude by&#39; asking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> as ex-Leader of the Labour party, and one of the men who assisted to create and maintain it for years, how he can justify his claim that he did not leave the party, but that the party left him? To-day he says, in effect: &#34;I believe in the ideals of the Labour party, and in the principles embodied in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline> manifesto at Gympie.&#34; May  1  ask him, then, why the </para>

But I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will admit that if that was the only difference it was not so great that it should drive him into the bosom of the inveterate enemies of the Labour party. Let me ask him this : If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> believes in the principles of the Labour party,, if it be true, as he claims, that he never hit back at the Labour party, if it be true that men have shouted &#34;Traitor !&#34; to him in the street, and that he silently bore all this without hitting back- </para>

              <para>- It shows that the honorable senator had been practising unfaithfulness to principles for some years past. I wish to say, in conclusion, that I had no desire whatever to be personal. I do not think that I have dealt with other than the political principles of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and those with whom he is now associated. My only desire was to say a few words in defence of my own party, and to remove some misapprehensions that seem to exist to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> was a sort of superior Labour man, who would never contaminate himself by signing the pledge as the mere ordinary hod-carrier of the Labour movement has to do. </para>

As such has not been the case, I can only say that, in my belief, the people will take their political revenge in March next, when we shall find not only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> but those associated with him in the so-called Democratic party who have so basely abandoned every political principle they ever held, receiving their deserts at the hands of the electors. </para>

            <para>. - I approach the consideration of the matter before the Senate from a somewhat different point of view from that which has been taken by the honorable senator who has just sat down. My honorable and greatly esteemed friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> said, the other day, that he would like to hear me on the situation, and mv honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> in the course of a speech to the whole of which, unfortunately, I had not the pleasure of listening, said that he also would be glad to hear my opinion on some of the matters to which he referred. My esteem for both my honorable friends is so great that the least I can do is to gratify them in those particulars, or attempt to do&#34; so. The occasion is the advent to office of a new Ministry. It is not an ordinary Ministry. It is not a coalition Ministry. It is not a reunion, which was the name applied to that combination which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> formed with the Labour party in 1905, when, under circumstances that are a matter of history, he ejected the Reid-McLean Government from office. That was supposed to be a reunion of hearts that had been temporarily estranged, and of people who were brought . back to the combined fold. That, as I say, was called a reunion. But for this Ministry a new name has had to be coined. It is called a &#34;fusion.&#34; Now, my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> thinks that that is a very good name. He defended it because, as I gathered, he thinks fusion strengthens back-bone. </para>

              <para>- I am glad to hear that. I do not think that on any occasion I have ever been very much troubled about a name. It is the thing itself which concerns us. The thing itself here is the Ministry. There are two things in relation to the Ministry that are important; its <inline font-style="italic">-personnel</inline> and its policy. I do not think that ft is possible, I&#39; do not think it would be just, to dissociate the one from the other; because while there may be offers of policy, still, as the honorable senator who has just sat down indicated, a great deal depends upon the confidence or trust which you repose in those who put forward these promises as to whether or not you can have any faith in their carrying them out. In neither aspect does this fusion commend itself to me. It does not inspire me with that confidence, that trust, or that enthusiasm which some of my friends may - each of us must exercise his own judgment - feel upon the subject. But I wish to express my view of it ; and I think that it is due &#34;thaW I should), seeing .that !my, esteemed friends, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> have paid me the compliment to which I have referred. I shall recall, I hope without any personal feeling of any sort or description, a few facts to show why I do not myself regard the fusion with a friendly eye. These are facts which I respectfully, and in all humility, submit for the consideration of my honorable friends, as to whether they should not with me pause before giving a whole-hearted and undivided allegiance to a leader whom, ever since the establishment of this Commonwealth, they have opposed whenever he has been in office-Mo a leader to whom they have been opposed during, at least, seven years - to a leader who yesterday spurned and insulted us as the wreckage of causes which some of my honorable friends may hold dear. Now, I am going to recall plainly one or two facts, and to invite my honorable friends to reason with me about them. Let us reason together for a moment as to whether or not we are going to be suddenly inspired with faith in the wrecker. Now we have a record of what took place and of what was said on the 20th October, 1908. At that time my respected and esteemed friend, the Right Honorable G. H. Reid, was the leader of the party to which I considered it an honour to belong. He was the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives; and, in my judgment, it was a misfortune to this country when he retired from the leadership. The present Prime Minister then said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> being present - </para>

              <para>- I am very glad to get that cheer, because no one better understands the inner history of this business, I believe, than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> and that &#34; Hear, hear,&#34; whilst it is explanatory, is distinctly distressing for the wreckage&#39; to hear. Is it not reasonable that we should consider why we should be in such haste to go over to the enemy ? Why should we fly so fast into the bosom of the gentleman who has so insulted us ? Why should we go so fast into the bosom of our traducer ? Why should we not at least have had a withdrawal ? Why should he not have explained that this was all a mistake, made in the heat of the moment? As Confucius, whose precepts are almost equal to those of the Christian religion, once said : &#34; The danger of allowing a man to spit in your face without resenting it, is that he may be tempted to do it again.&#34; So far as the Opposition led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> was concerned, none of us were so poor - I mean politically, because I have always had as great a liking for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> personally as any man can have - as to do him reverence. Are we now to begin and continue shouting  &#39; Hosanna, &#39; &#39; without explanation, without one word being said to bridge over, so far as I can see, the immense gulf that existed and that was intensified on the occasion to which I referred ? Has he magnetized the people? Has he over-persuaded them ? Like every one else, I recognise his marvellous gifts of speech ; they are, I think, beyond compare. I remember well an historic occasion when our very good friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, stood in the House of Representatives, a living protest to the treachery of which he was the subject at the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> He said - </para>

I beseech honorable senators most respectfully to join  with  me  in  endeavouring to resist the persuasion which, at least temporarily, has led to a dominant majority in Opposition having down their arms, and not merely ignominiously surrendering to the enemy, but selecting and accepting the General as theirs. I refrained from interposing earlier in this debate, because it seemed to me that the Labour party had a </para>

They evidently feel the natural bitterness of defeat, and also the perfectly natural and just resentment at what they seem to regard as the scurvy treatment which has been meted out to them. I remember that some years ago John Bright, in making a speech in the House of Commons on the abolition of primogeniture, related a little .anecdote in inverted commas, describing something that had happened. He had made a similar speech previously, and on leaving the House of Commons he met a younger son, who said to him - and he quoted the remark in the House of Commons in his second speech as I quote it now - &#34; We have been damned badly used.&#34; That may possibly be the feeling of the Labour party in regard to their recent treatment. </para>

              <para>- I do not know about that, but I have no sympathy with them on that score, because I think it serves them right for leaning on so broken a reed as they did. But I give them this consolation that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has treated them in respect to the matter they complain of not a bit worse than he has treated others; not a bit worse than he treated another Ministry and its leaders. What causes me considerable perplexity as to the present situation is that I object to be content now to sit in ostensible support of a politician who, as I think, betrayed my own leader and my own friends only so very short a time ago. Now, what is the case of the Labour party? I should not have referred to this except that it seems to me that frequently the blame is thrown on the wrong shoulders. The Labour party are called to account for daring to have a grievance. Here I wish to agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said in regard to the party. </para>

With their aid, and in respect to that we certainly have nothing to thank them for, he destroyed the Ministry which a few months before he had put into office, and of which he was supposed to be a loyal supporter.

              <para>- I do not know whether I am quoting correctly, but I think I saw in some newspaper that, at a meeting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had proposed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> should be the leader. That was the right thing to do. The satisfaction I have here is that an extinguisher has been put upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> as Leader of the Senate, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> occupies that position today. It is a pity the same thing did not take place in the other Chamber. </para>

            <para>He was ready to promote a Liberal Labour Coalition on a fair basis of cooperation. But this offer was contemptuously cast aside, and Labour demanded and obtained its desire that a Labour Ministry should be formed without any infusion of the Liberal element. </para>

          <para>The Labour party preferred what is called isolation, that, I suppose, simply means running on their own, to keeping <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> longer in office, or sharing it with him. Now, what took place in the early days of November of last year? Can anybody who recalls what took place then - and the facts must be fresh in our minds - repose any confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> as the Leader of this Government, entitled to the confidence of the community in promoting the destinies of Australia? Can any one believe in the protestations which are made as to the great altitude which he has reached in purifying and re-organizing the political conditions of this country? What took place? A cut-and-dried arrangement - I use that term advisedly - by which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was to go out of office and his friends who constituted the larger portion of his following were to take his place. What happened? There were some mysterious private conferences - a form of intrigue ; I will not use the word &#34;conspiracy,&#34; which has been used so frequently- </para>

              <para>- It will do well enough. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> solemnly intimated - and I hope that honorable senators will recognise that I am dealing with this matter quite impartially - that the larger section on the Ministerial side of the House of Representatives could no longer support the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> gravely assented, and inquired, &#34; Is there no other step now ?&#34; But it is quite evident that that announcement was expected, and the proper course for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to have taken was either to have resigned there and then or to have awaited the submission of a motion of no confidence by the recognised official Opposition, whose leader then was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook.</inline> But, of course, that was not the object of this little game. It might have let the regular Opposition into office, whereas the object was to permit of the larger section of the Ministerial side of the House - the Labour party- assuming the reins of Government. In point of fact, it was, in substance, a reconstruction of the Ministry which then existed. So it was arranged that a formal motion, should be submitted, upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> should move a slight technical amendment, the voting upon which would be regarded as a motion of no confidence in the Government, thus assuring that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who submitted it, should be sent for by his  Excellency  the Governor-General. On a subsequent occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> very properly denounced the whole of this arrangement and referred to what he described as the &#34; alacrity &#34; with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> rose to submit his trivial technical amendment. Now I ask honorable senators what faith we can have in a leader who is a party to a scheme of that kind? </para>

          <para class="block">It was probably the last sentence or two upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> relied in submitting his amendment. Again and again in the House of Representatives upon the discussion of Ministerial policy, both at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> by interjection, declared that he was keeping the Labour party in office, although he threw the gibe at the Opposition that they had helped to put them there. What does all this mean ? I say without hesitation that the bargain to which I have alluded was not at all a creditable one. I recollect very well <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> denouncing it in this Chamber in emphatic terms, and describing it by that lively simile, &#34; the descent upon the tart shop.&#34; I quite agree with that description. It was a delightful and perfectly true expression. But the &#34; tart shop &#34; was laid open to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;</inline> s successors by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> The arrangement was arrived at with the co-operation and agreement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> Such an agreement is of a character unknown in political history, and of a character which I hope will never be known again in political history? In plain English, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> enjoyed the fruits of office for over three years, and he rewarded a section of his followers wh&#91;o had stood by him during that time by placing them in office. </para>

I do not care who is concerned in a transaction of this kind, I should mete out the same censure, because I desire to see purity and fair play. The position was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> - having put the Labour party into office as part of a bargain which was not a creditable one, but rather one which every one of my honorable friends here would have denounced as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did - abandoned the principles which I had always attributed to him.

              <para>- If I am forgetting anything, the omission can be supplied. The more the details of this history are filled up the more disagreeable does it become. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> felt that the Labour Government ought not to be in office - that it was, as some of us &#39; considered, impotent - and if he knew that his promised support was a sham, I say that he was guilty of paying them for services rendered to him, not out of his own pocket, but out of the pockets of the taxpayers. 0 Why should he, if he did not believe that they should be in office? If he contemplated that at the end of the six months he was going to turn them out of office, why did he put them in office or allow them to remain there for a day? When Parliament prorogued the late Government was in a minority. A good &#39; many of us expressed the opinion that they could do nothing. They were powerless. It was even said, as a charge against them, that they wanted to get into recess. I dare say they did. -It was quite natural under the circumstances. And here was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> who is now Prime Minister of this great country, putting them in office, keeping them in office, and keeping six months in recess, the men whom he now literally declares were simply masquerading and were not really a Ministry at all. </para>

              <para>- But surely my honorable friend would not hand over the destinies of Australia to the keeping of a man who would betray them? That is the question that has been perplexing me. How am I, in the face of these things, to take to my bosom a man who has traduced my party and my leader ? But I say, again, that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> knew and felt that the Labour Ministry was incompetent, what was to justify him., in the face of the country, in putting them in office? What is there to justify him in giving these interlopers six months&#39; pay but of the taxpayers&#39; purse for doing nothing? But the man who is the greatest culprit is the man who ought to have known better, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> If, on the other hand, he honestly believed that the Labour party were worthy of office and of power at all&#39;, as I am quite willing to assume that he did, then he did them a cruel wrong in immediately beginning to intrigue against them, and what is more, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook&#39;s</inline> expression, in booting them out of office without a hearing. That is one part of the story. The second part is, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and his Ministry were entitled to rely on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> support; not always, not eternally, but until, on some point of policy or some point of administration, clearly defined, they were arraigned and defeated. I confess I shall be glad to hear that action justified. Having put them in office, and having declared in the passage I have read, contrasting the two, that they had supported him for three years, and that he and his party were prepared to do as much for them, I cannot understand how he could be a party to turning them out of office without giving them an opportunity of being heard in their own defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> who expressed himself exceedingly well, as he always does, on the 26th November, tried to extract some information about the situation. He said - </para>

          <para>Of course he meant to suggest that not merely the arrangement had been carried into effect, but that a suggestion had been made to the Governor- General - who consulted the Governor-General for them, and that friend is sitting by them to-day, staunch for the present. </para>
          <para class="block">Now that reminds me of a little story that I heard some time ago. A lady was complaining to her old gardener that he was a little the worse for liquor, and she said to him, &#34; Now, John, when you came to me you know you said you were a staunch teetotaller.&#34; The gardener replied, &#34;Not staunch, ma&#39;am, not staunch !&#34; My friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> must, I think, have seen that story when he said, &#34; Staunch for the present.&#34; He went on to complain, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did most justly and with great emphasis in the Senate, that a change of Government had taken place without a scintilla of reason. But is not that exactly what has happened now ? Is there any difference? Is it not a fact that, under the circumstances I have recalled to the attention of the Senate, the Labour Government were, to again use an expression of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook&#39;s,</inline> ignominiously booted out by the present Prime Minister, who had put them in? As <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner declared on the occasion that I have already referred to, the hand that made them was the hand to unmake them. It was done without a scintilla of reason, under circumstances which required at least some reason, some indictment. It was different in that respect from the previous occasion, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> changed portfolios with them. Then, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> could make no complaint, because it was under an arrangement that he had himself made. This ignominious booting out of office of the Labour party was performed by the politician who had assisted to put them into office, as they had supported him during a long period when he enjoyed the emoluments of office at their hands. Well might they say -  </para>

              <para>- In that respect, I think, my honorable friend is right in saying that he is going to watch <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> That, at all events, is satisfactory. What I have related is the position according to the records as they are before us. But there is one other little thing that I would like to mention. On the 20th October, when the little arrangement I have detailed took place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> apologized for having been a party to turning out the Labour Government, and, to show that there was no fleck in the sea of their smooth relations, he explained that he had not intended to do them any harm when he voted them out of office in 1.904. He said this - </para>

              <para>- Is panic-fear of a party who have done nothing a kind of justification? The great difference is that that arrangement was .not made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> I thank my honorable friend for the reference, because I recollect that it was then a case of national union in this country or nothing. It was a specific issue, and no more. But I also remember, and recall to his recollection if he will permit me, with all deference, another coalition which was with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> It was more nearly the kind of thing than that in New South Wales. It involved the sinking of the fiscal issue for a time. We have often heard of the fiscal issue. I do not know where it is now, under the language of this Ministerial statement. But at that time, let it be remembered, we had just passed a Tariff, and the sole object of the sinking of the fiscal issue was to secure fiscal peace for that Parliament. Apparently we were all going on comfortably. Our friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> who put us in office, went quietly to Ballarat; and having on a previous occasion at that place denounced in no measured terms the Labour party, he made a speech. I quote, not from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but from a most excellent pamphlet by my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON.- My honorable friend does not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> will not do. At any rate, that is what he did to us on that occasion. To the Free Traders in the Ministry who had taken the risk of such things, it meant a condemnation, but nothing else. No self-respecting Government would hold office for &#34;five minutes when their occupancy of it depended literally upon the vote of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> ; certainly upon his support. On that occasion it did not matter very much to those who must take the risk of such things. But the Ministry included four members who were old political and personal friends of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> two of them being very old friends of his in the State Parliament. I remember well the pathetic figure of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner in the House of Representatives when he was so severely stricken with illness that, the  Speaker,  certainly once, if not on more than one occasion, besought the forbearance of honorable members in interjecting. No more pathetic scene has ever been witnessed In any Parliament than on that occasion when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner got up in his place and, with a trembling voice and in great pain - not bodily only, but mental also - declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> had urged him again and again to go into the Ministry and that but for his personal solicitation he would not have gone in. </para>

          <para>Is a politician who has lowered the political and moral life of the community to be the leader of it ? </para>
          <para>I believe that he will live to regret the manner in which he has brought about this situation. Speaking politically, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has absolutely dishonoured the cheque that he gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> If I were to describe him as I regard him I would rather speak of him as a political jelly fish. When I say that, of course, I am only speaking of him politically. To my mind, this conduct says very little for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> as a practical politician. We should like to think of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> personally as the estimable man that we have all believed him to be hitherto. </para>
          <para class="block">That, I think, is a plain narrative of facts. The only additional fact&#39; which I think it is well to bear in mind, is that at the election which followed shortly afterwards, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> to show his friendship for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> went up Gippsland and most vehemently opposed him. I do not&#39; like very much the expression I am going to use, but with a slight alteration I will quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing said of the Labour party, and ask whether it might not be said of the present Prime Minister by some of those concerned in these incidents - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>An alliance with the present Prime Minister is like an alliance with an American Indian. He may fight on your side, but pretty soon after the fight is over he will get your&#34; scalp if he gets the chance. </para>

As I said, we still have minority rule, and the only difference, as compared with previous positions, is that some members of the majority are, in the case of the present Government, taken into office with some members of the minority. </para>

To-day he is the Leader of the anti-Socialists. Yesterday he was prepared to cast out from his Ministry four or five of his own friends, in order to admit an equal number of Socialists ; to-day he intrigues to dismiss the Socialists without a hearing. Yesterday he declared it impossible then, or in the future, to work with the wreckage of those causes which he described as the Opposition ; to-day he claims to be their leader. Yesterday he told the Imperial Authorities that Australia was desirous of putting an. end to the payment of &#163;200,000 a year under the Naval Agreement. To-day he makes political capital out of an offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or its equivalent of &#163;2,000,000. </para>

              <para>- I will show my honorable friend in a moment.. He at least lived politically for years on the system of* government by a minority, and now he poses as the instrument specially designed to destroy it. The other day, in England, and elsewhere, he talked largely about immigration. He affirmed that Australia was a great continent lying almost empty, and calling aloud for adventurous spirits to come from the Old Country - for the life-blood of a nation. Yet he placed upon the statute-book the Immigration Restriction Act, and the Contract Immigrants Act? Is he not responsible for section 16 in the Post and Telegraph Act, which was characterized as &#34; wrong, foolish, and dishonest &#34; ? Is this to be repealed under his leadership ? Let us look upon the record of the legislation which we have hitherto opposed, and ask ourselves &#34; Can this be true?&#34; Are we to put the stamp of our approval upon his successful efforts to so increase the cost of mining, farming, and other industries as to diminish employment, and to reduce earnings? Despite our opposition, he drove the kanakas out of the sugar industry. Am I to say to that, and to the other things which I have mentioned; &#34; Well done.&#34; Is he not responsible for the union label ? We should never have had it but for him. </para>

              <para>- I am rather encouraged to hear that.I am always glad to reflect that we have the High Court when these Acts turn out to be failures. But it was not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> fault that the union label &#39;proved to be a failure. Has any other man been in one sense so faithless to Federation by placing so many unconstitutional measures on the statute-book in defiance - and this is the whole point of my contention - of the Opposition? And are we still going to trust him with the Constitution? We have the Australian Industries Preservation Act, the Commerce Act, and the Trade Descriptions Act: - all of which were opposed by us - upon the statute-book, and we have also that monstrous fiasco, the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act - that delightful excursion into the realms of new Protection - and the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act. Yet we are asked to pledge our fealty to a Minister who is responsible for all these measures, the greater number of which were passed despite our strenuous opposition.- At any rate, we did not consider them part of the programme to which we ought to give our assent. No manager of a business would be engaged without his credentials being first examined, and yet we are asked to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> as Prime Minister in the face of the damaging record, from our point of view, which the whole statute-book presents. I am sorry that that should be the position to-day. But whatever our regard for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> may be- - and, personally, I hold him in the highest esteem - we must -look at his political acts. I think it was a distinct misfortune that he did not adhere to his earliest intention to stand aside upon the occasion when the negotiations for the fusion of parties took place. Had he done so, he would have felt a happier man, and more confident of his position in the country than he can possibly feel to-day. The negotiations for the fusion were of a very curious character, and I propose to read just one or two sentences from the cablegrams transmitted to- the English newspapers. As early as the ctb March the political campaign had begun, and the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> stated - </para>

There is no misunderstanding what we may expect from the Socialists, but in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dea-</inline> kin we never know where he is. The Labour party reminds me somewhat of the boy in the drug store. When a gentleman came along and saw the little fellow behind the counter he exclaimed: &#34;Halloa, have you got a diploma? &#34; To which the little fellow replied : &#34; No, but we have a little mixture of our own which is quite as good.&#34; That is my complaint against the Labour party. They have &#34; a little mixture of their own.&#34; </para>

              <para>- I shall not dwell upon the point that I object very much to the reading of the Ministerial statement. I objected before, in 1905, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> read the statement of policy of the Government that then came in. I think it is an insult to the Senate to have a written statement of that kind brought clown without the advantage of explanation and elucidation upon the different points forming part of the policy. It was sought to be justified in 1905 bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who said that the Government wanted to &#34; sing the same song &#34; in both Houses of the Legislature. </para>

              <para>- It is just because the result could not be very melodious that it has been put in this form. It is significant that these two questionable Deakin Ministries should have adopted the same questionable method that I am criticising. Of course, it may be that, Ministers being new to office, they had not got quite into harmonious working, and had not complete confidence in each other. But the greatest difficulty that arises out of this practice is that the statement is laid before us without elucidation. When it is brought forward within the four corners of a written instrument, there is no explanation. The position&#39; in regard to a Governor-General&#39;s speech is entirely different. First of all, the speech is read ; then two gentlemen selected from the Ministerial supporters, and who are supposed to be inspired by the Government, deliver themselves upon it ; then there is a speech from the Leader of the Opposition; and&#39; then discussion is opened by the Minister who happens to be leading, on behalf of the Government, making an explanation. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> pass that point by, however, in order to say that I am puzzled by the basis of agreement on which the Ministerial party has been formed. I find that there are at least four different published statements as to what is called the basis of the fusion. I am in a state of great perplexity, and I look to my Free Trade friends to explain the position to me. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> stated the basis of the fusion to be- </para>

It was the rectification of anomalies about which the split took place in  1904,  and it was because of the use of these very words  about rectification that an excuse for the  split was found. First one set of Protectionists, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> following in their ways, destroyed the agreement, reopening the whole subject, and leading to the construction of a new Tariff, with all its attendant evils. </para>

              <para>- Even&#39; one is to be free. I accept that as what is believed. But what is the result? The result is the very thing that happened in 7904. What was sunk then was the reopening of the Tariff, except for the rectification of anomalies. That exception was seized upon by the Protectionists as an excuse for re-opening the whole question. Of course every one was free, but the exception burst up the agreement, and turned out&#34; the Ministry which was put in on the supposition that everything was all right. But I am still more puzzled when I come to the Ministerial statement. I am only going to refer to one paragraph of it. It is certainly a most extraordinary: statement. It says - </para>

            <para>The most complex series of measures to be submitted includes those affecting the industrial interests of the Commonwealth.

          <para class="block">The first tiling that this Government proposes to do is to seek an &#39;amendment of the Constitution, which I think every Federalist ought to resist. In the Constitution we have an Inter-State Commission defined, and the object is to enlarge its powers and give it the extraordinary function of a. Federal Labour Bureau.&#34; Its members are, I suppose, to employ their leisure in making a study of unemployment. When they get into their offices they are to make a study of unemployment, and also a scheme for insurance against it. It is to be a kind of roving Commission, I suppose, to find out for a future Government a policy on unemployment and insurance. But it is not to be merely that. Of course it is to undertake many valuable functions. It is to have - a general oversight of production and exchange, supplying information in respect to markets and openings for trade, abroad, and for the improvement and extension of Australian industries within our borders. </para>

Not its general working but its operation - upon the investment of Australian capital and labour in Australian industries. </para>

          <para>Any divergencies between industrial conditions in the several States which occasion an unjust competition between Australian industries in different States will be adjusted by the Inter-State Commission, with of course, due regard to all the interests affected - </para>
          <para class="block">That is to say, the condition of the manufacturer, and the condition of the workman will be in a far more parlous state than they are in now, because no one knows how the Inter-State Commission will be constituted. If it is to have plenary power without appeal, except on questions of law, as is the case under the Constitution, then the industrial interests of Australia will be intrusted to a power that will be absolutely beyond control, and will exercise an autocratic and untrammelled influence in all probability to the disaster of those interests&#39; in some form or other. We are told that any divergencies will be adjusted - with of course due regard to all the interests affected, whether or not the unjustly competitive rates exist under the authority of local industrial tribunals. </para>

I know my honorable friend&#39;s patriotism, but think that if he had reflected he would have seen that very few men, with a spark of real patriotic feeling in their breasts, and not carried away by the excitement of the moment, could fairly and justly come to such a conclusion as that. I believe that Great Britain is supreme, that she possesses the mightiest fleet that has ever been in the world. If so terrible an occasion should arise as that her interest, her integrity, and her life were assailed, I believe that that little isle set in the silver sea would rise, as she has done before over and over again, in the magnitude of her might, and successfully face Europe itself in arms.

We all agree with that. Another indisputable point is that hitherto Australia has not borne her share of the burden of the Empire. The link that unites us to the Mother Country is invisible, but it is none the less strong, and it is incumbent upon every part of this; Empire, which is linked up with the heart, to rise to the responsibilities which rest upon it of doing its share in the maintenance of the integrity of the Empire and&#39; of the great instrument by which that integrity is kept up. Those who talk and&#39; imagine that everything should be left to England should remember that the people of the Old Country hold a lordship over some eleven or twelve millions square miles of the earth&#39;s surface - great areas of the world, equal to fifty times the area of France - and over a population numbering one-fourth  of the whole human race, in many parts where the white man is a mere fraction, and that on these little islands, as Lord Rosebery called them the other day, lie the pressure and the duty to defend the Empire. I do not believe that any one in this country would be mean enough to say, &#34; Oh, leave our defences alone, let England defend us.&#34;&#39; But when we speak of our defence we have to remember that there is the defence of our own shores, and of the trade routes,. the protection of which is vital to our oversea trade, and the defence of which is, in fact, wholly in the hands of the Imperial Fleet, because it is only nonsense to suggest that we can insure its protection by means of a local navy. It must remain in the hands of the Imperial Fleet, which in this connexion is like the surgeon who holds in his hand the artery from which, if it is opened, the whole life&#39;s blood will stream. We know also that if the navy of Great Britain were to suffer a reverse - I do not mean one, or, perhaps, two - but if Great Britain sustained a reverse from which her power would stagger, whether we had an invasion to face here or not, the hand of the dial of the progress of Australia would te put back for a couple of generations. Another thing is quite clear if we recognise this, and that is, that to avoid war we should be ready for it. We require adequate armament, concentrated equipment, and efficiency, and what I lay the greatest stress upon, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> did the other day, a uniform and central direction. We are not to wait until the country is pillaged, our citizens killed, or our houses in flames. We are not to forget, as has been too much the habit in Australia, I am afraid, that the fighting instinct is not yet dead in the human breast. But we are to arm and prepare the power and readiness of the Empire, and to the humble extent to which we are responsible our power and readiness, that we may avoid the horrors of war. We may be all convinced of this, yet there is nothing, and &#39;I repeat now that in my humble opinion there was nothing, to justify the scare which took place and the offer of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> I do not say that it was anything discreditable at all; far from it. No one could possibly ignore the effect of a demonstration, or of a declaration, whether it is business-like or not, upon foreign nations. But that is not the point of view from which we ought to took at it. </para>

              <para>- It was the outcome of hysterical emotion, and not the considered proposal of sane minds. I want to recall what took place, and I am afraid it has been a great deal overlooked. What led to the scare? The Imperial Government were as much alive to the necessity of maintaining the supremacy of the Navy as were, any of us here. It happens that there is a Liberal Government in power in Great Britain, and that there is a Conservative Opposition. It happens that party feeling runs high, and that with a. view to carrying out their policy to increase the strength of the Fleet and to provide ways and means in order to prepare the way-- - </para>

              <para>- That expresses it very well. In order to prepare the way, with many among their supporters who were desirous of economizing in various directions, including the Navy, the Government made a statement. in Parliament with regard to the strength of the  Navy,  and instituted a comparison, a wholly incomplete comparison, between the building operations of Great Britain and the building operations of Germany. They said that recognising the position it was necessary to lay down four improved <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> - not <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> as technically understood - two in July, and two in the month of November; and then they went on to say that consideration would be given to improvements, developments, and so on ; and that, if necessary, they took the power to lay down four more next year. That was eight <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts.</inline> That statement was immediately seized upon by the Tory party for party purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour</inline> said, &#34;But you must strike out &#39;may&#39; and put in &#39; shall&#39; &#34; ; and, not content with that, he gave notice of a censure motion in the House of Commons, condemning the Government for not immediately laying down eight <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts.</inline> I shall quote a word or two from an article by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> White, who used to be Director of Naval Construction, and who is perfectly impartial and entirely disinterested. </para>

              <para>- Undoubtedly. If a Government desire that their proposals shall be carried they must put their best foot foremost and make&#39; out the best case they can in support of their position. That was a right course for the Imperial Government to take, but I think they were not wise, if I may presume to&#39; say so, in the method they adopted. It would probably have been better, as many people admitted at the time, if they had been a little more definite as to the course they intended to take during, the following year. The difficult situation was brought about by their use of the word &#34;may.&#34; It was a temptation which, I think, the national spirit, as opposed to the party spirit, might have induced the Opposition to avoid. But they could not resist the temptation, and the first thing that was done was to instantly magnify what was said by the demand to substitute the word &#34;shall&#34; for the word &#34;may.&#34; I propose to quote some references to the matter from an article by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. William</inline> White, an ex-Director of Naval Construction. He was a perfectly impartial witness. He stands in the front rank of naval constructors, and is a man without any political interests and subject in no way to political influence.

The thing, if I may be forgiven the expression, is childish. What was proposed here was the offer of an additional ship.

I saw the other day in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald-</inline><inline font-style="italic">a</inline> very well-informed newspaper- that the present scare is about aerial ships. It is said that Germany is constructing these aerial ships in such numbers that Britain must wake up. Are we going to offer an aerial ship? What do we know about them ? </para>

          <para class="block">Again, he says that upon this question journalists have lost their heads. I would also remind honorable senators that, apart from the number of ships in any&#39; navy, a good deal depends upon power and efficiency. The efficiency of the British Fleet, apart from the number of ships which it contains, is absolutely unrivalled. Upon that point we have .the testimony of no less an authority than Lord Roberts, who, in the alarmist speech which he made the other day in the House of Lords, declared that the Army was a sham Army, but that the Fleet - owing to the fact that it had not been made a party question - was efficient. He deplored the tendency which has been exhibited during the past month or- two to make the Fleet a party question. There were 300 vessels, each as full of machinery as a watch, manoeuvring in the North Sea for three weeks last year - I note that this year there were 350 vessels so engaged - and the fact that they returned to their respective rendezvous without a single accident, is the most marvellous testimony to the efficiency of the British Fleet as a war machine. An American Admiral who witnessed the manoeuvres said - </para>

            <para>The British Navy is impressive, not merely because of its overwhelming size, but chiefly because of the shining efficiency which we seldom associate with bulk. It is the pride of the Briton and of every man in whose veins runs Anglo-Saxon blood. </para>

          <para class="block">That is the spirit which we ought to encourage just as we ought to oppose the tendency to accept scares which are created purely for party purposes. I ask the forgiveness of honorable senators for reminding them of a very admirable Lord Nelson story. When Nelson originally set out in search of the French Fleet he had only ten sail of the line, although he was pursuing eighteen sail of the line with a steady determination to bring them to battle. At Barbadoes his fleet &#34;was strengthened by two other sail of the line. When he arrived off Trinidad he thought that the French Fleet under Villeneuve was there. Accordingly he summoned all his captains to a council on the deck of the old <inline font-style="italic">Victory.</inline> The following is all that took place at that council : - -.He said to the captains : &#34; The French Fleet is probably there. They have eighteen sail of the line. The <inline font-style="italic">Victory</inline> will take three, the <inline font-style="italic">Canopus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Spartiate,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Belleisle,</inline> will take two each, and the rest of you will take one apiece. Now&#39;, gentlemen, the fleets are equal.&#34; That is the kind of spirit in which we ought to approach the consideration of the question of the comparative strength of fleets. </para>

            <para>Viewed in the light of the latest information it will be seen that a programme which provides for effectively commencing two new British battleships in July, and two others in November next, and for completing each ship in two years, should give us 16 completed vessels of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Invincible</inline> classes before the end of 1911, at which time Germany would possess nine similar vessels ready for service, two others approaching completion, and two well advanced, but not expected to be ready for service until the autumn of 1912. </para>

We have reason to be ashamed of the wild talk which has been indulged in by some writers during the last few days, and for an assertion that &#34; Unless the Government can be induced or forced .... to lay down eight ships in the next few months, and to order that those vessels shall be pushed on day and night, our naval supremacy is doomed, and our national life, our Imperial existence, are worth little more than two years&#39; purchase.&#34; </para>

              <para>- I do not know. I suppose she is making them for the same reason as actuates England. I am somewhat apprehensive, like every one else, but I am one of those who suppose - and I saw that an Ambassador said the same thing a little while ago - that Germany is increasing her naval strength because she wants to be in the front rank as a naval power, and to protect her enormously increasing sea trade. She probably sees that her interests require to be protected. But I admit fully that it is the duty of the Empire to maintain the British Fleet, to preserve our supremacy upon the seas, whatever Germany may do, and whatever her ulterior object may be. I will come to another passage in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> White&#39;s article, which gives the absolute figures as to the mighty Fleet possessed by England at this very moment as compared with Germany - </para>

          <para>A considerable number of the British armoured cruisers are distinctly superior to some German battleships in offensive and defensive power. The British battleships have 152 12 inch guns in their armaments; the German battleships 40 n inch. British cruisers carry 6S 9.2 inch guns as against 6 9.4 guns carried by the German cruisers. When it is remembered that this mighty fleet will be supplanted in 1912 by at least 16 completed <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline> and that 20 such vessels will be ready if the four contingent <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> are laid down, while Germany anticipates the completion of 13 ships only by the autumn of 191 2, it must be admitted that no true reason exists for anxiety as to our naval strength three years hence in comparison with Germany ; or that the accelerated completion in that country of any possible number of <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> by that date can threaten our superiority sinGe we can build as fast and probably faster. </para>
          <para class="block">I ask to be forgiven for making these quotations.

I am not making these remarks in any party spirit. I should deplore it if there were any party element whatever in the consideration of a question of this kind. But the mind of the country ought not to be left in a condition of panic if any effort of any of us can help to do away with it. I am glad to see that in Lord Charles Beresford&#39; s speech on the subject he expressly deprecates any panic. </para>

              <para>- My honorable friend would give twenty battleships, and so would I, if it were necessary. If it is put on a businesslike footing, showing that it is necessary, and that the proper way is to make a contribution, I am ready at this moment to vote either battle-ships or money, or anything else. If the Imperial Conference, or Government, say, &#34; The proper way to assist us is by giving us a contribution of  ^1,000,000,&#34;  and we have the means at our disposal, I am prepared to support the request, but that is not the position at all. </para>

              <para>-I should have held my hand and my tongue. Let me see what happened not knowing the facts, and I always take that into account. In New Zealand, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward offered a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> or two, if necessary, just as though he had a cupboard full of them and could hand them out at a moment&#39;s notice. Knowing that a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> could not be constructed for two or three years, and certainly could not be manned by Australians at all, obviously the first thing to do was to consider the best way of rendering that immediate assistance which, if required, it was desirable should be furnished. If immediate assistance was wanted surely their proposal was not merely futile, but perfectly absurd? That it was not the proper way is shown - I do not propose to express my own opinion about it - by three quotations which I will make. The first is from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Colomb, an admiral who is just dead, but who for years in the House of Commons, took the deepest interest in the progress of the Navy and whom I heard speak at the Royal Colonial Institute, which was so infected with party spirit that they must needs take a hand in this business in England. The second quotation is from Lord Charles Beresford, and the third from the late Under Secretary of State for the Colonies in the Unionist Government. In a letter dealing with a communication signed by, I think, the Labour members of the House of Commons, and therefore a critical letter on what they had said, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Colomb wrote - </para>

            <para>It is one that we have often heard argued, and in which I myself have the most perfect sympathy. Let us suppose two millions is going to be spent on a battleship. The battleship is to be in these waters, because you would not like to have it different. Battleships by themselves are not of much use ; they have to be in fleets. Imagine there was a war, and imagine that the Dominion&#39;s battleship was in these waters, and the danger that will occur to the Dominions does occur. That is the question of trade routes. I do not think it would add to the sympathy of these Dominions if, after having paid this large sum of money, that this, I won&#39;t call it accident, this circumstance did occur to them, when the money they had invested was defending the shores of this country. I think that might provoke recriminations. The only way the Dominions can be hurt is by their trade routes being cut. </para>

Then I come to the Right Honorable Alfred Lyttelton, because later on we find that the Conservative Opposition were coming to see that this was a national question, and one not to be dealt with as a matter of party politics.

            <para>I myself am convinced the true way to get a great Imperial Navy is not in any sense to check, but, on the contrary, to foster, the national spirit in the Dominions overseas. You cannot have national existence unless you have at the same time the will and the desire to make sacrifices by maintaining national existence by arms, and I am therefore absolutely in accord with Canada and Australia, who desire to form their own Navy and their own Army, and to make that Navy and that Army an essential part of the defences of those great nations and States. I thoroughly believe in that. Speaking purely from the point of view of the Motherland, I am certain we shall derive greater assistance and greater power from the efforts made in that direction than from any idea of the States of the Empire booming merely contributory to the Mother-Power, and I believe, so far as I have been able to follow it, that is very much the view of  His  Majesty&#39;s present advisers. </para>

          <para class="block">Then we hear it said that the little flotilla of destroyers is to be characterised as a tin-pot Navy. Well, upon that, as I have said, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward made that proposal. On the 22nd March, the Fisher Government sent a cablegram which I. believe was the first response from Australia to the situation in England, and which was amplified on the 1 6th April. Quoting from memory, because I have not the cablegram at hand, it was to the effect that, in the event of stress, or the existence of a difficulty, the entire resources of this Commonwealth would be placed at the disposal of the Mother Country. That was a statesman- like response to the situation which was supposed to have arisen in England. If Australia says that whenever the Mother Country is in trouble, I am proud of her, because every one of us would desire that the whole life&#39;s blood and treasure of Australia should be at the disposal of the Mother Country. I cannot understand, except that the word <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> was used, why a cablegram of that kind should not be as reassuring to England, and as effective a warning to the hostile nations, if they may be called hostile, as the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline></para>

I have mentioned the proposal made by the Fisher Government, and opposed as I am to the Labour party, their methods, and their programme, I do not see why I should not give them credit in a matter of this sort. I really venture to think that that message best expressed the real views of the Commonwealth.. Why should we not give the Labour Government credit for sincerity in sending that message? </para>

              <para>- If it was after, then, I say, it stands out a foot. I cannot acquit <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> or others, who subsequently to the despatch of that cable by the Ministry of the day, went to the side of New Zealand and proposed the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> of doing so, not for highly national and patriotic purposes, but for party purposes. That is my view. I hope that I may be mistaken. I find that what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook said was much more sensible, although it is singular to note how he has departed from it. At some agricultural gathering, I think it was, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook said that the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> would be sent as soon as the Federal Parliament had an opportunity of speaking on the matter. It is a remarkable thing that, if that was the ground of the indictment against the then Ministry, it was not stated in the House of Representatives and made the ground of their dismissal. I say that they ought to have been challenged on that, if on nothing else. </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to discuss that. I do not belong to any of the State Parliaments, and it is for them to deal with that question. I am dealing with the national situation. I say that it is a remarkable fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> did not challenge the Fisher Government on this matter, as, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook would have done. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook was Leader of the Opposition, - and I believe that he would have taken the sense of the House of Representatives on the question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> did not attempt to challenge the Government on the point. I suppose it was because he &#34; either feared his fate too much, or hi.s deserts were small. But why did he not do it? If the action of the Fisher Government was improper, what are we to say of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dea-</inline> kin&#39;saction  in making the offer he made while Parliament was in session, without consulting Parliament ? I say that it was not the right thing for Australia to follow in the footsteps of New Zealand in this matter, lt was the duty of those in power, with the meeting of Parliament comparatively imminent, to consider the thing, as the gentleman from whom I have quoted suggested, from a business-like point of view. It was not the business of the Government, without full information, to embarrass the Imperial Government, whose difficulties, God knows, are great enough. They have to raise now some ,&#163;20,000,000 or &#163;25,000,000 in extra taxation, which the Conservative Opposition in the Imperial Parliament are opposing in the most strenuous way. Why are they to be embarrassed .by an offer like this? Why is their policy to be condemned? - a policy in which they declared that the Fleet- of England was invulnerable; that England is unassailable on the high seas ; and that the supremacy of the British Navy is as unchallengeable to-day as it was iri the days of Nelson. Another phase of the question requires consideration. Before this <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> could be built, <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> might be obsolete. They are being changed and altered every day. </para>

              <para>- What had the previous Ministry done? The Canadian Government suggested a Conference, and the Fisher Government also suggested a Conference. That was the proper thing to do. I said so in. England, and <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> say so again now. The proper thing to do is to have a Conference, and there arrange what form our assistance should take. Another thing which the Government should have considered - and in this connexion I give due weight to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> information that the banks are prepared to make a good investment - was the ways  and means to make good their offer.  Money  should be no obstacle to the Commonwealth in assisting the Mother Country. I hope it will never be assumed that the Commonwealth will allow any question of- money to stand in the way of what the Mother Country requires to maintain the Fleet, which is as much ours as hers, and which is of as much value to us as to her.. </para>

              <para>- I agree that it is a miserable pittance; but the worst feature of it is that it is paid under an agreement. I say that what we give the Mother Country for the maintenance of the Imperial Fleet should be given without any agreement at all. We do not want any hiring agreement. What we give should be given untrammelled by any restrictions or conditions. How are we to get the money to make good the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought?</inline> Surely that ought to he considered. We are going to incur a most laudable debt, supposing the offer takes the form of giving &#163;2,000,000 straight away. We must consider how the money is to be raised. Are the Free Traders going to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and the Protectionists to get it from the masses of the people through the Tariff? </para>

          <para>SenatorSir JOSIAH SYMON. - I do not know how it is proposed that the money should be raised, but, at any rate, I shall be no party - if that is what noninterference with the Protectionist principle of the Tariff means, under this basis of fusion - to extracting this money from the pockets of the consumers in this country by any further addition to that blacklist which now exists as a Tariff. </para>

              <para>- I am pleased to hear it. I am with the honorable senator. I commend very much to my honorable friends that article by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> White. I think it will have a soothing influence, especially after the statements of Lord Charles Beresford in his saner moments, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Lyttelton, But the situation now is a little different, be cause, as my honorable friends remind me, the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> pure and simple, is dropped, though the word is retained, I suppose to save some people&#39;s faces. The offer now is &#34;Or something else.&#34; That is very proper, because, &#34; of course, that brings the whole question under the consideration of the Conference, and the only thing that can be said in objection to it is that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook very properly said, Parliament should have been consulted. I wish to say, however, that, viewing the offer of the present Government&#39; even in its new form, I prefer <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline> cable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline> message was adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, in a resolution which he moved - and I thank him for that, because I wish to give every one due credit - at a meeting which he addressed in the Town Hall at Perth. </para>

It recognised that it is our duty to bear our share of the burden of Empire. It recognised that the then Government felt that Australia was prepared to do its duty, not merely up to a minimum or maximum, but to the full limit of its resources. It recognised that what is to be done should be done, not in a spasm of fear, or from party feeling, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Colomb said, on a business-like basis. It was saying: &#34;Here we are ready; what do you wish us to do? We wish to do our duty; will you tell us how?&#34; It was saying, as has been said in very eloquent lines :  - </para>

          <para class="block">It was asking them to tell us what they wanted us to do, and I do not believe anybody could have gone back on the whole of what that cablegram conveyed. . Personally, whether it be in battleships or their equivalent, I am prepared, when the matter is presented to us on a business-like basis - as I believe it will be with the assistance of the Imperial authorities - to vote for the proposal according to our means, to the enormous benefit to be derived from it, and to the absolute safety of this country, which is wrapped up in the supremacy of the British Navy. But I shall object - as I have done on all occasions - to any sort of an agreement under which we are to hire the ships, whether it be for this purpose or for that. Our local defence is quite a different thing, and upon that point the Government are merely carrying out the policy which the last &#34; Deakin Government adopted in its correspondence with the Admiralty. The papers in my possession show that they contemplated the purchase of torpedo boat destroyers, and also of some submarines. The latter, however, have evidently been dropped under expert advice. So that the difference between the proposals made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and those of the Fisher Ministry was that the former were conditional upon the cancellation of the Naval Agreement, whereas the latter were made on the understanding that that agreement was to continue. </para>

              <para>- Exactly, until 1913. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Poore and others have all recognised the advantage of these destroyers&#34;, and, whatever I may think of their smallness as a beginning, I have always advocated an Australian Navy as an auxiliary to our land defences. In addition, we have had from all quarters expressions of opinion that they would form a most valuable auxiliary to any portion of the Imperial Fleet which might be in Australian waters for the purposes of defence or attack. Then, too,. I think that we should have  Colonel Foxton&#39;s  instructions before us. Only the other day an inspired paragraph, which was very difficult to- understand, appeared in one of the newspapers. For the reason that that paragraph was obviously inspired, and particularly as  Colonel Foxton  is not a naval man, I think that we should have the actual text of his instructions before us. The Government would do well to place those instructions upon the table without awaiting any specific request in that direction. I hope that a steady resolve to do our duty to the Motherland and to the supreme Navy, will be maintained. I trust that we will not be. niggardly in considering any proposals that may be made to us. by the Imperial Government. Whatever other effects the discussion of this question may have had, it must have convinced us of our obligations, and of the fact that, however we may stand in regard to other nations - whatever perils, imminent or remote, there may be - we are determined to pour out our blood and offer our treasure in defence of the Empire of which we are citizens. So far as the position in this Senate is concerned. I shall&#39; preserve a strictly non-party attitude. I shall adopt the independent position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has stated his determination of following. I distrust <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> utterly as a politician, though I have a great regard for him personally. I distrust his politics utterly, and I do not think it is possible to have any faith in them. &#60;!I have been in opposition to him whenever he has been in office ever since the Commonwealth was inaugurated. I was elected in opposition to him and his Government, and certainly what has recently occurred has not converted me. The Ministerial proposals which may be submitted I shall deal with upon their merits. I confess, however, that I shall view them with a little suspicion as coming from rather a tainted source, and on that account I shall give them the strictest scrutiny. I shall take nothing upon trust. If the measures are good I shall support them ; if they are bad, I shall oppose them. Upon these lines, aloof from the entanglements of parties, I shall  do my best, as a senator from South Australia, in the general interests of the Commonwealth and the particular interests of my own State. </para>

              <para>- It is simply preposterous. We all know that historically England is an appanage of the Scottish Crown. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> I enjoy <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> friendship in private life. A more charming personality there is not in Australia. With regard to his political actions, all I can say is, &#34; Let bygones be bygones.&#34; We believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has very good reason to prefer the party which is now supporting him to that which formerly supported him. I ask honorable members to reflect for a moment upon the behaviour of the Labour party since they were displaced from office. Look at the way that its members have wasted time day after day, and week after week, in vilifying <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> for what he has done in days gone by. Who believes in minority rule? Yet twenty-eight members of the Labour party, with four extreme Protectionists in the other House, seem to think that they represent a majority. </para>

              <para>- All Free Traders are independent supporters. As a matter of fact, I never knew a Protectionist who did not buy his goods in the cheapest market- and sell them in the dearest. All Protectionists are most anxious to protect their own pockets. I repeat that the fiscal issue has been- sunk for the time being. Honorable senators on this side of the Chamber believe in majority rule, and we have majority rule now. I must congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> upon having induced my honorable friends opposite to attend in full force to-night. &#39; One of their number is absent in Western Australia, so that, for the first time this session, we have had the pleasure of seeing fourteen out of their full strength of fifteen present. Yet this is what they regard as patriotism. Ministerial supporters also believe in the maintenance of loyalty to Great Britain. We have not any Republicans or extreme Socialists upon our side or supporting us. We do not believe in sympathizing with outrages such as were committed at Broken Hill recently, where men actually dared to say that the presence of police was responsible for certain trouble which occurred. Any law-abiding .citizen should be glad to see police. One member of the late Government actually headed a procession at Broken Hill, and who would dare to say that the Attorney-General of that Administration ought to have conducted himself as he did? I really wonder what the world is coming to. There is such a thing as constitutional action. At Broken Hill at the present moment some are advocating the looting of shops. </para>

I said to him : &#34; Do you believe in a fine stream of European immigration to this country?&#34; He said : &#34; I want to know how it is going to affect wages.&#34; I told him then, as I have often said to others since, that the Labour party unfortunately believes in an Australia for the whites who are already here, and for no one else. Its members are afraid of wages coming down. </para>

              <para>- Interest is lower now than it used to be. The rate is reasonable enough at present.  We also stand for Federation, and not for Unification. One of the charges that will be brought against honorable senators opposite at the next election is that they are going in for Unification. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has told us that he cares for measures not men. I have always been a supporter of good measures no matter from what side of the Senate they came. It seems necessary that I should say a word for the Free Traders in this Parliament. We Free Traders have confidence in the Ministry as long as Messrs. Cook, Glynn, Fuller and Millen are in it. But irrespective of those gentlemen we believe that the other members of the Ministry will honestly carry out the agreed-upon terms of coalition. </para>

              <para>- Certainly not; but I want to &#34; down &#34; the politics of the Labour party. They lost one of their best men recently because he could not stand their methods any longer. Almost all the best men in their party leave them after a while. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> was once one of them. </para>

              <para>- I do not &#39;object to being called a member of the anti-Socialist party, although I am not unfavorable to one kind of Socialism. It is a peculiar kind, because it is voluntary. I refer to Christian Socialism. As soon as you make Socialism compulsory it is no longer Christian. My impression is that the Labour party in Australia has touched high-water mark. The election in South Australia quite lately, confirms that belief. Singularly enough some of mv Protectionist friends consider that the present Government has practically nobbled the Protectionist party in the interests of Free Trade, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> seems to be under the impression that the Protectionists have nobbled the Free Trade party. Probably neither&#39; statement is true. Both parties are maintaining their fiscal principles, but for the time being have agreed upon a common platform for the benefit of the country. We put country above party. Some of my honorable friends strike me as being something like the person referred to in Bunyan&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Pilgrim&#39;s Progress,</inline> as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Facing-both-ways.</inline> We, while supporting the Government, know where we are. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> referred to Confucius, who, he told us, said that if you allow a man to spit in your face and do not resent it, he will very likely do it again. Some time ago,&#39; however, I was reading Waterton&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Travels in South America,</inline> when I was surprised to come across an instance to the opposite effect. Waterton', with his comrades, met an uncivilized party of aboriginals in the northern part of South America. He walked up to the chief unarmed, seeing that .the man&#39;s face was kindly in expression. When, he got near, the chief forthwith spat in his face. Wa terton saw that he did it with kindly feeling, and spat back. They were good friends at once. That incident shows that such treatment as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has referred to is in some parts of the world regarded as a compliment. Every one here knows I have always, been an individualist in politics. I am still. I think that if a man has the ability which enables him to rise he has a right to what he earns. Allusion has been made to the &#34;tart shop.&#34; Whatever my faults may be, no one can truthfully say that since I have been in Parliament I have shown any desire to secure anything for myself. I do not like these continual allusions to the desire of politicians to secure billets, f take it that we are sent to Parliament to look after the interests of the country. 1 If a politician is offered office and can take it honorably, he has a right to do so, and ought not to be aspersed. I admired the members of the Labour Government in many respects. I admired much of their administration, and never spoke a word in disparagement of them personally in their private capacity. But rr,y good opinion of them has been considerably modified by their extraordinary conduct in opposition. It looks as if they would have liked to remain in office a little longer. They have none but unkind remarks to make concerning those who put them out. But those who ejected the late Ministry did so in the interests of the country, according to their own and my belief. It is not a personal matter. There is not a senator with whom I am not pleased to shake hands. I do not consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> is the <inline font-style="italic">ne plus ultra</inline> of a political leader, but&#39; under the circumstances we are quite justified in meeting him and his party on a common ground of action for the best interests of Australia, as we conceive them to be. </para>
