                    <para>That the Parliament records its high appreciation of the many and eminent services rendered to the Commonwealth by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, particularly during his tenure of the arduous office of  Speaker  from its first assembling until his decease on Friday last. Inspired by a  lofty conception of the duties of his office, he presided over the House of Representatives with conspicuous ability, firmness, and impartiality. An unsparing devotion to administrative duties was associated with a personal courtesy which endeared him to members and officers of the House. The founding of a National Library has been among the most important of his special interests. All citizens of Australia will concur in tendering their profound sympathy to the bereaved wife and- family of a most distinguished Australian, whose loss is deeply felt by the whole community. </para>

                <para class="block">I am conscious that no motion which we may adopt, no words which we may .use in supporting it, will . do more than faintly express the feeling so universally aroused by the tragic death of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder. But weak though our effort may be, it is meet that we should pay our tribute to the memory of one who rendered signal service to his State,' and whose personal attributes endeared him to all who, like ourselves, were privileged to claim his ac.quaintance. There are those present more familiar with, and, therefore, - better able than I am to speak as to the great and - loyal service rendered bv the deceased gentleman to his own State. But this we all know, that in rendering' that service he displayed a full, many-sided, and well-balanced intellect, a strenuous if quiet determination, an unfailing courage, and, above all, a simple and unaffected devotion to duty. In the- days, sir, when he stood a foremost fighter in party conflict, he always remembered his own lofty ideals, keeping them before him as shining beacons by which he directed both his political and personal conduct. In later years he rendered yeoman service as one of the framers of the Constitution, helping the Union into being, and working always as one who sought to do his duty, and who regarded the work as greater than the work-, men. Still later, when we assembled here for the first time as representatives of a united Australia, his high character and great ability indicated him as the first  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. On the occasion of his selection for that high office, he expressed, to use his own words, his " deep sense of the obligation placed upon him, and his determination to maintain the high reputation which the office of  Speaker  had borne in all parts of the Empire." With what great capacity he discharged that obligation, how closely he adhered to that determination, we in Parliament can bear testimony. The first  Speaker  called to direct and control members who had been trained under varying parliamentary conditions, his task was indeed difficult; he was called upon to explore an unknown region ; but he has left behind him a trail . blazed for the guidance and assistance of his successors. The measure of success he achieved in solving that difficulty, as well as the manner of it, added to his own reputation and conferred upon Parliament great and lasting service. Clear in vision, sound in judgment, firm, tactful, just, and courteous, he secured to the full the confidence of those over whose deliberations he presided, and amply justified the high resolve with which he assumed the duties of his office. But great as have been his public services, I think it is perhaps his personal qualities which will induce us to treasure his memory the most. A kindly, if undemonstrative, man, with a simple nature, but unfailing courage, a warm heart, and above all a lofty and serious conception of life and its duties, he had more friends than he knew of. Whether we regard him as serving his State or the Commonwealth, or in his association with educational, social, philanthropical or religious movements, we can see him always moving with earnestness and sincerity,' giving the best that was in him. Regarding him, it may be said that "though dead he yet speaketh," for his career stands as a guide, an inspiration, and an appeal to those who follow him. May I, sir, add one word concerning those whose grief is greater than our own? It is not possible for us to turn aside the shaft of a great bereavement, but we may hope that our resolution, and the respect and sympathy which will go with it, will carry some little measure of comfort to hearts which are bowed in sorrow, and to a home which is wrapped in grief. </para>

                    <para>. - As one who had known the late  Speaker  tor many years, and watched his career, not merely in politics, but in public life in many directions, I rise with sincere feelings of emotion to second the motion. I sympathize with the people of South Australia at the loss of a representative who for many years had possessed the entire confidence of the State. And I also sympathize with the lady who has lost a faithful and loving husband, and the family who have lost the protection of a good' father. When he entered Federal politics <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder rose superior to those party principles and sectional ideas which may have possessed the minds of other men.  His  whole object in life seemed to be to carry out his duties in the best interests- of the people with whom he often came in contact. I am sure that there is not a senator here to-day but feels the deepest sympathy with the family of the late  Speaker,  and the deepest regret at the loss, not only to South Australia, but to the whole Commonwealth, of a statesman such as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder was. It is, sir, with very deep and sincere regret that I second the motion. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [2.40]. - The late
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline>
                    Holder was to me a friend of many years standing. With four other honorable gentlemen who are now members of the Senate, I was his colleague in the Australian! Federal Convention which framed the instrument of Australian Union. For these reasons, and as a senator from the State in which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline>
                    Holder was born, and to which he rendered, as my honorable friends who have preceded me have indicated, devoted service, I should like to join in trying to express the honour we wish to do to his memory, the memory of a man whose name will live in the Federal story of Australia. But for these reasons I should not have said one word on this occasion, because we are all feeling deeply the grief which the sad event has occasioned to the whole of the community, and more particularly to the members of
                    <inline font-style="italic">the</inline>
                    Federal Parliament, whether in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. I should have hesitated to add one word after the excellent and eloquent words which have been spoken by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, followed by my honorable friend,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline>
                    on the other side; but there is one aspect to which I should like to call attention, and which I think ought not to be forgotten. The late
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline>
                    Holder was not born to wealth as the world reckons. Fortune did not come to him with a smiling face. He was an example of the -  ..... divinely gifted man
                </para>
                <para>Whose life in low estate began. </para>
                <para>He owed nothing to high patronage. The road which he pursued was not made smooth and easy for him. He made his own way, and carved out his own career, by the great qualities which he possessed. He made his merits known by his own capacity, and the elements of that capacity, to some of which my honorable friend the Vice-President of the Executive Council has so touchingly alluded, were known to all of us. He had industry and sagacity, and an alert intelligence beyond that which is commonly allotted to mankind. He had a clear and calm judgment. To singleness of purpose and extraordinary lucidity of expression he united a directness of mind and a simplicity of character which made him loved by everybody. No man was ever less of a partisan. No man was ever less moved by heat and clamour. He entered the South Australian Parliament is a member of the House of Assembly in the year  1887,  the year in which I ceased to be a member of that Parliament. But our acquaintanceship then began and it ripened into a friendship which I ever valued, and into a confidence which, in common with every one else who met him, I continually reposed in him. He inspired confidence, and he returned the confidence felt in him bv giving the best of his counsel and advice. After a career of public service in South Australia, which is regarded as one of the precious possessions of that State, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder in  1897  entered the National Federal Convention. Honorable senators who were members of that Convention, and some of whom are here to-day, will bear me out when I say that he rendered conspicuous service there, and to his efforts in several directions the success of the work of that Convention was largely due. I can never forget the strong and steadfast position which he assumed in  1899  in the cause of Democracy in maintaining our right to the unamended Constitution. It was a great fight, and for him it involved a great strain. But the call of duty to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has alluded was sufficient to stimulate and strengthen him in that arduous contest. In  1901  he entered the Federal Parliament and became the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. It is impossible to add to what has been already said of the universal admiration which all inside and outside of Parliament felt for the noble, the impartial, and the absolute high quality of the manner in which he discharged his duties. It will be a pattern to his successors, I verily believe, for many years to come. My honorable friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, also referred with great emphasis to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder's devotion to duty. On that point I should like to say that duty is a path that all may tread, and at all times <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder trod that path with a firm and unfaltering step.  His  even footstep could be heard right up to the tragic moment when the lamp of his life went out - until God's finger touched him and he slept. As for him " after life's fitful fever, he sleeps well ; " as for us his life remains a great pattern and a great example. He died not full of years, but full of the esteem, and the honour of all men. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to say one or two words before putting the motion to the Senate. I wish to express my deep feeling of regret at the death of ourlatefriend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder. During the last few years I had the opportunity of coming into intimate association with him, and I knew his character to be such as has been depicted here to-day and elsewhere by other persons. He was of upright, fearless, conscientious character ; a man whom it was an honour to have as a member of the Federal Parliament of Australia.  His  work was not confined solely to his labours in the House of Representatives during the past eight years, hut extended throughout the Commonwealth, to every phase of life in which he took an interest. As a personal friend, I learned that he was a man not only to be esteemed and respected, but to be loved ; a man upon  whose word one could at all times rely, and upon whose friendship on all occasions of difficulty one might confidently depend. That such a man should pass away from us under the sad circumstances of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder's death is a great loss. Whether we speak as members of this Parliament, or as personal friends of the deceased gentleman, we may well exclaim - </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, without notice, whether it is a fact, as stated in the newspapers to-day, that 470 pensioners in Queensland have been deprived of their pensions pending the passing of the Old-age Pensions Bill? If so, will the Government provide for the passing of a Bill for the payment of back pensions to those persons? </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware as to the exact number, but a number of pensioners in Queensland are in the position indicated bv the honorable senator. But the Old-age Pensions Act Amendment Bill, now with the other branch of the Legislature, is retrospective to that extent, and provides for the payment of the back pensions referred to. </para>

It has been stated to me by a sugar manufacturer that he was not able to sell his product on the market if he took a very much lower price than that which the <inline font-style="italic">monopoly</inline> was able to get for its product. The monopoly practically governs the whole Australian market in that respect. This gentleman, with others, has now been bought out by the monopoly. </para>

                            <para>- That is the property of one of the banking institutions, which has had advanced to it about half a million pounds. But the Millaquin Refinery has had to follow in the footsteps of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and has- no say in regulating the sugar market of Australia. A friend of mine, some time ago, was running a fairly large business, and handling a considerable amount of sugar. He was dealing with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, through one of its agents. He said, " I am prepared to give you an order for so many tons of sugar." But 'the company replied, "No; we do not- do business in that way. We shall not allow you to speculate in our product. Your business enables you to dispose of so many tons of sugar per month, and that is all you are going to get, whether you like it or not. We know exactly what your trade is, and we will supply you merely with what '-ou require for carrying on your business." </para>

                            <para>- How much? Very little sugar that is brought from outside is sold in Australia. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is able to control our sugar market. I pointed out last week that the Queensland growers had passed a resolution asking the Federal Government to take steps in the direction of establishing a refinery, so that they might be able to get out of the clutches of this monopoly. I will quote the comment of one of the Brisbane daily newspapers upon the resolution. </para>

                    <para>It is somewhat novel in these blatant days of outcries against capitalists and employers of labour, that an effort should be made by these very employers to shift their responsibilities and obligations on to a central authority. The nationalization of industries may be a good thing in theory from the socialistic point of view,' but the willing manner in which men who have sunk their capital in the profitable production of sugar-cane are inclined to hand everything over to the Commonwealth Government shows that there are two sides to the question. In taking over a proposition of this magnitude there is the possible loss as well as the possible profit to be considered. The debit side of the balance-sheet is conveniently ignored by a certain unthinking section of the community. If the sugar-growers are not satisfied with the treatment received from the mill-owners and refineries, let them co-operate and erect mills and refineries for themselves. If  they  are sincere in the opinion that the State should control the manufacture and refining of sugar, then they should have shown their sincerity by proclaiming themselves Socialists, and "demanding the Government to take control of not only one  industry,  but all industries. Co-operation for a specific purpose is a doctrine preached by the energetic ; Socialism is preached by the " failure " and the sluggard. It is a pity that this fact was not recognised by the sugar-growers of Bundaberg yesterday. </para>

                    <para>One can almost imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rockefeller</inline> and his Standard Oil Trust with its profits of over ^12,000,000 annually, asking the American people a similar question such as " If you don't like our doings, why don't you go into business yourselves?" and the answer would be the same in both cases. There is one important difference, however, between the two situations, and that is that while many of the American Trusts and monopolies have not only got beyond the reach of private competition, but have almost beaten the Government itself, those of Australia, including the sugar monopoly, are still within reach of Government control, and the sooner the matter is taken in hand the better it will be, not only for cane-growers, but for the community generally. As for the parrot cry of " Socialism," it is simply a piece of inconsistent absurdity, because if a central refinery is to be condemned as socialistic, the Queensland Central mill system must be socialistic too, and condemned accordingly. Few, however, would dare to say that (with one or two badly-situated exceptions) these mills have been anything but a pronounced success. They give to the grower all there is in his business so far as raw sugar values are concerned, and the refinery would carry the matter to its logical conclusion by giving him all there is in his business, right up to refined sugar values. If this is " Socialism " then there is nothing in a name, and it would be at least interesting if those who are so ready to condemn, would explain how it could in any way repress the individual enterprise or energy of the cane-grower, seeing that on him, as on most people, the hope of a higher reward should certainly not have that effect, but be decidedly stimulating. It also displays either lamentable ignorance or libellous animosity, to use the terms " failure " and " sluggard " in connexion with Australia's cane-growers, and if the glib critic who did so, had first taken the trouble to inquire into the standing of the delegates responsible for the passage of the resolution, he would have discovered that such expressions were entirely inapplicable to any of them, or to the people who sent them to the Bundaberg Conference. </para>
                    <para>Although the monopoly controls the whole of this work, and is able to say to all the other sugar growers in Australia, and practically to the other refiners, that they will be able, perhaps, to get rid of their sugar at its price, yet it seems to me that under this legislation the Government will not be able to intervene. I feel quite satisfied that so far as this Bill is concerned, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company will beat the Government nearly every time. I believe that it is acting in the interests of its shareholders. But the cane growers think that they are placed at a very great disadvantage. They have published some tables in which they set out the value of their cane so far as it can be ascertained, and the amount received for it from the company. For instance, when sugar is  £19  a ton, the amount offered by the company for a ton of cane is 15s. 6d., and I might add that only tons of cane are required to make a ton of sugar. The actual value of the sugar contents of the ton of cane is ^3 os. od. if all is extracted, <inline font-style="italic">£2.</inline> 14s. 8d. if 90 per cent, is extracted, and <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 8s. 7d. if only 80 per cent, is extracted. The cane-grower realizes that in spite of everything which has been done on his behalf by the Government, so far as the work is. concerned, the monopoly is able to step in and take for itself an enormous portion of the value he produces every year. He contends that if it is fair for this Parliament to have a voice in fixing the wages which he has to pay j it is also fair for the Government to say that the monopoly shall npt be allowed to take a very large portion of the value which he produces. </para>

                            <para>- No, I only wish that I could. As a matter of fact, I am not in a position to do so. The first conference of the Sugar Cane Growers' Union of Australia was held on Thursday and Friday,  18th  and  19th  February,  1909.  These men, I may explain, were practically forced out of the other organization by the bigger men, who wanted to control the whole of the industry. They found that they must do something to protect their own interests, and, therefore, they formed an organization which embraced a very large number of the smaller men engaged in growing sugar cane. On the second day of the conference they passed the resolution which I read last week to the effect that the Government be called upon to take some step in connexion with the establishment of a refinery.  I quote the following extract from the report : - </para>

                            <para>- It has not done so yet. I know cases where the company has been paying, with a bonus, up  10 17s.  and  17s.  6d., when the men who supplied the central mills received with a bonus added over £1 a ton. The company buys that raw sugar afterwards. The Millaquin people do not take a great deal of that sugar ; they mostly get sugar which is made in their own district, at the back of Bundaberg, the Isis, and other districts. I do not think that from a business stand-point any one could find fault with the system of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It pays to good men very good wages for their services. But the business is organized in such a way that it knows exactly the requirements of every man who deals with them. It knows the quantity of sugar which he is able to handle, and it supplies him with that quantity and no more until he is able to prove that his business has grown and needs a larger supply. I do not think that the Bill or the method proposed by the Government will touch that sort of business. It seems to me that although we may render to the Government every assistance to make this legislation as strong as possible it will be ineffective. The Minister of Trade and Customs, in introducing the Bill, said that if, when passed, it were found to be ineffective, the case of those who advocate the nationalization of industries would be far stronger than it is now. But, during the time all this experience is being gained, we shall be doing nothing to relieve those who are, at present, suffering from the effects of monopolies such as I have outlined. I have no wish to labour the question. I point out that, so far as I can see, perhaps the biggest monopoly so far in existence in Australia, which is able to control one branch of industry so effectively that no one dealing in the same commodity has a show, will not bc touched by this legislation. We on this side will do all we can to make this legislation effective, but I am afraid that the Government will not be prepared to go far enough to render any practical service to those who are suffering from the monopoly to which I have referred, and from other monopolies at present existing in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator need not talk like that. The vessel to which I have referred is not engaged in the trade between Wyndham and Port Darwin from philanthropic motives, but from motives of profit. There is no reason why we should not safeguard the interests of the shipper at the places I have mentioned, just as we do those of the shippers at Melbourne and Sydney. Why should this qualification be inserted? If it be a good thing for shippers to be able to make these agreements, why insert the words "which are the subject of competition" ? Seeing that they constitute a limitation, I think that they should be eliminated, and, unless some satisfactory explanation* for their retention is forthcoming, I shall move in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- The insertion of the words referred to is very ill-advised. They not only constitute a limitation of the clause, but absolutely weaken it.  The principal Act is entitled "An Act for the Preservation of Australian Industries, and for the repression of Destructive Monopolies." In our endeavours to amend it, and to make it stronger, it is now proposed to insert words which will affect " goods or services which are the subject of competition. " Now, if there are two words which are absolutely contradictory, those words are "monopoly" and "competition." To that extent their use is extremely ill-advised. We are not now attempting to deal with the repression of industries which are the subject of competition, but with industries in which there is no competition - in short, in which monopolies exist. Consequently, to prescribe certain penalties, as in the cases of persons who <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> something in respect of "goods or services which are the subject of competition," is to travel outside the professed intention of the Act. It is not in industries in which competition exists that we desire to prescribe remedies, but in industries in which there is no competition. It has been, said that the case cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is unworthy of our attention, because there is only one vessel engaged in the trade between Wyndham and Port Darwin. </para>

                            <para>- That is precisely the point I desire to make. Let us take the case which has been cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> We can easily conceive of a company carrying on trade in certain waters of the Commonwealth, which, by reason of  having granted rebates in a wholesale fashion, has acquired a monopoly in that trade. We shall not improve that state of affairs by the insertion of these restrictive words, or by saying, in effect, " Because we find that you are carrying on services which are not subject to competition, we intend to let you severely alone." As a matter of fact, it is only in cases where companies or individuals are carrying on services in which competition has been killed that we desire to interfere. When I look into the meaning of the words to which attention has been directed, I am astonished that such a qualification should have been introduced, because they are so absolutely contradictory of its whole purpose. I do not object to the use of the words " goods or services." The word "services" is a very comprehensive and safe one, from the draftsman's stand-point. In the interests of the Bill, I am quite prepared to move the elimination of the  words "which are the subject of competition." If they are omitted, what harm will result? </para>

If we are going to amend that Act, for the purpose of repressing monopolies, we must take care that we do not allow any monopoly - destructive or otherwise - to escape from the operation of the law. But that is exactly the result which will be brought about if this proposed new section be passed in its present form. .If the Minister of Trade and Customs does not move for the omission of the objectionable words to which I have referred, I shall certainly do so. </para>

                        mentioned this matter, I have had an opportunity of discussing with the draftsman the meaning which he meant to attach to the words of which complaint has been made. I understand that his main object was that which I have already suggested. The words refer to goods which are recognised as the subject of competition - goods in connexion with which rebates are chiefly -granted. The draftsman used them for the purpose of more clearly identifying the provision with trade and commerce. From what I learn, it appears that they are capable of a wider meaning than was at first anticipated, and after consultation with him, I think that the provision will be made more comprehensive and effective by their omission. It is probable, as my honorable friends have pointed out, that where a monopoly exists the objection would be taken that the industry was not subjected to competition, and thus the very cases which we desire to assail we might be precluded from touching, if we retained these words. Upon further consideration, I think that the clause will be rather strengthened than otherwise by their omission. I move -

                        (South Australia) [4.57J. - I am rather afraid that the Minister of Trade and Customs has absolutely forgotten the title of the Bill. The whole tenor of his speech upon the motion for the second reading of this measure was that it was directed against the shipping rings of Great Britain. The point which I desire to make is that if the Bill be passed in the form which he suggests, we shall absolutely destroy, instead of preserve, one of the biggest industries in Australia. From where does the competition come to which the Australian ship-owner is subjected? It comes from the French, German, and cheap 'Chinese and coolie manned vessels trading on our coast. If the Minister, after considering this matter, had inserted the words " subject to foreign competition," I could have understood his action. But the moment this Bill is placed upon our statute-book, the Australian Mercantile Marine will become a thing of the past. At the present time our coastal trade is, to a large extent, in the hands of Australian companies. The Parliaments of Australia have done nothing to protect those companies. The latter have had to protect themselves. How have they done this? By looking after the trade. Now it is proposed to say to them, " The way in which you hitherto have protected yourselves is absolutely illegal."

In fact, the whole proposal is absolutely destructive.

                        <para>. - There are times when a Minister is apt lo give way too easily and without due consideration. I venture to say that the Minister of Trade and Customs has done so in this case. The proposed! new section under consideration is designed for a specific purpose, namely, to provide against unfair competition. It is intended to prevent a competitor from offering some secret advantage or concession to his client. I can quite understand that if we leave out the words in question, in cases such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has instanced there will probably be injustice. Take the case of a steamer trading between two ports, one being a mining port on the west coast of Tasmania. The inhabitants of the latter port may desire a ship to come there for the purposes of trade. But on account of the dangers and difficulties a steam-ship owner may not be willing to go to the port unless he receives promises of continuous support. Accordingly he makes arrangements to that effect. </para>

Or the ship-owner may give the merchant a discount of 10 per cent, or 20 per cent. That would be a rebate, and the large customer would be likely to become an offender, and liable to a penalty of ^500.

                        SYMON (South Australia) [5.5]. - I think that my views upon this disjointed system of legislation are pretty well known. I have resisted the whole system every time an instalment of it has come before the Senate. I have endeavoured if it wo* inevitable that some legislation should be passed, to improve what was submitted to us as much as possible. Unfortunately, the views of some of my honorable friends appear to have undergone a change in this respect. But it does seem to me that the argument which has been addressed to the Committee illustrates the absolute importance of reducing this system of legislation in relation to industrial trusts to something like a harmonious whole, instead of being, as it is now, a " thing of shreds and patches." I think that it is an entire discredit to our statute-book. That has been my opinion throughout, and it is my opinion now. Instead of the Government bringing down another shred or another patch to the system, it ought to have taken the whole of our legislation on the subject, into consideration, and submitted a homogeneous proposal that would have given us a fair prospect of carrying out the object which we all have in view. Because, however much we may differ, we who used to sit on the Opposition side of the Chamber were agreed that it was desirable that mischievous trusts, monopolies, and combines should be ended, lt was equally the- view of my honorable friends who now occupy the Opposition benches that things of the kind which are detrimental to the trade of this country, and to the consumers, should be put a stop to. The remedy of my honorable friends was nationalization ; and I am bound to say that the ineffectual efforts which have been made by the past Deakin Government and the present Deakin Government are tending to lead people to consider whether there is not a good deal in favour of the proposition for nationalization in matters of this kind. ' I have not come to that conclusion myself, but I warn my honorable friends that this patchwork system is going a long way to disgust people, who want to put a stop to the present scandalous state of things, with the methods which we have adopted, and may induce them to cast their minds further afield for other remedies.

                            <para>- I never met a monopolist who did not say that he was a benefactor of his species. Every tyrant says the same thing. When I come to my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> I am still more puzzled. I confess that, using the small amount of intelligence with which I have been endowed, I really cannot make out what this proposed new section is for. If it is for the purpose of preventing monopolies. - which already have an enormous power by virtue of being monopolies - from increasing that power by giving rebates, and so forth, then it is abundantly clear that the words which have been objected to ought to be struck out. </para>

He looks at the matter from one point of view, but he overlooks another point of view - as he may well do if he does not see it. I will not say, concerning my honorable friend, that there are " none so blind as those who will not see." What my honorable friend is striving for is a very legitimate thing. Suppose there is an individual who is in competition with somebody else in the same trade. It is desired to prevent him from giving rebates, and, by means of them, securing the trade of his customers for a certain period, and preventing it going somewhere else. My honorable friend desires that every individual engaged in a particular business shall be precluded from the giving of rebates which may have the effect of injuring the business of another person. </para>

                            <para>- I should think so. If these words be left out, what harm can be done to any one? The provision is made effective as regards monopolies. It is also made effective as regards any individual trader or company who, by means of a rebate, is doing something which is prejudicial to another person's business in the same trade. But if we are going to stop rebates, we ought to stop them thoroughly and altogether. </para>

                            <para>- Just so, but what is the good of keeping in the words "subject to competition?" That will' not do any good. The honorable senator wants a different kind of exemption. He has laid his finger on one of the defects of this kind of legislation, as he did before. I remember very well when he addressed the Senate exhaustively and to our great instruction, on the Bill of  1906,  and again on the Bill of  1907,  when he pointed out that these measures were simply in the nature of a prohibitive Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- Quite right. My honorable friend's object will not be helped by retaining these words. The proper course is to recast the provision, or put in some exception in the direction of giving protection to the particular class of goods he refers to. At any rate, if this is to be a Bill to prohibit rebates that might work mischievously, it ought to be general, applying to everybody and everything. Certainly if it is restricted to goods which are the subject of competition, it will exempt a monopoly, like the shipping monopoly, which already exists, because it will be able to say that there was no competition and that therefore the provisions of this proposed new section could not apply. </para>

                        <para>. - I am glad to see that the Minister is amenable to reason. I think that the time has arrived when we should be extremely careful in dealing with any legislation of this kind. On two or three occasions our legislation has been declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> by the High Court. It is only a week or two since it decided that certain portions of the principal Act were invalid. Again, we are asked to pass a measure of this kind, but in almost its first important provision we are able to pick holes. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Pearce called attention to the effect of the words ''which are the subject of compete tion" the Minister really did not know where he was. He had to consult with the draftsman, and then agree to move their deletion. Whatever good this provision may contain - and I do not think that it contains much good - would be destroyed by the retention of the words. In my opinion they would give rise to almost endless litigation. Certain persons have already been put to large expenditure in testing the validity of our legislation in this direction, and the retention of these words would,, in my opinion, bring about another series of legal worries. If the words are retained the trouble will be to prove where competition comes in, and whether it is fair or unfair. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> gave a very apt illustration when he cited the Wyndham case. Whether rebates are given on a small or large scale it is a very nefarious practice, and ought to be suppressed with a very strong hand. This part of the Bill is headed "Repression of Monoplies," but if we retain these words we will certainly encourage the existence of monopolies, not only in the shipping trade, but in other directions. T hope that the High Court will not be afforded another opportunity to declare that any provision we enact is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that, this provision ought to be recast. I should like the Minister to state how he defines the word "services." The discussion has been confined more particularly to shipping, but the word " services " will, I think, extend to banks. It is well known that the banks are accustomed to impose many restrictions ; for instance, to require that customers shall deal with them only, and do this, that, and the other thing. The banks, of course, will not' have a regular rate for everybody, but certain concessions will be given to certain customers. Is the Minister prepared to deal with the banks? If he is not, we certainly ought not to pass the proposed new section as it stands. I should like very much to see the Bill thrown out, because I do not think that it would be of any use except to give pinpricks and cause persons to say that useless legislation is passed. In my. opinion this provision will certainly include the banks. </para>

                        <para>. - Like the last  speaker,  I think it does not matter a great deal whether the words referred to are retained or deleted. I desire to give the longest possible tether to those who believe in this kind of legislation, in order to satisfy them that it is not worth' the paper it is written on. I do not wish to give them an opportunity to say by-and-by that their measure was restricted in its passage through Parliament, and consequently their purpose could not be given effect. So far as things subject to competition are concerned, this ' provision is directed at the present shipping ring, but I do not think that it would have the slightest effect in that direction, because, as a matter of fact, the shipping trade at present is not the subject of competition. The coasting trade is practically in the hands of a big shipping federation. When the Ocean Shipping Commission was inquiring a few years ago into the conditions of the Australian trade, there were a few little companies outside the big shipping ring which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> will remember was then referred to by merchants as an octopus. Since that time, the largest of the small companies has been taken into the ring, and to-day 'the coasting trade is practically in the hands of the ring. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite true. In Western Australia, some time ago, I think there was one ship-owner, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bateman,</inline> of Fremantle, who was crushed out of the coasting trade of his own State by the big shipping ring with this system of rebates. Every one must realize that a small ship-owner cannot give rebates and compete with large companies. If a man's trade does not extend beyond two ports, the rebates count for nothing. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The InterState trade may count a great deal to the trader. If we allowed these words to stand, and a case were taken to the High Court, probably it would decide that the coasting trade was not subject to competition, and that therefore the provision did not apply. Looking at the matter from that point of view, it is clear that if these words are allowed to remain, the Bill will be foredoomed to failure. If we intend to try the effect of anti-trust legislation, we should pass it in its most drastic form. We should then probably find out, what honorable senators opposite have so far failed to discover, that such legislation is not worth the paper on which it is printed. We know that in the case referred to, there has been no competition for a long time, and that there will be none, even if this Bill is passed. The ring will continue to control the whole of the trade, and we cannot prevent them. We can legislate against the payment of rebates; but they can continue to pay secret rebates, and we shall be unable to get at them. This has already been proved by the experience of America. In the United States, they have had a much, longer experience of the operation of the rebate system, in a more aggravated form than it has yet assumed in Australia; and their legislation, which has been in force much longer than ours, has been found to lie totally inadequate to remedy the evil. I have very little hope that this Bill will be of much use. </para>

                        BEST (Victoria - Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.34]- - I understand the position taken up by my honorable friends opposite, and I have no right to complain of it. Our contention is that there are certain trusts and monopolies which are regarded a? a menace to the community. They constitute evils and sores on the body politic, that we should endeavour to remedy. The design and object of this legislation is to deal with the system which has to so great an extent created these evils. Unless, following upon well-defined lines, we can by legislation of this kind control trusts and monopolies, we can understand the contention of our honorable friends on the other side, that nationalization is the only remedy for the evils complained of. I ask honorable senators to say whether they are prepared to admit that they are unable to control monopolies that are evil. I do not contend that all monopolies are evil. According to the terms qf the Bill, we propose to deal only with those whose operations are detrimental to the public. I appeal to my honorable friends to say whether they recognise an evil and , will make no effort in the interests of the public to control it. It must be borne in mind that we are not here proposing to introduce any new principle. The principle is already embodied in the original Act. In that Act we have legislated against any person entering into a contract in relation to trade or commerce, with the intention to destroy or injure, by means of unfair competition, any Australian industry ; and we have provided that the competition shall be deemed to be unfair unless the contrary is proved -

                            <para>- Of course ; he is a recognised necessity. As I understand the matter, certain shipping firms have agreed to form a conference or ring. They have determined exactly what freight sHall be paid, and have arbitrarily fixed the terms on which they shall trade. The evils associated with this particular monopoly have already been set out in classic and graphic language by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and some of our honorable friends on the other side in a report submit'.pd to Parliament. The members of the shipping ring say to the shipper, " We shall compel you to ship with us on our own terms. If you are a good boy at the end of twelve months, we shall be at liberty, if we are so disposed and inclined, to return to you a certain sum of money. But if, in the meantime, you attempt to deal with anybody else, or should be in any way a party to or privy to dealing with any one else, these refunds will go into our own pockets, and you shall not get a penny of them." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> charged the Government with endeavouring to crush the industry. We are endeavouring to do nothing of the kind. We wish to protect the public by preventing the creation of conferences or rings, such as those which have in other places worked most disastrously to the interests of the public. I have already pointed out that the shipping .ring in South Africa set State against State, and brought the Governments of the various States largely under their control. This is the kind of thing we are trying to control by this legislation. I urge that at this particular juncture, when these monopolies are merely budding in Australia, it is our duty to exercise control ; as the stronger they grow, the more difficult they will be to deal with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> misconceives the object of this provision. I am personally of  the opinion that the cases referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and one or two other honorable senators could be dealt with under this proposed new section, whether the words objected to are retained or not. </para>

Such a case would not be touched by the Bill. That would be a perfectly legitimate contract for the ship-owner to undertake. </para>

                                suggests that this provision would interfere with the practice of banks, and affect interest on overdrafts and exchanges. The- honorable senator has made that allegation under a misconception. It would not interfere in the case of such dealings between a bank and its customers, because they would not involve a condition of exclusive dealing, or the fixing of a definite schedule of rates.

But in the ordinary course of dealing I am not aware of any transactions of theirs which, would come within this provision. I would further urge that this proposed section has been introduced in pursuance of the terms of the principal Act and on the recommendation of that group of the Navigation Commission which included <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and which, after pointing out the arbitrary conduct of monopolies, and particularly of the shipping monopoly, said - </para>

                        <para>Upon the point that the limitation of the coastal trade to vessels complying with Australian conditions would result in a monopoly, a considerable amount of evidence was received. lt was freely stated that a combine does already exist, by which the rates for passengers and cargo carried by the companies in the Steam-ship Owners' Federation are regulated. Its extent may be gauged from the fact that out of about 188,000 tons engaged in Inter-State traffic, less than 10,000 are outside the ring. It would appear that the combine has been in operation for a long time, and complaints of a very strong and emphatic character were received as to its methods. </para>

                    <para>I do not desire to detain the Committee by reading those complaints, but honorable senators will see that in the clearest possible manner we are seeking to put an end to a system which is an acknowledged evil. If my honorable friends admit - as they have done - that an evil exists, surely it is not unreasonable to suggest, as we do by this clause, that that evil should be rectified in a simpler and more direct way than we have previously attempted. I commend the proposed new section to the favorable consideration of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not wish to vote for this provision without thoroughly understanding it, and I confess that I have not yet grasped its full meaning. It appears to me to be very drastic. So far, the discussion has centred around the word " services," which is a very comprehensive term, and one that is not confined merely to shipping. I regret that I have not yet heard anything in regard to its bearing upon the question of goods. I am not sure that it would not prevent a manufacturer from appointing a person as sole agent for his goods-- </para>

                        <para>. - If I were a manufacturer of blankets, and - knowing that the demands of a certain individual would be about  500  pairs during the season - I said to him : "If you will purchase  500  pairs qf blankets from me during the year " - which would mean that he would purchase from me exclusively - " I' will make you a certain concession," would that constitute unfair competition? A case which readily occurs to my mind in this connexion has reference to the east coast of Tasmania. Some time ago, Captain Hall, who then owned a steamer, visited various farmers in that portion of the State, and offered to make terms with them to provide a weekly steamer service. He did not attempt to bind all of them, or to grant similar terms to all. Instead, he went to the bigger farmers, and said : " If you will guarantee me your trade for twelve months, I will Carry your produce at a certain price," which was not his ordinary price. It seems 'to me that this provision is designed to prevent such an arrangement being entered into. Further, the fact appears to have been overlooked that it will follow a section in the principal Act which deals specifically with monopolies. Personally, I believe that the whole Bill is mischievous. Indeed, that has been my opinion of it from first to last. </para>

                            <para>- Since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has been a member of this Chamber, he has been identified with almost every party. As he has chosen to give a concrete instance, and as the Committee seems to have been converted into a sort of political kindergarten, [ propose to cite another. Take the case of the timber trade in Western Australia. In that State, there is a very large co-operative concern, which is controlled and managed entirely by working men. It is one of the most successful institutions of the kind in Australia. If that institution were to enter into a contract with some person or company under which it undertook to supply that person or company with the whole of its output in railway sleepers, would its operations come within the scope of this provision? </para>

I hope that the same principle will, in time, be applied all round. The middleman should be wiped out. He is one of those costly agents in modern production that our trust's have shown us how to dispense with.

                            <para>- If I had time to wade through the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> speeches on the Tariff, I could find instances where he has made such statements. In fact, it is a well-known principle, as advocated by Free Traders in the past. The political economist who first pointed out the fallacy, in answer to the arguments of Cobden and Bright, was Karl Marx, and every development in trade demonstrates more clearly as years roll on that he was right. Neither Free Trade nor Protection will prevent the growth of trusts. Free Traders may say that competition is the life of trade, but capitalists know it is the death of profits, and prevent competition wherever they can. I recognise that competition is often injurious. I am not a supporter of cutthroat competition. I know what it leads to, both in the case of the workman and the owner of capital, in any industry to which it is applied. But there is no competition on the Australian coast at the present time. The whole business is a huge monopoly in the hands of a few who have crushed out the small ship-owner. But it is absurd to suppose that freedom of competition would lead to the cessation of such monopolies. In Great Britain there are a number of railway companies, apparently in competition with each other; but in reality it is not so, because there are arrangements with regard to freight. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, and that is the reason why heavy freights have to be charged. Great cost is incurred in paying touts to get business for the companies. I hope we shall be able to take to heart the lessons taught by legislation of this character. If we do, we shall not trouble very much, about making an alteration in this provision as it stands. T repeat, however, that there is no competition in the Australian shipping industry, and if' the provision went before the High Court, I feel sure that the Court would hold that it would not apply to shipping because of the absence -e "f competition. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to support the amendment, but I have risen to ask the Minister whether he will be good enough to interpret the reference he made in his last vehement speech, when he asked the Committee whether, recognising the evil, we were not prepared to do something to abate it ? I do not know to whom the honorable senator referred, but certainly his remarks had no reference whatever to me and to the party to which I belong. </para>

But, at the same time, I feel that our efforts are vain, and that we shall not by these means accomplish the end which, seemingly, we have in view. We desire to prevent trusts, which are injurious, from carrying on their practices to the injury of the people of this country. I am in harmony with the Government in that matter. For that reason I. shall support the omission of the words referred to, believing that by such means we shall prevent a good deal of misunderstanding. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> I presume, thinks that the words should remain, and that unless they do the great shipping industry of Australia will be at the mercy of something which is foreign to our present condition of things. I do not know what it is, but I do know that, prior to the formation of the shipping ring, a good many of the Australian shipping companies did very well indeed for a considerable time. I admit that there came a time when the shipping industry here was in a very bad way, not from lack of trade, but from the desire of some companies to cut out others. Then they had no competition to face ; and to-day they are in a similar position. </para>

                            <para>- Throughout my experience, the local ship-owners have enjoyed - to a very large extent - the trade of Australia. They now have all the trade, and no competition to fear. The only competition which ever injured the shipping trade of Australia was that which took place between the local companies ; but, of course, that has been removed by the " honorable understanding " to which they came. The Government are now seeking, to prevent the " honorable understanding " from injuriously affecting the general public. I am prepared to go every foot of the way which the Government are prepared to go. At the same time, I think that any legislation of this description which may be passed, will not achieve the end to which they seem to be driving. </para>

                            <para>- I am reminding the Minister that in their report the Navigation Commission laid down as a first principle that the coasting trade should be reserved to Australian ships. That is a principle with which, I think, every one agrees; but, so far, Parliament has given no effect to it. For his own protection, the ship-owner wants to keep out the foreign trader. It may be urged here that there is no danger of foreign shipping coming into the Australian trade; but when [ mention that last week no less than two outside ships took freights from Newcastle in competition with our own ships, honorable senators will see that there is some competition in that direction to be feared. It is not a question of the number of ships which come in, but a question of ships being put on the -berth and disturbing the freights. We all know that if the earnings of ship-owners are reduced, the wages of their men will be reduced. The intent of the Government in bringing down this legislation in the first instance was good ; and that was to preserve Australian industries. Why was the first Bill on the subject introduced ? It was brought in to preserve the local manufacturers of harvesters. But what is the position to-day regarding that industry ? We do not know where we are. As a sort of excuse for the attempt to protect the manufacturers of harvesters, the first Bill embraced the repression of monopolies. Now, what monopolies were intended to be repressed when we passed that measure ? Undoubtedly, it was brought in, first to encourage local industry, and" secondly to repress the foreigner who was-- competing with local industry. Surely every one can recognise that those were the two main objects in view. In proposing that legislation, the Government were trying to shut out foreign competition. The words proposed to be deleted from this provision are " which are the subject of competition.'"' In Victoria; we find a hat industry which is subject to no competition, .and which deals exclusively with one wholesale warehouse. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> reference to the hat industry requires ventilation. The people of Australia have consented to very high duties being imposed on hats, in the hope that the local production of them would be encouraged; but the result has been that the various hat factories refuse to sell except through what is commonly  known  in Melbourne as " the Lane." Hats which are sold to "the Lane" at about  4s.  6d. each, cost the wearer  10s.  6d., and the sum of  6s.  is divided in profit between the retailer and the wholesale man. By this means, the establishment of the industry in Australia is very materially retarded. But for the fact that two profits have to be made - one of them seems to me to be wholly unnecessary - it might be possible either to  sell  the same quality of hats as now produced, or to produce  a  better quality at a greatly reduced price to  the  wearer. </para>

When I remember how bitterly a number of honorable senators, who are now supporting this legislation, opposed it in the past, I am tempted to think that it will be a mere matter of form to place this measure on the statute-book. The Government, even if they were willing, would not be allowed to put the measure into force. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to ask the Minister's view on an actual case, and he will therefore admit that I am putting a practical question. I have personal knowledge of an instance where persons engaged . in a particular trade asked that a boat should be put on to enable them to carry on their business. The ship-owner appealed to agreed to put on' a boat, but only on certain conditions, without which he claimed it would not pay. He asked for a specific undertaking that the shippers would pay freight at a specific rate on a certain tonnage, and that other conditions should also be complied with. Assuming that a boat is put on in such a case, and that after a certain length of time, when it is shown that the business is a prosperous one, another ship-owner expresses a willingness to put on a boat as well. The shippers say they will be very pleased to avail themselves of the extra boat on the same conditions as are asked bv the first ship-owner. The second ship-owner might contend that, since the business had become prosperous, those conditions were unfair, and he might claim that the first ship-owner was carrying on a monopoly, and had had the advantage of the monopoly for a number of years. I wish to know whether such an arrangement would come under the provisions of this Bill? </para>

                        to understand that the case he has quoted is that of a contract between certain individuals for transport at a particular rate, the shippers undertaking to ship their goods for a given time at that rate. Such an arrangement would not be affected by this Bill. First of all, there is no question of a rebate or concession involved ; and secondly, no consideration or condition as to exclusive dealing, and these are elements which must be present to constitute an offence under this proposed new section.

                        <para>. - I am not anxious to throw cold water on the efforts of the Government, but I wish to ask them to accept one or two amendments. I wish to have the words " or receives from " inserted after the word " to " in line  8,  and the word " unfair " after the word " any " in line  8,  so that this portion of the proposed new section would read - gives,  offers, or promises to or receives from any other person any unfair rebate, refund -  and so on. As the word " unfair " may have a different signification to some people to that which it has to those who desire to have the amendment made, I may say that I propose, at the end of the provision, the insertion of an explanation of what the word shall mean in this Bill. I intend to move the insertion at the end of the proposed section of the words -  " Unfair " in this section means unfair in the circumstances and to the detriment of the general public. </para>

                    <para class="block">Surely it will be admitted that there are cases in which the payment of rebates would not be detrimental to the general public, and would not, therefore, be unfair. This Bill is regarded in the commercial world as a very contentious one, and the amendments I suggest are submitted on behalf of persons interested in commerce. I agree with other honorable senators that the word "services" has such a very wide signification that it is doubtful whether there is any business at all that would not be more or less affected by this Bill, even though it might not constitute a monopoly. Honorable senators are aware that persons who buy goods in large quantities obtain an advantage over those who purchase only a small quantity. A steamer might be put on to a certain trade route, under a promise of support for a certain time. Some one, seeing that the steamer was paying well, might wish to start an opposition steamer, and those who began the service might feel justified, in order to retain their business, in demanding a promise of support from those who had induced them to start the service. If, in order to do so, they quoted a special rate of freight, that might be regarded as involving the payment of a rebate. I move - </para>

                        BEST (Victoria - Minister of Trade and Customs)  [8.1]. -  My honorable friend has now launched an amendment which, if adopted, would practically neutralize any good that might otherwise be contained in the Bill. He knows that the object of this measure is to simplify procedure, and yet he seeks to encumber it with a provision relating to " unfair" rebates. Now, what are "unfair" rebates? The honorable senator endeavours to define them by saying that they are rebates which are unfair in the circumstances, or which operate to the detriment of the public. May I remind him that an expensive action at law would be necessary to ascertain as a fact whether, under the circumstances, a rebate was fair or unfair?

                            <para>- We are attempting to strike at an evil. We know that there is a recognised system of rebates which has proved an all-important factor in the upbuilding of monopolies. In the principal Act, we legislated against that system, but, upon attempting to put sections 4 and 6 of that Act into operation, it was discovered that so many matters had to be proved that it was practically impossible to obtain a conviction. Hence it is that we have resorted to a simpler method of procedure by seeking to provide that the granting of a rebate conditional upon " exclusive dealing " shall be regarded as an offence. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it would not. This provision does not attempt to interfere with the ordinary discounts allowed in trade. It merely seeks to strike at the system of granting rebates upon the ground of "exclusive dealing." I have already quoted freely, with a view to showing how that system has been abused to the detriment of the public. If we have to resort to litigation to ascertain whether or not a, rebate is unfair, I maintain that any monopoly will be able to defeat the objects of the measure </para>

The Bill in its present form declares that the granting of rebates shall be a criminal offence, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> proposal would make the acceptance of such rebates a similar offence. The question of unfair rebates will have to be dealt with subsequently. In my opinion, the words " or receives from " cannot be inserted in this provision. Perhaps the Minister will agree to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> and embody his idea in a. new clause. </para>

They will require to be embodied in a new clause. I should like fo see such a clause circulated before subscribing to the honorable senator's proposal, because, in my judgment, it is capable of some abuse. We are endeavouring to repress monopolies, and it would be very inconsistent if we struck at some poor hard-up trader in the grip of a monopolist, who was practically forced to accept a rebate. We wish to strike at the monopolist, and not at his victim.

In the first place, I realize the terrible injury which may be inflicted upon the public if some steps are not taken to control large monopolies. But there is an equally dangerous aspect of this Bill, which makes me doubtful whether I ought to support it. There appears to be no intermediary between the Minister, who will put trie law in motion, and the delinquent. Surely there ought to be some such intermediary as the Inter- State Commission, otherwise an appeal should be allowed to the High Court. In the absence of such a provision we shall be absolutely at the caprice of the Minister in office for the time being. </para>

                            <para>- The big man, however, gets a large concession, while the small man gets practically nothing. If by Federal legislation we are to declare that the whole system of rebates is inherently wrong, we then and there strike a blow at the legislation of the States. Further than that, the States Governments differentiate in the matter of traffic rates on goods. They give the man who sends large consignments a reduction or rebate as compared with the charges made to the sender of smaller quantities. In Victoria, the concession is called not a rebate, but a reduction; but the reduction operates just in the same way as in New South Wales. I suggest that it is desirable that we should look ahead, and ask ourselves where we are going. I also bring under the notice of the Committee a famous case in regard to rebates on freight which was dealt with some years ago in England. In the year 1888, the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Mogul Steamship Company Limited</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">McGregor, Gow, and Company, and Others,</inline> was tried. The defendants consisted of ten other companies, including the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. The defendants had, by agreement, made arrangements whereby they undertook to give to all shippers by their vessels a rebate at the end of the season of 5 per cent. The Mogul Steamship Company, who were not in the agreement, desired to enter into the trade, and brought an action against the combination of companies. The case was first tried  by  Lord Chief Justice Coleridge. Afterwards, it went to the Court of Appeal, and finally to the House of Lords. In the first trial, it was held that -  the association being formed by the defendants with the view of keeping the trade in their own hands, and not with the intention of ruining the trade of the plaintiffs or through any personal malice or ill-will towards them, was not unlawful, and that no action for a conspiracy was maintainable. </para>

                        <para>One word in passing only on the contention that this combination of the defendants was unlawful, because it was in restraint of trade. It seems to me that it was no more in restraint of trade, as that phrase is used, for the purpose of avoiding contracts, than if two tailors in a village agreed to give their customers 5 per cent. off their bills at Christmas on condition of their customers dealing with them and with them only. Restraint of trade, with deference, has, in its legal sense, nothing to do with this question. But it is said that the motive of these acts was to ruin the plaintiffs, and that such a motive, it has been held, will render the combination itself wrongful and malicious, and that if damage has resulted to the plaintiffs an action will lie. I conclude that if the premises are established the conclusion follows. It is too late to dispute, if I desired it, as I do not, that a wrongful and malicious combination to ruin a man in his trade may be ground for such an action as this. Was then this combination such? The answer to this question has given me much trouble, and I confess to the weakness of having long doubted and hesitated before I could make up my mind. There can be no doubt that the defendants were determined, if they could, to exclude the plaintiffs from this trade. Strong expressions were drawn from some of them in cross-examination, and the telegrams and letters showed the importance they attached to the matter, their resolute purpose to exclude the plaintiffs if they could, and to do so without any consideration for the results to the plaintiffs, if they were successfully excluded. This, I think, is made out, and I think no more is made out than this. Is this enough? It must be remembered that all trade is, and must be in a sense, selfish ; trade not being infinite, the trade of a particular place or district being possibly very limited, what one man gains another loses. In the hand to hand war of commerce, as in the conflicts of public life, whether at the Bar, in Parliament, in medicine, in engineering (I give examples only) men fight on without very much thought of others, except a desire to excel or to defeat them. Very lofty minds, like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Phillip</inline> Sidney, with his cup of water; will not stoop to take an advantage, if they think another wants it more. Our age, in spite of high authority to the contrary, is not without its <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Phillip</inline> Sidneys; but these are counsels of perfection which it would be silly indeed to make the measure of the rough business of the world as pursued by ordinary men of business. The line is in words difficult to draw; but I cannot see that these defendants have in fact passed the line which separates the reasonable and the legitimate selfishness of traders from wrong and malice. In 1884 they admitted the plaintiffs to their conference; in 1885 they excluded them, and they were determined no doubt, if they could, to make the exclusion complete and effective, not from any personal malice or ill-will to the plaintiffs as individuals,' but because they were determined, if they could, to keep the trade to themselves: and if they permitted persons in the position of the plaintiffs to come in and share it they thought, and honestly and, as it turns out, correctly thought, that for a time at least there would be an end of their gains. The plaintiffs' conduct cannot affect their right of action if they have it; but it is impossible not to observe that they were as reckless of consequences in regard to the defendants as they accuse the defendants of being in regard to themselves; they were as determined to break in as the defendants were determined to shut out ; and they made their threats of smashing freights and injuring the defendants a mode of rather forcible suasion to the defendants to let them into the  conference. If they have their right of action, why they have it ; if they have it not, their own conduct disentitles them to much sympathy. On the whole I come to the conclusion that the' combination was not wrongful and malicious, and that the defendants were not guilty of a misdemeanour. I think that the acts done in pursuance of the combination, were not unlawful, not wrongful, not malicious; and that therefore the defendants are entitled to my judgment. </para>

The case was taken to the House of Lords. Judgment was not given until  1891,  when quite a number of noble lords spoke to the matter, and one and all confirmed the judgment originally given by Lord Chief Justice Coleridge. I will make one or two brief extracts. Lord Halsbury said - </para>

The only means by which they endeavoured to obtain shipments for their vessels to the exclusion of others, was the inducement of cheaper rates of freight than the appellants were willing to accept.

I am at one with everybody who wishes to smash unlawful combinations. By all means let us do so, and let us take the power to do so. But in our legislation let us safeguard our proposals so that we shall not run the danger of doing more harm than good. I trust that the Government will accept the proposal to insert the word "unfair," which, I repeat, is in the marginal note. </para>

                        referred to the cases which he quoted. If they are to be read or understood at all, I should say that they go to show almost conclusively why the Bill should be supported. Let us look at the facts. In the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Mogul</inline>
                        case the Judges all held that, according to the law, a particular combination was not a wrongful or malicious combination having for its object the smashing up of some other company. But the fact cannot be ignored that, although it was not unlawful, yet the operation of the combination was the crushing out of competition. Realizing that the public had to pay an excessive price for freight, and were injured in other ways, by reason of the creation of a monopoly and the crushing out of competition, this Parliament passed a Bill a few years ago with two objects - first, to put an end to monopolies, or to control them, so far as they were detrimental to the public ; and, secondly, to put an end to the conference and rebate system. We recognised that by the rebate system certain monopolies had been created in various parts of the world. We accepted the best form of legislation which, to some extent, had been deterrent j we relied as far as we could on the best features of the Sherman law and the Elkins law. These laws were in operation and had for their object the control of combinations. Being aware of the evil of combinations and of the possibility of controlling combinations in their earlier stages, we enacted a controlling law. Hence the cases which my honorable friend quoted can have no possible application to this Bill. The Senate affirmed that it was undesirable that the rebate system should be carried on, and embodied that determination in the parent Act. The object of the present measure is to simplify the procedure in order to achieve that determination.

                        intervenes with an amendment which, if carried, would revive all the old troubles. It would simply impose upon the law authorities all the original troubles, create all the former difficulties, and make litigation so expensive that the law would probably not be resorted to. The monopolist, being able to command the highest legal talent, would be likely to upset all our calculations. Hence, our object is to secure simplicity in procedure, and that simplicity is embodied in the terms of the Bill.

I read the opinions expressed by a number of very eminent Judges in the Old Country to show what they thought of the character of the trade, and the fact that they found that there was nothing morally wrong in it. That is the point of view that I wanted to put before honorable senators. The Minister also referred to my remarks about the large discounts given by the Railways Commissioners in connexion with goods, and a certain class of passenger tickets. He said that the system is open to all the community. If he thinks that that is the way out, perhaps the shipping community will try, under the Bill, to devise a way out. According to his statement, all that they will have to do will be to say: " If you ship a certain amount of freight bv our vessels, you will get a certain discount." </para>

                        <para>.- There is no doubt that in tackling the relationship of monopolies to the public we have a serious question to deal with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has made it evident that we have a pretty strong combination, possibly a beneficent one, established on our coast. But a combine, however beneficent it may be, has teeth, and it is just as well for Parliament to give an intimation that combines must be very careful how they use their teeth. It is quite right that traders in a possible conflict with powerful monopolies should not, in addition, be subject to immense expense while seeking to procure the infliction of penalties for the improper use of trade, or the monopoly of a trade against them. I am inclined, however, to think that it would be dangerous to insert the word " unfair," considering the circumstances which" we are. trying to combat. If the word " exclusively " were inserted, the honest trader, monopolist though he might be, would be sufficiently guarded. If the monopolist went outside the common meaning of the word " exclusively," he would certainly be punished. But if his proposals extended to the whole community, that would not be an arrangement detrimental to the public interest. For example, suppose that certain sugar-growers got rebates for shipping  500  tons of sugar by a certain, line, that other growers desired to ship by that line, and that their sugar was refused because they had not sent away  500  tons previously, that would be an unfair use of the combine's position. But suppose the combine offered to allow a discount of  10  per cent, to every grower who shipped  500  tons of sugar in a' season, whether he had dealt with the line previously or not or intended to do so in the future or not, and a discount of  12 J  per cent, to every grower who sent along  1,000  tons of sugar in a season, irrespective of any other condition, that would not be exclusive dealing. I think that the insertion of the word "unfair" would give the big shipping combines and monopolies too wide a loophole. It would be preferable to use the word "exclusively." </para>

                            <para>- I propose to make some quotations from the evidence given before the Navigation Commission on the question of rebates. It is very hard indeed, to say when they are fair or unfair. Personally, I cannot see how they can be justified. Where there is fair dealing there is no necessity for them, and if they constitute unfair dealing the whole trade in which the system is adopted must be condemned. I do not know whether honorable senators opposite are prepared to go that far. There is certainly a very unfair system of rebates in force in the coastal trade of Western Australia. I can assure honorable senators that one witness who suffered from the operation of the system, was a man in a large way of business as a merchant and in a smaller way of business as a ship-owner. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bateman,</inline> a very large merchant and ship-owner of Fremantle. He is a member of a family who have been in business in Western Australia for nearly two generations, and yet by the operation of the system of rebates, he was actually driven out of the shipping trade. I could have understood such a thing in the case of a mushroom firm, or one that had only recently been established in business. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bateman</inline> was asked when before the Navigation Commission - </para>

                        <para>Yes. It affected me in two cases. At the latter end of  1903  I -had a vessel loading at Singapore. In the following month a circular was issued by certain companies interested in the trade between Singapore and Australia and New Zealand, to the effect that in the future if their shippers sent cargo to Australia except to Western Australia by any boats other than their boats, or to Western Australia except by the boats of the Western Australian Steam Navigation Company and the Ocean Steam-ship Company, they would be deprived of their rebates on shipments to all ports of Australia; and the rebate was the heavy rebate of 20 per cent. If my vessel went to Singapore again for cargo the people who are in the habit of shipping to Western Australia and buying from the merchants of Western Australia and the Eastern States, would absolutely refuse to execute orders for shipment by my boat. They would otherwise jeopardize not only the rebates on cargo to Western Australia, but their rebates on cargo to the Eastern States as well. As this would mean a very big thing to them, it would be beyond possibility for me to get cargo from outside people for my vessel. It would even stand  in  the way of my getting - even getting - a man to buy cargo for my own ship; because if he bought cargo which was shipped  in  my ship  it  would be a contravention of the rebate arrangement. As merchant and shipper, I would be under a disability in trading to Singapore. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That evidence from a man of the standing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bateman</inline> proves that the rebate system operates in such a comprehensive way that it is impossible to provide any satisfactory method to put an end to it. The more I examine legislation of this kind the more satisfied I am that whatever our proposals may be we shall be unable to abolish the rebate system. It is a natural evolution of the capitalistic system, and those whose capital is invested "in enterprises of this kind will bring the system into force in every way they can. In fact, there is no other course open to them. The danger to capitalists of unbridled competition is so great as to justify me in saying that the rebate system, whether fair or unfair, will continue, and, therefore, all such legislation must be doomed to' failure. That, I think, must be admitted, even by honorable senators opposite who are adherents of an obsolete fiscal system. </para>

I have made up my mind that this Bill is only so much waste paper, and that we are merely playing at legislation in passing a measure which is doomed to failure. At the same time, I am prepared to assist the Government to put such legislation on the statute-book in order that it may be proved, if further proof is necessary, that this kind of legislation must prove worthless to attain the end for which it is passed. </para>

                        definition of " unfair " has completely altered the whole complexion of his amendment. He says that " unfair " means " unfair in the circumstances." In what circumstances?

                        would regard as unfair competition the system of accepting rebates which was recognised by certain merchants' in Queensland. Evidence concerning that system will be found on page 1193 of the proceedings of the Navigation Commission, which are set out in Vol. 3 of the Parliamentary Papers of 1906.

                        <para>How do those other mills ship their timber? - One has a boat of its own, but the export they do  is  very little. I am practically the only one in this place who has taken up the exporting  of  timber seriously. </para>
                        <para>Those mills have no timber to offer you? - We would take it for them if they had. </para>
                        <para>But up to the present they have not desired to send any by you, nor have they shipped any by the combine? - I could not say whether they had shipped any by the combine. I am disposed to think that they have. I may also mention that I quoted for the delivery of some cedar logs in Sydney, to be delivered by my own vessel. I wrote to a firm in Cairns, from whom I previously bought similar logs, but they wrote back stating they could not supply me, otherwise they would lose their rebate. The letter I received was as follows :  - </para>

                            Chairman.  - Do you import anything to Maryborough from any of the States outside Queensland? - We import from Sydney and Melbourne chiefly.
                        </para>
                        <para>By what shipping do you carry the goods which you import from those places? - The coastal steam-ship companies we have to do with here- the A. U.S.N. Company, Howard, Smith and Company (Ltd.), and the Adelaide Steam-ship Company. </para>
                        <para>Practically all your imports must come by those boats? - Yes, by either of those three lines. </para>
                        <para>Are there any other steamers trading to Maryborough besides those? - The boats owned by the saw-mills carry timber and coal. Two of them were running to Sydney for some little time. One is known as the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Hopewell,</inline> and the other the schooner <inline font-style="italic">Mayflower.</inline></para>
                        <para>There are other boats which trade here? - Yes. </para>
                        <para>Is there any system of rebates adopted by those companies you have mentioned? - Yes. In 1897 they issued a circular saying they would allow a rebate of  5  per cent, payable after the expiration of six months. I have now in my hand the original circular. That rebate was to be given on all goods shipped by us, provided we confined our entire shipping business to them. </para>
                        <para>The date of the circular is 13th August, 1897. </para>

                        <para>Do you think that condition of things tends to hamper trade in your particular business? - Unquestionably ; we have been hampered, and have lost a volume of business through it. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman</inline> and their agents over and over again that they were simply attempting to close our gates; that as soon as I received their circular in 1897 I was quite sure of it. I tendered for three steam boilers to be delivered at Port Mackay, which might be 300 or 400 miles from here; the rates were given at £60 each boiler, that is j£i8o for the three. They would possibly weigh 12 tons each. I told them that on such rates the business would certainly pass us. that I was sure of it, and it did. lt went to Messrs. Babcock and Wilcox, of Glasgow, who make patent water-tube boilers, which they ship in segments, and the freight on them becomes less on account of their being so handy for transport. There is one piece which would weigh about  5  tons, the remaining segments probably 1 ton each or less. Those would be delivered from Glasgow to Mackay at about half the freight we quoted from Maryborough to Mackay. I. could repeat similar instances. Our firm have lost volumes of business on the coast, and the companies themselves have lost the carriage of it. These goods now coming from England or America as it may be, have come in other bottoms oversea. </para>

                                evidence before the Commission was given on oath. Some honorable senators may say that there was fair dealing on the part of the shipping companies. I say  that it. was not fair at all. It is quite true, as

                                pointed out, that the Railways Commissioners grant concessions, but at the same time any person who does business with the railways to the same extent is entitled to the same concessions. The railways do not say, "Any goods which you send between any two points must be carried by us." Any person is allowed to take advantage of the best means of transit available to him. If  the word " unfair " is to be inserted, the Bill might as well be dropped. At the same time, I do not think that this measure wilt  be effective. I honestly believe that the companies are strong enough to beat this, sort of legislation in the Courts. Whether there is a question of fairness or unfairness or not, in every instance the companies have been financially strong enough to command the best legal talent and have fought from one Court to another until they won. I do not think that combines are going to be controlled in this way. Still we shall not oppose any legislation which the Government bring forward with this object in view. The peculiar position now is, that we find a Government bringing down a measure of this character, and their own supporters moving amendments having the effect of emasculating the Bill. Honorable senators on the Opposition side of the chamber are not prepared to support amendments having the effect of weakening the Bill and creating loopholes for monopolies already existing to carry on their practices, and defy the intention of Parliament.

I am given to understand that a similar form of agreement is quite common. Let me first of all deal with the legal aspect of the matter. The point, of course, will be taken that such an agreement cannot be made illegal by Commonwealth legislation if it applies only to State disputes, such as the bakers' dispute in Victoria. In various cases in America, especially in the case of N. <inline font-style="italic">C.

                    <para>On the other hand, it has also been held that in the case of a person being injured, or of trouble arising inside a State, the State is solely responsible, and the State legislation must prevail. I am not attempting to provide a remedy for such cases as, say, the bakers' dispute, unless we can imagine  a  case arising on the border of Victoria and New South Wales; where we have a town on either side, and where the control put over one person will extend to that person carrying on operations in another State. Here we have a chance to do  a  little towards stopping what I certainly think is an evil, and what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> judgjng by his remarks the other day, thinks is a very  serious  evil, not only inside  a  State, but  even  among States. Let us take a very simple instance under the agreement I read to honorable senators the other clay, and here let me say that I rather object to the careless manner in which  one  of the daily newspapers reported what  was  said. It reported me as objecting to the way in which "some employés"  were  compelled to sign agreements, whereas I used the term "all employés." Let  me  take the case of a clerk who is engaged in an  office  in Sydney, and gets an opportunity to go to an office in Brisbane. If he is an honorable man, and holds honorably by the document to which he put his signature, he is not allowed to be in any way instrumental in obtaining orders during the prescribed period from any customer for the goods dealt with. That is an unreasonable restriction to put upon anybody, and I believe that, as a matter of public policy, it would not hold good in a Court of law. Suppose that we have in Melbourne a firm called "A" manufacturing boots, and in Brisbane a firm called " B " manufacturing boots; and suppose that the firm " A " has employed a man for a certain period to travel for the sale of its boots, and that, after he has travelled through  Queensland for a certain period, the firm called " B," having heard from its own travellers that be is a smart man, with a good presence, and a good salesman, offers an engagement to him. If this rule which has been operating amongst certain firms is allowed to apply, that traveller cannot engage himself with the firm called " B " in Queensland. It is said that these men are engaged as travellers, and in that way have opportunities to ingratiate themselves with certain people in order to sell their employer's goods. I do not care twopence for the supposed extra shilling or two which they get a week for the purpose of buying drinks for customers, because my experience as a business man tells me that when a man goes to buy he tries to get the best goods he can at the lowest price, and is not largely influenced by the consideration that the traveller has a nice dark moustache, or is clean shaved, or has a grey beard. The man's manners do not occur to him when he is dealing. If a man has received a certain amount of education and possesses engaging manners that is part of his capital, and the employer has no more right to exploit his ingratiating manners than he has to exploit his muscle. Of course, my honorable friends may say that I am asking a great deal at their hands. </para>

It  is of no use to shut our eyes to what is taking place every day, and that is that the vendor of a business is bound down not to start a business in a certain area within a given time.  If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> were purchasing a business, he would make sure that he was protected in that way. But the whole point of the present law is that the agreement must be reasonable in its nature. This measure does not cover such cases as have been referred to by Senators Turley and Chataway, where the engagements are made within a State. Under the Constitution, we have no control over a case of that kind. That is purely a matter for State regulation. I confess that I find very great difficulty in imagining what particular class of cases a provision of this kind could apply to. It would have to be a case in relation to trade or commerce within the States, or to over-sea traffic. There might be an occasional case of the kind. But I do not think that the provision, if adopted, would be likely to cover many cases. It deals with a class of employment which at present does not occur to my mind. I am not aware of any class of engagements to which it would apply. But, sir, there is another point to be considered. I do not think that the amendment can be received, because it is quite outside the scope of the Bill. The object of the Bill is to amend the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906, and that Act provides for the preservation of Australian industries and the repression of destructive monopolies. The object of this amendment, however, is to deal with something outside the purposes of that Act, and that is the relationship of employer and employé. We have a standing order which says - </para>

The original Act and this Bill deal exclusively with monopolies and commercial trusts, and it appears to me that the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> is not relevant to the Bill, and does not come within its title. It deals, I think, with a matter of industrial legislation, which is one on which any State Parliament could legislate.

                            <para>- The reference was to an effort made by members of the Labour party in another place to extend the benefits of the Old-age Pensions Act. The point I wish to make is that if the Minister of Trade and Customs had made that statement on the floor of this chamber, and had suggested that any member of this Parliament in taking certain action, or in making certain remarks, was actuated by improper and unworthy motives, he would have been called upon to withdraw the statement. I do not think it is right for any Minister of the Crown, or any member of this Parliament, to stand upon a public platform, and accuse any other member of being actuated by unworthy or improper motives in taking a certain line of action. I say that in doing so, the Minister of Trade and Customs degraded the position he occupies as a responsible Minister of the Crown. On the question of pairs, the honorable senator proclaimed, so to speak, from the housetops that the Opposition had denied pairs. I remember that towards the end of last session, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> sat on the Opposition cross benches - when the smiles with which he usually greets us were not so frequent as they are now - and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> occupied the bench which the honorable senator and his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> now occupy, I asked for a pair on an occasion when, because of a domestic illness, I was placed in a very serious position. Party feeling at that time ran just as high as it is running to-day. I had already given pairs to honorable senators then in Opposition who were placed in a similar position, in order to allow them to get away to see a sick wife or a sick member of their families. But when I asked that a similar courtesy should be extended to me, it was refused. I did not take the platform, and addressing the Women's National League, or a Labour league, complain to Australia that 1 had been denied a pair. </para>

The Minister of Trade and Customs has stood upon a public platform, and tried to make political capital out of a matter of this kind, and, if he has been correctly reported, he used words which he would not have dared to use in this Chamber. I say that the honorable senator, in so doing, was sinking party politics to the lowest depths of political depravity ; and I now ask him to offer some explanation of the words he used. </para>

If he will examine what I have said, he will find that I repeated what was told to me, and what, if necessary, I could have amply verified.

If this had been the first session in which pairs had been refused, I could have understood the outcry bv our political opponents; but I can remember quite well in my experience of the Senate since the opening of the Federal Parliament, that pairs have been refused time and time again. </para>

Probably no honorable senator has given pairs more frequently than I have, and I have been positively disgusted when I have found that some honorable senators whom I had obliged refused to return the compliment. I consider that I am one of the most regular attendants in this chamber.

                        <para>- I regret that this question has been again introduced here. I had hoped that as the session proceeded any little heat that had been engendered would pass away, and that the ordinary courtesies of political life would be restored. But, seeing that the question of pairs has been revived, I am induced to hope, by the statements of some honorable senators opposite, that even now there is a possibility of our getting back to our old footing. I should, however, like to remind them, when they urge as an excuse for their refusal to give pairs events which happened in previous sessions, that that was not the reason given some time ago in the official declaration of why pairs were " off." The reason advanced as to why pairs were officially refused to us was not because on a previous occasion we had refused pairs, or because misunderstandings had arisen between honorable senators ; but merely because of certain political developments. </para>

                            <para>- I am in a position to affirm that there was an official refusal by the head of the Labour party to grant a pair to one of my colleagues, and what is more, the refusal was accompanied by the statement that pairs were officially "off." Are the declarations which we have heard to-night to be regarded as an intimation that better counsels have prevailed, and that the practice which has ordinarily obtained is to be revived? I sincerely hope so. I take no exception to the mariner in which any honorable senator may choose to express his individual views. But I hope that in this Chamber we shall at least get back to the old practice under which a courtesy offered by one side was readily responded to by the other. </para>
