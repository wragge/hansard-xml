                    <para>- In a speech which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> made at the last meeting of the Senate, he alluded to a newspaper report blaming the Opposition party for delaying the business of the country, and when I interjected &#34; That is true,&#34; he said &#34; It is false.&#34; I believe that his reference was to the report in the newspaper and not to my remark. Apparently he was misunderstood, and I am sure that it is only fair to him that I should make this explanation. </para>

At the present time the trawler is on the coast of Tasmania, and I can hardly say now when, according to- its itinerary, it is likely to go to South Australia, but that State will be visited. </para>

                <para>In Australia there is scarcely a business or occupation of any kind that is not now regulated by an agreement or understanding as to prices and conditions, and the results to the public are altogether satisfactory- and beneficial. Space will allow here but a single illustration of this, and we choose one that may, at the same time, help to show the absurdity of the law, namely, the Newspaper Trust. It is well known that there is among the newspaper proprietors of Australia an agreement that all cable messages from Europe shall be obtained through one channel only, and which in restraint of trade forbids any paper to receive and publish any independent cables. This it is that explains why the cables published daily in all the different papers are identical. As a result of this arrangement, instead of cable news appearing in a small number of larger papers only, every newspaper throughout, the Commonwealth, even in the remotest backblocks, is enabled to supply its readers daily with the latest intelligence from all parts of the world. But however beneficial this may be to the public, it is, under the Australian Industries Preservation Act (section 7), an offence, for which the penalty is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500.</inline> However, it is quite certain that no Government will dare to put the law in operation against so powerful an organization as the press.  and asked the Minister, <inline font-style="italic">upon notice -</inline></para>

                        <para>The statements in the paragraph seem to be inconsistent. If the agreements are beneficial to the public as alleged, the persons entering into them cannot well be deemed to have thereby committed offences within the meaning of the provisions of an enactment directed only at agreements to restrain, or monopolies of, or attempts to monopolize, trade and-commerce &#34;to the detriment of the public.&#34; </para>
                        <para>The paragraph does not suggest that the firm is in possession of any evidence of an offence against the Act in question, nor allege facts which, if proved, would justify a prosecution; but if there are any facts available from any source calling for inquiry, they will be given full consideration. </para>

The only object we have in view is, of course, the saving of time.

                    <para>. - I want to point out the most extraordinary position in which we stand. It appears that this Bill, the second reading of which is to be taken at a later hour of the day, has not yet been printed. During the past week or two we heard a great deal of complaint from the Government about the conduct of the Labour party in obstructing business, and now we find that the Government, who have been so exceedingly anxious to get on with their work, are not prepared with a single Bill. They have not, in print, the first Bill on their programme. That is an exceedingly forcible comment on the attitude of the Ministry during the past few weeks, and I understand that the same thing occurred in another place. Apparently the sudden collapse of the Opposition has placed the Government in an exceedingly difficult position. Ministers have no business ready, though they were anxious to proceed with work. </para>

I remind the honorable senator that the Senate has already suspended the Standing Orders to enable that course to be taken. </para>

But in any case, I think I am quite in order iri pointing out the peculiar position in which the Government have, placed tine Senate. I, as a member of the Senate, object to the second reading of any Bill being taken unless I hold in my hand a copy of it, so as to be able to follow the explanation given by the Minister. Are we to have a copy of this Bill before its second reading is moved? Will some member of tha Government give an answer &#34;to my question ? </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. They have agreed to take the second reading of a Bill which they have not seen, which is not in print, which, so far as we know, will not be in print when the second reading is moved and taken, and the pro visions of which they will not be in a position to intelligently follow when the Minister is explaining them. That is a position unparalleled in the history of parliamentary government. I do not think that it would be tolerated in any legislative  cham-ber  under heaven except&#39; the Commonwealth Senate. I do not think that any Government would be so stupid or so unmindful of what is due to honorable senators as to bring in its measures in such a slipshod fashion. I can characterize it by no other term. It is unworthy of any Government. Any self-respecting Senate would reject a proposal of that character with scorn and indignation. </para>

He has to accept the decision which has been arrived at. I understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was desiring not so much to comment upon the decision of the Senate as to object to a time for the second reading of the Bill being fixed until it had been printed. It will not be in order to reflect upon or to canvass the decision of the Senate, but of course I cannot prevent the honorable senator from alluding to it. </para>

                        <para>- I quite understand that. I know that the Government purpose is that the Minister introducing the measure shall rise in his place, move its second&#39; reading, and give an explanation of its provisions. But the usual course, when the second reading of a Bill is moved, is to furnish honorable senators with copies, so that they may be made familiar with its scope and its leading provisions. I cannot speak for honorable senators opposite. I have no conception, what their capacities are. But I am modest enough to admit that I am not sufficiently intelligent to follow the Minister in his exposition of a Bill which I have not seen, unless I have a copy of it before me. I desire to be placed in a position to do my duty to the people who sent me here in the most effective fashion ; and I shall be prevented from doing that in the present case in consequence of the procedure adopted by the Government. I shall certainly object to the second reading being taken until a printed copy of the Bill is placed in. my hands, and I can come to an intelligent decision with regard to it. </para>

                    <para>.- I object most decidedly to the second reading of this Bill being taken to-day. I fail to see what reason there is for this kind of undue haste. There is plenty of time for us to devote full and proper discussion to all the Bills which the Government have announced their intention to bring before the Senate. If the business which we have to do cannot be transacted by the Senate sitting three days a week, I am prepared to sit four days. There is no good reason why we should sit only on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. I am prepared, if necessary, to sit on Mondays and Tuesdays, and even on Saturdays. There is plenty of time for the Senate to devote itself to the work which it has to do in a proper manner, and without undue, and, I might say, almost indecent haste. </para>

But what I rose to&#39; point out is that constitutional practice has  proved conclusively that such safeguards against undue haste as are provided by our Standing Orders are necessary. That is the reason why they have been embodied in Our Standing Orders, and why they are &#39;included in the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, from which ours are derived. Those Standing Orders should not be suspended except in case of extreme urgency. There can be no extreme urgency in this ease. </para>

                        <para>- I am not discussing whether the Standing Orders should be suspended or not; I am discussing whether we should proceed with the second reading of this Bill to-day. That is the question before the Chair, and I am entitled to discuss it. No urgency has been shown for this course. It is probable that after this Bill and a few other measures have been disposed of, the Senate will be asked to adjourn for a week or two while the Government get other measures ready. There is no reason for suspending the safeguard against undue haste and against Bills being passed without proper discussion. I am quite prepared to facilitate the transaction of necessary business. Every measure which can be shown to be of advantage to the country I am prepared to assist to the best of my power in passing. But there is no reason why we should take the second reading of this Bill to-day. </para>

The Government should not ask the Senate to proceed with the second reading until we have the Bill in print, and know what we are asked to discuss. In these circumstances, I shall vote against the motion. We cannot expect good legislation to be produced in such a fashion. </para>

                    <para>. - We must be either extremely friendly towards the Government, or comparatively blind, if Ministers are to get themselves out of the difficulty into which they have put themselves. We have suspended the Standing Orders, in order that the present motion may be made. The reason for suspending the Standing Orders was that the business to be transacted was a matter of urgent necessity. The position in which we find ourselves, owing to the statement of the Government, is, therefore, that it is a matter of urgent necessity that the second reading of this Bill should be taken without any senator seeing a copy of it. I supported the Government in suspending the Standing Orders, although, as both representatives of the Government know, when they sat in opposition there was nothing to which they objected so consistently as suspensions of the Standing Orders. Yet they commence, in the present case, by submitting such a motion themselves. I must say that I shall regret it if the Government, having secured the suspension of the Standing Orders, ask members of the Senate to deal with a motion for the second reading of the Bill without enabling every one of us to have a copy of it. It is an insult, either to the Minister himself who moves the second reading, or to the Senate which listens to him, to adopt such a course. Either the Minister who moves the second reading of the Bill assumes that his remarks are of so little importance that it does not matter whether honorable senators have copies of the measure or not; or it is considered that the opinions of honorable senators about it are so unimportant that the Minister does not care whether or no&#39;t they understand what he says about it. I should like the Government to get out of the position in which they have placed themselves, but I . do not see how they are to do it. May I ask Ministers whether it is not possible to obtain copies of this Bill by a later hour to-day ? . For myself, I can see no objection to the second reading being proceeded with if we have copies. </para>

                        <para>- Cannot the Minister give the Senate the assurance that he will not take the second reading until such time as he is able to furnish every member of the Senate with a copy of the Bill ? If he cannot do that, it will be seen that a very undesirable practice is being adopted in asking the Senate to listen to a motion for the second reading of a Bill which they have had no opportunity of reading for themselves. We ought not to initiate a practice of this kind. It ought not to be done even once. I ask Ministers whether they have not another Bill, which is in print, and with which they can proceed? I gladly assisted them in the matter of the suspension of the Standing Orders, but I must confess that I do not like to proceed with the second reading of a Bill without seeing a copy of it. I am afraid that I shall have to vote against the present motion, although I desire to help the Government. The course proposed is an insult to us, and the Senate ought to object strongly to it. </para>

I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that Ministers should have the Bill before the Senate, or postpone its consideration until it has been circulated, and in the meantime go on with other business that they have ready. If they cannot do that, I think . we should amend the motion by adding the words, &#34;when the Bill has been printed and placed in the hands of honorable senators.&#34; We should have the Bill before us in less than half an hour if the Government are in earnest in their professed desire to go on with business. Last week we were given an intimation that Ministers would ask for the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable them to make their second-reading speeches on the measures they intended to introduce. No one objected at the time, because every member of the Senate who has seriously considered parliamentary procedure had it in mind that the Bills would be printed, and in the hands of honorable senators.

In the circumstances, I naturally resumed my seat, and voted with the Government, in the belief that the Bill was in print, and would be in the possession of honorable senators before any further steps were taken  in  connexion with it. If I had understood that the Bill was not in print I would not have voted as I did. In the circumstances the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> proposes the only reasonable way out of the difficulty. I hope that the Government will recognise the dilemma, in which they are placed, and accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite evident that the Government have got into a very great difficulty. One might readily sympathize with them for having been caught napping at so early a date. They have had control of the, affairs of the Commonwealth now for a month or five weeks, and have not yet had time to prepare their business for submission to Parliament. I decidedly object to the procedure suggested by Ministers.. I feel that the motion before the Senate, even if amended as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has&#39; proposed, would not entirely satisfy honorable senators. It appears that we are to he asked to listen to a second-reading speech by the Minister, without any knowledge of the text on which it is to be based, and that the Bill is then to be circulated, and we are to proceed at once with our criticism of it without knowing anything of what it contains. </para>

                        <para>- We have heard so many varying statements since we met this session that we may be excused if we have become confused by them. Some of the statements made have not been of the most reliable character, and I am not disposed to accept another off-hand. If the Government intended to proceed with the Bill, there would be nothing to prevent them from doing so if the motion before the Senate were carried. Of course, the unfairness of such a course would be so apparent as to appeal to any but a party majority. It is probable that nothing would appe?.r to be unfair to the Government majority at this moment. </para>

The Minister of Trade and Customs must admit that he is placing honorable senators in a position which they should not be asked to occupy, in proposing that he should make a second-reading speech upon the Bill, while they must remain in blissful ignorance of whether he is keeping within even measurable distance of its text. As I do not intend to occupy any such position, I shall vote against the motion. </para>

Accordingly, on Wednesday last, we intimated that as there was a prospect that the motion of want of confidence moved in another place would be disposed of on Friday, we were desirous that we should meet to-day not merely to do formal business, but to get on with as much public business as we possibly could. With a view to expediting public business, we intimated at the same time that we should ask that not only the formal motions for the first reading of certain measures should be taken, but also that Ministers in charge of them should be permitted to move the second reading, and give an exposition of them. Then, as soon as the Minister had sat clown it would have been the duty of a member of the Opposition, in accordance with the usual practice, to move the adjournment of the debate. </para>

If, for the sake of expedition, we had not made the suggestion which we did, it would have been the duty of my honorable colleague and myself to have submitted the ordinary motions that leave be given to introduce certain Bills for certain purposes. These formal motions having been disposed of, we should have had to adjourn until tomorrow. </para>

                <para>SenatorSir ROBERT BEST. -I am merely stating what was the object and desire of the Government. Now we are met with the objection that honorable senators have not copies of the Bills before them, and are not, therefore, in a position &#39; follow the second reading speeches of Ministers. There are two answers to that contention. The first is that the course which we desire to follow is not an unusual course under like circumstances. In the House of Commons, times out of number, the explanation of. Bills is made upon the motion for their first reading, and when there is not a line of their text before honorable members. Then the Bill is circulated, and&#39; the second reading is proceeded with in the ordinary way. We are simply following the principle involved in that practice on the present occasion. I also point put to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the Bill could not have been circulated until leave had been given to introduce it. </para>

                        <para>- It could not be circulated until the motion for its printing had been carried. Copies of it cannot be struck off in five minutes. I repeat that the Bill is in print, and that all the Government desire is to be allowed to explain its provisions. It is a short measure, so that honorable senators could not possibly be mistaken as to its terms. It contains but nine small clauses, only two of which are important. I should have taken the trouble to read each clause, so that honorable senators could not possibly be under any misapprehension regarding its provisions. </para>

But even if honorable senators were armed with those copies, they would be in possession of no more information than I intended to give them in moving the second reading of the Bill. There was not the remotest intention on the part of the Government to seek a division upon that motion to-day, and we have given a definite undertaking to that effect. </para>

That is in accordance with the usual practice. Had we departed from that practice we should have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> criticising us for our action. The Government do not misunderstand the nature or the purpose of the criticism which has been levelled against them. We have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> declaring that the reason copies of the Bill were not available to honorable senators was that we were not ready to proceed with it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> on the other hand, has accused us of undue haste. Of course, it is easy for critics to make such charges- </para>

                        <para>- Of course, I know that anything we may do will be displeasing to honorable senators opposite. When I declared the intentions of the Government last week, I assumed that the Senate recognised the inconvenience to which it would subject itself by adopting the course which I suggested. I credited honorable senators with being familiar with the ordinary practice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> must know that that practice is to have Bills printed during the period that elapses between their first and second readings. When I made the announcement which I did last week, I assumed that honorable senators realized the inconvenience to which they would be subjected by following the course which I then outlined. The Government have taken up the position that it is desirable to ask the Senate to submit to some little inconvenience in order to effect a saving of twenty-four hours of our time. Honorable senators supported the proposal to suspend the Standing Orders, but apparently many of them did so without realizing what their action involved. It is quite possible that they were not then aware of the fact that copies of the Bill would not be available immediately. The Government do not desire them to proceed with its consideration if they are not ready to do so. I say again - and I defy honorable senators to controvert it - that the practice of the Senate has been to have every measure printed during the period that elapses between its first reading and the motion for its second reading. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend knows that there are three reasons for that practice. As a rule, there is a contingent motion on the notice-paper in anticipation of the arrival of the Supply Bill. On the motion for its first reading the main portion of the debate on the Bill is taken. And as a Supply Bill originates elsewhere, it is always in print and available to honorable senators. This Bill, however, has been originated here. The Government have no desire to proceed with the motion for its second reading if the Senate considers that it would be under a disability in that course being taken. As this discussion has lasted some time, it is anticipated that very shortly, probably in a few minutes, the Bill will be available for circulation. If my honorable friend will withdraw his amendment, the Government, having done everything they can to expedite the printing of the Bill, will see that its second reading is not moved until copies are made available to honorable senators. </para>

The Government should be satisfied with the concession which they have obtained. When the second reading speeches on the two other Bills are concluded it will be a reasonable time to adjourn. The second reading of any other Bills might reasonably be made orders of the day for tomorrow. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister&#39;s justification for asking the Senate to suspend the Standing Orders has been that he wanted to fill up time. I am sure that the introductory speeches on the Seamen&#39;s Compensation, Bill and the Australian Industries Preservation Bill will occupy the time of the Senate to-day, after those measures have been made available. If we agree to this motion, it may be urged hereafter that because we suspended the Standing Orders to enable the second reading of two Bills to be proceeded with, that course should be taken in all cases. In my opinion, it will be a dangerous precedent to establish, unless, of course, there are-good reasons for doing so. I admit that there were good reasons for suspending the Standing Orders in regard to the other Bills. The Minister will be well advised if he does not press the mo&#39;. ion. </para>

                    <para>. - The previous discussion and. the remarks of Senators McGregor and Pearce on this motion have rather amused me. So far as &#91; understand the position, we have given leave to the Ministers to move the second reading of two Bills, because we want to fill up our time, and they are quite prepared to do that. We have also understood that, as soon as each Minister&#39;s second-reading speech is concluded, the debate will probably be adjourned. In carrying out this idea of filling up our time, no assistance is expected from, or can be given by, any one except the Ministers. The whole onus of filling up our time to-day is upon the Ministers. I also gather that they are quite willing to see that an opportunity is given to them to fill up our time. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will agree with me that if the two Ministers were to occupy our time until  10  o&#39;clock in moving the second reading of two Bills, their speeches would be very lengthy ; in fact, before they had finished we should probably be asking them to resume their seats, and, before they had been speaking a great while, they would probably be asking us to allow them to do so. Seeing that we have committed ourselves to this idea of filling up time, I think it is inadvisable to prevent the Ministers from moving the second reading of the other two Bills, if they so desire. I venture to suggest that they can take that course and yet not occupy our time until 10 o&#39;clock. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that there is a good deal in the views which have been expressed from this side, and also in the statement by the Minister that he does not propose 10 proceed with this particular Bill to-day. It is provided in the Standing Orders that sufficient time shall elapse after a Bill is introduced and circulated to enable its provisions to be considered by honorable senators. The second reading of two important Bills will be moved to-night, and the debate thereon adjourned until to-morrow, and we are now asked to allow that course to be taken with a third Bill. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> if, when the Senate assembles to-morrow, he will be prepared to discuss the whole question of the light-houses, beacons, and buoys of Australia, and the constitutional point which is involved in the Bill? If, however, the second reading of the Bill is not moved until to-morrow, we shall have another day in which to consider its provisions before the debate is resumed. I think that at least a day should be allowed to elapse before the second reading of the measure is moved. </para>

                    <para>- We shall not be depriving honorable senators of an opportunity for consideration, and will be expediting business, if we allow the Ministers to carry forward these measures a stage to-day. We suspended the Standing Orders because we recognised that the circumstances of to-day are peculiar, and that we should do something to-day which ordinarily we could not do. If it was right to take that course with reference to two Bills, there can be no reason against doing so in the case of other Bills. I heartily indorse what has been urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> The only two senators who can engage the attention of the Senate tonight are the two Ministers. It would be ridiculous to assume that they could occupy the time until10 o&#39;clock in moving the second reading of two Bills. I think that it is quite possible that they may. The Ministers may, by dinner time, have moved the second reading of four Bills, and we can proceed with the discussion of them at a later date. </para>

It will be recollected that the measure was introduced last session by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> The second reading was agreed to. At that time there was a fear in my mind, and in the minds of other honorable senators, that it might be possible to manipulate the recording machine in some way or other. </para>

                        <para>- I admit at once that it is a fear that is not to be pushed on  one side lightly. I have no objection to, but rather I regard with pleasure, any mechanical contrivance designed to save time and labour both to the public and to private firms. At the same time, last session 1 expressed grave doubt as to whether the machine had been subjected to sufficient tests. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did inform us that he had had reports from New Zealand; but unfortunately he omitted on that occasion to show that friendly desire that honorable senators should be supplied with the printed matter which he has displayed today, and we were not furnished with copies of the reports. Consequently, although they were satisfactory to the honorable senator, they left something to be desired from the point of view of the Committee generally. Since then the reports from New Zealand, coming practically down to date, have been printed and circulated. I think that if honorable senators have read them they will see that there can be little doubt that the confidence which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> expressed last session, can find an echo in the minds of all of us at the present time. I, at that time, expressed the necessity for manifesting caution. I have satisfied myself since by reading the reports that the measure may be safely adopted. I have now brought the Bill again under the notice of the Senate in the hope that the good work commenced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will be completed. </para>

Having been responsible for the measure then, subjects connected with it have naturally attracted my notice since. Probably honorable senators have observed from the newspaper reports that there has been an&#39; unusual number of frauds perpetrated principally by lads upon mercantile houses. During the recess I noticed reports of a large number of stamp frauds. </para>

In one case a large amount of trouble, and I do not doubt considerable expense also, was caused to a firm. I am certain that this measure will be of great benefit to large mercantile houses in preventing stamp frauds. I satisfied myself as far as I was able that the machine is safe from a departmental point of view. I do not think that it would be possible to &#34;fake&#34; the machine in the interests of those who use it. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> have both made general remarks concerning this Bill. Probably both honorable senators were justified in making what were virtually second-reading speeches in Committee. But, as we have now reached the part in which I take an interest, I should like to point out that the measure is one for the introduction of a machine which will render the use of adhesive stamps unnecessary. It is not a Bill to facilitate the sale of stamps; it is a Bill to enable them to be done without. The machine is one which makes a mark on an envelope, showing that a certain amount of money has been paid. Now, I happen to know that there is also available a very ingenious invention which may be used to supplant the machine mentioned in this Bill. It provides for the automatic delivery of adhesive stamps. There is such a machine in use in the precincts of the House of Commons at present, and it is largely used. </para>

                        <para>- But, as I have said, there is an extremely ingenious invention which provides for the automatic supply of adhesive stamps, and which would enable the public, where the machine was used, to secure postage stamps much more readily than they could do by obtaining them at a post-office. Moreover, it is an invention which will save a considerable amount of labour, because it is automatic. I shall not enlarge upon the subject if I am given to understand that it is not the intention of the Government to allow of any monopoly of the machine mentioned in the Bill precluding the possibility of another machine being used by the Post Office. Can the Minister give me that assurance? The rival machine, though different in operation, is similar in results, and in securing efficiency, economy, and convenience to the public. I do not desire to defeat the object of this Bill at all, but to secure freedom for the use of the rival machine. </para>

                    <para>- - I quite recognise the validity of the point of view from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has just addressed himself to the Committee. I should be with him in being disinclined to sanction this or any other machine which would be a convenience to people in a large way of business, if I thought that it would place any obstacle in the way of facilitating those whose business with the Post Office is of smaller dimensions. I readily give the honorable senator the assurance that this Bill is not brought forward to provide an alternative to the mechanical stamp-seller. The mechanical stamp-seller is for the purpose of selling stamps to people who generally want to buy one or two stamps at a time. This machine is to meet the convenience of people who require to stamp hundreds of letters in the course of a day, and it can in no way come into conflict with those who desire to make use of penny-in-the-slot machines for the purchase of a shilling&#39;s worth of stamps and who would never be justified in purchasing or hiring one of these machines. I direct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> attention to the following words of the clause under consideration: -  unless the contrary intention appears &#34; Recording Machine &#34;  means a machine for the purpose of making impressions upon postal articles and telegrams. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The point I make is that the Bill is intended merely to authorize the use of a machine which, under certain restrictions, and within certain limits, shall be available for people to whom it would be convenient to substitute an impressed for an adhesive stamp, and it in no way proposes to interfere with the use of slot machines or mechanical stamp sellers. It might later on be found that, because of some defect in the stamp-sellers, or in the recording machine dealt with in this Bill, the Department would find it necessary to discountenance the use of either. It is in no sense intended by authorizing the use &#39; of this machine to abolish the use of such a machine as that which is now placed in the Melbourne Post Office, and, for all I know, elsewhere, enabling small customers to rapidly supply their wants in respect of a. few stamps. It is not the intention under this Bill to provide in any way a substitution for anything, but merely an alternative form of stamping for the convenience of people whose correspondence is large in volume. </para>

                    <para>. - The main question to be considered in connexion with this Bill is the absolute reliability of these recording machines from the point of view of the Department, who will hire them to those who desire to use them, and from the point of view of those who will use them. I have not read the report to which the Minister referred ; but, granting that the machine is absolutely reliable, it must be admitted that its use would be of very great advantage to large business houses, who, instead of having to buy a large number of adhesive stamps, would be able by its use to impress the necessary stamps on all their correspondence. There cannot be the least doubt that very many large business houses would be glad to use such a machine, if it were only to avoid the results of fraud, to which they are sometimes subjected. Business houses that frequently send out a great many invoices and circulars, find that, instead of their being properly delivered, they do not reach their destination at all, and that the boys intrusted with the posting of them, unable to resist the &#39;temptation, pocket the stamps. That would be prevented if the recording machine could be relied upon. We do not want a machine which can be used in such a way as to defraud the Department, or which might be the cause of loss to the user. I am willing to accept the statement of the Minister that on the experience of the New Zealand Government this recording machine is absolutely reliable, and, if that be so, its use should represent a considerable saving to the Department in the printing of stamps, as well as a very great convenience, and a saving also to the users in preventing the peculation of stamps. </para>

                    <para>- - I am sorry that I have not seen the report circulated by the Minister in connexion with this matter. I do not think this business is quite so simple as it would appear at first sight.&#34; Our first consideration will be to try to find out how the use of these recording machines is going to affect the Post and Telegraph Department. I gather that they are to be issued to large mercantile firms. Persons in a small way of business will not require them, as it would not pay them to incur the cost of using one of these machines. Mercantile firms will stamp letters, circulars, newspapers, and postal matter of every description in their own places of business, and then deposit them in the usual way in the Post Office. I believe there is a. recorder attached to each of these machines purporting to indicate exactly the debt of the firm using the machine to the Post and Telegraph Department. If the machine is accurate, it will be all right, so far as the business firm using it is concerned. But we have to look at the Department&#39;s side of the matter. The Department receives a letter stamped by one of these machines, and they must make a note of it, because the person sending it has become their debtor for the postage of that letter. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to say that. I do not think that ladies are the worst offenders. I believe that business houses are the principal delinquents. I know that* a great many people try to &#34;have&#34; the Post Office. If they can send a letter or a newspaper without stamping it sufficiently, they will do so. That inclines me to the belief that in the use of these machines, there might not be freedom from fraud, and if fraud is possible with these machines, it will be the duty of the Department to keep a continuous check upon the correspondence of every firm using them. If that has to be done, the cost will outweigh the profit to the Department. With the exception of a reduction in the cost of printing stamps, referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> and that would not amount to very much, all the advantage in their use would be on the side of the commercial firms using them. If I could be persuaded that there would be no danger of fraud, I should be very much inclined to permit every possible facility for the use of these machines, but until it can be proved that that danger is non-existent, I must remain doubtful about the wisdom of supporting this measure. One reason given for the introduction of the Bill was to save these large firms from the peculation of their employes. I do not think it is the duty of the Post and Telegraph Department to do anything of the kind. The Department should look after its own affairs. If the employes of private firms are not honest, it is the duty of those firms to look after them. </para>

                            thinks very many things about myself and other honorable members on this side for which we are not responsible. By the use of these machines, if they are not entirely reliable, we might have the employers ssspeculating from the Government instead of the employes peculating from the employers. I am sent here to look after the interests of . the State. I am a State Socialist to that extent, if that is any information to
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker.</inline>
                            It is my. duty to see that the public revenue is safeguarded, and if there are peculations of postage stamps, they shall not be transferred from business houses to the Post Office itself. I think we ought to be satisfied on that point before we proceed further with the Bill. My own brief examination of it does not induce me to believe that the machine is one which will work to the advantage of the Post and Telegraph Department. So far as I can gather, the experience of New Zealand guarantees us nothing. It has merely used these machines, and they have proved fairly satisfactory. But we have no evidence that a continuous check has been kept upon their operations. Until that is forthcoming, I am so much a Conservative  that I am quite prepared to allow things to remain as they are rather than risk a leap in the dark, which may perhaps involve the Post and Telegraph Department in a very heavy loss of revenue. If more light can be thrown upon the subject, I shall be extremely glad, but, in the meantime, I must vote against the provisions of the measure.

                <para class="block">Apparently, the operation is not so simple as Honorable senators would make it appear. If an officer requires time in which to learn how to operate the machine, it is obvious that its working cannot be such an extremely simple matter. That being so, business people would probably have to employ an expert to operate it. My experience teaches&#39; me that all machines, such as cash registers, are capable of being manipulated. Consequently, I think that this automatic stamping machine might lend itself to fraud being practised against the Government. At any rate, we require more information than is contained in this memorandum before we are warranted in embarking on the experiment proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that a check might easily be kept upon correspondence passing through the post. But if the members of the postal staff are called upon to check stamps of&#189;d.,1d., 2d., 6d. and1s. values, instead of lessening the expense of the Department, additional hands will certainly be required. If that is the idea underlying the change, we ought to know it. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree that the use of this machine marks a departure which ought to be regarded with a great deal of caution, particularly, as was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> as it is a departure which is to be made, not so much in the interest of the Post and Telegraph Department as in the interest of certain firms. I claim that it is almost impossible for the ingenuity of man to invent a machine which the ingenuity of another man will not enable him to&#34; fake.&#34; I have had the privilege of examining this automatic stamping machine, and whilst I admit that it is an exceedingly ingenious contrivance, there are two ways in which the Department could be defrauded, apart from the accuracy of its recording powers. In the first place, the stamp is impressed upon the envelope or article which it is desired to forward through the post. A spring is released, and the stamp comes down and leaves its impression upon the letter or telegram as the case may be. But it appears to me that there is nothing to prevent two or three envelopes being simultaneously placed in the machine with a specially prepared carbon between them, and in that case the one stamp would be impressed upon all. I am assured by the expert that the plan which I have suggested would not work, because the pressure exerted by the stamp is too light. But if that be so the pressure might easily be increased. It is also urged that letters are too thick to permit of the idea which I have outlined being practicable. But that contention will certainly not hold good in respect of telegrams which are usually written on very thin paper. Three or four telegrams might be stamped simultaneously, and in that way the Department might be defrauded. I know that the fact that each die would bear a certain number would enable the Department to trace the articles sent through the post by any firm. But honorable senators are aware that letter-sorters are required to discharge their functions with extreme rapidity. Consequently it is scarcely possible to have an effective check kept in that way. There is another method by which I think fraud could be practised. It is true that the dies which make the impression are to be made with a secret mark which will be known only to the engraver and to the Department, and that the latter will thus be enabled to trace any particular impression of a stamp which passes through the post. But I would ask, &#34; What is to prevent any ordinary individual who knows that a firm has a No. 6 die on its machine manufacturing a <inline font-style="italic">facsimile</inline> of the impression stamp made by that machine? &#34; With an ordinary hand stamp he would thus be able to stamp as many letters as he chose, and these would continue to pass through the post until the fraud was detected. In such a contingency I venture to say that it would be almost impossible to trace the culprit. Of course, we may be told that forgery of the present stamps is possible. I admit that it is. But we know perfectly well that the difficulty that would be experienced in laying down a plant with which to forge postage stamps is so great that it would not be worth anyperson&#39;s while to attempt it. The practical test to which these automatic stamping machines have been subjected in New Zealand does not say very much for them. A highly respectable individual who occupied a very responsible position was convicted of embezzling money, and he had a host of persons in the witness-box to prove what an excellent character he was, but the Judge pointed out that every one bore an excellent character until he was found out. </para>

That goes to show that the Department considers that otherwise there is a possibility of the revenue being defrauded. But is there any guarantee that in spite of those precautions being taken the revenue will not be defrauded ? That is the only experience we have to guide us. I admit that the machine is an exceedingly ingenious one, and if it can do all that is claimed for it, without laying us under an undue liability to be defrauded, I have no objection to the use of it. In fact, I would gladly welcome the introduction of such a machine, but, with the knowledge I have, I am not satisfied that it will do all that is claimed for it. I was not satisfied when the Bill was last under consideration, nor am I satisfied now, that the Department will be placed in a better position. In fact, I am positive that it will be placed in a very much worse position. I am not complaining of any faults or defects in the present system. Only large insurance companies and big mercantile houses will use this machine. I am credibly informed that there are not above a few hundred of the machines in the whole of New Zealand at the present time. </para>

In view of the fact that a self-contained country like New Zealand, with a population almost equal to that of New South Wales, has  only  a few hundred of these machines in use, is it worth while for the Commonwealth to make a great flurry in order to suit the desires of an exceedingly limited number of persons who are fairly well served by the present method ? We are told, and I admit that there is soma force in the argument, that the use of this machine will remove the opportunities for peculation and fraud indulged in by the employe&#39;s of big firms, but I submit that it is no part of the duty of the Department to look after the morals of the  emplo&#233;s  of any one else. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that they should have been included in the Act. I hold that the Commonwealth, if it wanted to interfere, should have had the courage to deal with the question separately from that measure, and in a proper way. 1 hope that my honorable friend will not try to make me responsible for something with which I had nothing to do. The business of the Department is to carry letters and parcels, to transmit and deliver telegrams, and to provide the fullest possible facilities for those purposes. It is no part of its duty to try to give to private firms facilities which are not available to, or needed by, the great bulk of the people. Every employer should- be able to keep an easy supervision over his employes with regard to the number of stamps used. He knows the number of letters required to be posted in a day, and he can easily  issue the requisite number of stamps, and see that the letters are all properly stamped before they are taken to the post-office. The employers should not ask the Department to look after their employes. Again, I do not think that there is very much in the suggestion that the boys are always peculating. I believe that any of the big firms which are respectable employ decent boys. Such firms ought to pay decent wages. They should not try to sweat down the boys to a miserable living, and so tempt them to indulge in miserable peculations. I believe that if employes were treated fairly and well by their employers, we should &#39; hear little or nothing of petty peculation. At any rate, because of a little peculation which is alleged to go on in a very limited circle, are we to alter our post and telegraph system in order to leave the Department open, perhaps, to be defrauded in some way ? If any employers are being defrauded, it is their business to adopt methods to safeguard their interests, instead of trying to saddle the Commonwealth with a liability, in order that they may be protected against fraud. </para>

                    <para>. - The discussion on this proposed new section has been apparently confined c to the merits and demerits of a particular machine, which undoubtedly the Department has been trying. This is simply a provision to alter the law so that the Department, if it thinks fit, can use a stamping machine, or allow persons to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> had a great deal to say about the peculation of stamps. I admit that that has been one of the arguments used, but I think that a far more important argument in favour of the Bill is the fact that whatever mechanical device can be found to reduce the amount of labour and quicken the pace at which the stamping of letters can be done, should be utilized. I think that the Department should not be faced as it is now with an Act which says that, no matter what machine is- in existence which will do the work effectively, it must have adhesive stamps. Not only will the use of an automatic stamping machine quicken the work when it has to be done on a considerable scale, but it will .also largely reduce the amount of stamping which has to be done in the Department. I do not think that the general question as to whether a particular machine is good or safe, or reliable, need be discussed. &#39;The Department is simply asking that if it is satisfied that any machine will do the work required, it shall have the right to use that machine, or to allow persons to use it. If this power is granted it will be for the Department to thoroughly examine and test this particular machine. The evidence which was submitted here last session made me very chary about giving my assent to its adoption. If 1 thought now that the day this Bill was passed the machine would be used by the Department without better evidence as to its superiority being obtained, I believe that I should vote against its third reading. It was introduced by the late Government, and its Postmaster-General assured me that the machine was being tested very thoroughly. We have had a similar assurance from the present Government. If there are other&#39; machines of this kind in existence they will naturally be tested by the Department. It is not proposed to give to a particular make of machine a monopoly of the business. If better machines are invented, the Department will be free to use them. As the only question which arises in connexion with this provision is whether we should allow the Department, if satisfied with any form of recording machine, to use it, I shall vote for it. </para>

                    <para>. - The important question is whether the adoption of this machine will be mutually advantageous. There will be an advantage if the machine results in a saving to the Department j and if, on the other hand, it enables the clients of the Post and Telegraph Department to transact their business more readily, and to prevent peculation in stamps, I do not see why we should not suit their convenience in that way. But I am not satisfied with the documents that have been supplied to us. The letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward is not addressed to any one connected with the Commonwealth Government, but to the Secretary of the Automatic Stamp Machine Company. It is true that the letter states that the reports received from the chief postmasters of the districts in which the. machine has been used are favorable, and show&#39; that the machine is regarded as a great convenience. </para>

The reason is that, while it may be possible for an expert burglar to manipulate- the machine, the expert burglar is not the person who works it. Nor is the expert mechanic the person who will use the stamping machine in a large house of business. Probably there is nothing that human ingenuity can make which human ingenuity cannot defeat. But these machines will not be operated by experts who know how to defeat them. They will probably be operated by junior clerks. As to the possibility of fraud, I may also point out there that our present system is not free from it. Any philatelist will tell you in two minutes how stamps can be manipulated. The fact that such frauds are not often found out justifies me in saying that a good deal of fraud takes place. I hardly know of a mechanical device that would not be thrown out of use if such an argument were to prevail. There is a mechanical device used in connexion with the issue of railway tickets, and it is supposed to operate as a check on the number sold. I have no doubt that it is possible to cheat by that method. But that is no argument for not using it. This machine is no exception to the general rule. All that I can say for it is that it offers greater safeguards against&#39; fraud than are provided under the existing system. I am not representing that it is perfect, or that it would operate as a complete check against fraud; but I do say that the opportunities for fraud are less under it than under the present system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has referred to the dates of the reports which have been issued. He has expressed the wish that later information should be supplied. I took the same view when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> first introduced this Bill, and it was because I expressed it then that the later report of the  12th  June was obtained* though necessarily it is very brief. </para>

I regret that that was not done. But still, we have a considerable amount of information on the subject. The New Zealand officials have subjected the machine to severe tests, .and they have no doubt about the wisdom of adopting it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has referred to the fact that only a limited number &#39;of the machines have been used in New Zealand. As a matter of fact, however, the New Zealand Department has sanctioned the1 issue of  200  machines at each of the four large centres of the Dominion. </para>

                        <para>- I do not like to express an opinion on &#34; dodges &#34; ; but it is a fact that the Bill will, to a large extent, do away with the payment of commission on the sale of stamps; and it will also save the cost of printing stamps. I may 1101nt out one direction in which the adoption of the machine will be a convenience to a. public Department. At the present time, when a person sends a telegram, he pays his money, a stamp is handed to him over the counter, and he affixes&#39; the stamp to the paper. If this machine were adopted, instead of that process being gone through, the sender of the telegram would hand in his money with the telegram, which would be forthwith stamped by the stamping machine. In that direction the adoption of the machine would be of great advantage to the general public. </para>

                        <para>- No; in that particular it is unlike my honorable friend 1 It is a mistake to suppose that the machine will be of convenience only to large firms. I shall suggest to my colleague, the Postmaster-General, after this Bill is passed, that the machine be first installed at the larger post-offices, in order that the postal officials themselves may make themselves familiar with it. A splendid opportunity will thus be afforded for close official supervision. A question has been asked as to whether the Commonwealth Government will have a guarantee. Such is the case. In New Zealand the&#39; Government have accepted a guarantee from the company protecting them against fraud. There are one or two other methods in which guarantees could be given. There might be a substantial deposit with the Government, or there might be a bank guarantee. It hardly requires argument that if this Bill is passed the officials who are intrusted with business in connexion with it will see that all precautions are taken. The regulations have to be tabled in the Senate, and if any blunder is committed in the matter of the guarantee, or otherwise, every honorable senator will have an opportunity of introducing a motion. For these reasons, I ask the Committee not to hesitate to pass the Bill. The machine has been subjected to thorough official criticism, and such experts as we have are satisfied with it. We consider that the Government are amply safeguarded, and that the machine will tend to the convenience of the public. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;5.39&#93;. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has referred to the fact that probably large numbers of stamps which have , been cancelled are cleaned and re-used. That remark attracted my attention, because, a few years ago, I made a similar observation in the Senate. I forget who was Postmaster-General at the time, or what Ministry was in power - or, rather, in existence.  But I brought before the Senate substantial information, to the effect that cancelled stamps, to the face value of thousands of pounds, were sent from Australia to be doctored, and came back again ready to be used as perfectly good stamps. I made that statement here and called for action, and I was told that I was speaking on a matter I knew nothing about. I was given no encouragement to go further. The statement made by the Minister this afternoon goes to prove that what I said in this chamber years ago was substantially correct.

                        <para>- Then it is a machine the use of which ought to be abolished. Really, the eccentricities of the Post and Telegraph Department are so extraordinary that I feel justified in mentioning one of the latest which has come under my notice. In districts in which, for over a quarter of a century at least, letters have been delivered to persons at their own houses, a notice has been issued, over the signature of the </para>

                    Postmaster-General, to the effect that, if people do not provide letter-boxes for the reception of their correspondence, their letters will not be delivered, and they must apply for them at the local post-office. I have written to the Postmaster-General, to ask whether this notification has been issued with his knowledge or consent. I have suggested that it is a freak, and that really a process of letter delivery which has been continued for fifty, sixty, or seventy years should not be departed from, except under a regulation issued through the Governor-General in Council. I admit that this matter has no direct bearing upon the Bill, but I have ventured to mention it as evidence of the eccentricities that are afflicting the Department. Instead of endeavouring to make it an efficient public convenience, they appear to be chasing after all sorts of fads and nostrums, and I shrewdly suspect that this Bill deals with one of them. If, as the Minister declares, this recording machine has been in use in New Zealand for the last four years and no one has been shot before breakfast for using it, it may do no harm to give it a trial here. I hope that, if we carry this Bill, it will not be regarded as a premonitory symptom of the view we shall take of a voting machine which will secure the return of the fellow who is cleverest in manipulating appliances of the kind. I agree with the Minister&#39;s statement that, as a rule, these machines would be worked by innocent boys, who would not possess sufficient mechanical skill to. enable them to tamper with the apparatus, but surely the honorable senator has overlooked the fact that one who desired to manipulate one of these machines would give it, not to an innocent boy, fresh from school-;-- but to the cleverest mechanic he could find. The boy would not be able to doctor the machine, but the mechanic might. I do not think we can derive very much comfort from the suggestion that innocent youths will operate these machines. I suppose that we should give the machine a trial, and I shall support the Bill.

No opinion is expressed for or against them, but apparently they have given a certain amount of satisfaction to the Department, as the closing paragraph of the report states - </para>

                <para>It is a pity that more detailed information in regard to this innovation is not given in the report. If the use of these machines were to be confined to large public offices, telegraph offices, and so forth, there would not be so much objection to the measure as the Department would be able to discover whether it was possible to defraud the revenue by means of them. But I again insist that, if fraud is to be detected, the Department must exercise a continual check upon the correspondence of the people in whose places of business these machines are installed. That must involve considerable additional expenditure by the Department. For instance, a large commercial firm may send a bundle of trade circulars weighing one hundredweight to the post-office to be distributed. These are stamped with a machine. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Bill it is proposed that they may be stamped on the business premises of the firm issuing them. After being stamped they would be brought to the post office, and deposited there. If put into the post office one by one, each would have to be checked by the Department if fraud was to be detected. Under regulation, it might be provided that such circulars should be handed over in bulk to postal officials before being finally posted. There would not, in such a case, be so much difficulty in checking the postage upon them. I recognise that opposition to the Bill is futile. A majority of honorable senators seem to be in favour of it. I am always prepared to welcome progress if it can be made without very much risk, and therefore I am not much concerned whether the Bill passes or not. </para>

                    <para>. - The crux of the whole question is raised by this proposed section. We have to decide whether the power to extend the use of these machines is to be given to the company, or whether the Government are to take full responsibility in connexion with their use. There is great difference of opinion on this phase of the question in New Zealand. They are not satisfied there to allow a private firm to run these machines, whilst all responsibility in connexion with them is thrown upon the Government. In a letter dated  14th  July,  1908,  from the Secretary to the General Post Office, Wellington, to the Secretary Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, I find this paragraph at the close - </para>

                        <para>- If the introduction of the machine is going to result in a considerable saving and convenience to the Government, and if it will confer similar benefits upon those who use it, surely it cannot be urged that its cost ought to be allowed to stand in the way, because the continual savings effected, and the number of machines sent out, would be sure to reimburse the Government for their outlay. </para>

                        <para>- Only so far as the use of dies is concerned. In view of the experience of New Zealand, surely it is time we considered whether it is not desirable that the Government should take over this machine as a monopoly. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a firm from purchasing one of these machines from a company. The Government would then be prepared to license it, so long as it was of a pattern approved by them. </para>

During this debate we have heard a good deal about the possibility of fraud being practised against the Post and Telegraph Department. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said that the very fact that persons are not being constantly brought before the Courts for forging postage stamps is proof that forgery is going on. </para>

                        <para>- Is that evidence that fraud is being practised throughout the Commonwealth? It seems to me that the Government are fairly well protected by the use of adhesive stamps. Personally, I do not like the clause under consideration at. all. The power to issue permits to a company suggests to me the propriety of the Government taking over these machines as a monopoly. Certainly they could work them to much better advantage than can any private company. </para>

                        <para>- Any of the offences enumerated is tantamount to theft, and we do not usually punish theft by a fine. Sometimes a fine is imposed; but in nearly every instance the alternative is a term of imprisonment. I think that it is desirable to substitute a penalty of &#163;100, in lieu of &#163;50, and to provide an alternative in the form of imprisonment. </para>

                    <para>. -I  scarcely think that the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will meet either the requirements of the case or the idea which he has in mind. If it were adopted, the clause would then provide that any person guilty of any of the offences enumerated therein, should be liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding twelve months. That penalty can scarcely be prescribed in connexion with a summary conviction. I entirely sympathize with the object which the honorable senator has in view, because we must all recognise that the man who tampers with a recording machine can do so only for the purpose of committing a fraud. In these circumstances, I see no reason why there should not be a provision that in the event of his offence being sufficiently serious he should pay the penalty of ordinary offenders of that class. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> of course, does not want an amendment which will not accomplish his object, or which will compel a person to go to gaol without enjoying the right of trial by jury. If he will consent to withdraw his amendment and allow the proposed new section to pass as it is, I will ask the  Chairman  to report progress and get it recommitted to-morrow, with an amendment which I will havedrafted. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Minister who has promised to reconsider this provision will not forget that it provides a punishment for any person who is convicted of tampering with a machine. It covers the case of a person who tampers or meddles with a machine without any fraudulent intention. If a man tampers with a machine with the object of defrauding the revenue by interfering with the registration, under the ordinary law of the country he can be punished by way of imprisonment or fine. This provision seems to me to provide an extra penalty for minor offences in connexion with tampering or meddling with a machine. I think that it requires much more consideration than the Minister thought when he promised to have an amendment drafted to meet the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> wants to impose a very heavy penalty, not on a person who tampers with a machine, but on a person who wilfully obstructs an officer in the execution of any power granted in this part of the measure. Imprisonment is, I think, a somewhat serious penalty to impose. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. As regards tampering with a machine, I recognise that too high a penalty cannot be fixed, but there might be a serious difference of opinion as to whether a man wilfully obstructed an officer in the performance of his duty. It is a very serious matter to empower a Court to send a man to prison for six or twelve months. In the matter of the penalty, some difference should be made between the case of a man tampering with a machine and the case of a man wilfully obstructing an officer in the execution of his duty. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. A man may tamper with a machine when there is no officer to interfere with him. I recognise that it may be necessary to vest considerable power in an officer; but it should be surrounded with all possible safeguards. If, under this provision, an officer declared that he had been wilfully obstructed in the execution of his duty, and the person accused said that he had no such intention, there would be a chance of the latter being sent to prison. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the offence would have to be proved, but sympathy is, I think, always on the side of the officer, and&#39; perhaps rightly so too. As regards interfering with a machine or attempting to commit fraud, I am quite agreeable that very severe penalties should be fixed. Nor do I want to see an officer interfered with in the execution of his duty. If a man interferes with an officer, let him be fined in the sum of &#163;50 ; but it is a serious thing to send any man to prison for an offence of that kind. I shall be pleased if, upon reconsideration, the Minister can make a little discrimination between the offences set out in this proposed new section. I believe that it could be done without injuring any person or impairing the efficiency of the Bill. Before the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is withdrawn, I should like to know what he thinks about my suggestion. </para>

                    <para>This is a Bill for an Act to amend the Australian Industries Preservation Acts of 1906 and 1907. It will be remembered that the parent Act, which is the basis of what is known as our anti-trust legislation, and which was passed in the year 1906, was followed by an amending Act, passed in the year 1907, providing some additional effective machinery. The present Bill has for its object the amendment of those Acts, in order to make our legislation still more effective. Honorable senators will be aware that it has been the duty of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department and of the Department of Trade and Customs to make many investigations into what are variously known throughout the Commonwealth as combines, trusts, vends, or monopolies; and the result of the investigations made has shown that it is necessary that in some respects the machinery should be more direct and simple. </para>

                            <para>- There are legitimate combinations, some of which are not detrimental to the public interest; and the fusion to which my honorable friend refers is one of those which are beneficial. The Bill practically deals with two matters. First of all, it formally strikes out of our legislation the sections which were declared by the High Court to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> ; and it makes various consequential amendments in the law so far as those sections are concerned. It substitutes two new clauses which have for their object the further repression of monopolies. It will be remembered that several provisions of the original Act were challenged by an action which was instituted by Messrs. Huddart, Parker, and Co. against Moorehead, a Customs officer, who was the informant, testing the constitutionality of those Acts. Amongst other things, it was held by the majority of the High Court - that is to say, by the Chief Justice and by Justices Barton. O&#39;Connor, find Higgins - that the Australian Industries Preservation Act, in respect of sections 5 and 8, was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> By the first of those sections the Commonwealth Parliament enacted that . any foreign corporation or trading or financial corporation, which, either as principal or agent, entered into any contract or continued in any combination with intent to restrain trade within the Commonwealth or to injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry, should be guilty of an offence. It was held by the High Court that that enactment was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, who was one of the majority on the Bench, said that the principle, nature and character of the enactments contained in sections 5 and 8 of the Act did not constitute them a law with respect to corporations within the meaning of section 51, paragraph 20 of the&#34; Constitution; and he held that the sections were not within the legislative power of this Parliament. It will be remembered that section 51 of the Constitution gives the Parliament power to make laws &#34;for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth&#34; with respect to &#34;trade and commerce with other countries and among the States&#34; and by paragraph 20 Parliament has the same power with respect to &#34;foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth.&#34; The sections to which I have directed attention sought to regulate the trade of corporations within a State. We thought that we bad that power under paragraph 20 of sub-section 51 of the Constitution. But the High Court held that we had no such power, but that we had power only to legislate, in regard to trade and commerce with other countries and amongst the States so far as corporations were concerned. One portion of this Bill provides, therefore, for the elimination of those two sections from the principal legislation on this subject, and makes consequential alterations. The other important matter dealt with in the Bill has regard to rebates. In this connexion, I wish to draw attention to the provisions of the present law which have been found difficult and cumbrous to carry out, having regard to the intention of the original Acts of 1906 and 1907. Section 4 of the Act, 1906, provides that - </para>

That is the tenor and effect of the principal Act and of clause 5 of the present Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not attempt to deal with any particular combine at present. It is thought that by this simple process we shall be able to get at the nefarious practices that have been complained of. So far, we have had great difficulty in this direction. The people who indulge in these practices are skilled, by reason of their great experience, in evading the various features of the law, which consequently has, from time to time, to be made the subject of amending legislation for the purpose of meeting the practices which are resorted to. If, under present circumstances, a company or person has been carrying on the practice of giving rebates, they may not have gone so far as to enter into any contract, but there may be a certain verbal understanding. The greatest difficulty has been experienced in this respect. If, however, there is in existence a verbal understanding, this Bill provides for that verbal understanding to be proved. If, for instance, a customer goes to a seller and asks for a rebate, and the seller puts to him the question - &#34; Have you dealt with any one else ; are you prepared to make a declaration that you have dealt with no one else?&#34; - under those circumstances an offence under this measure has been committed ; and, that offence being proved, the offender would be liable to the penalty here provided for. Again, where goods are sold at a recognised price to certain individuals, and certain other individuals go to the seller and are refused at the ordinary selling price, an offence is committed. </para>

                            <para>- I think that I saw a record of a fine of something like ,&#163;350,000. There was also a fine amounting to &#163;5,000,000, which was not paid, but I believe that the &#163;350^000 was paid. At all events, legislation of this kind exercises a controlling influence. The Elkins Act of the United States was recently amended. The original Act was passed in 1903. The amending Act made some comprehensive changes. Amongst other things, it provided that anything done by a corporation, which if done bv an individual would be an offence, should be a misdemeanour. Any wilful failure to publish tariffs is also a misdemeanour under the Act. It further provides that for any person or corporation to offer, grant, give, or to solicit, or accept, or receive any rebate, concession, or discrimination in respect to the transportation of any property in Inter-State or foreign commerce is a misdemeanour, for which the offender is liable to a fine of $1,000 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> and a subsequent provision restores the punishment of imprisonment, which had previously been abolished in regard to this particular offence. I must, at the outset, admit that we are dealing with a subject of grave difficulty when we attempt to control trusts; but as they are in their infancy in the Commonwealth, I  contend that it is our duty by legislation to exercise as strong and powerful a controlling influence as we can over them. Nothing has been found more effective for the building up of trusts than the rebate system. We are directing our attention to that system. We know that it was by means of it that the gigantic Standard Oil Company managed to establish itself. It is at the root of the various monopolies that have become established, not only in America, but in the Old Country. We are endeavouring, so to speak, to nip in the bud this system of rebates which has been found so useful in the building up of trusts and combines elsewhere. I admit that if we fail to control these trusts by legislation, prompted from time to time by experience, there will be much strength in the contention that the last effective resort will be nationalization. I do not contend that that is the proper remedy to apply. </para>

The only reason why the word &#34;corporation&#34; was used in sections 5 and 8, where they are specially dealt with, was because it was thought that by the terms of paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution we were enabled to deal with the regulation of internal trade so far as corporations only were concerned. I desire to bring under the attention of honorable senators the very important report of the Royal Commission on Shipping Rings or Conferences recently issued by the British Government. It will be my duty to make some extended reference to it. But before I do so, I wish to make some explanation of a paragraph which appears at page 7 of the report - </para>

But, as is stated in the Board of Trade memorandum, the Government of the Commonwealth, on representations being made by the Colonial Office, undertook that in administering the Act, so far as shipping rings were concerned, they would bear in mind that a Royal Commission, including colonial representatives, had been appointed by the Imperial Government to inquire into the whole question. </para>

Oswald Sanderson, director of Earles Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Limited, Hull; director of the Hull  Steamshipping  and Ice Company Limited ;  Chairman  of Wilsons and North Eastern Railway Shipping Company, Hull ; and director of the United Shipping Company, Hull. The members of the Commission who signed the minority report were - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Miller Barbour, who_ has been a member of numerous Commissions. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Macdonell, Master of the Supreme Court. Robert Henry Muirhead Collins, representing Australia. Captain Collins represented Australia because Lord Jersey, who was asked to do so, could not spare the time. Henry Birchenough,  director of British South Africa Company and Imperial and Continental Gas Association. He has at various times been a member of many Boards and Committees ; and John Barry, Esq. The Royal Commission&#39; was directed to inquire into the operations of shipping rings or conferences, the latter being the more euphonious term by which rings .are designated in the Old Country. They were to go more especially into the system of deferred rebates and to report whether such operations have caused or were likely to cause injury to British or Colonial trade, and if so what remedial action if any should be taken by. legislation or otherwise. That is shortly the scope of the Commission&#39;s inquiries. The appointment of the Commission was the outcome of representations made on the part of South Africa by the High Commissioner. Honorable senators are aware that South Africa is dependent for its necessaries and supplies largely upon these shipping rings or conferences, the two great industries of the country being agriculture and mining. In the case of one it is necessary that they should find an output for their surplus products, and in the case of the other, they must secure transport for mining machinery and equipment. Unfortunately for South Africa the various lines of ships trading to South African ports were controlled or dominated by the London shipping conferences. </para>

                            <para>- Practically they were dominated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Currie. They had been subjected to the most despotic and arbitrary treatment, as I shall show honorable senators presently. Their treatment, indeed, had caused such an outcry that representations were made to the British Government to appoint this Commission. Now, in dealing with a report of this character it is important that we should have some little idea of the procedure which was followed in the conduct of the Commission. So far as I can gather, they did not examine witnesses upon oath. In fact, they say that what they did was to invite complaints from merchants and other shippers, to listen to any grievances which might be brought forward by other outside shippers, and, having tabulated these, to afford the shipping conferences an opportunity of replying to the complaints so made. Those who signed the majority report seem to have largely discounted a suggestion which was made to the effect that a large number of merchants and others were afraid to come forward and give evidence, because of the influence wielded by the conferences. This matter is dealt with very succinctly upon page 97 of the minority report, which says : - </para>

                        who gave evidence on behalf of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said, in his memorandum of evidence (paragraph 9) - &#34; . . Unquestionably there is difficulty in getting shippers to allow cases of their own to be quoted with names and particulars. This difficulty in itself illustrates how completely the shipping rings have succeeded in destroying fair bargaining between themselves and shippers. It is the completeness of the domination of the lines over those they deal with, and the dangers shippers therefore run if they put themselves in a position of active antagonism, which naturally make shippers most unwilling to come forward and give particular instances of the hardships they are experiencing.&#34;
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright,</inline>
                        who gave evidence on behalf of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, said - &#34; During the past few years the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce has received constant complaints from merchants and manufacturers with reference to the manner in which their trade was being affected by the operation of shipping rings. In most cases it has been impossible to obtain details, even on the promise of the strictest privacy, and this reserve on the part of traders can only be put down to the fear that the communication of details might conceivably lead to their being traced by shipowners and penalized in consequence.&#34;

                        also gave the following instance, both of the power of the rings and of the unwillingness of shippers to place themselves in opposition to them. &#34; Unquestionably, at the time of the Thompson-Houston opposition, I was informed by quite a respectable firm that they shipped by the Thompson-Houston line, and found that their South African agents and correspondents declined to take their goods, not only because they were threatened with being charged double the freight ; and, further, in order to get back they had not only to express their penitence, but to send a sum of money to a charity.&#34;

                    <para class="block">In regard to this matter, the following remark is made in the report of the majority :  - &#34;A suggestion was put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spens</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wright</inline> that important evidence of arbitrary abuse of their power by the Shipping Conferences was withheld from us owing to fear on the part of shippers that the giving of such evidence would lead to acts of retaliation by the shipowners concerned. This, however, we cannot believe.&#34; </para>
                    <para class="block">We can only say that the unwillingness of some shippers to appear in opposition to the rings seems to us to be beyond question. That this unwillingness is due to a fear whether reasonable or not of possible consequence is an inference as to the legitimacy of which each person can form his own opinion. </para>
                    <para>The remarks which we have just made illustrate one of the difficulties under which the Commission has conducted its inquiry. The members of the shipping rings have the same interests, and their organization is complete. On the other hand, the merchants, the persons more immediately affected by the action of the rings, are divided in their interests ; they may live far apart ; they can only combine with difficulty, and they are, at least in some cases, unwilling to appear in opposition to the rings. The producers and consumers, who are really the persons specially interested in the matter,  are only affected indirectly, and have even less power of combination. The inevitable result is to give the shipping rings an advantage in procuring and adducing evidence over those who are opposed to them. </para>

                            <para>- No. That document contains about 120 pages. I think it is well that honorable members should bear this fact in mind, in order that they may understand the manner in which the Commission was conducted, and also that they may realize that its investigations were not of so complete a character as might otherwise appear. I intend presently to deal very briefly with the majority and minority reports of the Commission. But before doing so I ask honorable senators to view this matter for a moment through British spectacles. If they do they will recognise that the system of conferences and rebates has been in force for a period of something like thirty years. It was first instituted in connexion with the Calcutta trade merely as a conference system. But difficulties were found by reason of certain contracts, which had been entered into by the larger shippers, so that two years later the system of rebates came into operation. It soon became the recognised system so far as shipping was concerned, and it has continued to be so regarded for the past twenty-five or twenty-eight years. The result has been that millions of pounds have been invested in the shipping industry, and it is alleged largely on the faith of what had become a recognised system. In dealing with the vast vested interests which have been so established, one can readily understand that the majority, especially, would stand aghast at any suggestion in favour of a drastic altertion. It is true that those who signed the majority report of this Commission could not but admit that these conferences obtained in respect of most of the outward trade from Great Britain. They had to recognise that monopolies had been established in that connexion, and that those monopolies had been guilty of the most arbitrary conduct. They also had to recognise that the system of granting rebates was essential to the carrying on of the transport trade along these various routes. But whilst that system obtains in regard to a large percentage of the shipping trade of the Mother Country, it does not obtain in respect of the homeward trade, the North Atlantic trade, and the coastal trade of Great Britain. It is important to bear that fact in mind. Outside of that particular trade, however, it is the recognised system of trading. Although the most definite evidence was given from time to time of the despotic conduct of these monopolies, and of the evils flowing from the system, neither the majority nor the minority reports of the Commission recommend that the system should be drastically put down. The majority suggested that it might be dealt with in this way ; that the shippers might combine, and, having combined, they would be in a position to deal with the shipping conferences. But that course is obviously open to the objection that, while the shipping companies are large bodies, and can be readily associated, the shippers themselves are spread over various ports. Consequently that suggestion must be limited so far as its application is concerned. The majority also suggested that some supervision might be exercised by the Board of Trade. They pointed out that where agreements were entered into between conferences and shippers, those agreements might be filed, that a system might be initiated under which the tariff rates might be filed and published, and that the power of inquiry should be vested in the Board of Trade, which might see its way to report to Parliament. Shortly put, that is the way in which the majority recommended that this acknowledged evil - this desperate monopoly - should be dealt with. Then the minority, in reporting, did not hesitate to denounce in the most scathing terms these combinations and trusts, together with the system of conferences and rebates. At the same time its members could not see their way to make any drastic suggestions for remedying the evil. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say what was stated in evidence, but I know that the subject was under the consideration of the Commission. The minority quite approve of the idea of shippers forming a combination, in order to make terms with the conferences, but they add that it is desirable that there should be some system of conciliation in this regard, and suggest that, no doubt, some business arrangement of a mutually satisfactory character would ultimately take place. They also suggest greater supervision by the Board of Trade and a wider scope for the purposes of inquiry. Honorable senators will see that although all the evils which we could possibly lay before Parliament are acknowledged to be incidental to this system and these trusts, yet these are the only suggestions for their remedy made in the report. The conditions of the Mother Country, where this system has obtained for a vast number of years, are very different from the conditions of Australia. In the Mother Country it has become a recognised system, and it is suggested that vast sums have been invested on the faith of its existence. In Australia the system of conference, accompanied by the system of rebate, is practically in its infancy. It is applied to one or two outward lines, from the United Kingdom to Australia, but, apart from that, it is only applicable to our coastal or domestic trade. The principle which was involved in the original legislation, and the principle which is sought to be carried out in this Bill would, I have no hesitation in saying, apply to the domestic ring or conference which exists,&#39; so far as Inter-State trade and oversea commerce are concerned. This report bristles with evidence of despotism and arbitrary conduct, on the part of this trust; it shows the natural development of this system, and nothing could be more conclusive than that our duty clearly is to nip the evil in the bud. If it is an evil, then we should drastically put it down at the outset, as far as we possibly can. The contrast between the conditions of the Mother Country and the conditions of Australia makes it imperative that we should take the more drastic course. </para>

                    <para class="block">South African Conference are referred to. Of course, it will only be possible for me to quote a few extracts. I ask honorable senators to listen to this quotation from page  72 - ^ By a letter of the 23rd May, 1907, to the Chairman of the South African Merchants&#39; Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Currie announced certain proposed new rates of freight. But the same letter also announced a reduction of the amount of the rebate from ten to five per cent. When the effect of the reduction of the rebate is taken into account, the net result is that while the rates on classes 2, 3, 4, and 5 to Durban and Delagoa  Bay, and on classes 3, 4, and 5 to East London were reduced, the rates on all classes to Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, and on classes 1 and 2 to East London were increased. That is to say that, although the merchants and Governments of South Africa have been for many years past asking for a percentage reduction of the tariff rates, the alterations which have been&#39; made actually increase the rates to certain of the ports. </para>
                    <para class="block">The report continues - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Further, it may be noticed as an instance of the autocratic spirit of the South African Conference, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Currie, in announcing the intention of the Conference to make the above reduction in the rebate percentage, stated (with reference to a resolution passed in South Africa in favour of the abolition of the system of deferred rebates) that he was glad the shipowners had been able to go half-way in meeting this proposal. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That is, I think, a magnificent piece of humour. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Currie was prepared to alter the rates. He reduced them as regards one port, increased them as regards another port, and, as they had suggested the abolition of the rebates, he said, &#34; I will meet you half-way by reducing the rebates from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent.&#34; This action caused alarm to the various Governments in South Africa. They called a Conference at Bloemfontein to take steps to counteract the effect of the change. According to the report - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>This Conference passed a resolution to the effect that &#34; the railway rates at present shall remain undisturbed, but rebates shall be granted in respect of the various ports affected, in such a manner as to maintain the, <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> which existed prior to the 1st July, 1907,&#34; an arrangement which, as explained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Mosenthal  and other witnesses, involved much trouble to men of business. No doubt the Conference lines were within their legal rights in acting as they did. </para>

                    <para>In other words, as State was put against State, and as all the railway freights were upset by reason of the alteration of the rates, the various Governments in South Africa were obliged to meet, and ultimately  to resort to the same process, for the purpose of counteracting the action of the shipping combines. </para>

But this procedure on their part disturbing a longstanding arrangement of great importance, not unnaturally appeared to be highly arbitrary. As SirH.  F.

                            <para>- There is, I think, another reference, where they state that there was a combination of shippers in Australia, but point out that it was a combination of some thirty shippers, and that by reason of the combination they were able to get some valuable concessions made to them. That, I submit, is a very small affair indeed compared with the gigantic matters which are dealt with in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>In the first place, we pointed out in Part 3 that a combination, formed and safeguarded by such a tic as the deferred rebate, necessarily created a certain kind of monopoly, but that, owing to the form of the Conference and the nature of competition in sea transport, this monopoly was under present conditions subject to certain important limitations.

It is possible that at some future time the system may assume a different character, and that in the shipping trade, as in other industries, there may be trusts or combinations calling for statutory regulation of a more drastic kind than that here proposed.

They effect their object by undercutting their competitors (if any) in freights until they have driven them away, and, further, by agreeing among themselves to charge the same rates of freight and to return a fixed percentage of all freight, after a certain lapse of time, to all &#34; loyal &#34; shippers, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> those shippers who have not shipped any goods by steamers not belonging to the ring. Matters are so arranged that the shipping companies always have a portion of the returnable freight in hand. Consequently, the shipper can never free himself from the ring, even if he can find a steamer not belonging to the ring which is willing to carry his goods, except by submitting to a sacrifice. Unless a very large shipper, he cannot charter an entire vessel. He cannot, as a rule, afford to lose his rebates; and so in this way he is permanently tied to the ring. Even if the rate of freight has been changed while the deferred rebate is in hand, the Conferences claim to retain it if their customer ships by an outside steamer. </para>

                        <para>I have signed the above report because I agree generally in the arguments brought forward in it, and in the conclusions drawn from them. At the same time, while I fully recognise the evils that might be caused by hasty and ill-considered action in a matter which is of national importance, I am unable to see that any practicable system of check would remove the evils to which the system of shipping rings, as at present constituted, gives rise. Apart from the fact that no system of check would affect some of these evils, such as the injury to that important section of British shipping which is composed of tramp steamers, I do not think that the gigantic system of monopolies established by the shipping rings could safely be recognised by the Legislature unless at the same time there were provided some means of check by an independent authority over rates of freight, and if any such provision were made there is little doubt that the ship-owners would prefer to abandon the whole system rather than have the rates which they are to charge to the public dictated to them by an outside authority. </para>
                        <para>If deferred rebates were made illegal, the shipping rings would probably cease to exist, and the system of monopolies would disappear, but I am told that satisfactory legislation to this end would be difficult. A more drastic, and probably more effective and simpler remedy would be legislation on the lines of the Sherman Act of the United States of America prohibiting combinations or associations of the nature of the shipping rings which had for their object the establishment of a monopoly in restraint of trade. I see no reason why such legislation must necessarily be of a general character. It would be sufficient for present purposes to limit it to shipping rings. </para>

                    <para class="block">I submit that this recommendation of the Commonwealth Commission is a sound and valuable one, so far as concerns Australian trade. The British Commission recognised that these monopolies have proved, from sorry experience, to be despotic and arbitrary in their terms. They are formed for the purpose of crushing competition, or making it completely feeble. On the other hand, they establish rates according to their own sweet will. These rates are usually on the highest scale, and they are not designed on philanthropic lines, but for the purpose of creating substantial profits. The unfortunate shipper cannot help himself. He is roped in, bound, and tied down. There is no. escape from his position. He cannot ship by any other vessel : or, if he ventures to do so, if he patronizes any free ship, it is at the risk of losing the payments which have been accumulating. Evidence was given before our own Commission that the Conference at times held something like  ^60,000  on account &#34;of rebates. That money is held at the disposal of the shipping companies. There is no power of legal resort for the purpose of recovering the money. I do not suggest that anything dishonorable has. up to the present occurred in regard to failure to comply with the under- </para>

But they do so simply as a matter of honour. The shipper has no legal rights in the matter. I submit, then, having regard to the evidence contained in the reports of the British Commission, and to the very conclusive recommendations made by our own Commission, that it is our duty to perfect our laws so far as we can, and to provide a direct and simple process for the purpose of putting an end to this system of rebates in the Australian trade.

                            <para>- With limitations, and there is a limitation not merely as to the area of operation, but also as to the occupation of the injured person. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will agree that so far as the existing law, State or otherwise, provides for compensation for seamen, it is not such a law as can be regarded as satisfactory. I hope by means of this Bill to introduce a. law which will remove many of the difficulties under which our seamen labour, and which will at any rate have the great advantage of introducing along the coast line of Australia, and throughout Australian registered ships, a uniform law which I believe to be founded both on humanitarian considerations and economic principles. Until within a few years past, legislation of this class advanced very slowly, very timidly, and I think inefficiently., It is comparatively only a few years ago since a complete change was brought about in the view taken as to the principle on which Bills providing for compensation for injuries should be founded. Great Britain, as recently as 1906, extended her Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act to seamen. Certain continental countries had preceded Great Britain in this desirable legislation. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Holland, and <inline font-style="italic">Denmark,</inline> had all made some provision for seamen ; the most complete being made by Germany, whilst Holland and Denmark confined the benefits of their legislation to those engaged in the local fishing trade. Up to the year mentioned, Great Britain made no provision for her seamen except in the Merchant Shipping Act. Although she had attempted to deal with workmen on land under a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, her law in that respect up to the year 1897 might almost have been said to be a snare and a delusion. Prior to the passage of the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act of 1897, the conception of justice as represented by the law prevailing in England was that the risk incidental to an occupation should be borne by the workmen ; the employer being held liable only for risks consequent upon his own personal negligence. Although in practice the workman was truly bound to carry the risk of his position, and in theory the employer had to carry the risk of his own negligence, it was found more often than not - owing to the difficulty of giving effect to the law and of furnishing proof - that the employer was able to escape the obligation and the responsibility which a true reading of the law threw upon him. </para>

                                has just anticipated me. The common law made the employer liable for injury to his workmen only where the injury was consequent upon the personal negligence of the employer. That meant that where the injury to one workman had been caused by the negligence of another, although that other might be in the position of a superintendent or overseer, as the agent qf the employer, and the man injured might be bound to obey his orders, the employer was able to avoid the liability which, under this Bill, it is now sought clearly to attach to him. The doctrine of common employment referred to by
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline>
                                was really a doctrine that a workman engaging himself with an employer was supposed to understand and assume the risks incidental to his occupation, and, further, to know the efficiency and steadiness of his fellow employes. It assumed that, knowing the risks of his occupation, and knowing, or being supposed to know, the steadiness and efficiency of his fellow workmen, he contracted to carry the risks. There was still another pitfall in the way of the injured workman seeking to recover compensation. It was created by what was known as the doctrine of contributory negligence. I can briefly dismiss the effect&#39; of that doctrine by saying that, if it could be shown that an accident to a workman was due to the extent of ninety-nine per cent, to the negligence of his employer, and to the extent of only one per cent, to the negligence of the workman himself, the workman was nonsuited every time.

But may I say, without desiring to offend the honorable senator, that nothing is more charming in its arrogance than the assumption of our honorable friends opposite that all good things commence and end with them. One other difficulty which confronted the- workman was that, if there happened to be any defect in machinery or building, as the result of which an accident happened to him, although the defect might have been in violation of some existing law, and although the employer might know of it, still, if it could be shown that the workman also knew of it, he lost his claim to compensation. A writer in a recent issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Atlantic Monthly,</inline> referring to this aspect of the case, says - </para>

                    <para class="block">That being the case, it will easily be understood that the law, as it existed, did not offer much substantial satisfaction to injured workman. A comparatively recent judgment in a case of this kind, by Lord Brampton, summarizes the position as it existed up to the time at which the judgment was delivered. I propose to quote it as showing the opinion of this eminent lawyer as to what the law really meant, so far as the workman was concerned, up to the time of the delivery of the judgment in 1902. Speaking of the position existing prior to the passage of the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, his Lordship said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In the first place, there was no available process known to the law by which such redress could be recovered, except by action at law, or by proceeding under the Employers&#39; Liability Acts; but no such action or proceeding could be successful unless the workman was in a condition to prove, by legal evidence, that his injury was due to actionable negligence or other misconduct or default of the person from whom he sought to recover, or some other person or persons for whose negligence he was responsible. Compensation without proof of such negligence was unheard of, and such proof was often hard to discover. Moreover, it was often extremely difficult, even when the facts were ascertained, to determine who was the person liable to be sued in the action, and to avoid such difficulties many persons were often made defendants in actions who were under no legal liability. Added to these obstacles, the law itself was for the most part too uncertain, too dilatory, and far too expensive &#39;for an ordinary workman to embark in. Having regard to this unsatisfactory state of things, it was, as I have gathered from a study of the Act, felt by the Legislature that it would be but just and right to confer upon a large class of workmen, whose necessities compelled them to seek employment in certain specified dangerous occupations, in the course of which accidents, not always possible to be guarded against are of frequent occurrence, some partly casual, others no doubt attributable to negligence or default of fellow workmen, whom it would be idle to sue, or others whose identity could not be established, a right to claim compensation to a moderate and limited amount in respect of the loss of such wages as they were incapacitated from earning in consequence of accidental injury, upon mere proof of the accident and its resulting loss, irrespective of its cause. Another object was to impose the obligation of providing such statutory compensation upon those to whom good sense would naturally point as the fittest persons to&#39; bear it, and to define for the convenience of injured workmen seeking compensation the persons from whom they are entitled to claim it. And, further, to provide a simple proceeding entailing comparatively trifling expense by which such compensation might, if necessary, be enforced. To carry out these very laudable objects the Act of 1897 was passed. </para>

                    <para class="block">That was the statement made after the passing of the Act of 1897, and before the Imperial Parliament had amended it by the Act of 1906. As that judgment shows, the scope of previous Acts was limited to certain specified trades which were called &#34;dangerous.&#34; But the later Imperial Act was extended to practically all trades in Great Britain, including that of seamen. It also made other very important amendments, the effect of which was to render it more definite and speedy in its operation. </para>

                            <para>- No; all the States have an Act of that kind in operation. But I am speaking of the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, which is quite distinct in its underlying principle from the Employers&#39; Liability Act. So far as New South Wales is concerned, I regret to say that there legislation of this character is extremely defective. In that State, it is true, seamen are covered by the Employers&#39; Liability Act, but the Act applies only to seamen working in port or within a limited distance thereof. To that extent its usefulness is very limited, and I am not aware that any great advantage has been taken of it. Following upon the Act passed in Great Britain in 1897 a Commission was appointed for the purpose of inquiring into its working, also to ascertain how far it might be advisable to extend its operation, and especially whether its operation ought to be extended to seamen. I have turned to that Commission, as one would naturally do who wishes to make himself familiar with the last word upon the subject to date. I find that the Commission finally reduced the subject matters of its inquiry to a series of questions, some of which I should like to read. The first question which the Commission set itself to answer reads - </para>

                        <para>Turning now to the question whether the Compensation Acts of 1897 and 1900 have conferred substantial benefits on those classes of workmen who are in a position to take advantage of them, we think that the general answer must be decidedly in the affirmative. Previous to the coming into operation of these Acts it is no exaggeration to say that the whole burden of the loss occasioned by industrial accidents fell upon the workmen, subject to the numerous exceptions where the burden was alleviated by the generosity of the employer, either by help afforded immediately to the injured workman, or by contribution to sick or accident funds. ... It seems right and necessary to make by law systematic provision for relief from the consequences of industrial accidents. In this way alone can some degree of uniformity be obtained, and workers in the industries within the law of compensation and those dependent on them, have reasonable security for obtaining substantial relief from the consequences of industrial accident, and that, in the great majority of cases, without litigation,  delay,  or expense. </para>

                        <para>The formation of new associations of employers belonging to particular industries, to deal with cases arising under the Act or the adaptation of associations previously existing for that purpose, has already been referred to at considerable length. A natural consequence has been that it has become a general practice  for  all claims for compensation on behalf of any member of a trades union to be dealt with by the secretary to the union. The trades union official enters into communication with the secretary or other official of the Employers&#39; Association. As has already been seen in dealing with the question of litigation, the result is that in the great majority of cases there is no dispute either as to liability or amount; in some cases where there is some dispute at first the questions are settled between the officials; in a comparatively small number the assistance of a solicitor is called in, and the case is settled after some correspondence, and, of course, at some cost. In a very small minority it becomes necessary to have recourse to the County Court, and of this last class again, a small number raise questions of difficulty which are carried to the Court of Appeal, and in some cases, in English (not Scotch) cases, to the House of Lords. </para>
                        <para>The evidence leaves on our minds the impression that it is where the organization of the associations, both of employers and workmen, is most complete that there is the least amount of litigation and the greatest satisfaction with the settlements reached. </para>
                        <para>Far greater difficulties appear to arise where there is no trade organization. The workman who has no organization to resort to for advice and assistance in such matters is comparatively helpless, or has to call in legal assistance. Costs are at once incurred, and the dangers above pointed out attending litigation are much more likely to occur. </para>

From those questions and answers, and from their exhaustive inquiry, it is possible to form only one impression, namely, that so far as the workman is concerned, these Acts have not produced litigation, that their operation has been distinctly beneficial to him, and particularly so where he has been able to operate through his organization. That is just what we might have been led to expect from our experience in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the honorable senator interjected whilst I was speaking. To my mind, this Bill opens up a vista of very important legislation, of  which I regard it merely as a steppingstone. I was pointing out when I was interrupted that there were three questions which the Commission answered distinctly in favour of this Bill. The fourth question dealt with the extent of -the financial responsibility which will be thrown upon the shipping industry. It will be noticed that the reply given to it was to the effect that so far that burden has not been great, but that there was a tendency for it to grow. That must be obvious to all, because when a scheme is introduced, there will naturally be during the first year of its operation only a limited number who will obtain compensation under it. But each year that number will grow until a stage is reached at which the beneficiaries who pass away will equal in number those who are coming under its provisions. That stage has not yet been reached in Great Britain, but it is being reached in New Zealand. There the amount of &#34; new business,&#34; if I may use an insurance term, balances the expiring business. </para>

Liability is imposed, upon the employer who is blameless, equally with him who has been guilty of negligence.

                    <para class="block">Obviously that is a convenient provision to have in a Bill of this kind. The object, of course, will not be to delay the bringing of the Act into operation, but as there will be some regulations to be prepared, and other matters to be attended to, it is certainly desirable that the measure should contain a provision for expediting, or, if necessary, slightly delaying the time when it shall become active law. As regards clause 3, which deals with definitions, I propose only to refer to the meaning of the term &#34; dependants. &#39; &#39; I specially invite the attention of the Senate to the definition, because in the majority of cases the dependants will be the claimants for compensation. The definition reads in this way -  &#34; Dependants&#34; means such of the members of the seaman&#39;s family as were wholly or in part dependent upon the earnings of the seaman at the time of his death, or who would, but for the incapacity due to the accident, have been so dependent. </para>

It will be seen at once that the former includes not merely those vessels which go from one State to another State, but also those vessels which ply between two ports in the same State. Clause  5  excludes from the operation of the Act a seaman whose earnings exceed <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per week, and a seaman sharing the profits or earnings of a fishing vessel. With regard to the second class of exemptions, it will be obvious, I think, to honorable senators that where men go out as mates in a venture, it would be hardly fair or reasonable that any one of them should be called upon to stand the loss consequent upon an injury to one. They all go out as partners in the concern, and, of course, have to share a joint responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- This clause will not shut out a whaler who is getting wages plus a share in the profits of the voyage. He will still be an employe. I am referring entirely to a group of fishermen who simply join together for the purpose of a fishing voyage. It may be undertaken in a rented vessel, or in a vessel belonging to one of them; but they all go out as members of a co-operative concern for the purposes of the trip. The reason for exempting a seaman whose earnings exceed &#163;5 per week may not be quite so obvious as the reason for exempting the other class. It is known that any one remunerated <inline font-style="italic">st</inline> that rate can obtain far higher benefits under a separate policy than he could do if grouped with a number of seamen obtaining less wages. In other words, under this Bill, if a man is killed, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;400</inline> is the limit of compensation. It is not desirable, or, perhaps, practicable, to include in an aver-i age policy covering a group of men one whose salary ranges from  ^5  upwards. </para>

                            <para>- No, he is shut out. The scale of compensation is set out in the first schedule to the Bill. As the hour is getting late, I do not propose to do more than to state that in case of death the compensation payable is to be at the rate of the wages earned during the three years preceding the date of the injury causing the death, or the sum of  .&#163;200,  whichever is the larger, but not in any case to exceed  ,&#163;400.  Practically the limit of  ,&#163;400  runs through all the clauses dealing with compensation. In the case of personal injuries, the1 compensation payable under the schedule may amount to  50  per cent, of the wages earned during the preceding three years. In that case also there is a limit of  ^400,  but in lieu of paying a weekly sum provision is made for the payment of a lump sum. It is desirable for honorable senators to note that where an agreement is arrived at for that purpose, it is to be done under official supervision. As a safeguard to the seaman himself it is provided that the agreement he makes for receiving a lump sum shall not be recognised unless it has been officially approved. There is a proceeding provided for by which almost judicial authority is required before the agreement can be given effect to. </para>

                            <para>- It is thirty-three per cent, higher. However, honorable senators will see at once that these matters of compensation are mere details. At the same time it is always necessary to bear in mind that, however beneficial we may make a measure to one set, we must be careful to see that no undue burden is thrown upon another set. Clause 6 provides that an employer shall not be liable for any compensation unless the disablement renders the injured seaman incapable for one week, and the compensation is not to be recoverable independently of this Act. That is a necessary provision, because there are three or four Acts under which such a claim could be made. </para>

                            <para>- The provision is that, if the incapacity lasts less than two weeks, no compensation will be payable in respect to the first week. Another provision says that compensation shall not be recoverable under this Act, and also under any other Act. There are several Acts under which a workman can proceed for compensation. For instance, he can proceed at common law, under the Employers&#39; Liability Act, under various State Acts, and in certain cases, I think, even under the Merchant Shipping Act. But this Bill contains a stipulation, founded upon common sense and equity I think, that if a man proceeds under any other Act and obtains compensation, he shall be barred from applying under this Act, and, of course, <inline font-style="italic">vice versa*.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Yes, but he cannot hope to get compensation under two or more Acts. I wish to call attention to another provision. In this Bill the object has been to shut out as far as possible that sometimes useful but frequently maligned fraternity to which my honorable and learned friend belongs, and to substitute a simple inexpensive form of procedure. At the same time it was necessary to keep as a controlling authority those upon whose integrity and judgment ample reliance can be placed. Therefore, provision has been made in certain circumstances for arbitration to be resorted to. I do not propose to refer to the circumstances, but merely to invite honorable senators to note that an effort is made here to introduce the principle of arbitration under Court supervision. Clause 7 sets out the time within which notice of claim must be given, and the following clause - a very important&#39; one - forbids any seaman or employer from contracting out unless the Comptroller-General is satisfied that the benefits offered by the employer&#39;s scheme, which may be, of course, an insurance scheme, limited to his own workmen or firm, are greater than, or as great as, those offered by the Act. Where these schemes involve the payment by the workmen of any premium, the benefits conferred by this measure will still be received by the workmen, plus the benefits for which they have paid. Clause  10  makes provision for the case of the insolvency of the employer. It is provided that where an employer becomes insolvent, if he has previously insured his workmen the rights attaching to the policy of insurance pass to the workmen ; and in the event of the liability of the insurance companies being less than the liability of the employer to the seamen, the seamen may prove for the balance in the bankruptcy or liquidation. </para>

                            <para>- I have now hurriedly run through what appear to me to be the main principles of the Bill. &#34; I have not ventured to _ deal with all of the clauses, but I think that I have covered the principal ones. The real underlying principle of the Bill is that the shipping industry shall make some provision for its killed and maimed workers without any regard to the causes leading up to the fatality or injury. It has been well said by a writer to whom I have previously referred, that the industry must replace a ruined engine, and therefore there is no reason why it should not replace the ruined engineer- and from the same source. With regard to this occupation I find from data collected that of the accidents happening half are regarded as incidental to the business.: three- tenths of them are due to the faults of workmen, though not necessarily of the workmen injured ; and most of the remainder are due to the faults of the employer. I am reminded by the presence of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> of a claim which may not unreasonably be put forward on behalf of compulsory insurance. I have not a word to say against the principle of compulsory insurance. In fact, I present this Bill as representing compulsory insurance, the compulsion being placed upon the employers to pay the premiums. </para>

                            <para>- Turning now to the question of the possible obligations thrown upon the industry, I have had the greatest difficulty in ascertaining the rates of insurance for seamen. That difficulty is due largely to the fact that Compensation Acts applying to seamen are quite new. They have been in operation in Great Britain only since 1906, and in Queensland for about the same period. The result is that the insurance companies have not had a sufficiently long experience to be able to give me quotations of rates at which they would be prepared to write business. But proceeding with what I admit at once to be a rather indefinite inquiry, I have ascertained these particulars. The Accident Insurance Company of London, in giving evidence before the Commission to which I have referred, stated that the rates ran from as low as 2s. per ^100 of wages to 25s. There was no indication as to the particular industries to which those rates applied. The General Accident Insurance Company, Perth Office, Great Britain, quoted 3s. 6d. for operatives in the woollen industry up to 60s. for stevedores. The </para>

                            <para>- Bearing in mind the figures I have read as applying to other industries, that rate appears to be high; but we have to remember that insurance offices, in exploiting new regions, would necessarily have to keep on the safe side until they found from experience that they could reduce their rates. I have not the slightest doubt that if private insurance companies could write business of this description for 35s. per cent., it would not be very long before the owners, by means of their association, would, be able to do their own insurance at lower rates than they would have to pay to private companies, which necessarily expect to make some profit. Applying those figures to the shipping industry, arid endeavouring to ascertain the extent to which this measure would entail added obligations upon it, I have been confronted with a similar difficulty in ascertaining the number of persons employed, the wages they receive, and&#39; the capital value of the industry itself. My figures must, therefore, be accepted as estimates. I find, working in that way, that the number of seamen, as given by one authority, is as high as 15,000. But I consider that that estimate is altogether toohigh. </para>

                            <para>- No; these figures are supposed to relate to Australian ships trading on the Australian coast, and Australian&#34; ships trading between Australian ports and other countries. I always think that it is better to look squarely at any difficulties that present themselves, rather than try to dodge round them. So far as  1  can see, although one authority puts the figure as high as 15,000, the best authorities lead one to believe that 10,000 represents about the number of Australian seamen who would be affected by this Bill. When I endeavour to ascertain the wages which they receive, I am again compelled to make a&#39;n estimate. I lune assumed for the purpose of my calculation that &#163;100 - taking the average all round - would be the wage paid to each of these 10,000 seamen per annum. Some of them receive more ; a good many of them employed on sailing vessels, and the younger hands on steamers, would receive less. But, taking &#163;100 per annum as a fair average, it will be seen that, on that basis, the payment made to j 0,000 seamen per annum in wages amounts to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> 000,000. Taking 35s. per cent, as the premium, there would be paid to the insurance companies, for insuring these men under this measure, &#163;17,500 per annum. That represents .17 per cent, upon a capital of &#163;10,000,000; which is the amount given by the Statistician as the capital invested in the shipping industry of Australia. I want to make plain what 17 per cent, means. It means a seventeen one-hundredth part; that is less than one-fifth - about one-sixth of &#163;1, or 3s.  4d.  for every &#163;100 of capital invested in the shipping industry. I have taken liberal figures for the express purpose of showing that the obligation thrown upon the shipping industry would not be a very serious or onerous obligation in the event of this Bill becoming law. As a matter of fact, I think it would be less than the amount I have stated. But, so far as I can see. the figures I have given represent the maximum. </para>

                            <para>- I may say at once that I have not consulted those concerned in the industry. I believe the Bill to be justifiable in itself,, and founded upon a sound principle. At the same time, I consider that there is an obligation upon every one of us to see what the effect is going to be so far as we can, humanly speaking, do so. But whilst the companies will increase their obligation and incur liabilities to the extent I have stated, I may point out that already some of our shipping firms, including one or two of our biggest companies, are assured. They are members of an association which has its head-quarters at Liverpool. They pay on a tonnage rate to that association, which relieves them of every claim for compensation or damages which may be sustained against them. So that these companies would not have to incur any additional expenditure by reason of the passage of this Bill. But, whether they do or not, I should like to say that I do not think that we could select a more opportune time for the passing of a Bill of this character than the present. So far as I know, the shipping industry is flourishing. It cannot be contended that any little additional impost of this kind will affect seriously the present or the future of the industry. It is as well able to sustain this obligation as any industry in Australia. For that reason, and also because I believe this to be a just and humane law; because I believe that it will bring some measure of relief to the widow stricken with grief at the news of the injury or death of a bread1- winner ; and because I believe it to be a sound, just, and economic measure, I confidently submit it to the Senate in the belief that it will be speedily passed into law. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, that estimate would cover maintenance. I feel sure that the Senate will be thoroughly sympathetic in its attitude towards the Bill. In that belief, I cordially invite honorable senators to join with me in making the measure as perfect as we can possibly make it. It mav not be possible to accept all the amendments which are proposed ; but, so far as I am concerned, I have but one object in introducing the Bill, and that is to make it as complete and perfect, and as smoothly working, a piece of legislation as it can be made for the carrying out of the objects which it embodies. </para>

                    <para>. - In common with other honorable senators on this side, I took no part in the recent debate on the Government policy. We had no desire to do so, but the charge has been made publicly in the newspapers, and in speeches delivered by supporters of the Government, that members of the Labour party desired to hang up the business of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> referring to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> said that there had been eleven speakers on the Government side in the debate, and eight speakers on the Opposition side ; that the Government supporters had occupied only five hours as against eleven hours occupied by the eight speakers on the Opposition side; and that a total of sixteen hours had been occupied in the debate. </para>

                        <para>- We need not trouble about their votes. Eleven honorable senators on the other side occupied in the debate referred to 10 hours and  33  minutes, whilst the eight honorable senators who spoke from the. Opposition side occupied  5  hours and 27 minutes - a total of 16 hours. If the time occupied by Senators Symon and Clemons be deducted from the time occupied by the whole of the speakers on the other side, it will be found that nine honorable senators on the other side occupied as much time as did eight honorable senators who spoke from this side. </para>

If there is a third party in the Senate, the Government must not hold the Opposition responsible for what the members of that party do, and they must not, because of what may be done by the members of that party, publicly announce throughout Australia that the Opposition are obstructing the business of the country. I believe the figures I have given are correct, though, of course, every man is liable to make a mistake, and my object in submitting them was to correct the public misrepresentation of honorable senators on this side. </para>

This, in comparison with the number of applications received in the other States, is a low number, but the further statement is made in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> that, of the 1,057 applications, only eighteen have been granted. </para>

It will be possible to supply only rough proofs of those speeches. Ministers have expressed their willingness that honorable senators should be supplied with those proofs, and already instructions have been given to have them sent to honorable senators. </para>
