                        <para>. - When I listened to the very lengthy, and certainly irrelevant, speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> I wondered whether I could have read aright the dictum of his leader in another place, namely, t&#39;&#34;at th&#39;s measure was to be dealt with apart from party considerations. It appears to me that the system of party government has obtained such a hold of public men in every Legislature that, though they may assert that a question is to be considered free from party, it is absolutely impossible for them to give effect to that laudable intention. No sooner had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> said that this question was to be decided apart from party considerations, than he proceeded to accuse the &#34;Prime Minister of having acted at the Premiers&#39; Conference more as the guardian of the States than as the protector of the Federation. He went on to assert his opinion that the Prime Minister did not act at the Conference as he should have done : and wound up by saying that the agreement had been framed partially, if not wholly, from the point of view of political interest, and no: for the advantage of the Federation. </para>

Let us see what the manifesto says. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> was the  chairman  of the finance committee.

                        <para>That those three propositions accurately described the scheme could be seen, it is asserted, by any unbiased person who reads the official report of the debate at the Brisbane Conference. As to the other point in dispute, whether it should be a constitutional amendment or otherwise, it could be fairly pointed out that this was the only way in which the States could be given even a semblance of security. Of course, even a constitutional amendment could not be made absolutely permanent - </para>

                    <para class="block">It was taken for granted at the Labour Conference that the agreement was to be permanent. No one used the word &#34; permanent &#34; or &#34; limited,&#34; but it was taken for granted that in substitution for the Braddon provision a clause would be agreed to giving the States one-half instead of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. Is not that a commonsense interpretation? It rests with my honorable friends opposite to show that there was a limit expressed or implied. The word &#34; limited &#34; was not used.

                        <para>Of course, even a constitutional amendment could not be made absolutely permanent, because it would be just as easy to alter the Constitution to introduce a new scheme, as it would be to alter it to introduce the Brisbane conference scheme, but the fact that it was in the Constitution would prevent the States solvency being attacked in a hasty manner by a chance authority in the Federal Parliament. </para>

He had carefully scrutinized Commonwealth expenditure, and admitted that the amount set down would not do all he would like it to do; but, on the other hand, to take even what they were asking would possibly be a bit of a wrench for the States. It would mean about .&#163;2,750,000 a year less than they had formerly received, although it was offset somewhat by the States not having to pay for old-age pensions. ... It was not necessary to confuse the question of State debts with that of payment by the Commonwealth to the State Treasurers. The State debts question should stand by itself. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite are not opposing the amount, because they could not possibly do so. But they are &#39;opposing every principle upon which that amount was fixed in their own scheme. All the other propositions of the present agreement are very much like those of the Brisbane proposal. I find that at the Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamond</inline> said -  </para>

                        <para>Seeing that it is impossible to dissociate the finances of the Commonwealth and the States, he believed that the scheme submitted was the only one that gave freedom to the Federal Parliament and security to the Stale Parliaments. Do honorable senators opposite believe in freedom for a limited time, and in security to the States with a time limit ? Are they not aware that the time limit of ten years attaching to the operation of the Braddon section was continually hanging over the State Treasurers? Is it not a fact that no State Treasurer can now frame his Budget until he learns from the Federal Treasurer what is coming to him from the Commonwealth? Will honorable senators opposite contend that a similar limited provision was meant by this reference I have quoted to &#34; freedom to the Federal Parliament and security to the State Parliaments&#34;? Will they say that what was meant by security to the States was a provision which might be altered in a few years, and which would perpetuate the uncertainty of the Braddon section? The thing is unthinkable, and I am quite at a loss to understand how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> could have made up his mind to depart from the scheme agreed upon by his own party at Brisbane. The word &#34; permanent &#34; is not used in the statement of the Brisbane Conference scheme, because it was taken for granted by those who framed it that it was to go into the Constitution, and that the Braddon section was to come out. That is implied in every line of it. Let honorable senators listen to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> had to say - </para>
                        <para>They had, of course, to be ready for any eventualities that might arise. At the same time, he believed it was much better than any other scheme that had been put forward. </para>

Every one of the members of the Labour party is now engaged in trying to keep back from the people the best scheme that has ever seen daylight, according to themselves.

                            <para>- The honorable senator said something about indirect taxation. But I think we have heard enough on that subject from him to last for a long time. What did the honorable senator mean when he seconded a motion that the Braddon &#34; blot&#34; should be abolished, if it was not that something else was to take its place in the shape of the Brisbane scheme. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that. But the honorable senator said that the Braddon section should be abolished and that something should be substituted for it. Where was the logic in proposing the abolition of the Braddon section which was the one security which the States held over their most important source of revenue after they had handed it over to the Commonwealth, if what was to be substituted for it was not to be embodied in the Constitution, but in an Act of Parliament which might be altered in the next session? I assert, without fear of contradiction, that no honorable senator opposite who attended that Conference had any such idea in his head. None of them dreamt of removing from the Constitution one of its most important sections, affecting &#163;10,000,000 or&#163;12,000,000 of revenue and of substituting for it some other arrangement which was not to be put into the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>After five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs the Parliament may provide on such basis as it deems fair for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. That is to say, that after the expiration of the Braddon section it is the duty of this Parliament to distribute all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth upon such a basis as it deems to be fair. What steps have been taken in order to discover a basis which would be fair? The Premiers held several Conferences, and at none of them could they agree. At none of them could they formulate any scheme comparable to this one. When the last Conference assembled here, in August, while I thought a number of its members would be in agreement, I assumed that there would be some disagreement. The Premiers, while the Conference was sitting, invited the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to be present. That was the first step taken by both sides to arrange for the distribution of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth on a basis that would be fair. Do honorable senators opposite contend that one party, without thinking of the other and its requirements and necessities, should have framed a scheme and insisted upon its adoption? Fortunately, both parties recognised the first elements of fairness by meeting together to discuss the whole thing. Yet we find that members of the Labour party, for purely party purposes, have done nothing but abuse the Conference. </para>

                            <para>- The members of that Conference were- discussing figures, and all sorts of things, and how was it possible for them to supply a report before they had arrived at an agreement? To cali the Premiers&#39; Conference a secret caucus seems to me to be calling black white. In order to do what was fair the representatives of the States and of the Commonwealth met to consider the requirements of each other. Although the Premier of Tasmania asked that the Commonwealth should return to the States 31s. 3d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> he eventually agreed to accept 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> Personally, I think that the States should receive 3s. per head more. Every State of the group, even the rich State of New South Wales, will be compelled to impose fresh taxation because the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> which it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall return to them will not be sufficient to enable them to carry on the government of the country. Consequently, I hold that the States should be guaranteed the return of -a larger sum <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> I come now to the speech which was delivered yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> As I understand, the arguments of the opponents of this Bill, four objections are urged to the proposed agreement, namely, 1, that under it the powers of the Commonwealth will be surrendered ; 2, that it does not provide for the taking over of the State debts ; 3, that it strikes a blow at the Protective policy of the Commonwealth, and 4, that it does not contain a time limit. In regard to the first objection, I think that the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was quite unworthy of him. It came as a great disappointment to me, and, indeed, to everybody who listened to it with an unprejudiced mind. Every word of that speech was the word of a clever advocate, and I fail to see that the honorable senator exercised the great gifts of statesmanship with which he has been endowed. </para>

                            <para>- In the first place <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> congratulated the Vice-President of the Executive Council upon his very admirable .speech in moving the . second reading of this Bill. It was an admirable speech, and when I say that, I mean it. But I rather doubt whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> meant it, because, immediately afterwards, he stated that the speech was very irrelevant, and very inconclusive. How he could praise it in one breath and condemn it in another as being irrelevant and inconclusive, I do not know. But throughout it was not the voice of Symon the statesman speaking, but of Symon the advocate. The honorable senator went on to say that if we placed the proposed agreement in the Constitution we should sow the seeds of discord and disaster. Five minutes later he declared that if it were subjected to a time limit he would not object to its insertion in the Constitution. At that stage I interjected that he was giving away his whole case, and thereupon the Vice-President of the Executive Council exclaimed, &#34; The honorable senator does not object to the Commonwealth giving away its powers for twenty-five years?&#34; To that question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> could make no reply. All his words were those of an advocate. He declared that the agreement constitutes a betrayal of the Federation. Does he mean to say that all the State Premiers have conspired to betray the Federation? Do we not know that the States require some financial security ? How, therefore, can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> stigmatize the agreement as a betrayal of the Federation? It is merely an arrangement which adequately recognises the obligations of the States and of the Commonwealth. We must recollect that after all the Commonwealth Government is the Government of the States, and that it has been deputed by them to discharge certain functions which have been delegated to it. They have concluded that 25s. per head is sufficient to enable the Commonwealth to proceed with the developmental work which it has to undertake. I come now to the last of the four objections which I have enumerated, namely, that the proposed agreement should be conditioned by a time limit. What is the history of the Braddon section? In order to establish Inter-State Free Trade the control of the Customs and Excise revenue was transferred from the States to the &#39;Commonwealth. In agreeing to that step the States parted with their most prolific source of revenue. At the Federal Convention the delegates spent hours in discussing how the Customs duties should be dealt with. It was then that my late colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, hit upon the expedient which has been adopted in what is known as the &#34; Braddon &#34; section. It was certainly a clumsy expedient, in that the Commonwealth is required to raise &#163;4 through the Customs for ever\ &#163;1 that it needs. But we have never had to raise additional revenue. The one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue has proved adequate to the needs of the Commonwealth, which has returned to the States about &#163;6,000,000 in excess of their three-fourths share of that revenue. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. But the one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue has hitherto proved ample for the requirements of the Commonwealth. The electors of New South Wa.les would never have accepted the Braddon section of the Constitution had it not been accompanied - by a time limit. Circumstances have shown that they were right. Ten years of the operation of that section have revealed the wants of the States and of the Commonwealth, so that we are now in a position to make a permanent arrangement with the States, and to embody it in the Constitution in substitution of the Braddon section. Will any of my friends opposite say that it would be fair to the States - recognising the vast importance of the Customs and Excise as a source of revenue - that the Braddon section should be excised from the Constitution, and that the provision in substitution for it should not be implanted in the Constitution? At the Brisbane Labour Conference it was taken for granted that the substituted arrangement would be embodied in the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- The Constitution does not say that at the end of ten years the Parliament shall distribute the Customs and Excise revenue &#34;as it may from time to time think fit.&#34; That is not what was meant- by the framers of our Constitution. The operation of the Braddon section was limited to ten years to enable us to gain experience. It would have been very easy for the Federal Convention to have said that the Customs revenue should be distributed at the expiration of ten years as the Commonwealth Parliament might from time to time think fit. But the States would never have agreed to such a proposal. The Braddon section was limited to ten years to enable the Commonwealth to gain experience, the idea being that at the end of that time, when we had learned something of the requirements of the . States and of the Federation, we should arrive at an arrangement which should be placed in the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- At the beginning of this debate my honorable friends opposite were in favour of embodying the proposed agreement in an Act of Parliament, the operation of which was to be limited for a term of years. Now they say that the agreement may be inserted in the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> declared that the adoption of such a course would result in sowing the seeds of discord and disaster. Now my honorable friends say that if the agreement be embodied in the Constitution it should be subject to a time limit. They urge that in a period of national emergency its operation would prove disastrous, and that to secure an amendment of the Constitution would occupy a long time. But I would point out that if we embody the agreement in the Constitution for a term of twenty years, a great national emergency may arise in five or ten years. Within that period we may be embroiled in the great war with Germany which so many people predict. Consequently, when my honorable friends opposite are prepared to leg-rope the Commonwealth for a period of twenty years they are a trifle inconsistent. </para>

                            <para>-Of course we might, but there would be a great outcry on the part of the States if such a thing were attempted in the absence of a dire calamity. If the agreement be limited to a term of years, it ought, morally, to run for that term. I have some belief in the freedom and dignity of this Parliament. The people who gave us our Constitution, and who are to be asked to embody this agreement in it, will be able to alter it when they deem it wise to do so. Are we to fear them? What is the dire necessity of which my honorable friends think so much ? Can the States ever get along with a less contribution from Customs and Excise than 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita?</inline> Have I not already stated that every State, including the State of New South Wales, will be obliged to resort to fresh taxation, because the amount which will be returned to them under this agreement is too small? Even if dire necessity should compel us within ten years to raise millions of money, could we decrease the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution to the States? These terms, &#34;dire calamity &#34; and &#34; disaster,&#34; are used without thought. The States will need money for the upkeep of their schools, the maintenance of their police, and the management of their various Departments of Government. I do not know what calamity could be of such a nature that the States would not want their 25s. per head from the Commonwealth. There might, it is conceivable, be a disaster of such  a  nature that we should need to put a swinging super tax on income and land. We might raise millions of money in that way, but the States would still want their 25s. per head to carry on with. </para>

                            <para>- Provision is already made for the Commonwealth to spend ,&#163;2,500,000 more than it had in the past. It has been recognised that the Commonwealth will want money for the Federal Capital, the development of the Northern Territory, and the building of railways. The agreement gives the Federal Government a very much larger sum than it ever had before. The Brisbane Conference scheme also provided for the future. But we have further to provide for the stability of the States. Is it nothing that the States have had to agree to the cutting down of the amount which they have received from Customs and Excise from three-quarters of the revenue to one-half? Surely the States have a right to know that in the future their finances are not to be so unsettled as they have been under the Braddon section. Is there to be no- permanency ? Surely it is reasonable that they should have some security as to the amount to be given back to them. I ask my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and others who will follow me from the Opposition side, to point out why the provision which is to be adopted as a substitute for the Braddon section should not go into the Constitution ? I can see no reason. A great argument which was used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> in that very irrelevant speech of his last night, was that the proposal of the Government will be a blow to the policy of Protection. I notice that, whenever a knotty point comes up for discussion, this question is brought in. But the history of every nation is opposed to the predictions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> The Vice-President of the Executive Council has shown that, during the period from 1887 to 1906, the population of the United States increased by 44 per cent., whilst the Customs receipts increased by 63 per cent. ; the population of Canada increased by 36 per cent., and the Customs receipts by 109 per cent. ; the population of Germany increased by 25 per cent., and the Customs receipts by 114 r,er cent. Let us turn to New Zealand. The effect of the figures cannot be got rid of by saying that that Dominion has been borrowing a great deal of money. She borrowed largely in the Vogel period, and has borrowed enormous sums since, but within the last few years she has not borrowed enough to rob these figures of their significance. In 1899, the revenue of New Zealand was 56s. per head ; in 1903 it was 63s. ; in 1907 it was close upon 70s., having increased since 1899 by 14s. per head. We are proposing to build a Federal Capital - which, by the way, we do not want - to construct one or two railways, and to develop the Northern Territory. The building of one railway will cost, I suppose, &#163;6,000,000. The moment that money commences to be .spent, up will go the Customs receipts. It is idle to say that this is a blow to Protection. Is not the wealth of this country increasing? Are not our savings banks receipts mounting up ? Are not our probate duties and our income tax returns increasing ? These &#39;facts all mean augmented wealth, more money to spend, and a greater power of consumption. We are bound to have increased Customs receipts unless the development of the country is to be absolutely retarded. I defy honorable senators opposite to show any justification for the belief that the Customs receipts will decrease. I also def\ them to show that there is any reason for believing that any injury will be done to the policy of Protection under this proposal, unless their idea of Protection be that a high wall is to be built&#39; around Australia, and that no imports whatever are to come in. For years before Federation the States of Australia went in for swinging duties. The question of Free Trade and Protection was hardly raised in Tasmania, but nevertheless we had 20 per cent, duties, and a Customs and Excise revenue of &#163;450,000 per annum in the last year or two &#39;before the Commonwealth was established. Under Federation that amount was cut down to &#163;330,000. We had an enormous Customs revenue in proportion to our population. The duties were imposed because we wanted the revenue. We have now, in Tasmania, a land tax, an income tax, an ability tax, a stamp tax, and a dividend tax. We pay in direct taxation 29s. per head. This agreement with the Commonwealth, to return 25s. per head, will compel Tasmania to put on &#163;60,000 or &#163;70,000 of new taxation. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, they are. Wages are going up all over Australia ; and that means more expenditure and more Customs revenue. If the rank Protectionists are not content with duties of 35 or 40 per cent., I can assure them that they will have to fight hard before they get more. If there are anomalies in the Tariff, let them be altered. If there are industries which are not sufficiently protected, let the duties affecting them be increased. We have deliberately adopted the policy of Protection,, and I am not going to run away from it. But, nevertheless, I am not going to be any party to blocking the adoption of this scheme, on the ground that Protection will be endangered by it. There is no ground whatever for that belief. I should like to read a few sentences from a speech made some time ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick.

                        <para>The Federal Parliament as a whole did not constitute the Commonwealth. . The Commonwealth, according to the express words of the constitution, was composed of the union of the people and the States. Whatever might be the national elements of the Commonwealth, they would spring from its federalism as expressed in the union of the people and the States. The States as separate governing entities were as much parts of the Commonwealth as the Federal Parliament and the Federal Executive. The true. theory of federation was, not that the Federal Parliament was the supreme and sole representative of the national principle, but that the Commonwealth was a political union and partnership, with a dual system of government, having two sets of governmental organs, Federal and State, each operative within its respective sphere, and largely independent of each other, but each deriving its authority ultimately from a common source, namely, the sovereignty of the people. </para>

We are one people. The State Governments manage the affairs of the people in regard to certain functions, and we govern them in regard to other functions, because the matters allotted to the Federal Parliament are such as can be controlled by one authority better than by six. I believe that the whole of this trouble about the financial agreement has arisen from the fact that honorable senators opposite argue as if we were fighting for two different sets of people. The fact that the people are one makes ali the difference. Justice demands that the Constitution shall be altered in order that the terms of the agreement may be embodied in it, and I believe that the people will recognise that the arrangement now being made is a righteous one. I have not the slightest doubt that they will agree to it. </para>

                    <para>There is a large hallucination in that statement. Why would the negotiations have to be begun <inline font-style="italic">de novo?</inline> Those who hold that opinion are infatuated with the idea that this Parliament ought not to exercise its powers, and that indeed it ought not to have the powers to exercise. Is it not a mere statement of fact that no agreement whatever is necessary ? Is it not a statement of fact that we can legislate on the subject in any form in which we like? Yet there is a distinct inference in the statement of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and in that of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that something else is necessary, that something being an agreement with the State Premiers. It is not necessary to give effect to this agreement, or any other agreement. There is no reason why such an agreement should be made a vital point of the issue. Yet the Government, by their attitude, do make it a vital point of the issue, and so do those who champion the cause of a constitutional fixture. Does not that fact justify <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> contention that this is not so much an attempt to get an agreement as to the allocation of the revenue as an attempt to shear the Commonwealth of power. The very arguments used by the supporters of a permanent arrangement show that that is in their minds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> asked me if we could justify the deletion of the Braddon section without putting in its place some other provision by way of an amendment of the Constitution. I am prepared to assist him in putting into the Constitution the very words of the Braddon provision, with an alteration in the amount of&#39; the payment to the States. Is he willing to accept that offer? He pointed out the virtues of the Braddon section, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> referred to it as a blessing. As it is admitted that the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> is fair to both parties, why do my honorable friends refuse to accept the blessings of the Braddon section with an alteration of the amount payable? </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly that was one of the factors which have led to the submission of that proposal, and which make <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and others enthusiastically favour its adoption. It is said that it represents a very great sacrifice on the part of the States. But that is not so. The 25s. per head will be a very fair amount to pay ; it will be fair to both parties, but I deny that it will represent any great sacrifice by the States. In 1898- 9, when there was no prospect of a Federal Tariff in the immediate future, the States collected from Customs and Excise about &#163;7, 250,000. A payment of 25s. per head of the present population will give the States &#163;5,000,000 roughly, or &#163;2,500,000 less than what they received under their own Tariffs. </para>

                            <para>- There is very little difference in the population then and now. The Commonwealth has relieved the States of the expenditure of &#163;1,000,000 on defence, &#163;250,000 on the collection of Customs and Excise revenue, &#163;75&#176;&#187;O0&#176; on old-age pensions, and &#163;50,000 on meteorology, quarantine, trade marks, and smaller items; or a total of &#163;2,050,000. So that the payment of 25s. per head to the States will actually represent within a few hundred thousand pounds what- they, collected from Customs and Excise in 1898-9&#39;. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. A larger Customs revenue is being raised, but that is not owing to any action by the States. Whatever increase they have received from Customs revenue has been due to no act of theirs, but to the action of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>I suggest to the honorable senator that it is novel to find him objecting to a practice which is invariably followed by the bodies with which he is associated, of carrying on their  negotiations behind closed doors, and then deputing one of their number to hand a written statement of their proceedings to the press. </para>

                    <para class="block">That brings me to the genesis of the agreement. It is a deplorable thing, and it will be one of the blots on the history of Australia when it comes to be written, that after several Conferences had been held in the light of day, the servants of the people met in a secret conclave and deliberately refused to allow their masters to know what reasons led them to a certain conclusion, which alone they were willing to publish. The honorable senator sought to justify that deplorable act by comparing the Premiers* Conference with the Conference of a party organization. Does any one here object to an organization calling a meeting of its members to frame a programme or to decide upon tactics? Surely a party programme does not concern the people until it is submitted to them for adoption or rejection. Surely a party has every right to deal with such questions as it may think fit. A question of that kind is not a public, but a party, matter. The Labour party does not profess to be a public body, but a party organization, seeking party ends. It carries on its Conferences in its own, way. </para>

                            <para>- Does the Minister wish to draw an analogy between a party Conference and a Conference at which those who hold the chief legislative positions in the States meet those who hold the chief legislative positions in the Commonwealth to deal with a matter which vitally affects the finances of the States and the Commonwealth behind closed doors, after seven Conferences had deliberated in the light of day, knowing that the conclusion arrived at must be submitted to the people, but refusing to allow them to hear what their guides have to say concerning the relative merits of various propositions? One of the few virtues of these Conferences has been that by the meeting of public men, the clashing of interests, and the promulgation of various views through the medium of the press, the people have been able to gain a better idea of the merits of respective schemes. But as regards the only scheme which is likely to be placed before them they are absolutely in the dark as to what led the Conference to come to an agreement. </para>

                            <para>- It is important that we should know what led the present Government to abandon their position. They came together under a compromise arrangement between the parties who then constituted the Opposition and the Corner parties. They turned out the Labour Government on a definite understanding. The terms of that definite understanding are contained in a Ministerial statement, which was issued by the Prime Minister, and ordered to be printed on the 20th July, 1909. </para>

                            propounded a compromise which was generally acceptable to all parties. It was as follows : - &#34; That the finances should be adjusted in a way that would permit the Commonwealth to. carry out all its commitments without unnecessarily depleting the State Treasuries. That there should be an interregnum of five years within which all the questions at issue could be considered and developed by the fusion Cabinet, and that nothing should be done during that five years to in any way prejudice the conception that the Commonwealth must undertake and carry out its obligations; that the State debts should be transferred ; and that a special commission, consisting of nonpolitical persons - men of standing in the financial community - should be created, which should act as a trustee body in connexion with existing loans and future loans, of State borrowing, and of Federal borrowing.&#34;

                            My idea is that there are two parties interested in any alteration that takes place after the termination of the ten years - the States and the Commonwealth.

                    <para>I know that quite well. It seems to be unfair where there are seven parties equally interested in any alteration that takes place that the power should be left in the hands of one of those parties. I think the present section,  87,  as amended in 1900, leaving the power to alter the system in the hands of the Federal Parliament, is unfair, considering that the States are equally interested. ... If the Australian people were desirous of altering it in any particular way, it would be done. Would you be prepared to consider any amendment in that direction? That would be putting the matter in the hands of the Australian people. None of us can very greatly object to our case being judged in that way, but to give one Parliament out of seven the power to alter when their interest as a separate Parliament is manifestly against the interest of the other six- </para>

                        was this agreement arrived at by those who had previously denounced it, and said that by assenting to it they would be false to theConstitution?

                        Forrest in 1907 said that he would not agree to such a proposal in any circumstances.

                            <para>- I do not say thai an agreement is not desirable. I say &#39;thai if a return of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per</inline><inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> to the States is a fair return, let us agree to make it, but let us agree to do so for a limited term, retaining our power to review the matter at the close of that term. That is the vital issue connected with the Bill. It is not a question whether a return of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> is sufficient, or whether it should be agreed upon for ten or foi twenty years,  6ut  that if it is agreed upon for any term this Parliament should retain the power to review the matter at the close of that term. </para>

                        <para>I am assuming that there is a practical agreement with and, at any rate, no very strong dissent from that portion, of the agreement which deals with theper <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> amount to be paid to the States. So far as I have been able to gauge the criticism of the measure, and the trend of public and Parliamentary discussion, there is no serious objection taken to the payment of 25s. per head of the population to the various States. I, therefore, do not propose to weary the Senate with any figures which are obtainable, and which might be advanced in justification of the contribution agreed upon at the Conference. </para>

                            <para>- But the Commonwealth has also reduced the expenditure of the States. I repeat that a defence scheme has been forecasted which, in six years, will involve an additional annual expenditure of &#163;1,500,000 upon defence. Then the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill contemplates a further obligation of at least &#163;300,000 annually, to say nothing of the expenditure upon the Federal Capital and the other transcontinental railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. If we take into consideration the increased expenditure to which we are committed upon defence, and upon the Northern Territory, we shall find that all the advantages that we shall gain under the proposed agreement will be extinguished. In addition, we know that there is a strong public opinion in favour of the payment of invalid pensions. Indeed, almost every proposal which comes before this Parliament means, not an increased revenue, but an increased expenditure. Consequently, I hold that within six years all the advantages which the Commonwealth Will gain under this agreement will have disappeared. </para>

                            <para>- I say that under the agreement our financial advantages will vanish within six years. But the Commonwealth will not then be at the end of its resources. It will still be able to fall back upon direct taxation. If we look at the experience of the past nine years, what do we find ? During the first year we had a surplus of about ^1,500,000, but within nine years we shall have a deficit of 200,000. Surely that is a significant circumstance. </para>

                        <para>It is in accordance with a principle of the Constitution, and with, I believe, public sentiment, that we should recognise that the interests of the States require that we should secure to them a further share in the Customs and Excise revenue. The alternative to that seems to be something which is nothing short of an absolute violation of the Constitution and that is unification. It is impossible to conceive of the States going on if they are reduced to a state of insolvency. In order to secure their solvency it appears to be absolutely imperative at the present juncture that the interest which the Constitution gave them in the Customs and Excise revenue shall be continued, at any rate, until other circumstances arise. The alternative to that is the crippling of the States financially, thus making them impotent to carry out the large responsibilities which devolve upon them, with the result that, from sheer force of circumstances, they would have ultimately to be transferred to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para class="block">To what is that an appeal ? It is a direct appeal to distrust future Commonwealth Parliaments. It is a forecast of a National Parliament which will not adopt the straightforward course of &#39; attempting to alter the Constitution, so that this power or that power may be acquired, but which will,, by starving the States, force them into unification. That is the most serious reflection upon any future Parliament which could possibly be made.

                    <para>Then why not accept the agreement for  a  limited term? Notwithstanding that the Vice-President of the Executive Council recognises the advantage that would flow from limiting the operation of the agreement, notwithstanding his admission that such a provision would place both the Federation and the States in a better position, he opposes any such proposal. Why? Simply because a bargain was entered into at the secret Conference of Premiers, and because even a better agreement would disturb that bargain, and might rob the Government of the political advantage which was the <inline font-style="italic">quid -pro quo</inline> which they received. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is just where the States impale the Commonwealth on the horns of a dilemma. The position which is there outlined has already arisen. It arose last year. Do we not all recollect that when the Fisher Government proposed a land tax the cry was at once raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and those with whom he is associated, that that Government were invading the sacred domain of the State Parliament. &#34; Hands off direct taxation,&#34; they said. The Vice-President of the Executive Council admits the possibility of the Commonwealth being again placed in that position, and he knows perfectly well from experience that, in such circumstances, a similar cry will be again raised. The honorable senator is most ingenious in many of his arguments. Whilst he was speaking I interjected that they partook of the nature of sophistry, and, without intending to be offensive, that is the only term which accurately describes them.

One of the difficulties which honorable senators opposite experience is to confine themselves to an argument without running off into side tracks. The position is this. Let us assume - as I do without reserve - that my honorable friends opposite absolutely and completely reflect the views of their constituents, What does that indicate? It indicates that those who. argue that the smaller States would not give up this provision once we gave it to them are fighting now to resist the larger States in thrusting down their throats this 25s.per <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> to which the smaller States are going to hang so tenaciously, which they will never surrender, and for the sake of which they would shake the very foundations of the Commonwealth itself ! </para>

                            <para>- No. The Vice-President of the Executive Council pointed&#39; out that some honorable senators upon this side of the chamber who oppose the agreement are representatives of small States, and he used that circumstance as an argument that the small States would not be likely to oppose taking the agreement out of the Constitution after it had once been placed there. He quite ignored the fact that sitting behind him are just as many representatives of small States who are enthusiastic supporters of the agreement.  His  argument, therefore, was the veriest sophistry. When I speak of the States, I speak of them as legislative entities.I speak of their Parliaments. Those Parliaments are a powerful political factor in the Commonwealth, and whenever a proposal may be made in the future to alter the agreement, we shall always find these great political organizations throwing the weight of their influence into the scale, not on behalf of the national interests, but for their own advantage for the time being. Can it be urged for a moment that in the past the Premiers have attended Premiers&#39; Conferences as other than advocates of their own particular interests ? </para>

                            <para>- It is. But the influence of the State Parliaments and of the State Governments will always be exerted in opposition to any alteration of the proposed agreement when once it has been embodied in the Constitution. That is going to have a very great effect upon the possibility of securing an alteration. </para>

The unfairness of the proposal is that, in order that the people may have an opportunity of accepting what is, in the opinion of all of us, a fair bargain as to a division of the revenue, they will have to vote upon a complex question which confuses the issue. In order to get the thing they want they will have to agree to something which I am satisfied the majority of the people are opposed to accepting. </para>

                            <para>- I mean that all the members of the Senate are agreed that the 25s. provision is a fair bargain. But what is the question which will be put to the people? They will be asked, &#34;Are you prepared to say that, instead of the provision now standing in the Constitution, there shall be a fixed sum of 25s. per head paid to the States?&#34; Seeing that we are practically agreed upon that provision, . we may take it that the people will desire to say &#34; yes &#34; to the question. But, in order that they may say &#34; yes&#34; to it, they will have to say &#34;yes&#34; to something else. They will not have an opportunity of saying that they prefer that the arrangement should be made for a term of years, at the end of which period the bargain should be revised. The question will be put to them in such a way that in answering it in the affirmative they will be expressing an opinion diametrically opposed to what, I believe, the majority of the people of Australia wish. </para>

                            <para>- The Conference expressed no opinion as to a period. There is nothing in its debates to indicate whether the Commonwealth Parliament was to have full power, or whether there was to be a constitutional alteration, or what was to be done in that direction. The whole question was left open. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman, Mr. McGowen,</inline> and other members of the New South Wales Labour party in the State Parliament have taken up a certain attitude on the subject, the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> newspaper, which is a strongly Nationalist organ, has referred the subject to all the delegates at the Conference. It wrote to them, asking what their opinion was as to the intentions of the Conference, and as to whether the agreement was to be embodied in the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable senator say that we could pay a fixed sum without a&#39; constitutional provision? Some little time ago I proposed - not in this Parliament - to initiate a proposal for altering the Federal Constitution, by which means I considered that we could bring about the abolition of the Legislative Councils. The objection that faced me at once was that there was an honorable understanding that the Legislative Councils of the States should not be. affected by anything done under our Constitution. The argument was used, indeed, that there is a provision of the Constitution which maybe interpreted  to mean that we shall not touch the Legislative Councils of the States. If the Constitution safeguards the Legislative Councils, we can amend the safeguard by taking away a certain portion of it. </para>

It asserts the principle that all representatives of the people should be directly and solely responsible to the people for their vote and action. . . . I say that when some of your representatives go into a room and a division is taken, say, amongst twenty-one members of Parliament, supposing eleven vote on one side and ten on the other, all  votnig  according to their judgment and conscience, the ten come out no longer representatives of the people. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Labour caucus has discussed the financial agreement, but if any member of the Labour party, either here or in another place, desires to vote for it, there is no power in the caucus to prevent him. He can vote for the agreement in absolute loyalty to his pledge and to his party. In Australia there is no Labour organization which can touch him for so doing. There is nothing in our pledge, or our platform, or our caucus organization which could in any way injure him for so doing. Every member of the Labour party, whether here or elsewhere, is absolutely free to support every principle in the Bill if he so desires. According to the Prime Minister, the Fusion deliberately came into existence as a protest against the Labour caucus, and yet some of its members have admitted in another place that on this question, on which we on our side are absolutely free, they are not free, having had to abandon their principles at the dictation of the party caucus. </para>

                            <para>- I understood what the honorable senator said in that light. Until I hear honorable senators on the  other side say differently, I shall take it that they are supporting the Government because they believe in this agreement ; but in the cases I have referred to, I have heard differently and not at the street corners or in the lobbies, but in another place. </para>

                            <para>- It is not necessary to refer to any admissions which were made in another place. Speaking in his own electorate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Irvine said that he trusted that the Prime Minister would not compel honorable members to vote against their convictions. He and other members have said publicly that there was a majority, in another place who were against the provisions of the Bill. We have seen the spectacle of another honorable member pleading that the members of the Fusion party should be left free to vote according to their convictions. A caucus is a justifiable weapon with a party organization. It may have disadvantages, but it certainly has advantages. In the public light of Australia there are men whose politics have synchronized with the politics of the Labour party, and who have been emphatically with the Labour party in all things except the main principles of party organization. </para>

                            <para>- I never could sympathize with that term, because, if a man is as good as a Labour man, the Labour party ought to be good enough for him. I am anxious to hear whether the objections which are raised to the Labour party caucus are held to apply to the Ministerial caucus. What is sauce for the Labour gander should be sauce for the Ministerial goose. If honorable senators whose political principles are identical with ours, and whose life-time profession has been that they believe in  Democracy  and advanced measures, have stood out of our party simply, as they have said, because of our caucus methods and our pledge ; if we now find them bending the knee to another caucus, and holding views which are diametrically opposed to those which we find in this Bill, an3 yet assisting in its passage, what inference can we draw? </para>

                            <para>- I think that Democracy is open to just as many definitions as is Liberalism. I hope that, even at this late hour, the Senate will justify its existence by insisting upon the people being given an opportunity to vote on this question without also being asked to strip the Parliament of .a power. If the reference is made to the people in that form, it will not injure the States ; but it will secure to them all the advantages of the agreement. It may injure the political advantage which I have referred to, but it will certainly safeguard the paramountcy of this Parliament on this question. I appeal to the Nationalists, to the true Federalists, to take such action as will secure to this Parliament the retention of a power, and, at the same time, obtain for the people such a re-arrangement of the financial relations as will be fair to- all parties, and to see that the Bill is passed in such a form that the people will be able to give an honest vote in those directions. </para>

                        <para>. - It would be idle to deny that the issue before the Parliament is a very grave and momentous one. We are in a difficulty. On one side there are those who desire to uphold a power intrusted to this Parliament, while on the other side there are those who want to lessen or impair that power. It is a pity that a very serious issue of that nature cannot bc decided in a cold and dispassionate way. </para>

                            <para>- I have very little hope that honorable senators will vote on the original issue, and that is whether or not we should hold fast to our powers. Judging from events which have happened in another place, I fear that their votes will be influenced by other considerations. To my mind, the whole question is whether or  not we are prepared to take the initial step to surrender a power which was granted to this Parliament by the people over ten years ago? It has been said that the situation warrants that surrender ; but, so far as financing their several enterprises is concerned, the States are exactly in the same position now as they were in ten years ago. When the people throughout the Commonwealth were consulted, they were quite prepared to leave it to the Federal Parliament to settle the financial issue, and to allocate the revenue from Customs and Excise as best it could, subject, of course, to the limitation in the Braddon section. We have drifted from that position. We are now told by the Government that it is necessary, as a preliminary, to enter into a cast-iron agreement with the States, the people of which&#39; ten years ago gave us paramount power, with the trifling limitation of the Braddon section. Is there any reason for embodying in the Constitution an agreement at this time, when the people saw no necessity for doing so ten years ago? </para>

                            <para>- A period of ten years is only a passing breath in the life of a nation, and the Braddon section was a trifling limitation on a power which was intrusted to this Parliament by the people ten years ago. Honorable senators are aware that, before the Constitution can be altered, the first step must be taken by this Parliament. No matter what is done in the Federal or State Parliaments, no matter whether power is increased on one side or diminished on the other, we cannot prevent the Commonwealth from progressing. We cannot intercept the progress of the people of Australia, or put a limit upon their future prosperity. That is a great consolation. Whether the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, or of the State Parliaments are increased or diminished, the nation will continue to progress. </para>

The crux of the matter is that we are being asked in this Bill to give away a power which we at present possess. Any honorable senator who calmly considers the matter must be satisfied that it would be a deplorable thing for members of this Parliament to deprive it of a power voluntarily given it by the electors some ten years ago. Have any of the State Parliaments done likewise?. Before the establishment of Federation, we had six State Parliaments in the different States of the Commonwealth, and we have them still. We cannot point to a single instance in the whole course of their existence in which they took the initial step to rob themselves of the powers with which they were originally endowed. On the contrary, I could cite a number of instances in which the Parliaments of the States have courageously fought to retain the powers given to them under the Imperial Acts by which they were constituted. </para>

                            <para>- I shall refer honorable senators first of all to a case that occurred in Queensland, and I direct the special attention of Queensland senators to it. When an attempt was made to invade  the constitutional powers of the Parliament and Government of that State, the political party in office at the time, and the people behind them, rose very creditably to resist a proposed encroachment upon their powers by the Imperial authorities. The Governor of the State sought to exceeed his constitutional powers by an interference in an administrative act, and he was told instantly that what he proposed was an interference with the constitutional powers of the Parliament and Government of the State. The people of Queensland rose in protest, the Imperial authorities yielded, and the proposed violation of the Queensland Constitution was prevented. </para>

                            <para>- I have infinite trust and faith in the people, and in their common sense and capacity to arrive at a well-balanced judgment. I especially appeal to honorable senators representing Queensland to recall the incident to which I have referred in which the politicians of the time, backed up by the people of the State, stubbornly and successfully resisted an attempted violation of the Queensland Constitution. What are Queensland politicians doing now? We find some of them in the Senate who apparently are willing to assist the Federal Government in making an inroad upon the constitutional powers of this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The Governor of the State attempted to exceed his powers under the Constitution, his attempt was resisted, and was ultimately condemned by the Imperial authorities. Lord Knutsford, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time, countermanded the Governor&#39;s order, and told him to keep within his powers under the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger admits the stand which the people of Queensland took on that occasion in defence of their Constitution, but I am sorry to say that as a representative of Queensland the honorable senator is now only too willing to take the first step to rob the Federal Parliament of the powers conferred upon it by the people of Australia. Another case can be quoted from the history of New South Wales. Honorable senators will remember that an attempt was made to introduce a number of Chinese, in connexion with which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes took a firm stand, involving a possible rupture with the Imperial authorities. A constitutional question was involved, and the Imperial authorities at the time took the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes was not entitled to resist the landing of the Chinese. I mention this case in order to show that where an attempt was. made, possibly to exceed the powers of the State under the Constitution, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes was able to maintain his position, and prohibit the landing of the Chinese in spite of the intervention of the Imperial authorities. Public men in the State Parliaments have not only successfully resisted attempted violations of State Constitutions, but have claimed to exercise powers which may possibly have exceeded the powers given under their Constitution, and the Imperial authorities have upheld them. I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> what he thinks <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes would be likely to do if he were a member of the Federal Government to-day? He was, probably more than any other public man in Australia, responsible for bringing about Federation, and he would never have agreed to pare down the Federal power as the Vice-President of the Executive Council is willing to do. There is one very notable example in history of a Parliament that took a hand in its own destruction. It was a Parliament organized under the British Empire, and the names of those responsible for the destruction of that Parliament have even to-day only to be mentioned to be execrated. Yet we find that some honorable senators are willing now to take a hand in depriving this Parliament of the powers conferred upon it by the people some ten years ago. With respect to the conservation of State rights, I wish to say that I desire to take no action which could be regarded as a violation of those rights. I believe that the State Parliaments are necessary to carry out the functions with which they have been intrusted, and that it would be utterly futile to seek to give effect to any wild scheme of unification. Yet we have the Vice-President of the Executive Council stating that the alternative to the adoption of this agreement is unification. </para>

                            <para>- The opponents of this Bill have no desire to encroach upon State Rights. Never was a more foolish bogy raised in this Chamber than that which was conjured up by associating the opponents of the measure with a disposition to invade State Rights and to head in the direction of unification. It is very unfair to impute unworthy motives to honorable senators who are simply expressing their honest convictions, who are subject to no restraint whatever, and who do not speak in obedience to a decision which was arrived at by a secret caucus. Upon this Bill members of the Labour party are perfectly free to vote in accordance with the dictates of their own consciences. Consequently, the Vice-President of the Executive Council put the position very unfairly when he affirmed that if the proposed agreement be not inserted in the Constitution there will be a danger of unification being brought about. I have no desire to infringe State Rights. </para>

                            <para>- That is merely a coincidence. We are absolutely free to vote as we choose upon this Bill. I regret that the Commonwealth Parliament is about to take the first step towards lessening its power and lowering itself in the eyes of its creators. It is quite true that, in moving the second reading of the measure, the Vice-President of the Executive Council made the best of a bad job. Indeed, I do not know of anybody who could have made a better case out of a bad one than he did. But he was careful to quote only expressions of opinion on the part of public men before we had had any experience of Federation. To-day, however, we are able to form mature opinions which are based upon actual experience of the working of Federation. Before we. take the serious step which we are invited to take, I think that we ought to look around and see what has happened in other countries in which a federal form of government exists. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> point to a single instance in Canada in which its public men voluntarily offered to forego any of the powers which had been granted to the Federation under the Constitution? </para>

From <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bryce&#39;s</inline> book, which is a standard work, I gather that whilst many amendments have been proposed in the American Constitution, not a solitary &#34;amendment to limit the powers of the Federal Government has ever been suggested. Upon page 366 of his book, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bryce</inline> refers to the character of the amendments which have been enacted in the American Constitution from time to time. He places them in four groups. He says - </para>

                        <para>The first group, including ten amendments made immediately after the adoption of the Constitution, ought to be regarded as a supplement or postscript to it rather than as changing it. They constitute what the Americans, following the English precedent, call a Bill of Rights, securing the individual citizen and the States against the encroachment of Federal power. The second and third groups, if a single amendment can be properly called a group, (amendments XI. and XII.) are corrections of minor defects which had disclosed themselves in the working of the Constitution. The fourth group is the only one which marks a political crisis and registers the political victory. It comprises three amendments (XIII., XIV., XV.) which forbid slavery, define citizenship, secure the suffrage of citizens against attempts by States to discriminate to the injury of particular classes, and extend Federal protection to those citizens who may suffer from the operation of certain kinds of unjust State laws. </para>

                    <para>It appears, therefore, from this summing-up of the history of the American Constitution that no attempt has been made in the United States similar to that which is now being made in this Parliament. But in conferring upon the slaves that freedom which some of the States refused to grant them the sphere of Federal functions  was  enlarged. So that there is not upon record a similar instance of an attempt such as is now being made to dwarf the powers of the Federal authority. </para>

                            <para>- There is no need for such a provision in the American Constitution, because when the American States federated they gave up all right to the Customs and Excise revenue. Why is this attempt being made to curtail the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament? Does it arise from a desire to assist the States, or is it prompted by a desire to take advantage of a set of conditions to improve the position of one political party ? Whilst it may spring from an admixture of motives the outstanding motive is a desire to gain a political advantage by diminishing the power which was spontaneously conferred upon this Parliament by the people. It is quite true that there are men who will vote for the proposed agreement whose action will be dictated by purely conscientious motives. But an admixture of motives prompts the action which this branch of the Legislature is now asked to take. When the Fusion party was formed a platform was drawn up which provided, amongst other things, for the conclusion of a temporary adjustment of the future financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth. But is that what is now proposed? Certainly not. A departure has been made from that platform, and a permanent agreement is now suggested in lieu of a temporary one. </para>

                            <para>- It is a fixture so far as the Vice-President of the Executive Council is concerned. Personally, I am curious to discover how this wonderful change has been brought about. The  members of the Fusion party subscribed to a platform which provided for a temporary arrangement in regard to the adjustment of the future financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth. But we have now submitted to us, not a temporary arrangement, but one as permanent as it is possible to put within the four corners of the Constitution. The common ground of agreement of the members of the Fusion party regarding this subject was that, pending the preparation of a complete scheme adjusting the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, an interim arrangement should be proposed under which Customs and Excise revenue should be dealt with. But after that arrangement was come to in the most solemn and deliberate fashion, it was departed from, and&#34; the members of the Fusion party are now asked to agree to this permanent scheme. The Ministerial statement which has been quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> confirms to the letter this description of the agreement entered into by the members of the Fusion party. What, then, are we to ask ourselves regarding the change of front ? Imagine the view which would be formed by an impartial observer as to the motives which have prompted the placing of this agreement before us. Would not the conclusion be formed that the principal object is to score a party advantage at the approaching elections? The necessity for coming to a temporary rather than a fixed arrangement has been repeated over and over again. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> when addressing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> prior to the secret - Conference held in Melbourne, used the following words - </para>

                    <para class="block">What, therefore, is the position of the members of the party opposite regarding this matter? They know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> entered into the Conference with the Premiers as a Nationalist - a man whose patriotism had been undoubted in the past. But he came out a bond slave to the State Premiers, and so did his colleagues. What. I ask again, would an impartial observer think of a body of men entering into this agreement, and now impelled against their will to come to an entirely different conclusion? I say that the facts all point to the certainty that there is some other motive behind this proposal than a desire to arrive at a workable arrangement. . There is some political reason for this <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline> on the part of a Government which has substituted for an interim agreement a permanent or fixed one. I do not need to quote the opinions which have been expressed inside and outside Parliament on this subject to illustrate the change of front.  1  do not need to cite passages to show the pressure that has been brought to bear upon members of the Ministerial party. I have myself heard a statement from Ministerial lips to the effect that those who voted against this proposed agreement were renegades. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard a Minister, when a member in another place was speaking in opposition to the agreement, call him a renegade. Where is the freedom of the members of the Fusion party when a member of the Government can address so opprobrious an epithet to one of them. Surely the time has gone past when allusions should be made to caucus rule. It is now evident that the party opposite is absolutely controlled by a secret caucus. We, for our part, profess to be bound only with regard to certain principles which are set forth within the four corners of our programme and the realization of which we believe to be necessary in the interests of the people. Except in regard to those matters to which we are pledged, we claim to be, and are, as untrammelled as human beings can be. Reverting to the opinions that were expressed on this subject prior to the declaration of the present Ministerial policy, I find that members of the present Ministry held totally opposite opinions, and expressed them publicly.  At the Conference of Premiers, held in Brisbane, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, as reported on page 196 of the minutes, spoke as follows - </para>

                        <para>On reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the proceedings of this Conference, which I have had the privilege of doing, one might fairly come to the conclusion that the attitude assumed by some honorable members of this Conference would seem to show that this Conference was the arbiter of the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth was asking for something in these proposals that will be injurious to their interests. Now, as a matter of fact, as you all know, under the Constitution, which is the law of the land, the Commonwealth has all the power it requires for itself already. It will have in 1910 all the power it wants. In our opinion it has powers which we do not desire to exercise. We desire to come to some arrangement with the States, and not to exercise them at our own free will. We have the right after 1910 to spend what we want in the interests of the Commonwealth from any taxation - from Customs and Excise, and from all other sources of taxation throughout the length and breadth of this great country. </para>

Many members of this Conference - I know from personal knowledge - from personal acquaintance and intercourse, fully realize the position I have placed before you, and what I desire is that it should be recognised by all, and that it should not be said for one moment that we set up claims which are not in the Constitution. Whatever is under the Constitution vested in the States I advise you all, unless it suits you otherwise, to adhere to them, because I consider that you are trustees under the Constitution for the people of your States. But what is not in the Constitution, what is vested in the Commonwealth, I think it is not -right or wise to lay claim to powers that, under the Constitution, are vested in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>The present action of the Commonwealth Government in trying to make an amicable arrangement suitable to all parties with the States does not warrant any distrust of it as if it is trying to get the last farthing, or trying to get everything for itself, and to give nothing to the States. There is another reason even stronger than the reasons I have given, and that is that it would be impossible, I think absolutely  impossile,  to get the Federal Parliament to agree to it. </para>

                <para class="block">That is what the opponents of this measure are saying now. They agree with the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest two years ago, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> at that time supported, because <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> stated more than once that the proposals which he laid before the Premiers had been minutely thought out by the Federal Government, of which he was a member. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, as Treasurer, now comes along with an entirely different set of opinions. He asks us to give up our control over finance. Why this somersault on the part of Ministers who occupied positions in an- other Government two years ago ? Why this <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline> as regards relinquishing our powers ? The motive for it, I am satisfied, is that it is desired to better the prospects of one political party as against the other at the coming elections. If I am right in that idea, it lends colour to a statement which has been made by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that the members of the Fusion party rely upon the support of the State authorities. Consequently, we now have this great national question made a mere plaything in the theatre of political passion. At the coming election political tension will run very high. We shall have two parties in the field. Each party will strive, by hook or by crook, to maintain its popularity, and at the same time the people will be asked to say whether or not there should be placed in the Constitution a provision depriving the Federal Parliament of a power which, it possesses. When the Constitution Bill was submitted for acceptance or rejection the people were entirely free from such pernicious influences as will soon prevail. At that time it was a question of Federation or no Federation. But now the position will be complicated by having the lingering prejudice against Federation brought into the political arena. Are we likely to get a fair or impartial decision when the issue will be obscured by political considerations ? That alone should, I think, lead honorable senators to vote down this measure until a time arrives when the great question of limiting the legislative power of this Parliament can be decided in a coal and dispassionate way. </para>

In those circumstances it would, I think, be foolish and unstatesmanlike for the Commonwealth to hand over money to the States. From the report of the proceedings of the Brisbane Conference I propose to quote another authority, and that is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers. It cannot be said of him that he was favorably disposed towards Federation, especially during the latter period of his Government. As a stalwart supporter of State Rights he had no equal in the Commonwealth. On one occasion he almost went to the length of embroiling the State and the Commonwealth in a very serious conflict. It cannot be said of him that he had any leaning towards the Federation, or any desire to make its path smoother than that of the States. What did he say to the Brisbane Conference? On page 103, he is reported as saying - </para>

                            <para>- The language employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers is only capable of conveying one meaning, and that is that it would be unfair to ask the Federal Parliament to do the thing which the honorable senator is prepared to do ; and, furthermore, that it would be impossible, to remove from the Constitution a provision of that kind. The present position does not afford much satisfaction or consolation to any true Federalist. On the one hand, we have a contracting revenue, and on the other hand an increasing expenditure all round. There is no doubt that at a very early date the Commonwealth will be confronted with very great difficulties, and that the payment of 25s. a head to the States may impose a serious strain upon the revenue. According to the Treasurer, in 1908-9, the revenue from Customs and Excise was &#163;10,843,000, or &#163;801,000 less than in the previous year, and the estimated revenue for 1999-10 is &#163;10,800,000, being &#163;43,000 less than the receipts for the previous year, and the lowest revenue for three years. The total revenue for the present year is estimated by the Treasurer at &#163;14,555,000, and the expenditure at &#163;7, 867, 000. It is not unfair to assume that we shall have more revenue next year, so that in the immediate future the compact under consideration will impose a serious strain on our finances. There is no reason to suppose that the Customs revenue for next year will be equal to that of the present year, and the Treasurer estimates that it will be &#163;43,000 less. Assuming, however, that the results are the same, we shall have a total revenue of &#163;14,555,000, and the expenditure will be at least the same as that for this year, namely, &#163;7,867,000, leaving a balance of&#163;6,688,000. Under the agreement before the Senate there will be payable to the States &#163;5,668,000, leaving a balance of&#163;1,020,000. But next year the Treasurer will have to find, for the payment of old-age pensions, the sum of &#163;665,000, which he did not have to find this year, because it has been gradually accumulating in the trust account. When that sum is deducted it will leave a balance of &#163;355,000. If we had no increasing demands upon the Treasury to meet a payment of 25s. per head would be too little to make to the States. But next year the Treasurer will have, I hope, to find at least &#163;250,000 for the payment of invalid pensions, &#163;250,000 extra for land defence, a large sum for the Federal Capital, a sum ranging from &#163;100,000 to &#163;200,000 for the Northern Territory, and an additional sum for naval expenditure. All these heavy claims &#34; will have to be financed out of the apparent surplus of &#163;355,000 for next year. Now, how is it going to be done? </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, but the Brisbane scheme, if adopted, would leave this Parliament free to adjust the finances whenever a difficulty arose. The additional expenditure on old-age pensions will nearly mop up the apparent surplus of &#163;355,000. We have also to meet an increasing expenditure on land defence, naval defence, High Commissioner, and bounties, and a large sum must be provided for the improvement of the postal service. Yet all these claims are expected to be financed out of an apparent surplus of &#163;355j&#176;oo. It is clear that by taking this step we shall be crippling the power of the Federal Parliament to cope with the financial stress under which we shall be in the near future. In the circumstances I see no reason why we should embody this agreement in the Constitution and make it so difficult, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers has said, to get it out again. The Vice-President of the Executive Council referred us to the experience of the United States. He went back to 1887 and dealt with the Tariff experience since that time. But on looking through Taussig&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Tariff History of the United States,</inline> I find that the author places a very different complexion upon the figures used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and gives a statement of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> receipts from Customs in the United States which the honorable senator did not supply and which I shall supply for him. </para>

                            <para>- They are material to the contention I make that a Tariff on revenue lines, as was clearly shown by the experience of the States prior to Federation, produces a larger <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return from Customs than does a purely Protective Tariff. This is shown in the history of the United States, where, according as the Tariff in force was high or low, so were the receipts per head of the population. I go a little further back than did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I go back to 1875, about nine years after the close of the American Civil War. During those nine years State fin- &#39;ancing in America was of a very erratic character. Tariffs were modelled and remodelled, and in 1875 a Tariff was framed which involved an increase of 10 per cent. all round on the duties previously imposed. As a result of the operation of that Tariff, the revenue from Customs for the year 1875 amounted to $154,000,000; for the year 1876, to $145,000,000; 1877, to $128,000,000; 1878, to $127,000,000; and 1879, to $133,000,000. The imposition of this Tariff increasing the duties previously imposed by 10 per cent, all round was followed by a reduction in the aggregate revenue from Customs, and necessarily in the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> Customs returns of the United States. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite willing to admit that in extraordinary circumstances the rule might not hold good, but the figures I have quoted show that an increase in the duties in 1875 was followed bv a reduction in the revenue returns in the United States. Another Tariff was passed in 1883, which increased some duties and reduced others, and the effect was such as to prove neither case. But in 1890 the well-known McKinley Protectionist Tariff, which was of a kind never previously imposed in the United States, came into operation. In that year the revenue receipts amounted to $226,000,000. In the following year they fell to $216,000,000, a reduction of $10,000,000. In 1892 they were $174,000,000; in 1893, $199,000,000; and in 1894, they had fallen to $129,000,000. It will be seen that from 1890 to 1894, when the Cleveland Tariff was introduced, there was a steady decline in the Customs receipts under the operation of the McKinley Tariff. Upon the imposition of the Cleveland Tariff the Customs receipts automatically took the upward grade, because the Cleveland Tariff involved a reduction of the duties imposed under the McKinley Tariff. By the way, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> might say that some of our Free Trade friends in New South Wales, on the introduction of that Tariff, sent a congratulatory message to the United States, which was never replied to. I have said that the Customs receipts for 1894 amounted to $129,000,000, and in the following year, the first of the operation of the Cleveland Tariff, they amounted to $149,000,000, or an increase of $20,000,000 in the year. In 1896 there was a further Increase to $157,000,000, and in 1897, to $172,000,000. These figures show a. steady and considerable increase under the operation of what was largely a revenue Tariff. I come now to the figures which the Vice-President of the Executive did not supply, because they did not suit his purpose. I wish to show the effect which the operation of. these different Tariffs had upon the receipts <inline font-style="italic">-per capita,</inline> because that is most vital to the matter now under consideration. As a consequence of the Civil War the financial position of the United States from <inline font-style="italic">1S66</inline> until 1875 was very unstable. It was only in that year that anything like a settled basis was found for them. I may say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taussig</inline> is a Free Trader, and in every chapter of his book he puts the case strongly from the Free Trade point of view, and condemns the opposite fiscal policy. According to this authority, in 1875, when a Tariff involving an increase of 10 per cent, in the duties previously imposed came into operation, the population of the United States was 44,200,000. The Customs receipts were $154,000,000, or $3.4, equal to 14s. 2d. per head of the population. In 1879, after this Tariff had been in operation for four years, the population was 48,800,000; the Customs receipts were $133,000,000, or $2.7, equal to 11s. *d. per head. During the four years of the operation of the 1875 Tariff, imposing higher duties than had previously been imposed, there was a corresponding reduction in the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> Customs returns from  14s.  2d. to 11s. 3d. As I have said, the results from the 1883 Tariff were inconclusive, because it involved the increase of some and the reduction of other duties. But coming to the McKinley Tariff, which was of a pronouncedly Protectionist character, T find that it was introduced in  T890.  In that year the population of the United States was 66,900,000, and the Customs revenue was $226,000,000, or $3.6 per head, equal to 15s. The </para>

                            <para>- I have admitted that there are perturbing influences which sometimes upset calculations, but I am dealing broadly with the effects produced by the operation in the United States of three Tariffs, one of the kind so much approved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> Cleveland&#39;s Tariff was introduced in 1894. When the Customs receipts represented 9s. per head of the population it continued in operation until 1897, when the Dingley Tariff was imposed. In that year the population of the. United States was 71,700,000, and the Customs revenue $172,000,000, equal to $2.2, or 10s. ner head. These figures show that under the operation of the Cleveland Tariff so much in accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> idea of fiscalism there was a gradual upward movement in the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> Customs receipts for the three years from gs. to 10s. Unfortunately Taussig&#39;s work does not give the same figures, showing the effect of the operation of the Dingley Tariff. It was introduced in 1897, when the Customs returns represented 10s. per head of the population, with a total revenue of $172,000,000, and in 1898 the revenue again fell to $149,000,000, and the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return was correspondingly reduced. I challenge any honorable senator to dispute the accuracy of&#39; the figures I have supplied, and they clearly go to show that an increase in Tariff duties is followed by a reduction in the Customs receipts per head of the population. A revenue Tariff will increase the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution through the Customs. That circumstance shows that the effort to manacle future Commonwealth Parliaments will, if successful, have a serious effect upon the fiscal policy of this country. It will compel politicians to adopt one of two courses. They will either have to frame a revenue Tariff, in order that the Commonwealth may be able to annually return to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> or they will have  to tap other sources of revenue, which will at once bring them into collision with the State authorities. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that the imposition of a land tax would be of material assistance to the revenue of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> showed clearly last night that in the United States, owing to the operation of a highly protective Tariff, a diminished revenue is being collected. The incidents of American history entirely falsify the position which was put before this Chamber by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. So far as the effect of the proposed agreement upon the future liberty of the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned, the position is one which forbodes nothing but trouble and anxiety. We are asked to implant this agreement in the Constitution for just so long a period as a minority of the electors may be anxious to retain it there. Taking the last general election as a guide, I find that the total number of votes polled throughout the Commonwealth was 1,059,168. An absolute majority of that number would b, 529,585. The votes polled in three of the small States were as follows: - South Australia, 70,517 ; Western Australia, 52,712; and Tasmania, 48,879. An absolute majority of the electors in those States would thus be 86,055. So that if a vital issue had been placed before the electors at the last general election, 87,000 electors in three small States might have placed at defiance 972,000 electors in the other States. Is that a creditable position? Of course, we are not to assume for a moment that the small States will stand in the way of altering the Constitution, except so far as is consistent with the desire of the people. But if the larger States wished to thwart the desire of the small States, 530,000 voters in the two big States could defeat the four small States, and hold them in constitutional bondage for just so long as they choose. This aspect of the case, as well as that which I have just presented, is sufficiently grave to cause any honorable senator to pause before setting the seal of his approval upon this pernicious measure for shackling our future freedom. I had intended to refer to the financial scheme which was drawn up at the Brisbane Labour Conference.

                    <para class="block">I repeat those words now. But the honorable senator also found fault with me for having used the word &#39; &#39; continue &#39; &#39; in the sense of meaning &#34; perpetual.&#34; Now, I merely repeated the word used in the preamble of the resolution which was arrived at by the Finance Committee of the Brisbane Labour Conference, and which declared that the States should continue to receive a share of the Customs and Excise revenue. I did not intend that they should continue to receive that share for all time, but only until the Commonwealth Parliament otherwise provided. I do hope that at this eleventh hour honorable senators will come to a clear view of their grave responsibility. 1 trust that they will recognise that if we adopt the proposed agreement, we shall be irrevocably tying the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament, and that our action will in the future tend to provoke a collision between the Federal and State forces. I shall vote upon this Bill as a Federalist, and I shall vote against it because I have not been sent here to curtail the liberty and the power of the Parliament of which I am a member. </para>

                        <para>. - Before the motion for the second reading of this Bill is put, I should like to say a few words, not only as to the motives underlying its introduction, but as to its probable effect if embodied in our Constitution. The position occupied by this Parliament was very clearly defined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in his illuminating speech of yesterday. He claimed that it is now proposed that this Parliament shall abandon a power which was deliberately reposed in it by the people. Nobody can deny the truth of his statement. At present, out of the amount raised by the Commonwealth from Customs and Excise, the States get three-fourths, and one-fourth is retained by the Commonwealth for its own purposes. Under the proposed agreement the Commonwealth will enter into a perpetual arrangement to annually return to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline></para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">The two positions are altogether different. They stand at opposite poles. At the present moment the Commonwealth Parliament has complete control over its financial policy. It may adopt a Free Trade policy if the people demand it, it may continue a Protective policy if the popular mandate be in that direction, or it may enact a revenue Tariff. But under the proposed agreement its power of action will be severely limited. </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly the position. Honorable senator&#39;s opposite must either see the Government through in connexion with this agreement, or face Ministerial opposition at the coming elections. The Government themselves are a mere pawn in the game. They are under the duress of the State Governments and the State Premiers, who have actually threatened the Commonwealth Ministry that, if the terms which, they have dictated are not agreed to, Ministerial candidates will be opposed by State Government candidates. So that the whole matter resolves itself into this : The Fusion itself was fused in the office of the Employers&#39; Federation, in the back rooms of our financial institutions, where the pawnbrokers, the usurers, the sweaters, and the land monopolists congregate. Where the hawks and vultures of this continent gather together, there this Fusion Ministry wasborn. </para>

                    <para class="block">And now the Government has to do the bidding of the people who created it. That is the conclusion at which I have deliberately arrived, and this is the proper place in which to state my opinion. I am not going behind the backs of honorable senators to say what I think about them, their Government, and their proposals. I intend before I sit down to give what I believe will be substantial proof of the truth of what I am stating. I have no hope that I shall be able to convert a single honorable senator opposite. There is only one method of converting them, and I am not in a position to apply it. If I were I have not the slightest doubt that I could get their votes just as easily as the Employers&#39; Federation and the financial institutions get them now.  1  have pointed out the position as it stands, and as it will stand if this agreement passes through this Parliament and is indorsed by the people. Under the present arrangement the Commonwealth Parliament may go in for any kind of Tariff that it chooses. As we know, the people of Australia have decided that the policy of Protection for native industries is to be the policy of the country. How, I should like to ask, will it be possible to carry out the policy of Protection if, in addition to raising all the money we require for our own purposes, the Commonwealth is to be compelled to raise 25s. per head per annum for the States? Commonwealth expenditure is going up by leaps and bounds, and if the various schemes that are now in the air, and some of which will soon be on the earth, are carried into effect, our expenditure will inevitably increase. The Northern Territory scheme, which has been agreed to by the other Chamber, will involve a very large expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- I am assuming that the Government&#39;s policy will be realized, and that they are prepared to finance their proposals. The Government may be stupid and unpatriotic enough for many things, but I have this opinion of them, at any rate : that if they bring forward proposals they will be prepared to finance them. If  not, their policy is so much fudge and humbug, and not only are they endeavouring to deceive Parliament, but also the great multitude of the electors. Our expenditure is going to increase year by year. It is mounting up with great rapidity. At the end of the ten years now approaching, we find that the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue which the Constitution permits us to spend is wholly inadequate. Therefore, the Government have arranged with the States that we shall have a larger proportion. The amount which we now propose to retain is almost double what we received before. But within a very few years even that sum will be insufficient. If the population and the revenue increase the expenditure will also increase. If the industrial policy which has been laid down by the people is to be honestly carried out, the revenue cannot increase in proportion to the population and the expenditure. The experience of every country that has adopted Protective principles proves beyond doubt that as a Tariff protects so does the revenue decline. What is the object of a duty on imported goods? It is to prevent them from coming into the country, and to encourage their manufacture in the country. If goods are manufactured in this country, it follows that no duty can be derived from their importation. Therefore, the revenue from Customs must inevitably decline. If the mandate of the people is to be carried out our revenue per head of the population, instead of increasing, must of necessity decrease. If that be the case, I should like to know how the Government are to pay this 25s. per head to the States in perpetuity, and also finance our own great Commonwealth undertakings? I have, however, come to the conclusion that the Government do not intend that the policy adopted by the people of Australia shall be carried out. I have come to the conclusion deliberately, on the facts as they present themselves to me, that the Government, at the bidding of the Free Trade section of its party, have deliberately abandoned the policy of Protection and intends instead to go for Revenue Tariffism. </para>

I believe that my honorable friend who interjects is as honest a man as is to be found on the other side, and if he thinks otherwise I can only come to the conclusion that he is deceiving himself. The facts are so apparent to my mind that he who runs may read. If you have effective Protection you cannot get revenue, and if the Commonwealth Government cannot get revenue from Customs and Excise, how are they going to get it? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator would not vote for a land tax. There is not a single supporter of the Government in this Chamber who would vote for a land tax. They may talk with their tongues in their cheeks about a land tax, but though they may think they can deceive the people outside, I can assure them frankly and fairly that they cannot deceive me. What the Government have been ordered to do by their masters, the Employers&#39; Federation and the land monopolists, is to impose a revenue Tariff which will save the rich and extract the uttermost farthing from the pockets of the poor ; a Tariff which will allow Dives to go almost scot free, but which will snatch even the crumbs from beneath the table from the miserable Lazarus. This is exactly the position as it presents itself to my mind, and which I shall place before the country in my own State. If the electors choose to accept the agreement with their eyes open after having been warned of its results, their blood will be on their own head. It will be their own mistake. One of the last things which those honorable senators opposite who twitter about a land tax would consent to is a tax which would necessitate the rich land-owners bearing their fair share of the burdens of this country. They are bound by their traditions and associations to oppose such a tax. </para>

                            <para>- If the States receive 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> and our expenditure is to be defrayed entirely from Customs and Excise revenue, it will be impossible for us to have a Tariff which will maintain our existing secondary industries and create fresh ones. Honorable senators have asked, &#34;Why not have a land values tax?&#34; I am discussing this question purely from the point of view of the declared policy of the Government, which is not Protection, but Revenue Tariffism. Let me quote the utterances of the Prime Minister, as recorded in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 14th April, 1906, when he was interviewed by the press on his return to Melbourne from a visit to Sydney, where he had tried to come to an agreement with the State Premiers - </para>

                        <para>While three-fourths of its receipts are taken by the States, there will be no inducement to the Federal Parliament to add to the number of its revenue duties. On the other hand, when we reach the entire utilization of our fourth of the Customs receipts, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner pointed out at Hobart, and when fresh supplies are necessary, the Federal Parliament will be driven to direct taxation. It must then enter upon fields more or less already occupied by the States. I endeavoured to press this upon the Premiers in Sydney as one of the serious consequences of their present proposals to retain the Braddon clause, but unhappily without avail. </para>

                    <para class="block">That passage throws a flood of light on the present policy of the Fusion Government. What astonished me more than anything else is that an utterance of this kind should have been made by a man who has hitherto been regarded as the High Priest of Protection. He says that, while the Braddon &#34; blot &#34; stands, we cannot impose additional revenue taxation, because, if we do, we shall Have to hand to the States 15s. out of every <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline> we raise. Before we can add to our revenue through the Customs, the Braddon section must be abolished. Apparently he had a good deal of difficulty in persuading stupid State Premiers of the truth of his statement. Fortunately for the Fusion Government, though unfortunately for the Commonwealth as a whole, he was able at the last Conference to show them exactly how the matter stood. This is my warrant for saying that the present policy of the Fusion Government is additional revenue duties. If we want more revenue? it is not to land values taxation that they will go. A position has been deliberately created by the&#39; State Premiers, in collusion with the Federal Government, which will compel the Commonwealth to resort to additional Customs taxation. If we propose a land tax, we shall be met with the cry that to duplicate land taxation would be unfair. If we propose an income tax, we shall be met with the same objection. If we propose any of the other kinds of taxes now levied by the States, we shall be told that we are encroaching upon the preserves of the States, and ought to confine ourselves to Customs and Excise taxation. This position has been deliberately created. The Commonwealth has been cornered, run up like a brumby of the bush, and placed in such a position that it can be hobbled and ham-strung.- So far as I can discover, there is no escape from additional Customs taxation. Having come to that conclusion, I am justified in inquiring what the effect of the policy will be upon the people. The quarrel at the present&#39; moment is not between the Commonwealth and the States, but between wealth&#39; and poverty. The same fight is going on here as in England. There it is the dukes, against the people; here it is the land monopolists, the - sweaters, the usurers, the financial institutions, and the Employers&#39; Federation against the people, with the only difference, that we have no House of Lords to obstruct reform. </para>

                            <para>- Surely to goodness people want food, clothing and housing. If they have not employment, how will, it be possible for them to get the comforts of civilization ? The honorable senator seems, to me not to know where he is . I confess that I am in a large measure wasting my energy on the desert air, because my honorable friends opposite are Free Traders, or rather Revenue Tariffists, I shall not dignify them with the name of Free Traders, because they are simply Revenue Tariffists, and on that account I have not the slightest hope of converting them to the benefits of Protection. I am trying to show that if we are to have a revenue Tariff we cannot have a Protectionist policy, and that if Protection is to go by the board tens of thousands of our working people will be thrown out of employment. That is a prospect which I am sure honorable senators opposite cannot contemplate without some fear of the consequences. Probably they think that nothing of the kind will happen. But so surely as I stand here, I feel that if the policy of the Fusion is carried out that will be the result. You cannot have a high Tariff, and at the same time Protection. The better your Tariff protects the less revenue it yields, and the more industry it creates the less money it puts into the Treasury. That is an axiom of fiscalism which cannot be controverted. We have the case of Germany, whose Tariff yields a very low sum per annum, namely, less than 16s. per head, and it is one of the most prosperous Protectionist nations of modern times. Then we have the case of the United States - perhaps the most complete instance of Protection which can be found anywhere - where the average yield is between <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 6s. and&#163;110s. per annum. I have no desire that any honorable senators shall lose their trains, and I shall be glad to have the consent of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Chamber to continue my speech on Wednesday next. </para>
