                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister in charge of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill whether his attention has been called to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of this morning that in the House of Assembly yesterday the Treasurer of South Australia, in reply to a question, said that Oodnadatta would be taken over by the Commonwealth if that measure were passed? I want to know if it is in the power of this Parliament to take over South Australian territory. </para>

                        <para>- Oodnadatta is not within the Territory which it is proposed to take over from South Australia, and I apprehend that the Treasurer of that State must have been referring to the Oodnadatta railway, whch, according to the terms of the agreement, it is proposed to take over. </para>

                        <para>Great amount of work in obtaining the necessary documentary evidence to allow claims to be finally settled is principal reason why work cannot be further expedited. Every effort is being made to have claims dealt with as rapidly as possible ; hope greater bulk be settled by end of year. Of six thousand one hundred odd claims received, four thousand eight hundred odd finally dealt with ; claims coming in daily ; those received from Adelaide and suburbs and from country magistrates prior to first July all virtually settled. Since first October four hundred fifty-five new claims received. </para>

                    <para>- It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that on the 25th November a certain passage-at-arms took place between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and myself. I made a statement which he challenged, and went to the length of declaring it to be false. In order to be quite accurate, perhaps I had better read the report in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> at page 6330 - </para>

                    <para>Senator DE LARGIE - My speech is on right lines, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will find out later on. I do not speak in one way here and in another way elsewhere. I utter the same sentiments this year that I gave expression to last year. I did not commence political life as a Labour man, and finish up as the champion of Toryism. I did not commence political life as a  President  of a Labour League and finish up as the champion of all that is reactionary. </para>
                    <para>Senator Millen - Has any one here done that ? </para>

                    <para>Senator Millen - That is absolutely false. </para>

I would point out to the honorable senator that if his object in making a personal explanation is only to renew, or prove, a charge which has been made against another senator, he is not in order. The right of personal explanation is allowed solely for the purpose of enabling an honorable senator to explain where he may have been misrepresented or misunderstood, but it does not permit an attack to be made on another senator. If&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has been misreported or misrepresented in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he has a perfect right to have the matter corrected, but he cannot carry on a dispute between himself and another senator as to the correctness of a certain position which may have been occupied by either of them previously. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! The honorable senator seems to misapprehend the purpose of a personal explanation, or my object in intervening. My desire is to prevent him from exceeding the limits of a personal explanation to set right any misreported which may have appeared in reference to him. He will recognise that if every contradiction of a statement made in the Senate were to afford an opportunity for making an explanation at a later date, we should never get to the end of our deliberations. It is altogether foreign to the purposes for which an honorable senator is allowed to make an explanation.</para>

                    <para>Honorable senators will remember that I deferred the third reading until to-day, with the object of enabling inquiries to be made by the Treasurer and by honorable senators to discover whether there are any other funds established in the Commonwealth on exactly similar lines to the New South Wales Miners Accident Relief Fund, payments from which it is the object of this Bill to exempt from the definition of the word &#34; income.&#34; The inquiries made by the Treasury Department have led to the conclusion that there is no other fund similar to the Miners Accident Relief Fund of New South Wales. Payments by way of relief under such funds as the Watson Fund in Victoria come within the exemption contained in the definition of &#34;income&#34; in the principal Act. </para>

I may explain that the revised copy of the Bill only reached me whilst the bells were ringing, so that I had not sufficient time to look into the clause thoroughly. I recognise the justice of the criticism which has been levelled at my proposal, because of the presence of the word &#34; canteen.&#34; But I would point out that the retention of that word is absolutely unnecessary. If we exclude intoxicating liquors from military camps,
                    <inline font-style="italic">Sec,</inline>
                    obviously the word &#34;canteen&#34; is not required. I therefore ask leave to withdraw my amendment with a view to moving the excision of that word.

                <para class="block">I regret that the author of this clause is not present to hear what I am about to urge. Under it a prohibition will be imposed upon the sale of intoxicating liquors in camps in which citizen soldiers between 18 and 20 years of age are undergoing training. Now we all know that a camp is of a limited extent, and, although we may prohibit the sale of intoxicants within its boundaries. we have absolutely no control over the sale of liquor immediately outside those boundaries. Where measures of this kind have been adopted, it has been my experience that a most pernicious system has arisen - a system under which sly-grog selling has become rampant. We have not the slightest power to prevent that. I do not wish to in any way wound the feelings of those who desire to do all that they can to promote temperance both in the community at large and in our Defence Forces in particular. But in their endeavour to accomplish one good, I ask them to be careful lest they do a much greater evil. Experience everywhere has shown that it is better to control the sale of liquor than to endeavour, to suppress it. Everybody knows that in a celebrated State in America, liquor may be purchased anywhere save at the hotels, where it is most required. I fear that by attempting to treat as children our virile intelligent men to whom we look for the defence of this country, we shall reproduce that condition of things here. </para>

I say that there are men and women in the Commonwealth today who would be far better off if they were prohibited from getting intoxicating liquors. In these circumstances, I am justified in saying, so far as our military camps are concerned, &#34; Lead us not into temptation.&#34; If we are going to compel the young men of this country to undergo military training, in the interests of humanity and Christianity, I ask the Committee, notwithstanding the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> to stand by the Government, and by that which is right. I am very glad indeed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has taken up a firm attitude upon this question, notwithstanding the opposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> and others, who are endeavouring to cover their tracks.

                    (New South Wales) &#91;11. 16&#93;. - It has occurred to me that in this clause we are proposing to enact that which we have no power to do. The whole area bounded by Botany Bay on the south to some distance north of Sydney, suburbs, and bounded again by the seacoast, and running how far inland I do not exactly know, is &#34; Sydney fortress &#34; under the military organization. The area teems with hotels. Yet we are proposing to enact that on all occasions when compulsory parades or drills are held all the public-houses in the area are to &#39;be shut, and any one who has liquor in his possession - every merchant, every publican, every householder with liquor on his premises - is to be fined.

                        <para>- Yes, and there is an important hotel at Chowder Bay now. If any compulsory training is going on within the limits of Sydney fortress, any one who sells any spirituous or intoxicating liquors, or has them in his possession, will under this provision be guilty of an offence. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> happens to have half-a-dozen of the best champagne in his cellar he will be penalized. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will find himself subject to severe penalties if his house is searched. Perhaps the military authorities might get out of the difficulty by withdrawing the term &#34;military fortress&#34; from the area in question. But there is another point. The training specified involves both day and night drills. There is one place in&#39; Sydney that is used for drilling purposes. That is the barrack square. It is tar-paved and well lit, and consequently can be used for night drills. Under the clause as it stands, without stretching it in any way, the military canteen at the barracks will have to be closed while any drill is proceeding. Further, the clause will necessitate the removal from the barracks of all liquor in the canteen, the officers&#39; mess, the sergeants&#39; mess, and from the quarters of the officers and non-commissioned officers. It actually makes the whole area subject to the prohibition. Every drop of liquor that is to be found anywhere at the Victoria Barracks will have to be removed whenever there is a parade of young soldiers on the barrack square. Are we really going to enact such an absurdity as that? </para>

                        <para>- Of course it cannot be carried out ; and, therefore, under the pretence of protecting our young men, we are deliberately putting something in the statute-book which we know to be a transparent absurdity. Under the pretence of having a moral disposition towards our youth, we are enacting that which&#39; must be a farce. </para>

                        <para>- No; and there are various kinds of sobriety. I have referred to forts, now I will speak of posts. In carrying out defensive manoeuvres military posts are established temporarily, of course, in the vicinity of, and including, areas occupied at present by licensed premises. I will take a case in point. There are two or three hotels at Coogee Bay. During the Easter training there is generally a military post at Coogee. All the licensed premises there will be affected by this clause. The proposal as it stands is a transparent sham, for the Commonwealth has no power to interfere with public houses. No doubt it will please certain good folks who have strong views on- the question of liquor consumption. But it will do a great deal of harm, first, by enacting that to which effect can never be given; and, second, by leading to the smuggling of liquor into camp, and its secret consumption. It is ah offence fur men to drink in their tents, but this is a proposal which will undoubtedly conduce to the illicit consumption of strong drink. If it be possible to raise a prohibitionist army, well and good&#39;; hut do not let us profess to do that which is palpably a sham and1 a nullity, worthy only of political ostriches sticking their heads in the sand of a silly proposition. This provision will not protect those whom it is desired to protect, but will create more temptation and damage than could ever result from the consumption of liquor under military regulations ; because it is a military offence, punishable by reduction in rank of non-commissioned officers in charge of canteens, to permit the improper consumption of liquor. To show that I am not speaking without knowledge on this matter, may I say that I commanded for nine years a regiment whose offices and head-quarters were within the Victoria Barracks, Sydney? Probably there is not another member of this Parliament who has commanded a regiment whose head-quarters were in the very heart of the military organization of the State. It is common for regiments to have their head-quarters at a little distance away, or&#39; in the city. But, from the start, I asked that my regiment should be &#34;quartered in the very centre of military control. Therefore, I have seen more of the working of military canteens and messes than falls to the lot of most, whose duties have not taken them, as mine took me every day of my life, for months together, to the barracks. In consequence, I learnt more of barrack life than falls to the lot of most citizen officers. It is on this account that I feel I have a right to express my views, not as sentimental propositions, but as the result of the actual observation of facts. I again point out to the Minister that, under this clause, it will not be possible to conduct training in the admirable Barrack Square, Sydney - the best drill ground of the kind in Australia, where fairly large bodies of men can be handled - -without the closing of the canteen of the Permanent Artillery, the messes of the officers and non-commissioned officers, and the removal </para>

                        <para>- Most undoubtedly ; particularly for night drills. Barrack Square is the only open area which is suitably lit. You would not use it for the whole day drills ; you certainly would want at times to use it for afternoon drills, and most assuredly there is no other place about Sydney where, except on moonlight nights, men could be drilled out of doors, because you want a larger area and arc lights at a great height. That has all been provided at Barrack Square, and men can be drilled there at night nearly as well as in the day time. Drilling in the dark round street corners is mere waste of time. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has had considerable experience with regard to canteens, and I, as a layman, am decidedly inclined to pay serious attention to his suggestion. He has moved to delete the reference to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of section 125, with the object of keeping the canteen open to men, but shut to boys. The reason which he gave for his proposal seemed to me to be a very sound one. He said that if the canteen were closed against men, it would promote a worse form of liquor consumption, that is to say, drinking in sly-grog shops, whereas if the canteen were retained, so far as men were concerned, it would be under the best possible control, and that is military control. Apart from my honorable friend&#39;s experience, it seems to me that the one thing we must do is to try to control the liquor traffic, as it cannot be stopped. My honorable friend&#39;s point of view is that if we closed the canteen the military authorities would be brought into conflict with the local authorities in each State, and that the latter would have their way, to the great discomforture of military order and discipline. I am quite willing to be guided by his experience. I also agree with him about the provision with regard to boys under eighteen years of age. I think it is desirable that there should not be any liquor available while they are undergoing training. Owing to the interruption, it must have been difficult for some honorable senators to gather the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> and I hope that with these remarks it is now clear to every honorable senator. </para>

                    <para>. - At this late stage of the discussion I do not propose to traverse the grounds, weighty though they are, advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> and supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> The whole question is- Shall we try to suppress the liquor traffic, or place it under control? That is too large a question for me to discuss to-day. What I propose to do is to vote to retain the proposed new section  123A  as it stands. Whatever may be the merits of a fully-developed canteen where there are adult troops, it should be remembered that we shall be bringing into the camps a number of youths who may, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> said, think that they are men when they are only lads. A percentage of them will not have reached their eighteenth year. In a military sense they will be counted as being of eighteen years of age, though they may be only seventeen and a half years of age. We &#34;shall be bringing into the camps a large number of mere lads, and the question is whether we ought not to endeavour, as far as possible, to keep even the appearance of the temptation away from them. For that reason I ask the Committee to stand by the provision. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia)  &#91;11.40&#93;.  - I feel compelled, in some respects against my will, to support the view which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    has put. I am one of those who believe that there is no reason why the old system of canteen should not continue, and beverages, more or less intoxicating, perhaps, be sold there under proper military regulations. My belief is that there is very little likelihood of abuse. If it is impossible for the authorities of a camp or a fort to safeguard the consumption of intoxicating beverages in the canteen, there is a very poor outlook for the Australian soldier. If I had been here the other evening - and I am sorry that I was not able to attend - I would certainly have voted with those who desired to continue the old system. If this were a proposal to strike out proposed new section  123A,  and restore the old system, I am not sure that I should not, if it were not too late in the session to again deal with this matter, be found rather favoring that side. But it has been decided, so far, that there shall be a sort of modified canteen.

                        <para>- Under paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> the canteen is prohibited as regards youths, lads from twelve to fourteen years of age, and from eighteen: to twenty years of age, but there is no prohibition with regard to a camp at which: there are men from twenty to twenty-six. years of age. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron&#39;s</inline> amendment is founded on a sentiment with which. I agree, that if we prevent the consumption of intoxicating beverages in the canteen, we shall probably encourage sly-grog shops in the vicinity. That is probable, and my honorable friend says, and&#39; says very truly, of course, that there will be a temptation for those in camp to go to those places, if they have a consuming thirst upon them, and probably the results may be worse than if they had consumed the liquor under regulation in camp. The vice of the amendment, to my mind, is that my honorable friend wants to protect, against, the allurements of the sly-grog shops, those who are between the ages of eighteen and. twenty years, but there is no protection extended to those of tenderer years, namely,, those between twelve and fourteen years of age, and between fourteen and &#39; eighteen years of age, who are, I should think, quite as liable, if not more liable, to temptation and to mischief, than those between eighteen, and twenty years of age.&#39; If we are to deal with the matter at all in this form, it seems to me that we ought to strike out all the restrictions, and protect all youths in. training. We certainly ought not to protect from the inducements of mischievous places, young men who are between, eighteen and twenty years of age, and to leave unprotected youths of seventeen years of age, who are at least as liable to temptation as those who are a month or two over eighteen years of age. With great deference, I think that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> proposes would be ineffective and insufficient. If we are to extend protection to persons under training, there is no reason why it should be afforded* to trainees between eighteen and twenty years of age, and taken away from those who are not yet eighteen years of age. The amendment would only be a partial cure for an evil which I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> exists, and should be abolished, and I am, for the reasons I have stated,, unable to support it. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;11.46&#93;. - I should like to remind the Committee of a difficulty which has so far been overlooked. We have in the ordinary militia and volunteer regiments a number of &#34; nippers,&#34; some of whom are under fifteen years of age. I know that in my regiment, we had the champion boy bugler, a lad who was sent to Aldershot, in England, because he was too good to keep here. Boy buglers and bandsmen are enlisted at very early ages. I am not sure of the practice with horse regiments, but in the New South Wales Defence Forces, as they exist to-day, there are boy trumpeters in horse regiments, and the buglers of foot regiments are always boys. There are two to each company, so that in every infantry regiment there would be no less than sixteen boys who would probably be under sixteen years of age. In ten such regiments, we should have 160 boys who would not be protected under the proposed new section. There are, probably, about 400 lads in the existing Militia and Volunteer Forces.

                        <para>- No, I would not, and the honorable senator has no business to say such a thing. What this provision proposes is only that it shall be made difficult for boys undergoing compulsory training to get liquor in a straightforward manner. In any case it is needless, because all that would be necessary to give effect to what is desired would be for the Governor-General in Council to issue a regulation prohibiting the sale of liquor in any canteen to members of the Defence Force under eighteen years of age. Lads of eighteen years of age may be recruited for the ordinary militia regiments. I have known regiments in New South Wales in which the proportion of lads from eighteen to twenty years of age would be at least  20  per cent., and some in which the proportion would be as high as 50 per cent. These could all get drink under the proposed new section, whilst lads of the same age undergoing compulsory training would be denied it. If the Minister would agree to substitute for proposed new section  123A  a provision reading </para>

                <para>No intoxicating or spirituous liquors shall be sold or supplied at any military canteen, camp, fort, or post to any person connected with the Naval and Military Forces who is under eighteen years of age,  he would attain the object sought without the slightest difficulty, and would avoid the anomaly to which I have directed attention. That simple proposal would make for the protection of youths, and even if we do pass this very absurd provision, I am satisfied that it will still be necessary to issue a regulation on the lines I have suggested. I have done what I believe to be my duty in submitting certain facts to the consideration of the Committee, and, so far as I am concerned, Ministers must now take the responsibility of persisting with the proposed new section. </para>

But may I, with very great respect, suggest that it is the duty of the Chair to obey the Standing Orders?

                <para class="block">There is no need for me to occupy the time of the Committee in discussing this proposal, further than to point out that, as the clause stands, it draws a line between persons of twenty and twenty-one years of age who are in training, and thus creates a most inexplicable anomaly. My amendment will simply provide for an annual registration of these trainees. Under proposed new section 123 a, when the annual parade occurs, the man who has reached twenty years of age and one month will be at liberty to go to the canteen and purchase liquor, whilst his comrade in the same squad who is only twenty years of age will be prevented from so doing. Such a provision cannot fail to create dissension in the ranks. We must either abolish the canteen in its entirety, or wipe out this discrimination. If my amendment is agreed to, it will mean that the clause will be passed in the form in which it originally came to the Senate. That, it seems to me, is the best way to remove temptation from the men who will come into camp for training. By perpetuating the canteen we are simply keeping up a relic of bygone days, when the soldier of fortune wanted a place to which he could attract his buccaneering followers. As I said yesterday, there are many callings pursued by men in Australia, especially in the warmer parts that are far more arduous than is the training to which voting soldiers are subjected. Yet this work is done without resource to canteens or similar establishments. Proposed new section 123A draws a line which will create an undesirable distinction in the ranks of men undergoing training. When Bill Jones says to his mate. &#34;Come and have a drink,&#34; his mate will have to reply, &#34;No; I am not yet up to the whisky age, and cannot come.&#34; That will be absurd. </para>

I trust that every honorable senator, no matter what his views may be, will receive credit for submitting what he believes to be the facts of the case. In view of the stage of the session which we have reached there is an evident desire that short speeches shall be the order of the day ; and I shall not offend in that respect. We are called upon to accept the Northern Territory under an agreement. That agreement was made by the Prime Minister with  the  former Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price.</inline> I do not feel bound by that agreement in any shape or way. I had no hand or part in it. I cannot see why I should be asked by the Government to approve of the agreement. </para>

                            <para>- I should not be standing here at this moment to oppose this Bill if, like the measure to which my honorable friend alludes, it had to be referred to the people of the Commonwealth. I oppose the passage of the Bill simply because it will increase the burdens of the people  without  their consent. It has been repeatedly stated that if the agreement is accepted it will involve an. additional burden of  &#163;2 14s.  on every man, woman and child in the Commonwealth. On that ground I think it is the duty of honorable senators to resist the imposition of such taxation until the people have had a chance of saying whether the Commonwealth should accept the Northern Territory or not. I want it to be thoroughly understood} that I am not against the acceptance of the Territory, but am against its acceptance on the proposed terms. Suppose that a syndicate engaged in mining, pastoral, or commercial pursuits had started out with the best of intentions to develop the Northern Territory, but had failed to achieve its object. And suppose that another syndicate was asked to take over the Territory with all its liabilities, but with the proviso that it should be developed on exactly the same lines as the previous syndicate laid down. How could any business man or body of business men accept a proposal of that character? Yet that is what this Parliament is now asked to do on. behalf of the Commonwealth. Notwithstanding his great abilities, the Prime Minister is, to my mind,  a  very poor business man. The late Premier of South Australia was a hard, practical business1 man, and ,  undoubtedly he drove  a  very good bargain with the Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- That is an uncalled for interjection. The Government of South Australia helped more to bring coloured labour into the Commonwealth than did any other State Government. With Chinese labour they made the railway from Pine Creek to Port Darwin at a cost of &#163;7,000 per mile. Yet the Commonwealth is supposed to construct a railway in the Territory for about ,&#163;4,000 a mile. We all know that the country from Port Darwin to Pine Creek is the best watered portion of the Territory. If it cost the State &#163;7,000 a mile to build the railway between those points with Chinese labour, what is it likely to cost the Commonwealth per mile to build a railway through the driest and most inhospitable part of this continent. I hope that it is not to be built with Chinese labour. That is my reply to the honorable senator&#39;s uncalled for interjection. Honorable senators who are advocating this measure are not prepared to trust the Commonwealth Parliament to take over the Territory. I heard an honorable senator, for whom I entertain a great respect, argue here the other day that we should trust the Parliament. Now, in this matter we want to trust the Parliament. We want South Australia to hand over the Territory at the price of its cost to it, and trust to this Parliament to take action in the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth. Some honorable senators are not now prepared to trust the Parliament of the Commonwealth, but want to bind the Commonwealth down to an agreement which, so far as I know, was entered into without the consent of any man, except the Prime Minister. I object to the Commonwealth being bound down in that way, and I hope that the Senate will do so, too. I think that it would be a fair thing for the Commonwealth to undertake to take over the Northern Territory, and pay all the debt thereon, to be determined by any court or body of men chosen by the Commonwealth and the State. I do not wish to be understood as advocating the construction of a line from any particular State to the Territory. I do not care from what State a line is constructed to open up the Territory, so long as the determination of the route is left to the Parliament of the Commonwealth. At the next general election this proposal will be brought before the people more definitely than it has even been before. The representatives who will then be chosen should be left absolutely free to decide what is fair in the interests of all the States. In 1907, the population of South Australia was 392,000, and no doubt by this time it has increased to 400,000. If the Commonwealth takes over the debt on the </para>

Under the agreement we are required to build a railway which is computed to cost a certain sum. I very much doubt the accuracy of the estimate. I know of many cases where the cost of public works has been more than double the estimate. What will it cost the Commonwealth to build 1,000 miles of railway in the driest and most inhospitable part of the continent if it cost South Australia &#163;7,000 a mile to build a railway in the best watered portion of the Northern  Territory with Chinese labour? </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to trust the people first, and the Parliament next. We ought to be told what class of people the Government intend to employ in opening up and&#39; developing this country. My experience of forty odd years in the tropics teaches me that the introduction of a number of men from the Old Country, to build a railway or to settle and develop the Northern Territory, would result in a huge failure from the very start. It can only be developed by men who have been inured to climatic changes, or by the native population. It would be murder, so to speak, to bring a number of persons from a cold climate into the tropics, where water is so scarce, to build a railway. Even if we are willing to take over the Northern Territory, we should be told where the settlers are to be brought from. I know that a number of men left a district in which I was living to go over to the Port Darwin rush, and that after being there for nine or ten months they deserted the country and returned to the district. This country will be taken up, as country that was at one time considered quite unsuitable for settlement has been taken up in the United States, when we have a population in Australia of from  20,000,000  to  30,000,000,  and when the good land nearer the coast and closer to markets has all been occupied and railways have been extended to the boundaries of each of the States. I asked a gentleman, who, I believe, is an explorer, and who has taken a great interest in the Northern Territory, what could be grown or produced there which would bear the transport charges from the centre of the Territory by the proposed railway to Port Darwin or to Adelaide. The only product he could mention was wool. I remember a time, forty-five years ago, when wool produced in some parts of Queensland was taken to the nearest port by bullock teams and other means, and was  six months on the road. I am quite satisfied that if the lands of the Northern Territory were suitable for sheep, they would be taken up. We are told that there is a large amount of settlement in the Territory, and I believe that there is, of a kind. I have here an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">North Queensland. Register</inline> of  10th  May,  1909,  containing an advertisement of the offer for sale of three very large stations in the Territory. It will indicate what land there is worth, and what the Commonwealth is likely to get for it if we take over the Territory. This is the advertisement referred to - </para>

For this country the South Australian Government are getting the large annual return of1s.  3d.  per square mile. I do not know that any words could better describe the character of the country. </para>

The honorable senator will not ask me to&#34; believe that the Eastern and African Cold Storage Supply Company would have taken up the 5,374 square miles comprised in these stations if they could have secured better land.

                            <para>- No. 1 am perfectly certain that the honorable senator could not point to any station properties in Queensland that are leased at less than eight times that rental. The lowest rental that I have known to be paid for country in Queensland, and that was after a drought, was from 8s. to 10s. per square mile. That, however, is immaterial. The point is that this country to which I have referred has been leased for forty-two years at a rental of is. 3d. per square mile. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> says that there is much better land unalienated. </para>

                            <para>- Are we to believe that the people who took up such large areas selected the worst country they could find? I speak from personal knowledge, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> can bear me out when I say that many years ago men holding station properties in Victoria and New South Wales, and having sons growing up, sent the oldest of them out with a couple of stockmen looking for country which they might take up. That practice is followed to-day in three or four of the States. Men are out looking for good country, and if they find any they are prepared to take it up and stock it. I want to know why this enormous area of land in the Northern Territory is left unoccupied. The &#39;only reason can be that it is not worth taking up at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- There is a vast area of land in Queensland that is a very .long way from the coast. I have said that I can remember a time when it took a year for bullock teams to make the trip from stations on the Barcoo to Rockhampton and back. Within the last six months I travelled with a man who had accompanied another to the Northern Territory to look after a station property belonging to a bank. He went out to secure suitable country on which to put stock, but after putting in six months in the Territory in search of country that would suit him, he came away without taking up any. </para>

                            <para>- I do not doubt that. I admit that there are large cattle stations near the coast in the Northern Territory. The honorable senator is speaking of swampy country around the Roper and other rivers, but the cattle on such country are subject to pleuro, the tick, and other diseases. We have some country of the same class in Queensland. Without doubt the Northern Territory will be taken up, but it will only be after the better lands of Australia have been settled ; when our population, instead of being 4,250,000, will be more like 30,000,000 or 40,000,000. It is quite immaterial to me whether the Northern Territory is developed from the south or from the&#39; east. I desire that it should be left to the Federal Parliament to decide - the best way in which to expend &#163;5,000,000 or &#163;6,000,000 in developing the Territory. I do not desire that the Parliament should be bound by this, the most one-sided agreement ever entered into. No business man of any acumen would put his signature to such an agreement. South Australia has been in occupation of this Territory for from forty to fifty years, and has not been able to make a success of it. I give the people of that State every credit for their heroism in attempting the task, but it has proved to be beyond their powers and their means. Can any one imagine a pastoral, mining, or commercial company, that had been working without success on wrong lines, expecting to be able to float  their business into a new company with the condition that the new company taking over all the liabilities should be bound to follow the lines of development which had been proved to be unsuccessful by the operations of the old company ? That is what is proposed in this agreement. </para>

I object to this Parliament being bound in the way proposed in this agreement. I believe in trusting the people and the Federal Parliament. If, after the next Federal elections, senators are returned from Queensland authorized to vote for the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth on the terms laid down in this agreement, I shall feel myself bound to vote for it. But I honestly believe that if the people were asked whether they approved of the taking over of the Northern Territory on these terms they would by an overwhelming majority answer in the negative. On the other hand, if they were asked whether they would agree to the Commonwealth taking over the Northern Territory and paying South Australia what its occupation has cost her they would agree to it. </para>

I am quite willing to allow this Parliament to determine what railway would be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, and best calculated to promote the development of the Northern Territory. I am not in favour of taking over the Territory under the agreement which was entered into bv the Prime Minister with the late Premier of South Australia.

                            <para>- It would receive the Northern Territory, the development of which will require the expenditure of millions of pounds. In my view, it would be premature to attempt to develop it whilst there are more suitable lands available nearer our sea-board - lands which possess a better climate. Of course, I give the representatives of South Australia every credit for endeavouring to obtain the best terms possible for their own State. But they can scarcely expect the representatives of other States to vote for a Bill which they believe to be opposed to the best interests of those States. In Committee, if&#34; the Government will agree to an amendment which will empower the Commonwealth to take over the Northern Territory at a reasonable price - and I do not suppose that the people of South Australia desire to make a profit out of the transaction, because, up to the present, the Territory has been a white elephant to them - I am prepared to support the Bill. I hope that some such provision will be inserted, and that the future development of the Northern Territory will be left in the hands of this Parliament. </para>

I have not the slightest idea of complaining that he has departed from his avowed intention to be temperate in his use of language. It is not intemperance of language on his part of which I am inclined to complain so much as his narrowness and .paltriness of view.

                            <para>- But my honorable friend has looked through the wrong end of the telescope, and has thus obtained a microscopic view of a great public question. I am exceedingly pleased that he has employed such nice language in reference to myself and my colleagues.  His  want of temperance in the matter of his language was reserved for the Prime Minister, whom he described as a gentleman of a very poor business capacity. He subsequently added that no man of any business acumen, and with any respect for his reputation, would have appended his name to such an agreement as that which is included in the Bill. He implied that ray lamented and very excellent friend, the late Premier of South Australia, had hypnotized the Prime Minister in a matter of business. I hope that the Senate will not be led away by that portion of my friend&#39;s fervid oration, because the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> was the last man in the world to exhibit excessive business acumen. I differed from him in politics, but I never met a straighter man in business, and one who was less inclined to play tricks. It was only right that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> should have attempted to justify his attitude in opposing this Bill, because it is a remarkable fact that, though this is a Ministerial measure, its most vehement opponents appear to be included in the Ministerial ranks. </para>

                            <para>- T like freedom of action as much as does anybody, arid I am quite sure that the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> was to escape from the anomalous position in which he is placed by reason of his vehement opposition to a great question of  public  and national policy. The Prime Minister was scarcely deserving of the imputations upon &#34;his business capacity which were thrown out by the honorable senator. The narrowness of my honorable friend&#39;s view is evidenced bv the fact that he commenced &#34;his most interesting address - and I know that it carried some instruction to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline> mind - by viewing this question, which the Minister of Trade and Customs was most commendably at great pains to raise above a parochial level, from the stand-point of one syndicate which was going to take over another syndicate&#39;s mining or pastoral property when the latter syndicate had been unsuccessful. I venture to suggest that that is scarcely the view which we ought to adopt in dealing with the acquisition, by what we believe will yet be a great nation, of a huge and undeveloped portion of the territory included within the national area. I do ask honorable senators not to look at this question as if it were a matter of one syndicate bargaining with another, or of one bankrupt and ruined pastoral syndicate endeavouring to palm off its property on another syndicate. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> who is a man of business capacity, to view it from a higher level than that. I ask him to view it from the level adopted by the Minister of Trade and Customs, who looked at it from a national point of view. </para>

                            <para>- That does not touch the question of its magnitude and of its significance. What I desire to amplify is the view which was put forward by the Minister of Trade and Customs in moving the second reading of this Bill, namely, that the measure and the agreement which is included in it involve a question of very great national importance. Of course, if we are not invited to consider this Bill from the stand-point of its effect upon the building up and consolidation of the Commonwealth, it must be approached from an altogether different stand-point. But I view it from the stand-point that we all desire to magnify and build up the Commonwealth, to give it coherence where it has not already got coherence, to develop and settle it under the best possible auspices, and to afford it security against foreign assault to which&#39; it at present lies open and which makes this portion of our country a source of danger to us. This Commonwealth of ours is one which we hope to make and to keep intact. We wish to make it the arena in which we shall work out our destiny, develop our resources, multiply our settlement, and thus make it a home for our race. What we wish to maintain intact is not a bit of Queensland, or of South Australia, or of New South Wales, but the entire continent encircled by the. sea. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to trust the Commonwealth, and I will show my honorable friend why he is not. He is not prepared to trust the people of South Australia in respect of things which she has done, and on account of which her&#39; conduct has been described - rightly I think - as heroic. I do not intend to enter into details about tick and pieces of sand, and all the rest of it, in one part of the country and another. That is not what we are dealing with. We are dealing with this matter from the stand-point I have suggested ; that is, primarily in the interests of this great Commonwealth. It is a question that rises above these pettifogging and huckstering ideas of a pound or two here and there. We have to follow out the policy which is involved in Australia&#39;s destiny, of securing control over the whole continent, and especially over that great tract of the continent which is. admittedly a source of danger, and which I believe, if the Mother Country is ever in a position of stress and difficulty, will become to us like the heel of Achilles. It would not be a question of agreeing to take over the Territory then. It would be a question of occupation by a foe. I wish to put to honorable senators very briefly what the Territory is that we are dealing with. Those who are opposed to this agreement speak of it as if it were a kind of bargain about a little bit of land somewhere or other ; as though it were a piece of somebody&#39;s back yard which we were about to buy. This continent of ours consists of about 3,000,000 square miles, and the Northern Territory of Australia consist of 523,620 square miles. It comprises over 335,000,000 acres of land. The extent of it is not realizable unless you study it carefully upon the map. It is more than one-sixth of the whole area of this continent. That is what we are dealing with. This Territory, says my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> if it be taken over on the terms agreed upon, will mean the Commonwealth paying <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> for every man, woman, and child in South Australia. That, of course, is simply a fallacious statement which has no relevancy whatever. If you choose to make such a calculation, you must realize that on the other side the Commonwealth will be getting 335,000,000 acres of land. I do not care whether it is worth 5s. or is. an acre. The point is that it lies in the heart of this continent, and for that reason the Commonwealth should get it on any terms. </para>

                            <para>- Of course not. What is the use of coming here with a lot of peddling details and figures with the object of making out the value of a plot of land here and a plot of land there ? Of course, the Northern Territory is like the rest of Australia ; there are good patches and bad patches. I decline to waste the time of the Senate by going into any question as to how much of it is good and how much is bad. I dc* not know whether the statements that have been made on that subject are correct or nod. I see that between two and three hundred thousand square miles are described as first-class pastoral land, well watered, and with an excellent rainfall. I also see on the map the words &#34; Good pastora country &#34; and &#34; Tropical, well-watered country.&#34; About 250,000 square miles are so described. </para>

We know, in addition, that there is vast pastoral and mineral wealth in the Northern Territory.

                            <para>- I will say the unsuccessful management then. Surely it is high time for the Commonwealth to set out to redeem this great tract of country from the blights which&#39; have been pressing down upon it. Speaking again from the national stand-point, I ask : Is this Territory to be left on the shoulders of South Australia as a great burden because that State has been unsuccessful ? Is that the kind of attitude that the representatives of Australia are to assume? </para>

                            <para>- But that is what has been said. South Australia is to get  &#163;10  per head for every man, woman, and child. On the other hand, there are 335,000,000 acres which, on the basis of &#163;4,000,000, works out at 3d. per acre. Will any one stand up in the Senate and say that, as a mere matter of bargaining, the Territory is not worth 3d. per acre? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has remarked,, at a valuation of is. an acre, it would work out at  &#163;&#34;&#39;16.000,000,  which is far more than the indebtedness upon it, plus the cost of the railway. </para>

That is the sort of nonsense with which the honorable senator gets saturated in Sydney over this question. We know very well the views that are entertained over there. I do not wish to distort them. The people of New South Wales are entitled to get the railway to Bourke to connect the back country with that magnificent harbor of Port Jackson if they can. I do not say a word against it. . But I beg of them to cast out these parochial ideas when they are considering this question, and to view it from the larger national stand-point. As I have said, the Commonwealth, under this agreement, is to get 335,000,000 acres at 3d. per acre. </para>

                            <para>- That is something to start with. He would give South Australia &#163;5,000,000. Very well. Would the honorable senator be satisfied if the railway were to run to Bourke? This Territory, it must be remembered, is larger than South Australia proper. It is a magnificent Territory from the particular stand-point of development. There can be no finer sphere for the operations of the Commonwealth Parliament than will be afforded by this Territory, which it is to be hoped in time to come may emerge from the condition of a Territory into that of a State, or two States. Here another important question arises for consideration. To my mind, some of the States are a great deal too large for the management of their population. That remark applies especially to Western Australia and Queensland. The Queenslanders themselves, some years ago, considered that their State ought to be cut into two parts, north and south. It appears to me that it ought to be part of a great national policy to try and influence, if we can - not by force or anything of that sort - the division into a larger number of States of these immense territories, which, if left for development to the States as. they are, and to the populations as they exist, will not grow as they ought to do for many years to come. The position of South Australia in relation to the Northern Territory was this: She held it .for over forty years. It was all that time an appanage of South Australia. It was not part of the province. She was entitled, if she chose, to hand&#39; it back. She was bound to give it back if the Imperial authorities desired it. It is sometimes forgotten that that position was changed on the advent of Federation, when the Northern Territory became part of the State of South Australia. When Federation was being advocated&#39;, she might - and* if she had not been the heroic little State that she has been described as being, she would - have said : &#34; This is merely an appanage; we are not going to have it fixed on to us; we will hand it back to the Imperial authorities ; some other definite and satisfactory arrangement must be made.&#34; But South Australia did1 not do that. She brought the Northern Territory into the Union, and South Australia&#39;s wishes in respect of it -ought on that account to be respected. She behaved, not for the first time either, in relation to the Territory from a high and lofty stand-point. She might if she had chosen have placed the Union in a most serious and embarrassing position if she had not been faithful to the cause of Federation. Is all that to go for nothing? Is not that to be remembered to her advantage? Why does the Commonwealth contemplate taking over the Territory? Not because of any request or anything of that kind on the part of South Australia, but because the national interests demand it. I admit that we have to consider terms, but the reason we contemplate taking it over is because the national interests of the whole people demand it, and a million or two one way or the other is neither here nor there -when the material interests of the whole Commonwealth are concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I intend to say a few words on that point. If we do not see the proposal from that point of view we ought to drop it at once; but the primary reason why the Commonwealth desires to take over the Territory is that in the belief of many persons, of the Government and the Prime Minister, it is essential to our national existence that it should be taken over, and, of course, the Commonwealth has to accept the transfer subject to the debt upon the Territory: There is no generosity or liberality in that to South Australia. As a South Australian, I resent the suggestion about liberality of any sort. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend put it in a perfectly candid and large-minded way, and took one objection to which I intend to refer in a moment. But that is the position. The Commonwealth should, in addition to taking over the Territory subject to the debt,  do that which is equitable and just. If we believe that the land is worth only 3d. per acre the Commonwealth will get. full value for its money. But if we believe, as we do, that even from that low stand-point - that of a bargain as to a piece of ground - it is worth infinitely more, then the Commonwealth and the people of every State will get a very handsome bargain. They will derive, as they ought to do, a very large profit. South Australia, if she were in a position to insist on terms, as she might like to do, might very properly say, &#34;Well, you must pay me a fair adequate price if you take over this Territory, merely in purchase of a certain number of acres of land.&#34; But that is not how either of the parties is looking, or ought to look, at it. It is not a bargain of that kind- It seems to me that, because many of my honorable friends, without any intention to take a view against that put forward by the Government or by South Australia, look upon this as though it was a purchase of that character, they are misled into opposition to the Bill. Of course, if they were to look at it from that point of view, then I admit that it would be proper to go into the <inline font-style="italic">pros</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">cons.&#39;,</inline> and to send up, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> said, a commission or some valuators to make a valuation, and determine how much ought </para>

But that is not a method to be adopted between two high contracting parties like the Commonwealth and South Australia, which has associated with her, not as a part of her, but as an appanage, a great Territory which it is proper should become  a  Territory of the Commonwealth.

                            <para>- I am very glad to hear that, and I hope that the honorable senator will vote for the Bill. I do not deny that South Australia - and I do not think it is at all a reflection on the State - has found, and may for some years to come find, the task of developing and governing this great Territory much more than she can well bear. I do not think it necessary for a moment to contest that there must be a motive for each of the contracting parties entering into an agreement of this kind. That, on the part of the Commonwealth, is to round off, if I may so express it, the enormous continent for which it is responsible. The motive on the part of South Australia is to pass on to a greater power the responsibility for its development, because she, with her 400,000 people, is not in such a position as is the Commonwealth to bring out all the possible prosperity of that great country and to make it what it ought to be, a strength instead of a weakness to the Commonwealth. But I shall put aside the question of the land altogether. It has to be remembered that South Australia is entitled to further consideration, because for forty-five years, under circumstances of great difficulty, sometimes under circumstances of almost dire distress she has striven for the development and the improvement of the Territory to the best of her ability. She has built roads, railways, and jetties, provided harbors, and made experiments and improvements of all kinds in order to encourage settlement and to ascertain what the best kind of settlement would be. She has also opened to navigation the magnificent rivers in the Territory, and she has done all that at an enormous cost to her population. </para>

                            <para>- He is like the people in New South Wales, who will not build a railway eight miles long in the north of that great State because it would allow the producers to take their goods to a nearer port. If the line were built, the goods would not go to Sydney. That is the kind of spirit in which this great agreement between the State and the Commonwealth is treated there. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has interjected, South Australia has prepared&#39; the way, has made the path straight for those who are to come after us in this development. And more than that, the citizens of South Australia, the State not alone, but in conjunction with others, have expended their money, and for the matter of that, have poured out their blood and lost their lives in doing their utmost to open up and make a beginning in the development and prosperity of this Territory. Is all&#39; that to be forgotten- </para>

                            <para>- They acknowledge all that, but they are not going to reward it. They say &#34; Thank you,&#34; but they want to take it all for nothing. They say, &#34; What a monstrous thing it is that South Australia should suggest that there should be at some time or other a railway to link up that part of Australia with which its people have been connected for nearly fifty years.&#34; My honorable friend says &#34; No. We will not recognise what you have done. We will take all your land. We say it is worthless. But even admitting that it is an equivalent for the money which we will have to pay and spend on the railway, still we think that you are making a monstrous request when you ask that there should be built at some time or other a railway to connect the south and the north of this great country which bisects the continent.&#34; These constitute the grounds on which I think we may all fairly look at the question. The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> from his point of view, made a broader estimate of the position than that taken by other speakers. One point was that under the arrangement for taking over the Territory a railway - not the railway, not any specific railway - has to be constructed. That is where a great mistake has been made. This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> said &#34; a specified railway. &#39; &#39; A railway has to be constructed from the north to the south of this acquired Territory of over half-a-million square miles, but it is not to be constructed now. The position has been contested as though this agreement would bind the Commonwealth to immediately set about - tomorrow or next year, I suppose - the building of a railway by a specified route. That is not so at all. In this agreement there is not a single word I have been able to find fixing upon a specified route for this railway, or saying that it is to be built at any particular time. </para>

                            <para>- Here I may be allowed to say that my trust and faith in the Parliament are exactly the same as to this arrangement as they were in regard to another arrangement which we debated a few days ago. I am not asking that this agreement if passed should be put into the Constitution. The demand in the other case was that a certain agreement should be embodied in the Constitution. I said that we might put it into the Constitution for a term, but that we should trust the Parliament after that term to do what was right. I say now that I do not want this agreement put into the Constitution ; I trust the Parliament. Let honorable senators pass this Bill, and I trust absolutely to the Federal Parliament to honour this piece of legislation, and do under it what is just and right, exactly as I endeavoured - unsuccessfully, I admit, and I make no complaint - to induce some of my honorable friends to trust the Parliament as to the financial agreement. </para>

But if he votes for the Bill he should do as I do, and trust the Parliament to carry out the agreement.

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is picking out a particular condition of the agreement. The two contracting parties have made an agreement, as was done in the case of the financial agreement. I never questioned the financial agreement. I never sought to alter any of its terms, and I do not take up any different position with respect to this agreement. This Parliament must accept or reject the agreement, and I say that if we accept it, I am prepared to trust the Parliament to carry it out without having it put into the Constitution. If the Parliament says, &#34; We will not have this railway,&#34; those who desire the railway will have to submit. I can assure my honorable friends that I am not making these observations with any feeling of antagonism, because of a difference of opinion with regard to the railway provision. I am asking consideration of these points because I felt when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> was speaking that it was being assumed that we were being asked to pledge the Commonwealth to the construction of a definite line. </para>

                            <para>- I say no, though my honorable friend may take a different view. Nor is Parliament being asked to pledge itself to construct the railway within any specified time. If in 20, 30, or 50 years Parliament feels justified in constructing this railway, there will be no reason why it should not do so. The people of South Australia, as they are perfectly entitled to do, say, &#34; We think that the Territory which belonged to us for fifty years, which we have done our best to govern and develop, ought to be linked up with us. It is only fair that a line bisecting the continent north and south should be constructed &#34; - I think myself that such a line is a great national undertaking, which must come about some day or other - &#34; That is the only condition we make.

                    <para class="block">Australia are perfectly entitled to say that, when they leave the construction of the line in the widest way possible to the Federal Parliament in the future. When my honorable friends talk of a definite line I should like to know what they would regard as a fair limit of deviation for a railway. What is the width of this Territory ? From one degree of longitude on the west to another on the east it stretches for 560 miles, and all that is asked is that the line shall cross the 26th parallel of latitude within that distance. Yet we are told that South Australia is asking that the Commonwealth should be pledged to something unreasonable. The railway might be brought close to the borders of Queensland and New South Wales. </para>

I can find nothing in the agreement which would prevent the Commonwealth Parliament, before it decides to construct this line to suit the wishes of South Australia, constructing any of the other railways which have been suggested. If it should appear to be more advantageous that it should do so, the Commonwealth has, a free hand. It might construct a line to connect with Cammoweal, or some place in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is asking me to say what would be regarded as a breach of faith, but the honorable senator knows what politics are just as well as I do. I say that there is nothing in the agreement to prevent any other  railway being constructed. Of course, my honorable friends will not contend that some provision should be included in this agreement to bind the Commonwealth to construct a railway into another State&#39; independent of the Northern Territory altogether. I do not hesitate to say emphatically that my opinion is that the railway should be constructed from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. This agreement was not favorably viewed in South Australia at one time. I opposed it very strongly indeed before a large gathering in the Adelaide Town Hall, and chiefly on the ground that it did not specifically provide for the continuation of the railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. One very strong reason why South Australia might ask for that is that she has already spent over&#163;2,000,000 in building a railway to Oodnadatta absolutely as part of the contemplated transcontinental line. </para>

                                is wrong. It is a long time since the honorable senator was acquainted with the geography of that part of the Commonwealth, though it was familiar to him at one time, I know.

                            <para>-  Of course, the Parliament is the supreme Court of the nation. This is a matter which would have to be decided by the Parliament. South Australia might very properly, when it thought an opportune time had arrived, ask that the line should be constructed. But whatever was proposed would have to be submitted to the Parliament, and we must trust the Parliament. If South Australia were obstreperous, the Commonwealth Parliament could repeal the Statute. But we trust the Parliament to do what is just, and not to say, &#34; We have made this bargain with you, and we will not construct the railway for a hundred years.&#34; When it is reasonable that the line should be constructed, a proposal to that effect will be submitted to Parliament. As my honorable friends agree with the fundamental proposition that the taking over of the Northern Territory is a national necessity, I ask them to think of the position in which they will place themselves by rejecting this agreement. While we are haggling over the question - if it be merely a matter of terms which is involved - some great trouble may be precipitated, and the Commonwealth will then find itself without that control which it ought to have over what is an integral part of the Commonwealth. Our safety may be menaced in that quarter, the integrity of the Commonwealth may be shaken, and yet we shall be powerless to do  a  single thing in the direction of complying with the first necessity of development by increasing our population in that portion of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> said that before he assented to the Bill, he wanted to know what kind of population would go there. Of course, I recognise that he was not serious in his remark, and I cannot profess to tell him what is going to happen. Like everything else in connexion with the development of the Territory, that must be left to the Commonwealth Parliament. But I can tell him that if the agreement be rejected, South Australia &#34;must necessarily be driven to do something to lessen the burden which in the interests of Australia she has hitherto carried. She has held the fort for a White Australia all these years. I know, and other honorable senators know, that many years ago an Act was passed by the South Australian Parliament authorizing the importation of coolies into the Territory, and my belief is that if effect had been given to that Act, we should have had  a  very different tale to tell of Northern Australia to-day. I believe that we should have had tropical products and prosperity there. But the sentiment of South Australia was so strongly opposed to the importation of coloured labour that the Act remained a dead letter, to the loss, I think, of the South Australian Exchequer. Now, of course, that State is hampered and controlled in respect of an immigration policy by the national policy. But although South Australia held her hand a year or two ago in connexion with the land-grant railway project, although she desisted from adopting that method of opening up the Northern Territory in order to permit of an agreement being entered into in  1906,  she cannot always be expected to pursue the same course. Opposed as I am to land-grant railway construction, I am prepared, should this agreement fail, and should there be no other alternative open to South Australia, to do all that I can to bring about railway construction within the Northern Territory by some means or other,  and  if by no other means, by a land-grant system. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> detest that system, but 1 say there are evils and evils, and that South Australia must take some step to lessen the burden which she is now carrying, and to open up that country. </para>

                                sentiments are my own. I merely say that should this agreement fail, many of us who opposed these land grant efforts, and who were instrumental in bringing the negotiations in  1906  to an end, thus suspending the acceptance of the tender which was then received until an attempt had been made to induce the Commonwealth to take over the Territory, will be forced to change our line of action in order that something may be done to assist in developing that country.

                            <para>- But South Australia has done a great deal more than merely occupy the half-million square miles which it is proposed to surrender to the Commonwealth - a great deal which ought to be recognised. Where a tenant has done excellently with an owner&#39;s estate he is not usually turned nut without any allowance being made to him for the improvements which he has effected. On the contrary, he is treated fairly, if not liberally. South Australia will have to do something should this agreement fail, and, if the Northern Territory must be acquired by the Commonwealth sooner or later, is it not better that we should acquire it now ? </para>

                            <para>- I disclaim that. If it should seem that I am speaking simply on behalf of South Australia, I have failed in my remarks this afternoon. I am speaking as a citizen of the Commonwealth. I have frankly admitted that the transfer of the Northern Territory will relieve South Australia of a task which is too big for her - a task which 400,000 people cannot possibly undertake, and which, perhaps, 4,000,000 cannot adequately discharge. I decline to discuss questions relating to a patch of land here or there as though we were purchasing a small estate. We are doing nothing of the kind. If we were purchasing the Northern Territory as so much land, so much river, so much swamp, and so much forest, we should be getting 335,000,000 acres for  about 3d. per acre. If any syndicate in the world were powerful enough to undertake its development its members would jump at such a proposition. All of us, poor though we may be, would find our mouths watering at such a prospect. But I have stated the position from a broad, national stand-point. I would rather that the Bill were rejected than that its acceptance were based on the ground that the Commonwealth in taking over the Northern Territory will be conferring a favour on South Australia. It is no favour that the Commonwealth will grant to that State. We shall be getting a new province added to the Commonwealth. That is the stand-  point from which I view this matter. I do not ignore the fact that by the transfer of the Territory South Australia will be relieved of a great burden which she cannot possibly continue to carry. It is upon these grounds that I earnestly hope that the Bill will be carried, and that the agreement embodied in it will be ratified. If that be done it will be the finest and noblest testimony we have yet given to the world that this Parliament can think conscientiously. It will be the best testimony we have yet given to the world that we have the capacity to govern a great country, the very best evidence we can offer that we mean to dwell in our own land from east to west, from north to south, as Commonwealth citizens, and that we mean to occupy all of it effectively, none daring to make us afraid. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot allow a division to be taken on the motion for the second reading of this Bill without saying a few words. I am almost afraid to speak, because I have been ordered not to do so. I also feel a great responsibility in following my dear friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> He has made a strong case out of a bad one.  It grieves me to have to speak in such strong terms about the matter, because I acknowledge that I should be delighted to vote for the Commonwealth taking over the Northern Territory on other conditions. Forty years ago, or more, the people of South Australia had great ideals and very proper aspirations. They&#39; decided to build a transcontinental railway. Thirty years since I was one of three men who undertook to build what was called the first section of the line from Port Augusta to Government Gums. There was 200 miles of line in the one section. Naturally, I took a keen interest in the country in which we were working, and I have taken an interest in it ever since. I have also been over a great part of Northern Quensland, and at a time when travelling in that country was downright pioneering. As I understand it. no one in this Senate is opposed to taking over the Northern Territory. The whole difficulty lies in the matter of committing this Commonwealth to a dreadful bargain. South Australia, of course, has found that the work of developing the Territory is too great. Practically, she has had to abandon it. The Commonwealth must, therefore, be extremely careful in what it does. Of course, if the Commonwealth hereafter came to the conclusion that the continuation of the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek would be the best method of developing the Territory she would adopt it, but I am so bitterly opposed to that view that I desire to leave the Commonwealth Parliament with a free hand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has referred to the narrowness and paltriness of the views of those who sustain this position. Well, I am not committed to the Government on this matter. They have not bound me, nor have they asked me to support this agreement as a <inline font-style="italic">sine qua non.</inline></para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">It would be ridiculous to expect supporters of the Government to pledge themselves to such terms. The members of our party were never consulted about the matter. It is, therefore, the duty of every honorable senator to justify his own vote to his constituents. If I did not feel very strongly I should not dream of opposing this Bill, but as I do feel strongly I am bound to do so. Any one who will carefully study the map of the Northern Territory will see that the railway has been built so far west as to make it impossible to connect it with trunk lines in the other States. The country beyond Oodnadatta is a kind of <inline font-style="italic">terra incognita.</inline> I have been over it, but it is known to very few. The fact that it has been open for nearly a century and is not yet occupied indicates the kind of country that it is. The truth is that it is quite unsuitable for settlement. </para>

                            <para>- The great point is that it would be impossible to connect the projected railway with lines in other States, whereas if the Territory were taken over and the Commonwealth were to build a line across the continent it would be a good scheme. I should be heartily in favour of that. If the line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek were run down to the Queensland border, it would be infinitely more advantageous to the people of the Commonwealth than would the continuation of the line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta. </para>

                            <para>- That interjection hints that I am interested. I am not. I have properties on the Georgiana, the Flinders, and the McKinley, but they are hundreds of miles from the route of the railway I have suggested. We have a railway practically at our doors, and send down our stuff to Townsville, as the Queensland senators know. I repeat that if we want to develop this country, we must build our line to the east, 500 miles away from the route of the Pine Creek-Oodnadatta connexion. Why should the Commonwealth be compelled to build a railway over worthless country when, by a deviation to the east, we could connect the railway with four or five places communicating with populous centres? </para>

                            <para>- We want railways to develop the Commonwealth, not a certain portion of land where nothing will grow. We are here to do the best we can for the people of Australia. It is not our duty to build railways in uninhabitable, and, more or less, desert country where there is no rainfall, and only sand and drift. Surely it is better to build a line connecting with occupied country ? It would be infinitely better and wiser for the Commonwealth to take over the Territory, recoup the Government of South Australia for the expenditure incurred in running the railway from beyond Quorn to Oodnadatta, and then break up the line; which is no good. </para>

If I were a millionaire who had undertaken the task of developing the Northern Territory as a &#34; spec,&#34; I would pay the South Australian Government for what she has incurred on the line from 50 miles or so beyond Quorn, and then I would take up the rails. Having done that, I would extend the railway from Port Augusta to Pine Creek to the east, so that it could be connected up with settled portions of the country. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in good seasons. Surely we want no better evidence of the nature, of the country in question than the fact that it is unoccupied, whilst the country to the east is settled by happy and prosperous people. The reason is that one part of the country is more or less of a waste, while the other is habitable. Furthermore, a line built further to the eastwards, could be more cheaply constructed, because four or five sections could be commenced together, whereas, if we had to commence from two ends, many years would be occupied in the work. What a nice condition we should be in if Australia were invaded, and the troops from Townsville, Brisbane, Rockhampton, Newcastle, and Sydney, had to be sent round by Adelaide in order to get to the north. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gwynneth,</inline> who was* our engineer when we were building the line, has distributed maps, and so has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson,</inline> of New South Wales. The former is a very clever engineer, who understands his work, and he strongly recommends the line to the eastward. He says that its construction would not be at all serious or expensive, and that it would be a dreadful thing for the Commonwealth to do anything else. I sincerely hope that no honorable senator will support this proposal. </para>

                            <para>- On the southern side of Camooweal there is good country, but when you get away from that point the vast bulk of the land is not suitable for settlement as the map indicates. The good country is occupied with sheep and cattle, and is being developed. Moreover water is very scarce over the great area of the country north of Quorn. For five years we had to employ seven or eight engines in pumping water from great depths. For three or four days our eng&#39;ines would be in the hospital getting repaired, so bad was the water. Further, if our bullock yokes were not put on end against each o&#39;:her, in the morning they would be covered with drift sand. People in this part of the Commonwealth have no conception of the state of that country. My suggestion is that some future generation should be left to deal with this problem after a thorough survey of the country has been made. I should dearly like to be able to help South Australia. It grieves me &#34;to have to oppose good senators and good people, but in the interests of the Commonwealth T do hope that this project will not be carried out. Certainly it is a matter of great public importance, but it should be left to be determined after due inquiries have been made into the character and possibilities of the country. The best men who could be found in the States should be sent out to inspect it. If what we say is not true, let the truth be ascertained, but do not let us now commit the Commonwealth to the expenditure of  &#163;10,000,000.  If I were the dictator of this country, I would tell honorable senators where that money could1 be expended with immense advantage and yield a very good return. We should be no better off after we. had built the railway. Suppose that an emergency arose, and we had to send round our troops to Port Darwin, the country would be taken before we could get our men there. The proposal will not bear examination. What an eminently clever man <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is in  making a good case out of a very bad one ! I should not be greatly opposed to the Commonwealth telling South Australia that it would pay the cost of a line from beyond Quorn to Oodnadatta, and the cost incurred up to date. But by all means leave the Commonwealth to deal with the development of the Territory in a proper fashion. As regards population, I would point out that if the line were built in the way I suggest,  10,000,000  persons would be nothing to settle along it. You could carry, perhaps,  40,000,000  extra sheep in that part of the Commonwealth if you had a railway constructed to develop it. As wool is getting scarce all over the world, that is the best thing you could do. You would have then any quantity of products to export, and the country would be settled by a prosperous and contented people </para>

He not only did his utmost to convince us who listened to him, but he laboured, evidently strenuously, to convince himself. - He refused to discuss milsons, but every acre pf land worth an alleged threepence could be reckoned up with a nicety of arithmetic which would have done honour to a skilled pedagogue or a chartered .accountant. I was a little sorry, that he went so far as he did, because he did not, in mv humble opinion, deal fairly with the question. He would insist that the line which forms the chief feature of the whole project could be built practically anywhere so long as it passed through the northern boundary of South Australia.

                            <para>- No, the only possible line which can be built. It was pointed out to me that all the land between the proposed railway eastward to the borders of Queensland and New South Wales consists of tremendous sandhills through which it is utterly impossible to construct a railway. I allowed this gentleman to convince me if he could, but he did not succeed. I congratulate him on his eloquence. He was very kind in giving me a lot of information, he was most courteous, but he certainly satisfied me that to the eastward of the proposed line through the centre of the Territory, you could not construct railways because of the terrible nature of the sandhills. As regards carrying a line to the westward, that is really too absurd, of course, to be discussed, because you would be merely throwing it utterly out of the reach of civilization, you would be throwing it into a country of&#39; which no man living seems to know anything. Nothing is shown on the map. This is a no-man&#39;s land. Those who have ventured into it have, in many cases, never returned. Others have been more fortunate. It is pathetic to hear the appeals which are made about the value of the Territory. How is it that when it was settled by the British Government about  100  years ago in the best watered portions it was shortly afterwards abandoned and has never been re-settled ?  If you look up the maps of the northern portion of the Territory, starting some years back, you will find that there have been fresh names plotted, and for the same areas, year in and year out. Twelve or thirteen years ago I took up 4,000 square miles of the country, so that I ought to know something about it. I took up at 6d. per square mile per annum what was alleged to be the pick of that portion of the Territory. It included an abandoned cattle station, that had been owned by a <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Brown,</inline> and was known as the Delamere station. There was a fine stone house on it, but it was all abandoned when I took it up. , </para>

                            <para>- For grazing and mining purposes. What I wanted to do thirteen or fourteen years ago is on the <inline font-style="italic">tapis</inline> now . amongst some of the large run-holders there. I wanted to see a port, a township, and meat works established on the Victoria River, and there seemed to be a prospective chance in connexion with minerals. When I was in London a few years ago a great gold property in the Territory was floated with a capital of &#163;3,000,000, and the shares were put off at a premium. The thing was underwritten and offered to the public at &#163;3  10s.,  a premium of  &#163;2 1  os. making the value of the property  &#163;10,000,000.  No one ever got anything out of it except the pleasure of paying calls. I do not suppose that the place could now be found on a map. All the timber has been eaten out by the ants, and the place over-run with vegetation. </para>

                            <para>- No, I had nothing to do with it, but I read about it in the English newspapers from day to day. I was interviewed about it, but I could not give any information, because I knew nothing. However, that is by the way. There is no doubt that portions of the country are good, and well watered, but this project is launched here on half-a-dozen different grounds. It is advocated, first, for defence purposes; second, because the Territory is of immense value; and, third, because South Australia cannot carry the baby any longer. These are three of the leading reasons which are put forward for our not doing an act of charity, but approving of this agreement. It does strike me as a most remarkable thing that a proprietor, having in his possession something of which he can make no use, and the cost of maintaining which is draining his pockets and beggaring him, should ask another proprietor to take it off his hands, pay all his liabilities and then insist that he shall spend millions upon it. I have looked up the position of the Northern Territory. Speaking in round figures, it seems to me that the debt on the Northern Territory plus interest is about &#163;3,500,000. Then there is to be added the cost of the Oodnadatta railway, which stands at about  &#163;5,500,000.  I speak subject to correction. </para>

                            <para>- They would probably be nothing to the honorable senator when he wishes to&#39; have that sum voted. But it is my business, and it is the business of the other members of the Senate, to see that the people of the Commonwealth are not lightly rushed into the most serious responsibility they have yet .been asked to take in this Parliament. To show the absolute recklessness of this proposal, some honorable senators are seeking to secure approval of a proposition, which, at least, would involve the Commonwealth in an indebtedness of &#163;10,000,000. I remind honorable senators that in connexion with the valuation of the transferred properties we have had some of the highest officers- in the employment of the Commonwealth with professional assistance engaged for years trying to arrive at a valuation where the total amount involved is not more than &#163;5,000,000. Here we are being asked to vote &#163;10,000,000 or more without the smallest information from anybody but the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of those who have interest in promoting or in opposing the proposition. The proposition is one which appals me. I find  a  number of members of the Legislature banded together to force through Parliament  a  proposal &#39;involving &#163;10.000,000 or &#163;12,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend has been a good old supporter of Canberra. After having saved the situation, and having secured that the principal avenue of the new Capital will be named after him because of his magnificent patriotic services in connexion with that question, it is a pity that the honorable senator should now attempt to belittle himself. I am reminded by his interjection of another which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to the effect that a gentleman from Sydney, with narrow selfishness, tried to get the Federal Capital established right off. Let me say in reply that an honorable senator from Hobart, with an equally narrow selfishness, has tried for years to prevent the fulfilment of one of the best known conditions of the Federal Constitution. From the last information we have on the subject, we learn that there is an annual loss of &#163;175,000 a year on the 150 miles of railway from Palmerston or Port Darwin to Pine Creek. That is as nearly as possible an annual loss per mile of &#163;1,200. We are asked not only to take over that line, but to pay for it, although it will be of no value to us The line from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta will be of no value to us if we get it-, because it is. built on a  3  ft.  6  in. gauge, and we could not use a  3  ft.  6  in. line for the transport of troops, horses, and supplies in a country through which we would have to earn&#39; food and water. Are honorable senators aware that the railway from Palmerston to Pine Creek is built with iron sleepers, because the white ants ate out the wooden sleepers as fast as they were laid down ? Those iron sleepers would not be worth twopence to us for any purpose. They would be too short for a standard gauge line. To say that we should pay the full price for a railway that has no prospective usefulness for the Commonwealth is a liberal enough proposition without asking us to build a railway over the rest of the distance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> very properly pointed out that it is a perfect absurdity from a defence stand-point. The honorable senator used an argument which I intended to use, but I hope I may amplify his observation without being considered guilty of plagiarism. If we require to. take troops to Port Darwin for defence purposes, they have to be transported for. an enormous distance from the larger centres of population of the Commonwealth. I take Sydney as fairly representing the centre of the population settled in the eastern portion of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- From Sydney to Adelaide the distance by rail is about  1,000  miles, from Adelaide to Port Augusta  250  miles, from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta  700  miles, from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek at least  1,100  miles, and from Pine Creek to Port  Darwin  or Palmerston  150  miles. This makes a total of  3,200  miles from about the centre of the eastern settled portions of Australia to the point that it is proposed to defend. I ask any man who knows anything of the handling of men, horses, cannon, goods, forage, and water, to say nothing of ammunition, whether it would be possible to transport them successfully over  3,200  miles of railway built on three different gauges, and for the &#34;greater part of the way on a narrow gauge? The New South Wales railways are built on -the  4  ft. 8&#163; in. gauge, through Victoria, and through part of South Australia the gauge is  5  ft.  3  in., and for the rest of the way the Une would be of a  3  ft. 6 in. gauge. I should like to have the opinion of such a man as Colonel Foster, the military lecturer of the Sydney University, as to the possibility of moving troops and horses such a distance on railways built on three different gauges, and with most of it  a  narrow gauge. What would1 the horses be like when they got to the end of the journey? They would be &#34; puffed &#34; beyond recovery, and would not have a leg to stand on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> accurately gauged the situation from the defence stand-point when he drew attention to the impossibility of carrying out the defence of Port Darwin by the transport of troops from the eastern portion of the Commonwealth by  a  narrow-gauge railway through a desert. That it is a desert no one can deny. </para>

                            <para>- All that has been built so far of the proposed transcontinental line has been constructed on a narrow gauge. I have been arguing that the Commonwealth is being asked to pay the full price for railways which will have t. be destroyed. The earthworks will remain, but the sleepers, rails and rolling stock will have to be provided anew. If, on the other hand, a line were constructed further east than the proposed agreement will permit, the New South Wales lines could be linked up with it and the Queensland lines could be connected with &#39; it, at least from the points of transfer from the  3  ft. 6 in. gauge to the  4  ft. 8J in. gauge upon which any trunk line must be built. It is well known that on lines of  3  ft. 6 in. gauge trains cannot travel more than about  25  or  30  miles per hour. </para>

                            <para>- Then my honorable friends have enjoyed travelling under circumstances which are opposed to the testimony of the best engineering experts. It stands to reason that the possession of the whole of the Northern Territory is not necessary to the Commonwealth for defence purposes. As a matter of fact, its possession would be a burden rather than an advantage to the Commonwealth. For -the purposes of defence, the possession of a few- points only are necessary. But instead, it is proposed that we should take over an immense area - an area equal to one-sixth of that of Australia. For what can it be utilized? I have been told by a gentleman whom I regard as a high authority that if this line were &#39;constructed sheep stations could be established throughout the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator cannot point to any period at which more than a mere handful of whites 6826 <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Acceptance Bill.</inline> have remained in the Northern Territory. The climate is too &#34; enthusiastic. &#39; &#39; India has been a possession of the British Crown for Heaven knows how long; settlements of white people formerly existed in the tropics of America, the Dutch have been resident in Java for a long time, and so throughout the equatorial belt of the world the whites have been the masters, but they have never been anything more. They have never lived there in any numbers. They have been bosses, overseers, and buccaneers, but never settlers. I say, God help every useful effort to develop Australia in all its parts ! But those who sincerely wish to push forward the development of the Northern Territory must recognise that in such a tropical country, where there is a heavy rainfall - it is about the best watered portion of Australia with the exception of Cairns on the eastern coast - a tremendous heat is experienced as well as a tremendous rainfall, which produce conditions eminently unsuitable to the white races, who are accustomed to cooler latitudes. What do our friends from Tasmania say about the splendours of the Tasmanian climate? Why do they go into ecstasies over that climate? Because it is cooler than is the mainland. We know, too, that the residents of the southern portion of Australia like to point to the splendid climate which they enjoy, because it enables them to do things which cannot be done in warmer latitudes. It will be remembered that only a few years ago a Sydney newspaper published the opinions of prominent men in that city and in Melbourne in regard to which was likely to be the future commercial capital of Australia. On that occasion one of the unfailing arguments used by Melbourne merchants was that the climate of this city was much more suited to the white race than is the alleged enervating climate of Sydney, and that consequently Melbourne must always outrun any bid for commercial supremacy which Sydney might make. But the Northern Territory is about the hottest spot in Australia. I know the Gulf country, which is hot enough. I have also had experience of Thursday Island and the whole of the Queensland coast. I have known it intimately for nearly thirty years. I am also acquainted with the west coast of Australia as far as Derby, but I can truthfully say that I have never struck any place quite so hot as is Port Darwin, although I visited it during the cool portion of the year. The heat which I experienced there was quite equal to that of Colombo. </para>

                            <para>- I was there a fortnight, and I never struck a climate more enervating. As illustrating this, I may mention a little incident which occurred during my visit. I was wearing an ordinary pith helmet, such as most men wear in Queensland, and when I proposed to leave the hotel at about  2  o&#39;clock in the afternoon the proprietress positively forbade me to do so without first securing some better protection from the sun. That was in May. The incident ended with my being informed that I must not go out into the sun until I had purchased a pith hat nearly the size of an umbrella and almost three-quarters of an inch thick. I should not have gone  100  yards along the streets of Port Darwin if I had not had some equally useful covering. </para>

                            <para>- Such interjections are calculated to prolong my remarks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> took great credit for South Australia for her plucky action in taking over the Northern Territory, and spending money upon it. I regret that he is not now present, because I would like to remind him of the fact that, until a not very distant date, the Northern Territory was attached to New South Wales. I remember perfectly well when it was taken over by South Australia. Apart from the building of the overland telegraph line, and the construction of  150  miles of railway in the northern portion of the Territory, South Australia has not succeeded in developing that country at all. Indeed, she has done nothing more than attempt to lease its lands. It is true that she has used it to make experiments in plants, which have become the most obnoxious of weeds - vegetable pests which are now destroying even the natural scrub of the country. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely pointing out that the Northern Territory has been absolutely neglected by South Australia. The same Birds Protection Act which operates in Adelaide also operates at Port Darwin, with the result that, as the mating and breeding seasons in the two places occur at different periods of the year, the Statute is a dead letter at Port Darwin. Now, after forty years of neglect, South Australia asks the Commonwealth to take this load of indebtedness off her hands, and to build her an immense railway into the bargain. It is all very well to say the line is intended for the development of the Territory, but is it intended for the development of the Commonwealth ? In what way can the projected railway be of any advantage to the Commonwealth? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> and myself have both endeavoured to show that from a defence stand-point, the line would be absolutely useless. </para>

                            <para>- In addition, it cannot be connected with the main railway systems of Australia. The only advantage that can accrue to any one from the building of the line is that it will open up some part of the Northern Territory said to be suitable for sheep farming, and bring wool to Adelaide or Port Augusta. Beyond that it is impossible to say that there is anything in the project. It will be of no use to the rest of the Commonwealth. But the rest of the Commonwealth is asked to pay for the benefit of the little commerce of Port Augusta. As to there being a lot of good land there, such is evidently not the case. The map shows patches of occupation at the top end, and that is all. Then comes the question of who is to foot the bill? I do not want to drag in the interest of one State as against another, but nevertheless it is the duty of this Chamber to consider that aspect of the case. We are here to represent the interests of the States, not those of any class of people. Those interests are looked after elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- It is the function of this Senate under the Constitution to protect the interests of the different States. Therefore,  1  am merely doing a duty in considering the actual burden that is to be put upon the different States. If this affair is to cost not less than&#163;12,000,000 - and it can cost no less - more than one-sixth of that must come out of the pockets of the people of the State that sends me here. I cannot regard that as a matter of no consequence, to be voted upon without inquiry and knowledge. We must have more information on this subject. With that object in view it is my intention to move an amendment upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I do not like to vote against the measure. That would look like an act of unfriendliness where no unfriendliness is intended. If I can discharge my duty in a friendly way without voting against the second reading, I shall do that which appeals to my better nature, and will also, I hope, appeal to the distinguished statesman who is piloting this Bill in its difficult course through this Chamber. I, therefore, intend to move that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report. </para>

                            <para>- That is not my business. Does the honorable senator buy a piece of machinery without examining it? Does he buy a horse or a cow without inspecting it? We are asked to buy a&#163;12.000,000 pig in a poke, and I want to have it examined. No sensible man enters into an engagement without examination. Are we to put aside common prudence, and every business instinct that differentiates a man from an animal? We are asked blindly to vote an enormous sum of money, the like of which has not been under the consideration of this Parliament before. We are asked to &#34;go it blind,&#34; to use a colloquialism. I cannot see my way to do so. We spend hours in the Senate debating matters which, compared with this, are the puniest trifles that could be considered even in a nursery. I may say at once that I could not serve on the Committee. I have some other things to think about. Therefore, it cannot be thrust at me - as some might attempt to do - that 6828 <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Acceptance Bill.</inline></para>

I would not go into this Northern Territory country, as it would be necessary for the Committee to go, for any sum of money. It may be that the Committee would be able to discover facts bearing out the enthusiastic assertions of the advocates of this Bill. I am sure I . hope so. I may this afternoon have unintentionally made representations that may be shown to be to some extent incorrect. I am not aware of them, but it is possible. In like manner we have had statements - and shall have more of them - from the advocates of the proposal, made in good faith, and equally likely to be lacking in some of the essentials of accuracy. The essentials of accuracy in this matter are not to be minimized. I am averse to Australia taking over the Northern Territory, when no one can tell me what is going to be done with it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> is the only senator who has made anything like a suggestion. He says that if we take over the Northern Territory we can run a horse-farm with  500  mares.

                        <para>. - I have very little to say upon this Bill. - What strikes me chiefly is the helplessness of the Commonwealth, with reference to this enormous Territory. It is part of the continent of Australia, yet it is practically under no effective control. It is dangerously accessible to outsiders, who might be hostile in their intentions. For that reason it; ought to be, if possible, under the control of the Commonwealth Parliament. It ought to be under the control of such an authority as could be reasonably expected to make an effective effort to secure its occupation. Its present unoccupied state is a constant menace to the safety of the Commonwealth. That is, I think, a reason for making a very great sacrifice for the purpose of securing it. For many years the people of South Australia have made a most valiant effort, with their necessary limited means, to develop the Territory, and the fact that they have not been more successful is due not to their lack of desire, but to their lack of means. In their efforts they have been put to a very considerable expense - an expense which so small a community could indeed very ill afford. Therefore, without regard to the question of whether the expenditure was well or ill advised, I think that we should willingly recoup the State for any expenditure which it undertook in its effort to maintain the integrity of the Commonwealth. That is my view with reference to the desirability of taking over the Territory. But, having agreed to take it over, and to be anything but huckstering in considering the price, it ought to be transferred to us absolutely free from any restriction. As the Bill contains provisions compelling us to take over a railway which we may or may not require, and to build a railway in what may or may not be the most suitable position, I </para>

I shall be glad if we can arrive at such a decision in Committee as will enable me to vote for the third reading. I know of no greater question to the people of the Commonwealth than the acquisition of the Northern Territory, and the necessity of taking immediate steps to secure its efficient occupation. I am prepared, as my remarks will show, not to go into the question of the millions to be paid. The point is that the Territory ought to be taken over at such cost as it has entailed on the people of South Australia, whatever that may be, but that when it is taken over it ought to be under the control of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that the Ministry have seen fit to bring forward this important measure at such a late period of the session as to almost prevent the proper consideration of the terms of the agreement which it asks the Senate to ratify. In his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> drew attention to the enormous area of the Territory. The facts which he mentioned satisfied me  conclusively that an important measure of this kind should have been submitted at a time when it would have been possible for us to examine all the details and incidental obligations, in order to arrive at a just decision in the general interests of the Commonwealth. At present, the Senate has not the necessary time at its disposal to deal with the measure as it deserves. </para>

                    <para class="block">Understanding that an amendment is likely to be carried which will make the Bill more equitable, and certainly more Federal in spirit, I have decided to curtail my remarks. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has made a most unjustifiable and inexcusable attack on the general policy of New South Wales. If there is one State which has been generous in regard to Commonwealth obligations and necessities, it has been New South Wales. It is not only untrue, but ungenerous, for a representative of South Australia to speak of New South Wales as a selfish and grasping State, considering what she has done for the Commonwealth at large. </para>

                            <para>- Time will not allow me to go into that question or into the details of this Bill. I believe that New South Wales is quite favorable to South Australia being refunded every penny piece which she has spent in trying to develop the Northern Territory. In doing that, the Commonwealth will only be doing what is just and equitable. I contend that the Commonwealth has treated South Australia in a most generous and equitable spirit in agreeing so far to recoup her what she has spent in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- Again and again that view was affirmed in the Parliament of South Australia. I hold in, my hand a report in which a Governor of the State declared that the future of the Territory so far as finance was concerned, must be dependent almost entirely upon the proper use of coloured labour, presumably under restrictions similar to those under which kanakas were imported into Queensland. Every evidence which can be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> points to the fact that, from the very first, South Australia has done her best to test the mineral and other possibilities of the Territory. She has tried in every way to develop the Territory, and has had to confess through her public men that she has failed. Representing the people of New South Wales, I say that they are willing that South Australia should be paid every penny-piece she .has expended upon a Territory, the occupation of which has been proved to be unprofitable, in spite of every effort made to develop it. When South Australia took over the Northern Territory she was indebted to the Old Country. She had not paid her interest, and that is one reason why she took the Territory over. </para>

                            <para>- I did not make any remark of the kind. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> as a business man, to say if the money which South Australia has expended on the Northern Territory had resulted in its successful development, we should ever have heard of the proposal to hand it over to the Commonwealth. It is only because the small population of South Australia has expended proportionally a very large amount of money on the Territory without success, and because her public men realize, that under the White Australia policy, which I hold to be right in principle, its development is very improbable, that she is now willing to part with it. It must be admitted that the Territory can only be developed after many years of trial and expense, and South Australia proposes that the Commonwealth should incur the expenditure necessary for the experiment. No honorable senator from South Australia will pledge himself that the Northern Territory is likely to be a prosperous State of the Commonwealth for a very long time to come. Who can say what expense the Commonwealth would be obliged to incur in developing the Territory? At present the loss upon it runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds, and if we do what South Australia desires, it will run into anything from &#163;20.000,000 to ^&#163;30,000, 000. In view of the liabilities already undertaken by the Commonwealth, with our population of  4,500,000,  I venture to assert that he would be a very bold man who could pretend to say how many years must pass before the Commonwealth would secure a reasonable return from the money expended in the development of the Northern Territory. In agreeing to take over the Territory at its cost to South Australia, we should be acting most generously, and in the circumstances it is very unreasonable that South Australia should&#39; seek to make conditions as to the way in which the Commonwealth shall proceed to develop it after it is taken over.. As Senator Symon has so often said, the people of South Australia should trust the Federal Parliament, and the people of the &#39;Commonwealth in this matter, to do what will be best in the interests of Australia.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> referred in the most eloquent way to the advantage from? a defence point of view which the Commonwealth would derive from the acquisition of the Territory. I join issue with the honorable senator on that aspect of the question. It is true that the Northern Territory is much nearer the Straits Settlement and Java than are other parts of Australia, and it might, perhaps, be of advantage to us in years to come that the Commonwealth should hold the Territory. But I should like to ask what money South Australia has spent on the defence of that Territory? Twenty years ago (Federation was scarcely thought of in Australia, and I would ask how much South Australia spent in the defence of the Territory up to the establishment of Federation? I would ask also in what way the conditions, from the point of view of defence, have altered since? It is true that the position of Japan has been changed, but no one who knows anything of Java, the Straits Settlement, and the other island&#34; of the North Pacific will believe that we are in any danger of attack from the people of those countries. Should we be in danger of attack through the Northern Territory, does any one realize &#39; what it would cost to defend that Terri- &#39; tory - to protect&#34; a coast-line extending for over 1,200 miles? It is absurd to suppose that the Japanese or the Chinese, assuming that they were in a position to make an attack upon Australia, would land their forces in the Northern Territory, when they might land them on the eastern and southern  toasts. No one can tell what might happen in fifty years&#39; time, but it is fair to say that in the near future there is likely to be no more reason why the Commonwealth should spend large sums of money -on the defence of the Northern Territory than there has been for such expenditure during the forty years it has been under the control of South Australia. I have here a list of the Premiers and the Cabinets who have administered the affairs of South Australia since the Northern Territory was annexed to that State. The list includes many of the ablest and best citizens of that State. I venture to say that every one of them in his time did his best to develop the Northern Territory, but without success. I applaud the people of South Australia for the efforts they have made, but it must be admitted that, although they have incurred enormous expense,  they  have failed. Can any&#39; representative of South Australia point to the probability of any revenue from the occupation of the Territory which in the near future would make this agreement a remunerative one for the Commonwealth? If the Commonwealth acquires the Northern Territory it will be with a knowledge of the loss South Australia has suffered in attempting to develop it, and that the Commonwealth, following upon similar lines, can hope to derive no profit from it. I ask the people of South Australia to take a Federal view of the question, and to admit that we shall be dealing with them in an equitable spirit if we agree, on acquiring the Territory, to recoup them for all they have lost on a bargain which they acknowledge was a bad bargain. If a man  buys  an unprofitable business, he requires to know how it can be turned into a profitable one. We know that in connexion with this matter the Commonwealth might be called upon to spend &#163;20,000,000, but we do not know what we should get for it. I sent a representative of my firm to the Territory some eight years ago, and on the journey to Oodnadatta there were on the train with him two Chinamen and one white man who had a pass. At that time the railway was running once a fortnight. I ask any reasonable man who will look the facts in the face to say whether we should not be treating South Australia in a generous way if we agreed to take over the Territory at cost? I venture to say that we should not, as a Commonwealth,, be required to make such terms with any outsider. I have evidence here which it would take me hours to read, showing the views held by members of the South Australian Parliament as to the value of the Northern Territory before it was proposed that it should be taken over by the Commonwealth. Whilst I hone that the future will reveal that the Commonwealth Parliament has acted wisely in this matter, I fear that the taking over of the Northern Territory will result in a very serious loss. </para>

                        <para>- - I do not intend to detain the Senate very long, but I think there are one or two gaps which I may be able to fill before the vote upon the second reading of this Bill is taken. With one or two exceptions no serious objection has been raised to the proposal that the Commonwealth should take over the Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger is the only honorable senator who has ventured to say that he will vote against the second reading of the Bill.  His  reason for so doing I should like to commend to the Senate. It is that somewhere about i860 the Duke of Newcastle recommended that the Northern Territory should be attached to Queensland, and his recommendation was not given effect to. Simply because his recommendation was not accepted, the proposed transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth is wrong, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger will oppose the Bill.  His  opposition, therefore, arises from a piece of petty State jealousy. To my mind, Queensland already possesses sufficient country to occupy her undivided attention, so far as development is concerned, for the next half century, so that she is scarcely justified in casting covetous eyes on the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has also indulged in what I can only describe as vague generalities. He devoted a good deal of time to the discussion of matters which were entirely irrelevant to the Bill and wound up his speech with a kind of double-barrelled amendment, the intention of which is either to waste time or to kill the Bill. </para>

                            <para>-  His  intention is to kill the Bill and to afford other honorable senators an opportunity of assisting him to do so by speaking upon his amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has stated that he could prove by quotations from the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that members of the South Australian Parliament had strenuously opposed  the taking over of the Northern Territory. That statement is absolutely true. . There were men in the Parliament of South Australia, who bitterly opposed that State ever touching the Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker, your predecessor in the chair, sir, was one of them. He declared that the Territory would be nothing more nor less than a white elephant to South Australia. A number of other gentlemen consistently opposed that State touching the Territory from the very commencement of negotiations in respect to it. But amongst politicians differences of opinion will always exist, and there will always be somebody ready to cry &#34;Rocks ahead&#34; ! It is not to be assumed that the South Australian Parliament is different from any other Parliament in that connexion. This discussion has disclosed that there is a general consensus of opinion that the Commonwealth should take over the Northern Territory. Opposition to the Bill has dwindled down to objection to the conditions contained in the agreement which is embodied in it. I do not propose to waste time in reviewing the history of the Northern Territory or of the efforts which have been made for its development. The chief objection urged against the Bill relates to the construction of the proposed line of railway from Pin&#176; Creek to Port Augusta. It is argued that the Commonwealth should take over all the monetary obligations of South Australia, that that State should be recouped every penny of liability which she has incurred on behalf of the Territory, but that when once the Territory has been taken over this Parliament should be at liberty to do what it chooses with it, and that South Australia has no title to any further consideration. </para>

I repeat that the only objection to the Bill is based upon the claim that South Australia has no title to consideration when once the Commonwealth has taken over the obligations which she has incurred in the &#39; development of the Northern Territory. The line to Oodnadatta was constructed as part and parcel of a transcontinental railway. It would never have been carried into that dry, arid, and almost waterless country if it had not been regarded as the first section of a line which was ultimately destined to cross Australia from south to north. South Australia would probably have completed the next section as far as the MacDonnell Ranges, but for the bad times and droughts which she has experienced. But there was a period when the South Australian Parliament could have granted permission for the construction of a transcontinental line upon the land grant principle. Had she done so, the company which laid that line would have introduced coloured labour into the Northern Territory - not Japanese or Chinese - but British subjects from India, and the Northern Territory, instead of being an empty space to-day, would have been populated by tens of thousands of coloured labourers engaged in tropical production. </para>

She is thus in a position to hand it over to the Commonwealth as a white man&#39;s country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has stated that he is prepared to take over the Territory and to pay the whole of the monetary obligations incurred by South Australia in that connexion.

                            <para>- In ordinary circumstances, I should be found indorsing the proposition, of my honorable friend. Under ordinary conditions, his attitude is a perfectly reasonable one. But these are not ordinary conditions. They are altogether extraordinary. I give my honorable friend credit for the straightforward attitude he has adopted. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has complained of the obligations which the Commonwealth will incur in taking over the Territory. Now, it seems to me that, as a senator from Queensland, he should have been the last to raise an objection of that kind. What has the Commonwealth done for Queensland? South Australia has kept the Northern Territory white. But did Queensland keep her Territory white? Did she not pollute her Territory by the introduction of black labour, and when that black labour was deported, had not the Commonwealth to pay for its deportation? We were then called upon to assist the Queensland sugar-growers to produce sugar exclusively by white labour, and we cheerfully responded to the call. </para>

I say that he should have been the last to do so, in view of the great consideration which Queensland has received from the Commonwealth. If sugar can be grown successfully by white labour in Queensland today, obviously, it could have been successfully grown under similar conditions years ago. We are now helping Queensland to develop her resources by! means of the sugar bounty, and we are only asking that a little consideration shall be extended to South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- South Australia has no industries which are helped in that way. What does the agreement ask? It asks that South Australia shall receive some recognition for the enterprise and pluck which she has exhibited in times past. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> paid an eloquent &#39; tribute to the heroic work which has been done by South Australia. She undertook the exploration of the country from south to north, and did it successfully. She carried the telegraph line right across at her own expense, whilst Queensland, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, was pleading with the other States to help her to do a similar work. If Queensland had had as much pluck, she would have had an overland telegraph line of her own. The agreement asks that the Federal Parliament shall recognise the sacrifices that South Australia has made. She has carried on the overland telegraph line so far at a considerable loss. But she recognises, as she was bound to do, that she has taken up too big a contract. She realizes that for a State with a population like hers to construct a railway across the Territory is altogether too big an undertaking. For that reason she has been simply holding it in the interests of Australia as a whole.  The line at present ends in a <inline font-style="italic">cul de sac.</inline> Had it been carried on to the MacDonnell Ranges,, which was to be the next section constructed, my belief is that it would have been immediately profitable. A great deal has been said about the conditions binding the Common wealth to construct a certain railway. They do not, however, bind the Commonwealth to construct a line from Oodnadatta &#60;&#62; to Pine Creek. I believe myself that that central route is absolutely the best that the line can traverse, but I have not the least objection to an inspection of the country being made, and, if necessary, to the line being built further to the east. All that is demanded is that the line shall come up to the northern boundary of South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> declared that he had had&#39; a talk to a gentleman who is in Melbourne in the interests of this measure, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindsay</inline> had told him that the country east of the MacDonnell Ranges was all big sand hills, and that it was impossible to build a railway there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindsay</inline> authorizes me to say that that is an absolute misrepresentation, and that what he told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was that for 60 miles in the south-east corner of the Northern Territory the sand hills were so big that a railway could not be built there. That is a very different statement from the one which the honorable senator made. </para>

                            <para>- The railway can deviate to the one side or the other. There is nothing in the agreement which says what route&#39; it is to take. There are about 580 miles from east to west, and according to this  agreement the line can be built anywhere in that country. It is said that a transcontinental railway is required for purposes of defence. We have heard from- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> and from that eminent military authority, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> that troops could not be taken from the eastern and southern parts of Australia to the Northern Territory readily enough over the projected line. I do not suppose they could be. Though not a military authority, I can easily recognise that. But what is the best defence of this country? Our best defence is population. The Territory is open now. If we had a line to develop it, and could settle 10,000 or 20,000 people, we should have a means of defence, and then we should not need to think about shifting troops 2,000 or 3,000 miles at a few hours&#39; notice for the purpose of repelling some invader. The best defence, of the Northern Territory; I repeat, is population. A railway is required to enable population to settle, and also for the development of the country itself. What would be the use of taking a line from Pine Creek for two or three hundred miles, and 0then running it into another country? </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the honorable senator had his Queensland spectacles on, and when his vision is so affected he is unable to see things in their proper light. A railway running through the MacDonnell Ranges would open up a vast mineral country. It is known that there are rich deposits there, but the cost of producing them is so great as to make their working unprofitable. It is said that this is a dry country and not capable of agricultural development. But in the MacDonnell Ranges there is a rainfall of between 10 and 11 inches, and it increases as one goes north until it reaches 60 or 80 inches. The country is capable of agricultural development, and will evert grow wheat. It cannot be condemned as being arid and dried. There is a good rainfall immediately the MacDonnell Ranges are passed. The route of the projected railway is open for inspection.  1  have no objection to the best experts in the Commonwealth being sent there for the purpose of deciding the route of the line. I have no hesitation in saying that I believe they would declare that for the development of the country itself a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek would be the best. </para>

                            <para>- Why should we leave that out? The honorable senator wants it left out in order that when the Territory is developed its resources shall benefit eastern States. They would have its products brought down to Brisbane and Sydney. I am not here to speak for the Parliament of South Australia, but, sofar as I can interpret the minds of the people of that State, I believe that this agreement represents the ultimate limit to which they will be prepared to go. It is reasonable and fair to Australia as a whole, and to South Australia. It is a just agreement. There has been an outcry as to the enormous liability of &#163;10,000,000, with the &#163;5,000,000 extra which will have to be spent if the railway line is to be completed. But, on the other hand, the Commonwealth would take over a Territory with over 330,000,000 acres of land. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that if the Commonwealth took over the Territory on the conditions mentioned in the agreement, and decided to build a railway through the country, it could be constructed on somewhat the same principle as the land-grant system. It could vest in a Commission appointed to construct the railway 75,000 acres of land per square mile, or a total of  123,000,000  acres which, if realized at  2s.  6d. per acre, would cover the whole of the liability. The Commission could use the land for the benefit of the Commonwealth; it could let or sell the land as it thought fit, and by doing so enough would be realized to cover the whole of the liability. </para>

                            <para>- No; it was started with white labour, and finished with Chinese coolies. The climate of the MacDonnell Ranges for hundreds of miles northward is not like the climate in the tropical part of the Territory. It is simply raising a bogy to say that the line cannot be built except with coloured labour. I think that if the Commonwealth took over the Territory it would experience no difficulty in that regard. It should be placed in the hands of a Commission, with the right to use, let, or sell the land, and, in my opinion, enough money could be raised not only to pay for the construction of the line, but also to cover the total liability taken over from the State. </para>

                    <para class="block">Some objection has been raised to the working of tha present railway. Some honorable senators say, &#34; Yes, we will take over the line, but we do not want to work it.&#34; I do not imagine that the Commonwealth would be called upon to undertake that duty, because South Australia could carry on the work on behalf of the Commonwealth until  the latter was prepared to commence the construction of a railway either from one end or from the other. The responsibility for whatever consequences may result from the rejection of this agreement must rest with the Senate. The Bill was passed in the other House by a very substantial majority, and if it is rejected here, and the State as a consequence agrees to build the railway on the land-grant principle and give away millions and millions of acres of land, nobody will be responsible but the members of the Senate. Only a week or two ago a gentleman came to me and said, &#34; If you throw out this agreement in the Senate, on the next day I will put down  &#163;10,000  as a preliminary deposit, and guarantee to carry out the line on the land-grant principle.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- No. Whether the State Parliament would accept or reject the alteration I cannot say. But I do know that very strong pressure would be brought to bear upon its members not to budge one inch from the terms of the agreement. I feel quite sure that very strong pressure would be again brought to bear upon the State Parliament to agree to the construction of the railway upon the land-grant principle. So far, the State has refused to allow the Territory to be exploited in that way, and if it should have to give way now for financial reasons, I do not think that it could be blamed by the Senate. </para>

If the Bill is not passed this session, it cannot be taken up next session as a lapsed Bill,  because a general election will have intervened. Everything must be begun <inline font-style="italic">de novo.</inline> So far as the . agreement is concerned, the State Parliament has fulfilled its conditions. A great deal has been said with regard to its being an agreement, and to South Australia having got by a long way the best of the bargain. It has been said that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price was too shrewd for the Prime Minister, and got at him. 1 do not share that view. I believe that the proposal was discussed by the Prime Minister and one or two of his colleagues and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> and, if I remember rightly, the result of their deliberations was published almost every day in the press.&#39; The agreement was not in any sense arrived at secretly, because the two parties threshed out the matter, and decided what, in their minds, was fair to both the Commonwealth and the State. The State Parliament has passed a Bill which empowers the Government to surrender the Northern Territory, and it has received the King&#39;s Assent, but, of course, unless the agreement is accepted, the Act will be a dead letter. I think that the Senate ought to pause before it decides to take the serious step of refusing to ratify the agreement. I have endeavoured to look at the proposal from a fair stand-point. I believe that in accepting it no wrong will be done to the Commonwealth, nor do I consider that anything more than justice will be done to the State. For that reason I hope that honorable senators will be prepared not only to agree to the second reading, but to pass the Bill through Committee without amendment, and take over responsibilities which rightly belong to the Commonwealth. This Parliament passed an Immigration Restriction Act which is intended to keep the continent white, and I think it is quite up to the Commonwealth to see that the spirit of that law is carried out in all things. I do not think that I am making an unreasonable request when I ask the Senate to ratify the agreement as it stands, and thus settle a momentous question on lines equitable to both sides. </para>

                            <para>- We may not have another opportunity presented to us. If I took the dismal view of some honorable senators, I would not desire that the Commonwealth should acquire the Territory. I believe that in the course of perhaps the next quarter of a century, it will be found to be one of the Commonwealth&#39;s most valuable assets. It is undoubtedly one of the most highly mineralized parts of Australia, and time alone can determine whether minerals will be found to any great, depth. If they are found no one can foretell the richness of the country. Almost  every  known mineral has been discovered there. </para>

He states that 213,430 square miles have an average rainfall of from 10 to 20 inches; 96,790 square miles, a rainfall of from 20 to 30 inches; 120,600 square miles, a rainfall of from 30 to 40 inches ; and 86,500 square miles, an average rainfall of over 40 inches. Less than 1 J per cent, of the total area has an average rainfall of under 10 inches. From remarks which have been made in this chamber, one would think that the whole of the citizens of South Australia are pathetically pleading that the Commonwealth should take over this area. Let me tell honorable senators that there is a division of opinion in South Australia on the question. There are many influential men in the State who have an extensive knowledge of the Territory who believe that it would be better for South Australia to hold on to it. In confirmation of that statement, I have here a resolution which was passed by the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce. The members of that Chamber came to a unanimous conclusion that - </para>

                            <para>- I quote the resolution from a pamphlet published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Barr Smith, a prominent citizen of South Australia. The pamphlet was printed in 1907, and I assume that the resolution was passed shortly before the printing of the pamphlet. We know that there has been in South Australia for a long period of years a very strong desire on the part of certain people to develop the Northern Territory in a particular way. It is believed by a section - though it may be a small section of the citizens of that State - that the only way in which it can be developed is by the construction of the transcontinental railway on the land-grant system. I say that there could be nothing more inimical to the interests, not merely of South Australia, but of the whole of the Commonwealth, than that that Territory should be&#39; handed over - for that is what it would mean - to a private syndicate. I believe that some time ago the promise was made that if a private syndicate would construct this line, involving an expenditure of &#163;6,000,000 or &#163;8,000,000, they should be given land on either side of the line to the extent of 90,000,000 acres, an area equal to more than one and a half times the size of Victoria. We know something of the history of syndicate railways in different parts of the world, and if such an area of land on either side of the railway were given to a private syndicate they might just as well be given the whole of the Territory. I am glad to say that it was mainly through the instrumentality of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price that the proposals then put forward for the construction of this railway on the land-grant system were defeated. A high tribute is paid to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price, and the party with which he was associated, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barr</inline> Smith in the pamphlet which I have here. He says - </para>

                        <para>Fortunately for South Australia, the Labour Party as a party is altogether opposed to land-grant railways, and is even willing to make a stand against a popular cry for an expenditure which seems to go in the direction of helping labour. All honour to them. The State has good reason to rejoice in such a stand. It shows a statesmanship of a high order. Have we no reason sometimes to fear Governments putting the exigencies of party life and- party gain before the manifest interests of the State? It is therefore- matter for national congratulation when any party has the conscience and courage to strenuously object to a policy which they know to be unsound, even when it seems to give a temporary advantage to their supporters and friends. Common sense will applaud, and all experience hereafter justify the stand made by the Premier. </para>

                    <para class="block">The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> has gone where we all must go sooner or later, and there is in power in South Australia to-day, not a Labour Government, but a Government that has coalesced with its one-time bitterest enemies. It is difficult to prophesy what that. Government might be disposed to do if this Bill were not agreed to. Certain honorable senators have said &#34; Let us take over the Northern Territory by all means, but let the Commonwealth decide what route the railway shall take.&#34; Some have made no secret of the fact that they are interested in this question, not so much from the point of view of the Commonwealth as from the point of view of what they believe to be the interests of the States they represent. If it were possible for the Commonwealth to acquire the Territory without agreeing to any condition as to the route of the railway, I can quite imagine that in future Parliaments we should have the State Righters, with all their armour on, fighting, as perhaps they have never before fought in this chamber, for advantages  for their own States from the construction of this transcontinental line. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that I am here as a representative of the State of Victoria; but in this matter I consider the interests of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is because I am satisfied that it would be to the material advantage of every citizen of the Commonwealth that I am extremely anxious to see this Bill go through. It is, I think, remarkable that the Government have not sought to exercise the same power over their supporters in dealing with this measure that they did when the financial agreement was before the Senate. </para>

If the honorable senator has shown any activity in the matter at all, it has been in his efforts not to secure the passage of the Bill, but to kill it. I say that this is a remarkable attitude for Government supporters to take up. </para>

                            <para>- It is a part of the Government programme, and I was always under the impression, that when a Government introduced their programme their supporters did what they could to carry it into effect. I have heard the statement made within the precincts of this chamber that this Bill is not likely to go through the Senate. When certain honorable senators expressed surprise that it should have been passed in another place, the remark was made by one honorable senator, &#34;You need not be afraid; it will not get through the Senate.&#39; &#39; Let me say that in the consideration of this measure there has been too much of the huckstering spirit displayed. It has been suggested that South Australia is desirous of making a good bargain with the Commonwealth. Honorable senators appear to forget that the Northern Territory is a part of the Commonwealth. Although it has not yet been taken over by the Commonwealth from South Australia, surely they are as much interested in that part of the Commonwealth as in any other. Every one regrets that this immense area, which is six times the size of the State I represent, should have remained so long unpeopled and undeveloped. It has been said that its vastness and emptiness make it a menace to the whole of Australia. If the statement be correct, and I do not doubt it for a moment, how is it that there should be so vigorous an opposition in this Chamber, which is supposed to be a national Chamber, to a national question? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has said, South Australia has shouldered the burden of the Northern Territory for nearly half -a -century. I say, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that the people of that State have made heroic attempts, and very great sacrifices to do what they  considered was in the interests, not merely of South Australia, but of the Commonwealth as a whole. They incurred an initial expenditure in connexion with the </para>

                            <para>- The fact remains that South Australia built the overland telegraph une at a cost of nearly &#163;500,000, and there has been a deficit in the working of it during the last twenty years amounting to nearly &#163;300,000. The State has made an heroic attempt to span the Continent with a railway. She built from Port Darwin to Pine Creek what was, perhaps, one of the most costly lines ever constructed in Australia, because it had to be constructed upon iron sleepers. That was found necessary because of the ravages of white ants. In the building of the jetty and pier, similar precautions had to be adopted. </para>

                            <para>- It scarcely becomes a member of the National Parliament to deride any portion of the Commonwealth for which he is called upon to legislate. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> was speaking, he expressed a doubt as to whether the proposed line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta could be constructed by means of white labour. But, even if he thinks that that railway cannot be built except by coloured labour, does he imagine for a moment that the Commonwealth will develop other portions of the Northern Territory with coloured labour ? We know that white men have lived and worked in the most trying portions of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that nobody has attempted to exert influence with me. Had the attempt been made, it would have been fruitless. When I visited the Northern Territory about two years ago, and covered about 1,000 miles of it, I determined that, if I was afforded the opportunity, I would raise my voice in favour of the acquisition by the Commonwealth of this immense Possession. From time to time innumerable pamphlets and papers have been published with a view to refuting the statement so repeatedly made that the Territory is an arid waste. As a matter of fact, in some portions of it, cattle and sheep fatten much more rapidly than they do in any other part of Australia. Moreover, they realize higher prices. </para>

But it may be equally true that honorable senators have never invested a single shilling in enterprises in other parts of Australia which today are highly profitable, which are returning big dividends and paying reasonable wages. It is a fact that during the past few years there has been little or no development in the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- Because South&#39; Australia has been quite unable to deal with it in a systematic manner. But if the Commonwealth acquired the Territory it would have behind it a population of 4,000,000 and moneys which would enable it to conduct experiments upon up-to-date scientific lines. Nobody can dispute the fact that a Territory possessing good soil, and having the advantages of sunshine, a good rainfall, and navigable water-ways, is capable of sustaining a large population. Some years ago Western Australia was regarded as an absolutely waste land. Even when the gold-fields were discovered men who were considered experts declared that it was altogether unsuitable for cultivation. Yet those who are familiar with that State to-day say that portions of it are producing heavier wheat crops than are being produced in any other part of the Commonwealth. In the early stages of the gold fever, too, Western Australia imported considerable quantities of fruit, and it was then alleged that the country was absolutely unsuitable for the production of fruit. But to-day fruits of all kinds are grown in abundance there, and Western Australia, which was at one time considered a barren waste, has now a fairly large population. What will be gained by casting this Bill into the waste- paper basket? Will any good purpose be served by the Commonwealth refusing to do its duty? Now that we have begun our career as nation builders it is the duty of the Commonwealth to build upon a concrete foundation, and it is impossible to do that whilst we neglect any portion of it. Some honorable senators profess to believe that if we reject this Bill, the South Australian Parliament, after more mature consideration, will eliminate from the agreement which we are asked to ratify the condition relating to the construction of a line of railway from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta. I do not think it will do anything of the kind. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me that the question of developing the Northern Territory is one of the most difficult problems, and certainly one of the gravest financial responsibilities, with which this Parliament has ever been faced. It cannot be complained that we have debated the subject at undue length. The result of the debate will be to inform the Prime Minister on the one hand, and the Government of South Australia on the other, concerning the defects which some of us see in the agreement now presented for our acceptance. It is perfectly plain to me that the Northern Territory must be taken over by the Commonwealth, and that South Australia will have to part with it. I am particularly anxious to treat South Australia fairly, and even generously. But on behalf of the Commonwealth I am bound to exercise such business capacity as I have in the interests of the electors who sent me here; and I must see that the agreement does not unduly fetter the Commonwealth in developing the Territory in the best possible way. As to the question of defence, let me say, in a sentence or two, that I do not attach the same importance to land defence as some of our professional soldiers do. I suppose that <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> ought to say that with apologies to mv honorable and gallant friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> I also do not pay much attention to what a general may have said ten or twenty years ago. The existence ot trie Empire to which we belong must depend upon the maintenance of our supremacy at sea; and whether we have a railway built more or less to the eastward or the westward for carrying troops to Port Darwin is a minor point. But considerations of defence alone ought to prevent us from entering into this agreement, because it is perfectly apparent that most of our troops will come from the country between Melbourne and Brisbane, which lies more to the east. The great crux of the question, however, is: How are we to develop the Territory? It cannot be developed without railway communication, and consequently we are at once faced with the consideration of the way in which the railway is to go. Immediately after I left Port Darwin, having availed myself of all the opportunities that presented themselves to gather information about the Territory, I ,came to the conclusion that the railway should run from Pine Creek down towards Cammoweal, and that we should not build that line until we had an assurance from the States concerned that it would be connected with trunk lines. I find that a line, such as I contemplate, would be about 650 miles in length as against 1,063 miles, which is the estimated length of a line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta. I have been told by people in the Northern Territory, and the statement has been confirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> that there is in the north-eastern part a considerable strip of good pastoral country. I was also told that this country extends over the border until you come close to Cloncurry, which is a mining centre. If we have three or four hundred miles of good pastoral country fit for all kinds of settlement, and the line thus built is three or four hundred miles shorter than the one which South Australia desires, that surely opens up a grave question as to whether the north-eastern line is not the better one to build. I admit at once that a line down the centre of Australia seems to be the better one for the development of the Northern Territory itself. All other things being equal, I should be inclined to vote for that line in the interests of South Australia. But as I find that that would be in every sense the worst line to build, and that that would not be the best plan of developing the Territory, I shall have to vote against it. It is because we have not sufficient information before us on a dozen vital points that I cannot consent to an agreement binding us to construct a line to the northern boundary of South Australia. For the purpose of opening up the Territory, I should like to see a line built down the centre, but when I commence to study the map I am faced with difficulties. I notice red patches on the map exhibited in this chamber. I understand that they represent pastoral leases which have been issued by the State. I see a patch of pastoral leases to the south of the MacDonnell ranges. When we look at the north-east portion, near the Queensland border, we see that there is there a tremendous amount of pastoral settlement. To the north-west there is a still larger amount of settlement on the banks of the splendid Victoria River. But from the MacDonnell Ranges upwards there does not appear to be a single settlement. There appear to be hundreds of miles of country north, east, south, and west, which up to the present have been deemed to be absolutely unfit for settlement. Of course, we have to take into consideration that there have been few facilities for settlement. But when we remember that droves of cattle are driven seventeen hundred miles, we may take it that if the centre of that country had been worthy in any way of the risk of settling it, there would have been a great many red patches on the map showing that pastoral leases had been taken up there. My honorable friend, the Minister of Trade and Customs, gave us the estimate that the projected railway, 1,063 miles in length, would cost about ,&#163;4,500,000. I have been furnished with a document which was prepared for the information of the members of the Federal Convention by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> G. Pendleton, Railway Commissioner, South Australia. He estimated that the 1,063 miles of railway would cost &#163;7,004 per mile, or a total of &#163;7,447,321. That is a very much larger sum than that mentioned by the Minister in introducing the Bill ; and the disparity between the figures shows at once how absolutely deficient we are in real facts as to the Territory. Of course, it is admitted that there has been no survey. There has not even been a flying survey. The figures supplied to us represent merely a rough estimate. I am certain from my knowledge of what narrow-gauge railways cost in Tasmania and New Zealand, and from what the Pine Creek railway cost, that &#163;4,500,000 would not be sufficient for the construction of even the greater part of -the 1,063 miles of line. Another reason against constructing / this railway is that we can gain some knowledge from the experience of South Australia. We all know that the financial undertaking of developing that great Territory was too big for South Australia. It was almost too big for any State. But, still, South Australia has tried to do it. She has spent and lost enormous sums of money. What are the results ? One thing amongst others has been made plain, and that is that the Territory up towards the MacDonnell Ranges and towards the centre of Australia, the country all about Oodnadatta and towards Port Augusta, is hardly worth settling. The railway which has been running for so many years would have occasioned more settlement than there is if the country had been worth developing. Therefore it appears to me that the experience of South Australia is a warning to us, because, although we may desire to treat the State generously, we must admit that her attempts to develop the Territory have resulted in failure. Can anybody indicate how the Territory can be made a. success? Can any one point out any reason why it has not been developed? There is a railway upon which the loss is &#163;72,000 a year. If we sign this agreement from the date when it becomes law we shall be losing &#163;72,000 a year on the Oodnadatta railway alone. We shall also be losing, from the moment of taking over the Territory. &#163;46,000 a year on the Pine Creek railway. I travelled over the latter line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek and back again. I kept my eyes open, looking out of the -windows of the railway carriage perpetually. I must confess that the country I saw was very disappointing. There were a few mines. Some of them, have been doing well. Some of them have good prospects. Some of them have ruined their shareholders. Every now and then there were Chinese along the line who came with supplies of beef and vegetables. I was told that a few miles back the land was good enough for cattle. But if there is a great mass of country like . that which I saw, I do not hope for much from it. and if there is some which is worse, I am perfectly certain that the railway never will, and never can, pay. If such has been the experience of South Australia in regard to the Oodnadatta and the Pine Creek railways, is there any better hope of developing the Territory from the eastern States? Tt is to be regretted that perhaps both New South Wales and Queensland are deeply interested in this question. I believe that every one of the senators from those States who has spoken honestly believes what he has said. Nevertheless, we cannot help our unconscious bias; but, apart from their State interests, it appears to me that there is a great deal to be said for their contention that there is not much hope for the development of the Territory from the South Australian end. Can any one suggest what we could do to cause the 1,063 miles of railway to bring in revenue and to develop the Territory, if we try it from the Oodnadatta end? I must say that I do not think the prospect is very bright. On the other side, however, there is a brighter prospect. First of all, Queensland would have to build, and I believe would be willing to build, 250 miles of railway. Then we should have to build 650 miles to the Queensland border. The whole of that country, or nearly the whole of it, is fit for settlement, both for pastoral and agricultural purposes. I have heard a great deal about the Northern Territory being fit to grow tropical products. The Minister of Trade and Customs stated that at Port Darwin almost every tropical plant .that can be mentioned is growing. But to those of us who know the place, that statement appears to be a little misleading. We visited the Botanic Garden at Port Darwin with very great interest, and had numerous chats with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holtze.</inline> We saw these various agricultural products being; grown in a rather amateurish fashion. But to say that because a product or a plant will grow in that garden after having been properly cultivated, you could&#34; cultivate the product, and market it profitably is another thing. I am inclined to think, especially since my visit to Port Darwin, that our tropical Australia is a very much exaggerated property. It was an unfortunate circumstance to me that when I got into the Northern Territory, among the buffaloes, I did not see any fruit. I could not find out that there was a single fruit that would keep man alive which was indigenous to the country. I found that oranges, lemons, and fruits of that sort could not be grown on account of the white ants. I was faced with&#39; the labour problem. We are informed that the Pine Creek-Port Darwin railway was commenced with white labour, that sometime afterwards the men began . to throw up their jobs, and that finally it was completed with &#39;Chinese labour- </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">However much we may love our doctrine of a White Australia, there is the fact that close to Port Darwin, to which delicacies could be carried by ships, and sent down the line, white men threw up their jobs before its construction was finished. It has been stated that had the Northern Territory been peopled with natives of India, whom ex-Senator Playford selected after he had made many inquiries, we should have had tropical products of all descriptions growing there, as well as a great amount of settlement. If we admit those two things as facts, what is the logical conclusion to draw therefrom? If ever we want to develop the Northern Territory, and effectively settle it, we shall have to make some little exception to our White Australia policy. &#39;It is of no use to say one thing and mean another. To my mind, it is a very grave problem whether we could effectively settle the Territory by means of white labour only. I gained one or two facts which prove to me that it could be developed with white labour. In the railway workshops I came across two men of splendid physique, one being about 5 ft. 10 in. high, and the other 6 feet, weighing about 14 stone each, and looking the picture of health. The men who were working in the shops under cover told me that they had worked with navvies on the line, and that a white man could do so if he would only keep away from alcohol. I came across another splendid specimen of a man, standing about 6 ft. 3 in. high, and when I asked him the same question about developing the Territory with white labour, he replied, &#34;I took the contract for putting the iron roofs on all the buildings in connexion with the Pine Creek railway. I was engaged on the work for seventeen months, and had forty-three men in my employ during that time, and every one of them - Japanese, Chinese, and white men - sooner or later, chucked up their jobs.&#34; It will be seen that we are faced with great difficulties. I believe that it will be found a most difficult problem to start tropical agricultural industries unless we employ other than white labour. Let me refer to one or two industries which, I think, might be made to flourish with white labour. I allude to the growing of tobacco and maize, and the rearing of pigs. I believe that such industries might be started side by side with cattle or sheep breeding, and by degrees it could be ascertained to what extent we could grow cotton, coffee, and other crops of that description. It will be found that the labour question is a very troublesome one. Suppose that we were to take over the Northern Territory under this or an amended agreement, how is it to be developed? We are bound to lose an enormous sum before we have scarcely made a start. Before we have got a railway built our losses will have piled up, and I do not think that anybody will be able to foresee the end of it. Still, we must take over the Territory, and face the problem. I do not believe for a moment that if this agreement is rejected the Government of South Australia will be unwise enough to do anything but confer with the Prime Minister, with a view to seeing on what terms fair to both the Commonwealth and the State a new agreement can be made. I do not desire to drive the unfortunate taxpayers of the State into striving to get this railway built on the land-grant principle. If they did, I believe that they would live to regret their action, and that no good would come of it. </para>

                            <para>- For their sake, as well as our own, I do not want to see them do it. For twenty-five years this will be nothing but a great financial burden - all outgoings and no incomings worth talking about I do not know how we are going to tackle the question of the gauge to be adopted for the railway. Has any honorable senator considered for a moment whether the railway to develop this vast area should have a 3 ft. 6 in. or a 4 ft. 8J in. gauge? The Pine Creek railway has a 3ft. 6in. gauge, and so have the Queensland railways. That, to my mind, is a very strong reason why the Territory should be developed from the eastward. The Bishop of Carpentaria told me that he had travelled down the central telegraph line, and that he was astounded at the barrenness of the country through which he passed. He told me that he had four horses to take the buggy, himself, and another man over the sandhills. I gathered from him that there were from 50 to 70 miles of sandhills going clown the central track. But I gathered from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindsay,</inline> whose lecture I heard with very great pleasure, and with whom I have had the advantage of conversing, that the land a little away from the railway line is, to some extent, better than one would think. He gave me a far more favorable impression than that I gathered from the Bishop, who only travelled down one track where the boggy could go, and what he said is confirmed by the report of some of the engineers. I look forward to the time when a railway will go from Constantinople, across Persia, across India, and down to Singapore, and we shall travel from London to Port Darwin without spending more than three nights at sea, that is, from Singapore to Australia. If we cannot develop the Northern Territory without tens of thousands of persons from the Mother Country or elsewhere to help us, are we going to bring every visitor from the Old Country along 1,500 miles of railway with little or no good land visible from the train? I do not suggest that we should build a railway by any route simply to enable persons to get a good view from the carriage windows. In that distance of 600 odd miles to Cammoweal there is some splendid pastoral country, but between Port Darwin and Port Augusta a distance of 1,500 miles, there is little or no good land except through the MacDonnell Ranges, and if the railway is constructed by that route we shall give every visitor a most terrible idea of the barrenness of the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- No, but I have crossed the Texan Desert for a distance of about 200 miles. One fancied that he saw nothing but grass, with every now and then a cactus 30 feet high sticking up, but, as a matter of fact, there was no grass&#39; as there was little rainfall. Let me now touch on a point which I have not heard dealt with, and it certainly is&#39; in favour of the railway being taken through the central part of Australia. What are we to say with regard to the development of Western Australia, which embraces an enormous&#39; area? I take it that some day the northeastern part of that State will have to be developed. There is an enormous water frontage from which our enemies will come if ever they do come. We all know of the pastoral leases on the Victoria River or in that direction. The question is whether, to a very great extent, a railway constructed by the route which the people of South Australia desire would not open a very vast area to the west of the Territory and in the north-east corner of Western Australia. If we are to take a national view of these things, as I think we should do, there is something to be said in favour of that idea. But, without the thought of developing Western Australia, and without the thought of developing the country up by the Victoria River, there is no sufficient reason, according to the map, to warrant a man in building the proposed railway if it cost only &#163;1,000 a mile, and I feel quite certain that it would cost &#163;7,000 a mile. But, having regard to the whole of the continent, to my mind we shall have to carry out the old English policy of taking one- step at a time. I do not think that any man can foresee how we shall develop the Territory. We must proceed very slowly, and if we can, at a cost of &#163;3,000,000, link up the country by way of Cammoweal with the eastern States, knowing that we shall be doing, a good thing, Will not that be better than to spend &#163;7,500,000 in opening up a Territory which, on the face of it, does not disclose good land or possibilities of settlement or hope of marketable products? I shall be very sorry indeed to find any honorable senator voting against the second reading of the Bill. We should pass the motion to show that we approve of the principle of taking over the Territory on terms fair to South Australia. But what those terms are to be will require a. great deal more consideration and negotiation than either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has yet given to the question. This is the most difficult problem with which we have ever been faced, and it _ will take months, of negotiation to discover what is the right thing to do for the Commonwealth and the just thing to do for the State. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no intention of speaking at any length. This subject has been very well&#39; threshed out, and while honorable senators are unanimous as to the desirability of&#34; taking over the Territory there seems to be some difficulty with regard to the terms. I think that South Australia ought to be relieved of a burden which has become too heavy for her to bear any longer, and which she ought to be glad to get rid of on almost any terms. I am surprised that the Commonwealth Government should have accepted such terms as are contained in this agreement, and, further, that the South Australian Government should have dic- tated them. It appears to me to be only fair that if the Commonwealth takes over the Northern Territory with all its obligations, the development of it should be left entirely in the hands of the people of the Commonwealth without any fetter, and!  without any conditions being previously laid down. That would be only fair. If I am in business and get into trouble, and some kind friend comes to my relief and engages to carry on the business in future after I have bungled it, I think he would open his eyes if I, having previously failed in the undertaking, endeavoured to lay down the lines on which he should conduct the business in future. If any man takes over my business after I have failed in it, I think he is entitled to carry it on in the future in his own way, when, if he fails, he will have to pay the piper, and if he succeeds he will secure the benefit. While I believe that that is a principle which may very fairly and justly be laid down, and one to which every honest individual and every fair-minded public body would at once agree, we may go even further with regard to this agreement and say that the policy which has been laid down by South Australia in this agreement is one which is not in the best interests either of South Australia herself or of the Commonwealth. I had the privilege of going to Oodnadatta as the guest of the South Australian Government. I felt very grateful to that Government for giving me that opportunity, but I can assure honorable senators that my journey to that place was an eye-opener. I was surprised that any poor, sparsely-populated State like South Australia ever had the courage to build a railway to such a place. I have been over a very considerable portion of Australia, but I never saw. country so barren, so inhospitable, and so unfit for settlement as I did on that occasion. </para>

                            <para>- The, honorable senator had no right in any case to come asking me what I proposed to do. I resent any man asking me how I am going to vote on matters of this kind. I say that it is exceedingly improper that any honorable senator should go round trying to induce other members of the Senate to vote against their previously expressed convictions. I have never privately asked any man to vote in a particular way. I may have directed arguments to honorable senators in this Chamber, but I have tried in no other way to influence the vote nf a single member of the Senate. I think it is improper to do so. I was speaking of the country around Oodnadatta. It was exceedingly poor. Of course, we wore told by some people there that a few miles back the country improved. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, that is an old story which I have heard a hundred times. I admit that I saw a few horses in excellent condition, but they were very few. The very fact that a train is run along that line only once in two weeks is abundant evidence as to the character of the country. We have in Queensland a line constructed from Rockhampton right out to Longreach. On that line there are two or three trains run on some days ; there are two or three mail trains every week, and there is constant communication between Longreach and the coast. The same thing applies to the railway from Townsville to Cloncurry, and to the railway fi om Brisbane to Cunnamulla. All the back country served by those railways is settled, and the pastoral industry carried on there is in a prosperous condition. Here we have a railway line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta on which a train is run only once every two weeks, and on which there is an annual deficit of between &#163;70,000 and &#163;80,000. We have heard a great deal about the MacDonnell Ranges. We are told that they are a kind of oasis in the desert ; but we have no certain information upon the matter. Then, with regard to the Northern Territory, I have heard honorable senators dilate upon the splendid soil,, the good rainfall, the climate generally,  and the various advantages possessed by that portion of Australia. My only answer to that is, I think, an all-sufficient one - the Territory has been known for forty years, and there is no settlement there worth mentioning. I say that if the country had been worth settling it would have been covered with sheep and cattle many years ago. In Queensland, at any rate, our great squatting companies have men continually on the look-out for fresh country. If this country had been of such a character that it might be put to profitable use, it would have been taken up and stocked many years ago. It has not been taken up or stocked, and it is almost an empty land. I have come to the conclusion that it is not quite of the quality we have been invited to believe. We are told that the transcontinental line proposed in this agreement is necessary for the purposes of defence. I think that is the very weakest link in the whole chain of the argument in support of this measure. Any man looking at the map must see that. The great bulk of the population of Australia is settled between Melbourne and Brisbane, and if it were necessary for defence purposes to send troops to Port Darwin they would have to be taken all the way round to Port Augusta in the first instance, and would then have to be carried north to Port Darwin. They would have to be brought south from Townsville, Rockhampton, Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, and then from Melbourne right round to Port Augusta before they could be forwarded on by the proposed line to Port Darwin. </para>

We know that eastward of the MacDonnell Ranges, between Queensland and the Northern Territory and between Queensland and South Australia, there is country which might be much more closely settled than it is at the present moment. We know that if a transcontinental line were run from Palmerston in such a way as to tap that country, the State Governments of Queensland and New South Wales would construct lines to link up with that line. </para>

                            <para>- Kidston is not Queensland. He is only one man, and I say that the policy of the people of Queensland is to extend the railways of the State continually westward to tap new country and open up fresh territories capable of development. If a transcontinental line from Port Darwin were &#39;built by such a route as I have suggested, there would be an additional inducement to extend lines from the coast westward to connect with that line. If those connexions were made, troops could be sent at once from Sydney, Brisbane, Rockhampton, and Townsville, and could be massed at Port Darwin in a comparatively short time, instead of having to be sent round <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Port Augusta. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I think it would be very much better, even in the interests of South Australia, that the transcontinental railway should be constructed by such a route as I have suggested than that it should be built right down the centre of Australia. A line down the centre of Australia could not possibly pay for the next fifty or 100 years. </para>

                            <para>- Central Australia has no railway communication now. In every State in Australia the people desire that railways shall be constructed in districts suitable for closer settlement. If in the course of time it is found that the very heart of Australia is suited for closer settlement, railways will be constructed there, but that time is not now. We want railways constructed nearer to the coast now, and even from the defence point of view such railways would serve us very much better than a railway right down the centre of Australia. I believe that the day will come when there will be more than one line down the centre of Australia, and perhaps across Australia. But that will not be in our time. It is enough for us that we should do the work which lies to our hands without trying to encroach too much upon what should be done by future generations. </para>

                            <para>- I am desirous of seeing a transcontinental railway constructed in my time. We have now a railway from Sydney to Bourke, in New South Wales. Queensland has pushed her southern and western railway out to Cunnamulla; her central railway to Longreach ; and her northern railway to Cloncurry, and any one looking at the map will see how readily those lines might be connected with a transcontinental railway which would not be quite so far out as the route proposed by South Australia. If the railway, right through the centre of the continent, for which South Australia bargains, be constructed, the Commonwealth will also have to build a number of spur lines to connect with the various State railways - to connect, for example, with the Cunnamulla line, the Charleville line, the Longreach line, . the Cloncurry line, and the Bourke line. In other words, it will have to build five spur lines, in addition to the main line. That is an undertaking which under present circumstances the &#39;Commonwealth ought not to be called upon to face. It may be urged that the opponents of this agreement are dealing very unfairly with South Australia. I give that State every credit for having held the Northern Territory so long, and for having kept it white. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that if it had been as capable of settlement as is the eastern coast of Queensland, it would have been something less than fairly white. It might have been fairly black or piebald. I do not think that any particular desire has ever been exhibited even by coloured persons to settle that portion of the country. Had there been, I am not quite sure that the South Australian Government would have placed any obstacle in the way of such settlement. But the country is fairly white, and if South Australia be entitled to any credit in that connexion I willingly concede it. I am quite prepared to do what is fair by that State. I think that if the Commonwealth becomes responsible for every liability which South Australia has incurred on behalf of the Northern Territory, it will have done everything that it is incumbent upon it to do. For South Australia to attempt to lay down the lines of future development is to usurp a position which she ought not to occupy. The future development of the Northern Territory wilt have to be paid for by the people of the Commonwealth, and those who pay the piper are at least entitled to call the tune. If I paid for the development of a particular piece of country, naturally I should- expect to have some voice in determining how that development should beeffected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has suggested that if the Commonwealth does not take over the Northern Territory on the terms laid down in the proposed agreement, the South Australian Government may hand it. over to a syndicate. I do not believe that there is a syndicate in creation which would have anything to do with it, unless the country is very much better - a hundred times better - than any which I saw on my recent visit to Oodnadatta.. No syndicate would invest a single shilling in such an enterprise. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> thinks that because I am opposed to land-grant railways I am prepared to swallow any bargain which South Australia may wish to thrust upon us, he is very much mistaken. Unless that State is prepared to part with the Territory upon just terms, by all means let the syndicate have it. Syndicates are not philanthropists. They have no national policy to pursue. They are only after dividends, and I fail to see where dividends are to be obtained from the sandy desert which lies between Quorn and Oodnadatta, and which I believe extends for hundreds of miles beyond Oodnadatta. </para>

I believe that Australia is one and undivided, and that whatever is good for a portion of Australia is good for the whole of it. Similarly, what is bad for a portion of Australia is bad for the whole of it. It would be the acme of stupidity for the Commonwealth to agree to the conditions imposed in the agreement which we are now asked to ratify. Look at our present financial obligations. We are compelled to go into the loan market for the means with which to build an Australian Navy. Further, there is no prospect of any money which we may invest in taking over the Northern Territory returning interest during the next hundred years. To subscribe to the proposed agreement would be an act of folly on the part of the Commonwealth, and one which would not benefit South- Australia one iota. I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill, because I believe in the principle underlying it, which is that the Commonwealth should&#39; take over the Northern Territory, but I reserve to myself the right to vote against &#34;certain conditions contained in the agreement. </para>

                        <para>. - The very importance of this question justifies me in making a few observations before the Bill gets into Committee. I am as much impressed with the importance of this measure as is any honorable senator, and with the obligation that we owe to South .Australia as a State, and to Australia as a whole to take over the Northern Territory. As a representative of Tasmania, I wish to say that that State is in a position to deal quite impartially with the matter, as she can have no selfish interests, and is not particularly concerned with the route which the proposed railway through the Territory may traverse. Tasmania merely desires that the Territory shall be developed in the best interests of Australia as a whole. I should like to vote for the Bill, with a view to bringing about an agreement which would prove acceptable both to South Australia and the Commonwealth. But I am confronted with a very great difficulty, in that when we pass an ordinary Act of Parliament, we know that it is susceptible of amendment or repeal should experience justify the adoption of either course, whereas in this instance the Bill involves the ratification of a solemn compact which was entered into between the Premier of South Australia and the Prime Minister, and which, when once accepted by Parliament,- cannot honorably be altered. That is one reason why we should carefully scrutinize the nature of the contract into which we are entering. </para>

                            <para>- That is my principal objection to the Bill in its present form. There is just one other aspect of the matter with which I should like to deal. The Northern Territory that we wish to acquire is merely a part of the northern territory of Australia. Its acquisition will therefore establish a precedent, because it is inevitable that in the future the States must be divided into smaller areas for the purposes of better government. What has already occurred will surely be repeated. All the arguments which have been advanced in favour of the acquisition of the Territory for defence purposes, apply only to the defence of about  1,300  miles of our coastline. </para>

                            <para>- What about the other miles of seaboard to the north of Australia? Is it conceivable that the mere handful of people who own nearly a million square miles in Western Australia will continue to be responsible for that Territory for all time? Certainly not. What has happened in the case of New South Wales and will inevitably occur in Western Australia. That State will find itself compelled either to subdivide to a certain extent, or to approach the Commonwealth with a demand that the northern portion of it shall be taken over by the Central Authority. When that time arrives it will strengthen its demand by advancing similar reasons for the acquisition of that territory to those which have been advanced here to-night, and the terms now asked will be taken as a guide then. I am sensible that we should not look at this matter in a sordid way. It involves . large financial responsibilities; but they are really insignificant in comparison, with the magnitude of the Commonwealth, and the vastness of its resources. I do not look at the question merely from a monetary point of view. Let us decide it in the most generous way towards South Australia. But we have a greater responsibility than that which we owe to that State. When once we acquire the Territory, we should have no more concern for South Australia than for Queensland on the one side or Western Australia on the other. Our task will be to develop the Northern Territory as a part of the Federal Dominion, .and we must have regard, not to any one State, but to all the States. A great deal of information has been brought forward as to railway routes. I was one. of the party that accepted the hospitality of the South Australian Government by visiting Oodnadatta. I was very pleased that I went, though I must frankly acknowledge that the effect of the journey was to assure me of the impossibility of obtaining useful information on such a trip. The country that I thought was almost desert was, I was informed, very good for sheep and cattle raising. </para>

                            <para>- I went honestly desiring to learn all about it that I could. I shall not offer an opinion as to whether the railway to be constructed should proceed from Oodnadatta in the south, or from Pine Creek in an easterly direction. Before a person like myself could form an opinion upon the matter- at all, he would have to obtain the opinions of experts. There will have to be a thorough investigation by the most competent men we can commission to inquire into such a matter. We should have to build a railway primarily for developmental purposes, but also with an eye to its strategical possibilities in case we should have to defend the Territory in time of war. It is idle for a senator to express an opinion as to whether the railway should go entirely through the Northern Territory and South Australia, or by way of Queensland and New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- The agreement binds us to construct a railway from Pine Creek to some part of the frontier line dividing the Northern Territory from South Australia. A further part of the obligation is that we must connect that point with some point on the Port Augusta railway. That seems to me to be equivalent to saying that we must connect Oodnadatta, or some point near it, on the Port Augusta, railway with the Pine Creek line. Is it likely that the Federal Government, after acquiring that railway, and having the responsibility of working it and assuming the annual loss for its working, would construct another line through some other part of South Australia ? It seems to me, therefore, that we are really binding ourselves by this agreement to one line and no other. I say, with all- sincerity, that I am very sorry that I cannot see my way to support this Bill in its entirety. I should like to do so for many reasons. It is a pity that we are asked to deal with the matter at the end of a very important session, because it imposes vast obligations and responsibilities upon the Commonwealth.  We are launching out in a new direction. We are concerned, not merely with the acquisition of the Territory, but with the taking over and working of railway lines and the initiation of a policy of railway cons&#39;truction. The acquisition of the Territory will involve a change in our immigration laws; or, rather, it will involve the creation of immigration laws, because, after nine years of Federation, the only measure on our statute-book dealing with immigration is an Immigration Restriction Act. How are we to people the Northern Territory unless we invite immigrants to come there? We have, therefore, to re-shape our policy in that direction. In the circumstances, though I have a disposition to treat South Australia in- the fairest way, and to give her everything that she is entitled to, I am nevertheless equally convinced that it is my duty to treat the whole of Australia fairly, and to leave the Commonwealth free and untrammelled in the handling of this matter, and the management of it afterwards. </para>

I am of the same opinion. On that account, it is not my intention to speak at any length. But I wish to point to some references to South Australia which have been made by the last  speaker,  and others. These honorable senators have said, &#34;&#39; We have great sympathy for South Australia, and admire what she has done. We are thankful that she has kept the Commonwealth white.&#34; </para>

If this Bill is altered in the way suggested, I am convinced that South Australia will shake herself clear of the agreement altogether. But what I complain about principally is that since this agreement was made by the late Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> several years have elapsed. In the meantime, South Australia has expected the question to be settled.  Her  people believed the Prime Minister to be in earnest. They expected the question to be grappled with. But what has been the result? The Bill was kept low down on the notice-paper last session. This session, it has been on the paper for months. </para>

But, in the circumstances in which we are placed, I intend to go in for a little plain speaking, though I shall be moderate. I watched the passage of the Bill in another place. It had not the support of the whole Government. One Minister did riot vote at all. Had it not been for the members of the Opposition - the party to which I belong; the Labour party - the Bill would have been thrown out by a large majority.

                            <para>- I am just now looking at the honorable senator, whom I sometimes call the Vicar of Bray. I find that the opponents of the Government, with the exception of the Queenslanders, are supporting the Bill. The supporters of the Government, on the other hand, apparently, including their Whip, are doing all they can against the measure. I want South Australia to know that the responsibility really rests with the Government. If this Bill be thrown out, I think I can succeed in showing to South Australia that the fault rests with the Government. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> had sent round his Whip in the right way, instead of allowing him to do as he pleased, the Bill could have been carried without any trouble. </para>

                            <para>- The Government do not mean it, and must take the responsibility. Why not be honest and say straight out, &#34; This is not a Ministerial Bill &#34; ? Why leave it- to the Labour party to fight the battles of the Government? This is inconsistency in the extreme. I wish that those who profess such wonderful love for South Australia would come forward in their true colours, and throw the Bill out at the second-reading stage, if they really are opposed to it. The South Australian Parliament is now sitting ; but its session is drawing to a close, lt is necessary that South Australia should know the fate of this agreement at the earliest possible moment, and- if they are informed that the Bill has been carried or rejected they will be able to meet and take some action. That is one reason why I ask the Senate to come to a decision at once. Let the Government show their courage, let them say that they did not mean what they promised. It seems ridiculous to me to find the supporters of the Government in each House with a free hand on this important question. Whoever heard before of a Government whip having a free hand as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has in this instance? It is a hollow pretence. I desire to say a few words about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who is in the same swim as the others. </para>

When any one asked me how I intended to vote on an occasion when those sitting on this side were at daggers drawn against me I did not hesitate to say that I had decided to adopt a certain course; and neither de&#39;il nor man would have prevented me from doing so. I have been told&#39; in South Australia, and also within the precincts of Parliament House, &#34;Ah, Russell, what a mistake you made when you voted for Canberra. Where are your Canberra fellows now? Not one is alongside of you.&#34; It is very hard for me to endure it. It is very hard for my State to suffer. I cannot forget the persecution I have been subjected to. Were it not that I had some backbone I would have given in. I do hate to see anything that is crooked. I hope that even now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will try to improve his reputation and that of his Government, and will send round the Whip to get one or two more votes so as to carry the Bill. &#39; If he does not intend to do that, let him say straight out that he and his colleague here never meant to fight for the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Which he now repeats by interjection - in their treatment of this measure. I desire to remind the Senate, as I know that it is useless to remind the honorable senator, that there are a few facts connected with this question which cannot be overlooked. First of all, I want honorable senators to recollect that this is not the first time that this measure has made its appearance here. I think I am correct in saying that it is five or six years since it was first introduced to the notice of the Senate. A large number of those who are present now were present then, and a large number of those who have expressed opinions now expressed opinions then. I remember distinctly the occasion when the Bill made its first or second appearance. Those who opposed it then are opposing it now, and those who supported it then are supporting it now. I want to know whether simply because the revolution of the &#39;political whirligig has brought about on certain matters an amalgamation of those who were previously opposed, we could expect those who were opposed to this agreement to immediately become its friends. Is it reasonable to suppose that this, or any other Government, could call upon those who were good enough to extend them their support to immediately change their opinions, to reverse their previous form, on a matter of this kind ? It would be insulting the intelligence of the Senate to assume that any Government would have the audacity to ask for such a complete change of front as that. </para>

                            <para>- When I joined the Ministry, I made a reservation in regard to this matter. In common with many of my honorable friends here, I felt that the agreement might be modified with advantage to the Commonwealth, and without injustice to South Australia. And feeling that, I put my position before the Prime Minister, who - as was done in the matter of the Government Whip in the Senate - left me an absolutely free hand. When it became obvious a little later that the Bill was going to be in jeopardy here it was the Prime Minister who came and asked me if I would review my decision, and see if I could throw in my lot with the rest of the Ministry. Does that look as if the Government were trifling with the question? The Prime Minister did a thing which he was perfectly entitled to do. In view of the fact that we had . enormous Commonwealth responsibilities, and believing also - and this was the one argument that prevailed with me - that unless &#39; there was something vitally wrong, there is an obligation on a Ministry to try to carry out an agreement made by its predecessor, provided, of course, that there is no violation of principle, I decided to give a vote to carry this Bill through the Senate. I mention that fact in order to clear the Prime Minister from the very gross imputation which has been made against him, and to clear the Ministry from the accusations which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell. In this case, it amounts to something like ingratitude that he should make an accusation of that kind, in view of the facts that I have just related. I regret, indeed, that this note has been sounded. I have stated my position fully and frankly. I have stated how it is that, instead of voting to-night against the Bill, as I was at liberty to do until a few days ago, and had decided to do until the Prime Minister came to me, I intend to vote for it. I have offered, I think, the greatest guarantee as to the sincerity of the Government in trying to carry out the agreement. May I, in conclusion, express the hope that, having heard my statement, there is no other member of this Chamber who will follow the lead given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think it is worth while to continue the debate. I do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of Ministers. They have been sincere, I think, in pushing on the consideration of this question, with a view to getting it settled this session. But I cannot help noticing the difference between the attitude of the Government supporters on this agreement and the action which they took in connexion with an agreement which was recently ratified. </para>

                            <para>- The object in view was certainly different. Apparently the honorable senator is about to do the same thing in connexion with this agreement as he did in connexion with the previous one. He professes a desire that the Commonwealth should take over the Northern Territory, and yet he- intends to vote for an amendment which he knows will make that absolutely impossible. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to repeat that any honorable senator is under a delusion who thinks that South Australia is anxious to get rid of the Territory. If any honorable senators imagine that it is begging the Federal Government to take off its hands something which is of no use to it, they are mistaken. Undoubtedly, in its present condition, the Territory is a burden on the State. But the Commonwealth Parliament is partly responsible for the present annual loss, because, when the agreement was arrived at, the State Government ceased to carry on any developmental work, or to entertain any applications for the sale of land. It has received such applications, and possibly it could have disposed of a very large area but for the existence of this agreement. The State Government felt in honour bound not to sell or let another acre of land until the agreement had been dealt with by this Parliament. To that extent,  therefore, the Commonwealth Parliament is responsible for not having come to a decision sooner. I have heard a number of the opponents of the measure describe the Northern Territory as a desert. I refer to gentlemen like Senators Gray and Neild, who have never seen the country, and do not know anything about it. </para>

                        <para>As we go north, directly we cross the boundary line we find a great change in the country ; the stony plains are left behind, and timber, bushes and grass become plentiful - a sandy country, intersected by the Finke, the Goyder, the Hugh, all large water-courses, in the channels of which water can be obtained by sinking - a good stock country, supporting now over 15,000 head of horned cattle. Approaching the MacDonnell Ranges the country improves, as does the rainfall, which, at Alice Springs, averages n inches per annum. This mountain range, extending east and west for 400 miles, attains an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, giving it a most excellent climate - Professor Spencer said the finest in the world. A grand pastoral country. Sheep, horses, cattle, all do exceedingly well. Agriculture, too, is possible. From here right on to Powell&#39;s Creek good country extends for a considerable distance westwards and eastwards, right to the Queensland border. I estimate that there are 87,000,000 acres of land, with a rainfall of from 10 to 15 inches, with permanent water and springs capable of, with a railway, supporting profitably large herds of cattle, horses and flocks of sheep and Angora goats, besides some cultivation. If half of this area were lightly stocked with sheep - say, 60 to the mile - we would have over 4,100,000 sheep. Now, taking an average of 6 lbs. wool to the sheep, the annual product would be. 24,600,000 lbs. of wool - about 11,000 tons - value, at 6d. per lb., ^615,000. </para>
                        <para>The greatest distance to be railed is goo miles. The schedule rate in South Australia for that distance is under id. per lb. </para>

                        <para>The freight would pay the interest on the construction of 700 miles of railway. </para>
                        <para>These figures show that sheep can be profitably grown on this vast area, providing there is a railway, but not without. </para>

                        <para>Wheat grows in nearly every climate, and is one of the easiest crops to grow and garner. Europe produces more wheat than the whole of the rest of the world put together, and yet needs to import 500,000,000 bushels each year. Australia produces 68,000,000 bushels, Great Britain 58,000,000, and has to import 170,000,000 bushels each year. The population of the United States is increasing so fast that in another ten years it will total 100,000,000 - enough people to consume the whole of the wheat produced in Canada; so here is a chance for Australia, with its immense areas and its few people, to cut in and supply the European markets, and that is what I expect to see the great Northern Central division of the Northern Territory doing. </para>
                        <para>Between Powell&#39;s Creek and the Katherine, stretching east and west right across the Territory, is a magnificent country, embracing the Barclay tablelands and the Victoria River district. </para>
                        <para>As a result pf much research, I am strongly of the opinion that this region of 80,000,000 acres, with an average rainfall of 15 to 40 inches, will prove to be the future wheat granary of Australia. </para>
                        <para>While the railway survey is being made, which will take two years, we should send expert agriculturists to establish experimental farms for the growth of wheat. All we want to find out is the right sort of wheat to plant, and the time of the year in which to sow the seed. </para>
                        <para>This country has an elevation of from 200 to I,500 feet above sea-level, has a good climate, and no part of it is more than 350 miles from the ports of Wyndham, Darwin, Roper, McArthur, or Burketown. </para>

                            <para>- I am inclined to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> in his statement upon that point this afternoon, was slightly in error. I believe that tenders were called for the construction of the line from Palmerston to Pine Creek, and that the tenderers had the option of employing either coloured or white labour. They were asked to put in alternative tenders. There  was a difference of some thousands of pounds between the two tenders, and the South Australian Government accepted the lowest one, which permitted the contractor to employ Chinese labour. To that fact, more than to anything else, may be attributed the present position of the Northern Territory. Had the South Australian Government imported one or two thousand British navvies, probably a large number of them would have settled there and would have peopled that portion of the country with good White Australians. During the course of this debate, reference has been made to the climate of the Territory. Now, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> I had an opportunity of visiting the Northern Territory some two years ago, and from my own observation I can say that it will produce almost anything. It will produce hardy, healthy men and women. At Brock&#39;s Creek, 70 miles south of Palmerston, I met a lady and her daughter who were as fine samples of womanhood and girlhood as can be found in any part of Australia. The lady, I imagine, was between thirty and thirty-five years of age, and her daughter was about fifteen or sixteen years of age. Both of them were born in the Northern Territory, and the girl&#39;s grandmother was still resident in Palmerston. These facts prove that the climate of the Territory is a healthy one. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> could find similar cases in Melbourne. In addition to tropical products, the Northern Territory will produce nearly every product of the temperate climes. About 100 miles up the Victoria River there is a station which is owned by a man named Bradshaw, and when I visited the Territory he had growing in a little plot on the bank of the river nearly every variety of English vegetable to be obtained in the southern part of Australia, including cabbages, cauliflowers, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, and onions. I have no desire to prolong this debate. I understand that the motion for the second reading of the Bill will be carried without a division. Honorable senators are willing to show their sympathy with the proposal to take over the Northern Territory by affirming the principle which underlies the Bill. But immediately after they intend to evidence their insincerity by voting for an amendment which will render its transfer to the Commonwealth practically impossible. I know the feeling of the people and Parliament of South Australia upon this question. When this agreement was before the South Australian Parliament, the greatest difficulty was experienced in inducing the Legislative Council to indorse it. Member after member emphasized the great value of the Territory, and argued that South Australia was parting with it too cheaply. I am satisfied that if the agreement be not adopted, the Commonwealth will never be afforded another opportunity of taking over this magnificent country. South Australia was only prompted to offer it to the Commonwealth by the consideration that in the interests of Australia as a whole it was essential that it should be developed more&#39; rapidly than she could develop it. Realizing the possibility of an invasion by Asiatics in the near future, she made a substantial sacrifice when she subscribed to the agreement which is now under consideration, and thus made it possible for the Commonwealth to take over the Territory and develop- it in the best interests of Australia. During the course of his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> compared South Australia to a man who had failed in business, and who waited upon a friend to ask for financial assistance, and then attempted to dictate the rate of interest which he should pay for that assistance. The honorable senator appeared to think that the friend was entitled to charge the man who was in financial straits 1,000 per cent. When the Premier of South Australia made this agreement with the Prime Minister, he realized that he was giving more than good value for what South Australia was getting. He also knew that unless the provision regarding the railway formed part of the agreement, there was not the remotest hope of getting it through the South Australian Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> would have been wilfully throwing away the rights of his State if he had agreed to the Commonwealth taking over that great Territory with a free hand to build the suggested serpentine railway through New South Wales and Queensland. Pie realized that the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta must always be a drain on the resources of South Australia, until it is pushed further and taps the good country that will furnish it with freight and make it a paying proposition. That is the reason why the whole question hinges on the route of the railway. Honorable senators who vote for the agreement on the understanding that they will afterwards vote against the railway provision, ought to know that an alteration of the agreement in that respect means the rejection of it. No doubt the numbers are up ; but those honorable senators who are sincerely anxious that the Commonwealth shall have the Territory may as well be quite sure that the rejection of the clause relating to the railway will make it absolutely impossible for the Commonwealth to secure possession. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support the Bill in its entirety. One of the strongest reasons in favour of it is that it is desirable to place on the shoulders of the Commonwealth the task of proving what  our tropical and sub-tropical areas are capable of producing. If we do not undertake that task, we may rely upon it that South Australia will set about it in a lame and halting fashion through want of means. It is not reasonable to expect that a small population, heavily indebted, can carry on the burden as South Australia has done in the past. One of the strongest reasons advanced against the Bill is that South Australia ought not to dictate to the Federal Parliament as to the mode of developing the Territory. I remind those who entertain that view that Australia is indebted to South Australia for bearing this burden. Had she not done so, the Northern Territory would, in all probability, have been a Crown Colony, and perhaps large settlements of alien labour would have been implanted there. The connexion of South Australia with the Territory would be regarded in an entirely different light if it were remembered that that State has stood in the breach and held the Territory in trust. South Australia, having been in the position of an- .agent in trust, we must surely allow her to insist upon some conditions on resigning her trust. The condition on which she insists is a very reasonable one. It simply means that when the Territory is taken over by the Commonwealth, a line of railway shall be built connecting with South Australia. . What disadvantage is there in that? If the other suggested course is taken, and the railway is taken out of the Territory, the result will be to develop portions of the eastern States which are already well looked after, whilst ignoring the development of the Territory itself, which should be the principal object of our concern. As to the resources of the Territory, if honorable senators will only read the reports of men who have travelled there, they must be driven to the conclusion that it is a very rich patch indeed. Even if there be a large margin of waste land, there is still within the 500,000 square miles plenty of valuable country. There is in the MacDonnell Ranges gold and coal. </para>

Let honorable senators recall the purchase of Louisiana by the United States. The American Government paid to the French something like &#163;5,000,000. Certainly, the population was larger than that of the Northern Territory ; but, on the other hand, there were no railways in Louisiana, which was described by some of the Jeremiahs of the time in similar terms to those used by some honorable senators concerning the Northern Territory, lt was said that the land was so poor that the bones of those who tried to work it would be all that would be left to tell the tale.

                            <para>- Quite so ; he was halting in his attitude. But those who prophesied that Louisiana would prove a hopeless waste, have been shown to be utterly wrong. I am convinced that portions of the Northern Territory will prove to be most useful for purposes of tropical and sub-tropical agriculture. Already the temperate parts of Australia are fairly well occupied, and people are being forced into the arid portions of the country. Opportunities will be needed for white men to develop the north. Why should we palter about the terms, in face of the fact that South Australia up to the present has manfully borne the burden in the interest of Australia as a whole? I consider that, in refusing to concede the terms for which she asks, we shall be acting in a paltry huckstering spirit. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know of any such case in Queensland. Croydon was only  120  miles from the coast, and the Queenslanders thought that that was a wonderful field to work. I think that we should come to terms with the State. We are offered a Territory with limitless possibilities, and the obligation is placed upon our shoulders of trying to discover what that large tropical area of Australia is capable of producing. When that work is carried out in a systematic way by an authority which will have unlimited funds at its disposal, it will prove of immense benefit to both Queensland and Western Australia- As regards the financial aspect of the question, certainly the Commonwealth is offered a very fair asset by South Australia. Even though the agreement may appear to be favorable to the State, we should never forget that but for its heroic action we might have had a far more formidable problem to deal with, indeed one which would have taxed all the wisdom, diplomacy, and force of -the other States to solve. I intend to support the Bill, believing that in doing so I am taking the true Australian course, and  that after all is said and done South Australia will not have very much the best of the bargain if the agreement is ratified. </para>

                        LARGIE (Western Australia) I&#34;10-2&#93;-  -  I only propose to speak for a few minutes, because I recognise that the agreement has been debated so exhaustively both here and elsewhere that there is not much left to be said. Unlike some of the preceding speakers, I cannot say that I have a personal knowledge of the character of the land in the Northern Territory. But I can speak with some knowledge of the Kimberley country in Western Australia. Round Wyndham and Derby in that State there is, I suppose some of the finest grazing country to be found in Australia. I have been informed that the country from there to Port Darwin, and a great deal of the country back from Port Darwin, is somewhat similar to the country in the Kimberley district. If that be true, I think it can be accepted that the land in the Northern Territory is very fair. I do not think that the land in any part of Australia is so extremely rich that it can be boasted of in comparison with the land in other countries. We know that, so far as much of our land is concerned, there is not a great deal to boast of. But that fact should not, in my opinion, enter very largely into the question of taking over the Northern Territory. If the. country is poor, that is an additional reason why the Commonwealth should relieve South Australia and accept a load which all the States should bear. In the consideration of a great national question the parochial spirit should be excluded as far as is possible. I regret that the tone of many speakers to-night was decidedly parochial. We have dealt with many great national questions in this Parliament.

I would be very sorry indeed to give a vote of a parochial nature. Consequently. I intend to support the second reading of this Bill, believing that I am taking up the national attitude on a great question.

                    <para class="block">The insertion of the amendment would mean that the Committee approved and ratified the agreement, with the exception of the paragraphs relating to the construction of a railway from Pine Creek to a point on the southern border of the Territory, and thence to a point on the Port Augusta railway, and the taking over of the Port Augusta railway. This question was debated very fully on the second reading, and I do not propose now to go into any elaborate disquisition, because I believe that every honorable senator has made up his mind. What I am standing out for is the complete power of this Parliament to deal with the Northern Territory, in the light of full knowledge, in anyway which it may think proper. </para>

                            <para>- Suppose that the State did, would the honorable senator still say that we must accept the agreement? It contains several extraneous propositions to which I object. I&#39; want to know why, in order to develop the Territory, we must take over the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway? Every other State has developed its territory by running railways from its seaboard into the interior, and when necessary a State has connected its railways with the railways of adjoining States. Why should not the Commonwealth do the same thing with the Northern Territory? </para>

                            <para>- South Australia proper would not extend half way across the continent after the Territory was taken over.I am not  going  to argue the merits or demerits of any railway. What I contend is that we should not be bound down when we have not sufficient knowledge to enable us to arrive at a just conclusion. When the Commonwealth has taken over the Territory, as by my amendment we would propose to do without any hampering conditions, I want this Parliament to be free to arrive at a conclusion which will be fair to all sides, especially to the Commonwealth, in the light of f&#39;ill knowledge. South Australia has nothing to fear. If she has the best route I am satisfied that the Commonwealth Parliament will do the best thing for her, and in arriving at any conclusion hereafter the State, through her representatives in this Parliament, will have a full voice in common with the representatives of every other State. At present she wants to tie the National Parliament hand and foot before she will agree to surrender the Territory, which she is only maintaining at a severe loss to herself. We do not want the State to  sacrifice herself for the Commonwealth. We desire to relieve her, but instead of being glad, she replies, &#34; We will not allow you to do so unless you agree to these conditions.&#34; I do not think that that is fair. I am inclined to do a fair thing by the State. I want to take over the Territory- with every fraction of financial obligation which properly belongs to it, but when it is taken over this Parliament should have its hands free to develop the country for national purposes, and for the benefit of all the States in any way which it mav think proper. </para>

                        <para>&#91;10.15&#93;. - I intend saying but a few words. This question has been so thoroughly threshed out during yesterday and to-day that it is necessary only that I should point out that .the carrying of the amendment means, as a matter of course, the defeat of the Bill, and honorable senators must accept that responsibility in voting for it. Honorable senators have asserted the principle of the desirability of the acquisition of the Territory by the Commonwealth, and if they carry the amendment they will run the risk of subsequently discovering that it will be doubtful whether the Commonwealth can secure the Northern Territory. This will be the test vote, and it is useless to argue the matter further, having regard to all that has taken place. </para>

                                may be fond of asking for charity but South Australia is not. This matter has been under consideration now for some years. Recognising that the Commonwealth should take over the Northern Territory the Prime Minister discussed the question with a Premier of South Australia. I do not think that South Australia was pressing this question forward or asked for the Conference about it. - The negotiations, I believe, were initiated by the Government of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister and -the Premier of South Australia at the time came together, threshed the matter out, and came to an agreement which would provide for the taking over of the Territory by the Commonwealth, and, at the&#39; same time, for doing that which would-be absolutely just and fair to South Australia. To that agreement there is attached the signature of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the signature of a Premier of South Australia. Now, I say that if that agreement is to be torn up the responsibility will rest with the Senate. If South Australia, recognising that there is no hope of the Commonwealth taking over the Territory under a fair agreement such as this is, seeks some other means of developing it the Commonwealth Parliament must not complain. If the people of South Australia say that there is no way of developing the Northern Terri tory in the circumstances, except by the construction of a. transcontinental railway on the land grant principle, then I say that, although I do not believe in that kind of thing, I for one shall be inclined to say that I will agree to it. If that course should eventually be adopted the responsibility for it will rest, not upon South Australia, but upon the Senate for carrying this amendment.

                            <para>- I believe that if honorable senators will listen to me for five minutes I shall be able to convince them that they would be doing wrong by carrying the amendment. It is admitted that the Northern Territory cannot be developed without a railway. There are some honorable senators who want to develop it by building railways in Queensland and New South Wales. But does any one believe that an intelligent Federal Parliament would spend the money of the Commonwealth in building railways in Queensland and New South Wales to develop Federal territory ? </para>

                            <para>- I wish to say. as briefly as possible that the only way to develop the Northern Territory is to build a railway right through the centre of it. Such a line must be the best to construct if we desire to develop the whole of the country. That should be clear to any intelligent man. Why then do honorable senators cavil at this condition which was inserted probably at the instance of the late Premier of South Australia? The sensible way to develop the Territory, and the way which will, without doubt, be ultimately adopted by the Commonwealth, should it acquire the Territory, is to build a trunk line as nearly as possible through the centre of it, and allow the States to connect with it on either side by branch lines. The agreement gives Queensland the right to connect with the transcontinental line by a line from Brisbane, Rockhampton or Townsville. No doubt it would be to the advantage of Queensland ports that they should capture some of the trade of Central Australia. It cannot be imagined for a moment that the whole of the trade of this great country will go to Port Augusta on the one hand or to Port Darwin on the other. If there is a port nearer either in Queensland or in New South Wales that port will be certain to secure a portion of the trade. It would be better for the State of Queensland to have a trunk line constructed through the centre of the </para>

                    <para>. - This morning I raised a question to which I now take the liberty of again referring. I then read from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> an extract which I do not propose to repeat, because I think that honorable senators are already familiar with it. It related to an incident which occurred in this chamber exactly a week ago, when the Vice-President of the Executive Council denied the accuracy of certain statements made by me and challenged me to prove them. Since then I have secured the proof, and I am now about to produce it. Upon the occasion in question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that my statement that he was at one time the  President  of the Bourke Labour Electoral League was false. He added that he was prepared without any qualification to resign his seat if I could prove that he had ever belonged to the Labour Party. </para>

The result of the discussion was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Millen</inline> tendered his resignation as  president  of the branch in writing.

                        <para>- The Labour League which exists there is the successor of the original Bourke Labour Electoral League, and took over the books from that body. The extracts which I have read have been taken from those books. The proof of my statements is to be found in the document which I hold in my hands, and which has been forwarded to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#39;</inline> White, who is still secretary of the Shearers&#39; Union in that district. He vouches for the accuracy of the statements which he has supplied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has more than once stated in this Chamber that he sat beside <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> at a Labour Conference which was held in Sydney, and at which the latter represented the Carriers&#39; Union of Bourke.  His  statement is corroborated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Rae and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> McDonnell. All this took place prior to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> standing for the New South Wales Parliament in  1894. </para>

It was at the conference which was held in  1893  that the great debate took place regarding the pledge which should be adopted by the Labour party. I do not know whether it is necessary for me to read the documents which I hold in my hand. I have outlined the contents of them, and, therefore, I do not think it is necessary for me to do so. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> desires to examine them he is at liberty to do so. </para>

I remember a statement made by way of interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and by way of retort I said that he had, like a good many other men, endeavoured to get into public life by the aid of the Labour party - the party which at that time he was doing all he possibly could to ridicule. I made another reference quite recently to the same matter ; and on that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> stated that the conference to which I referred was a very special conference, called for a very special purpose, and that he was there as a very special delegate, representing a special section of the people in Bourke, namely, the Carriers&#39; Union.

                        <para>- He said that the question with which he was delegated to deal was one having reference to the employment of Afghans in Bourke. I thought my memory was really not so defective as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> imagined. I had an idea that I recollected that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was the same gentleman of that name as had sat beside me in that conference. I also remember that that gathering was one of the most important conferences ever held in connexion with the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- They would improve the book, and make it more like a work written by a man who knew what he was talking about. This conference, as I say, dealt with the question of the pledge, which brought about the division of parties. That is to say, it gave room for the Labour &#34;rats&#34; to get out. And they took advantage of the opportunity to get out. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> time after time in this Senate, so emphatically denied his connexion with the Labour party, I candidly admit that I had to think seriously over the matter, and to ask myself the question whether I had really made a mistake - whether I had unjustifiably accused the honorable senator of having been connected with the party. But now the evidence to hand is such that I am absolutely confident that all I said was correct. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the honorable senator was looking for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Langwell&#39;s</inline> scalp. I am satisfied that there was a feeling of that kind at the conference to which I have referred. Indeed, I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> very presence there was particularly concerned with a desire to take the scalp of &#34; Hughie &#34; Langwell; rather than representing the unionists of Bourke. However, there are the facts. I claim now that something more is required at the hands of the Vice-President of the Executive Council than a mere denial of the facts which have been brought forward. They are facts that may be said to be indisputably correct. They are facts that have been drawn from the record of the present <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and they prove his presence at various meetings that have taken place in connexion with the organization and general conduct of the Labour party. Therefore, I think it is fair that the honorable senator should carry out his promise to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. He should be as good as his word and send his resignation along. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel that, quite apart from the fact that I am personally interested in this matter, it is not a very edifying spectacle for the Senate of Australia to be occupied in listening to matters which evidently proceed from personal venom, and which are directed to no public question. They  involve no principle, and are not connected in any way with the welfare of this country. Before I proceed to deal with the matters which have been raised, and to show to what extent venom can hurry people into making statements and can blind their judgment as to the meaning of ordinary words, let me congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie upon his method of attack. He endeavoured to bring this matter forward this&#62; morning under circumstances which he knew would prevent me from giving a denial at that time. I am unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> in this respect - that I do not regard it as a disgrace to a man to have been a member of a Political Labour League, and if I had ever been a member of one I should not have been in a hurry to repudiate it. The whole position is this : The honorable senators have allowed their desire to attack me in this matter - a desire which has been ceaseless and sleepless - to impel them to rush away, wire all over Australia, and scrape up the records of twenty years, for the purpose of coming here and making a statement in the hope of damaging me. I shall leave it to the Senate, after I have concluded, to decide whether they have succeeded or not. I wish to say first of all that, had I been a member nf a Political Labour League, I certainly should not have felt any inclination to repudiate it. Had I been a member of an\ other political bodies and had seen reason for changing my views and for leaving them, I should not have felt under an obligation to repudiate my former connexion with them. It is quite clear, however, that the honorable senators who have spoken &#34;dc not regard it as a particularly outrageous thing for a man to leave a political body with which he has formerly been associated. Otherwise they would have nothing else to do but to preach  sermons against several members of the very party to which they belong. Indeed, I might- say that half the members of their party from New South Wales are men who within recent times were applicants for nomination from the party to which I belong. It is obvious, therefore,- that the members of the Labour party do not mind recruits who have left another party to join their own. They  do not object to a person leaving a political party, provided it is their own party which is joined.  They  keep all their venom for those who hold a contrary view to their own. Let me come now to the actual facts of this case. </para>

                        <para>- I have admitted that I was at the conference, but I deny that it was of the nature indicated. It is quite obvious from the statement by my two accusers - if I may dignify them with that name - that they are not aware of the facts. Let me state them. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> aware that at the time when I was present at the conference to which he has referred, I was actually a candidate in opposition to the Labour candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Langwell.</inline> I stood again in 1894. From 1891 to 1894 I was the avowed candidate for Bourke in opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Langwell.</inline> This being so, how was it possible for me to join the Political Labour League? What k;nd of labour league would have tolerated in its midst any one who had just defeated its own candidate, and who was openly avowed as the opponent of its candidate at the next election? I ask honorable senators to put to themselves the question whether any Political Labour League would have tolerated such conduct on the part of one of its members ? </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White</inline> said anything of the kind it would be untrue. On that point I can appeal to the Senate to take my word, unsupported as it is, against the equally unsupported word of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White.</inline> I will &#39; presently give the reasons why I represented a body at that conference at all. It must be remembered that the Labour Leagues in those days were purely industrial bodies. They were quite distinct from the Political Labour Leagues of to-day, which are their successors. They were, I will admit, extremely radical in their views, and were largely composed of those who to-day form the Political Labour Leagues. But the League referred to formed&#39; itself on such a basis that when it secured the selection of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Langwell</inline> as its candidate, he was repudiated by the Labour bodies of Sydney. It is quite clear that the Labour body at Bourke, call it what von will, was not in touch with, or a branch of, the existing central Labour organization in Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Langwell</inline> was not admitted as a member of the Labour party until some time afterwards. I mention that fact to show that the Labour body at Bourke was not a Political Labour League. I have never denied that I was present at a conference, or that I was a member of the Labour body at Bourke. </para>

At that time the very big question agitating the people of Bourke was the introduction of camels and Afghan drivers. The Carriers&#39; Union, which was a fairly strong body, was organizing an agitation for legislation to suppress the introduction of those aliens. At that time the matter was of great importance to Bourke, which was a large distributing centre. The Carriers&#39; Union consisted, not as its name would imply, of carriers only, for I venture to say that nine out of every ten business men in Bourke were members of it, as the only means they had of assisting the carriers to protest against the introduction of coloured aliens. To that extent it was a political league in the sense that it was aiming at a political object - legislation to suppress the introduction of aliens. It invited me to attend the conference as its delegate. I had never attended a meeting of the union in my life, but I had taken an active part in the agitation to close the door against the introduction of Afghans. I was presented by the Carriers&#39; Union with a ticket of honorary membership, and on that I went down with one specific mandate only, which was to endeavour to get the conference to deal with the question of coloured labour. But I regret to say that it was so busy wrangling over its pledge that that question was never dealt with until towards the last, when, perhaps, five minutes was all the time that could be devoted to it. Owing to the frequency with which the gag was applied there, I never had an opportunity of fulfilling the mission with which I was despatched from Bourke. I have now made my statement on the matter. To summarize it, in 1891 I was opposing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Langwell,</inline> the Labour candidate. I could if time had permitted, or it was worth while, have produced ample journalistic evidence that from 1891 to 1894 I never ceased to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Langwell,</inline> and in the latter year I again stood against the Labour candidate. That is the first thing I put before honorable senators to show that it would have been impossible for me to be a member of a Political Labour League, either in that district or in any other. The next thing I put before honorable senators was an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> showing clearly that the conference I attended was not a conference of Political Labour Leagues as understood to-day, nor was it so called. It was a meeting at which industrial unions as well as political bodies were represented. </para>

                        <para>- Would the honorable senator admit there to-day as delegates the representatives of socialistic or single-tax leagues? Certainly not. Yet such persons were at that conference. The conference of that day and the conference of the present day are two different things. I attended the conference as the representative of an industrial union in pursuit of a mission of which I have no reason to be ashamed. That was one of the first steps taken in that far-back country to voice a growing protest against the introduction of coloured aliens. I have made a clear statement on the matter, and I am not at all sorry that my honorable friends have brought it up. If they think that in someway or other it stands to my disgrace that in the earlier days of the Labour movement, thinking that it would travel along safe lines, I was inclined to take a kindly interest in it, they are welcome to whatever satisfaction they can get out of that. When I look back to the beginning of the great Labour movement, I simply regard&#39; anything which I did in the light of a dose of political measles. I express the hope that I have done with them. </para>
