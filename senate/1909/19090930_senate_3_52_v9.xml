                        <para class="block">Has the attention of the Government been directed to a letter, appearing- in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of  28th  September, signed by J. Denistoun Wood, and which contains the following paragraph :  - " I would call your attention to the fact that, by the  24th  section,' the amount of a pension ' is to be at such rate as, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the commissioner or  deputy  commissioner .... deems- reasonable and sufficient.' It appears to me that your first answer (if I construe it correctly) lays down the principle that all that a commissioner has to do is to ascertain whether any of the deductions expressly mentioned in the Act have to be made, and that if none of them have  to be made, then he is bound to grant the ' full pension,' whereas the section, as I contend, . provides that he has in every case a discretion as to the amount to be granted..... If the Act contemplates .... that the amount may be less than <inline font-style="italic">£26</inline> per annum (irrespective of any question of the statutory deductions), what are ' the circumstances ' to which ' regard ' should be had? Surely, one of them is whether two persons claiming pensions are living separately or are living together as husband and wife. It cannot be denied that a married couple living together can live upon a smaller annual sum than two persons living separately from each other." </para>

                <para class="block">I take it that as this measure deals with a matter which' has been more or less present in our minds for some time, it will not be necessary for me to speak at any great length in recommending it to the consideration of honorable senators. The Bill, is one of very few clauses, and, perhaps, a summary of them might with advantage be given. Clause  2  sanctions the appointment of a High Commissioner. Clause 3 covers the term of the appointment, and contains a proviso for re-appointment and a sub-clause dealing with the possibility of removing from the office a gentleman who, for the reasons set out in the Bill, may be regarded as incapable of further continuing in it. Clause 4, in general terms, deals with the functions which will devolve upon  the High Commissioner upon his appointment. It will be noted that power is taken -to add to the functions stated in the clause should occasion require it. Once the office is established there may, from time to lime, arise fresh functions which it would be necessary to intrust to the High Commissioner. This clause has, therefore, been drafted in such a- way that the greatest freedom possible is given to the Government to impose upon the High Commissioner the performance of all duties which can advantageously be carried out by such an officer. Clause  5  provides that the High 'Commissioner shall, if requested by the State Governments, be at liberty to act for them in matters of State concern. </para>

                        <para>- For one or for all. Of course, the matter will be entirely within the discretion of the State Governments, but it has been thought possible that there may be occasions on which a State Government may seek the services of the High Commissioner, and in such cases under this clause legislative sanction could be given to the High Commissioner acting, if so requested, on behalf of the Government of a State. Clause 6 deals with the salary to be attached to the office, which is set down at an amount which I venture to think honorable senators will not regard as excessive. It is proposed that the High Commissioner shall be paid a salary of  .£3,000.  with an allowance of  £2,000  per annum for the expenses of an official residence. Clause  7  imposes restrictions against the occupant of the office holding positions in companies and similar institutions. Clauses  8  and  9  cover the appointment, both from Australia and by the High . Commissioner himself, of officers who may be required to enable him to carry out the duties of the office. The Bill I submit is a natural and logical outcome of Federation. Under our Constitution all external affairs are under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth authorities. When I say external affairs, honorable senators will naturally think at once of the development of trade relations and matters which might arise in connexion' with shipping. All such matters come within the jurisdiction of the Government of the Commonwealth. Modern conditions are such that there is no nation of any standing or with any claim to progressive aspirations, that has not its representatives resident in all the principal countries with which it has. diplomatic or business relationships, and especially in those countries with which its business relationships are most extensive. That being the case, it will be agreed that the representation of Australia in Great Britain is particularly necessary. The two countries are parts of the one Empire, their Governments are in frequent intercourse, there is a natural, and lately an increasing, tendency on. the part of the people of the one country to seek to understand those of the other, and there is, what, perhaps, is more pleasing, an obvious striving by the people of each not to misunderstand the other. All these considerations render it extremely desirable that we .should have in London some authoritative mouth-piece through which, as occasion requires, Australia may speak where Australian interests are involved. Amongst the reasons which, perhaps, I might advance for the creation of this office is the fact that the trade between Australia and Great Britain is now in the neighbourhood of  £60,000,000  per annum. It is obvious that a very slight thing, even a temporary prejudice, might tend to deflect a portion of that trade from its present channel. It has happened before, and might happen again, that, as the result of a little misunderstanding as to the tendency of some of our legislation, a false prejudice might be created in Great Britain. A High Commissioner on the spot, closely in touch with the aspirations, ideals, and aims of Australasia, as he no doubt would be, would be in a position to set at rest any misapprehension which, might arise in Great Britain due to the imperfect cable messages which convey from the one country to the other news of what is taking place in each. Apart from trade matters, there is one other consideration which should undoubtedly have an important bearing on this appointment. Whatever immigration policy may be decided upon in the future, I am sure we are all agreed in the hope that the major portion of the immigrants arriving in Australia will come from Great Britain, from the countries to which, directly or indirectly, we owe our birth. That being so, the supervision of our immigration policy, whether it be a modest or an expansive one, must be intrusted to some one at Home representative of the Commonwealth, and there could be no better, and should, I think, be no other, official intrusted with it than the High Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to direct the attention of the honorable senator to the fact that while the State Agents-General are, no doubt, working well and loyally for their States, they are, to some extent, in conflict one with the other. Apart from what they may be able to do in the matter of immigration - and I wish in no sense to discredit their efforts - it is clear that there is no one at present at Home who is in a position to speak for Australia as a whole. I shall refer a little later to a- possible modification of the duties of the present Agents-General of the States should the office of High Commissioner be created. </para>

                            <para>- I should prefer to put it in this way : I think that some literature has been quoted in this House in which it has been shown that statements circulated by the Governments of one State have not been altogether complimentary to the other States. A resident of Great Britain, reading this somewhat contradictory literature, might be disposed to say, " These people cannot agree amongst themselves as to what they have to offer," and might, therefore, discount all statements coming from Australia. I do not wish to be drawn into anything which" might appear to be a reflection upon the gentlemen who at present discharge the duties of State Agents-General. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is limiting his consideration of the matter to the question of immigration. I have said that, no matter what immigration policy is proposed, it must have an important bearing upon the appointment of a High Commissioner. The duties of the High Commissioner, apart from those connected with immigration, would, of course, be largely diplomatic, if one may use that word to describe communications from a country like Australia. In this connexion, I propose to quote a sentence from a communication addressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges some years ago to the then Federal Government.  His  Honour, who, I understand, was in London at the time, was invited by the Barton Government to forward them a communication outlining the duties which are performed by the High Commissioner for Canada. As a result, he sent out a very interesting document from which I should like to quote a few extracts. The first of these reads - </para>

                        <para>While the Governor-General' is the channel of communication between the Governments of Britain and Australia, it appears that, there may be a large amount of work that may be called diplomatique that the- High Commissioner would be required' to attend to. It would be his duty to watch all proposed legislation, to see if such legislation might affect Australian interests, and, if so, to communicate at once both with the Colonial Office and the Australian Government, and to take such steps-, and to make such representations, as might he necessary to delay the passing of such Acts- until the Government of Australia, had been consulted and: its interests safeguarded. And in cases where- other Colonial interests were also liable to be affected, to make common cause with the representatives of such Colonies. </para>

                    <para class="block">I would draw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> attention to the very important range of duties covered by the portion of the report which I have just read. It must be obvious to all that no State representative could in any way claim a hearing in the name of Australia. Yet it might easily happen that a treaty about to be entered into by the Mother Country, and which had almost been concluded, might materially prejudice the interests of the Commonwealth. In such circumstances, it would be the duty of the High Commissioner to make representations in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges has outlined. That duty could not be discharged by our present representative, Captain Collins, or by the representative of any State- </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend does not suggest that a cable message regarding any matter that he wished to bring under my notice would be half as effective as would be a personal visit from him. The cable is a very useful adjunct, but- it does not enable us to make nearly so effective representations as we should be able to make through the medium of a High Commissioner. Whilst it is possible to send Home general directions by cable, we cannot always fill in the necessary details, and we cannot be prepared to meet the reply which may be forthcoming.. Therefore, a representative upon the 'spot has  all the advantage over one who* has to communicate his wishes from a distance per medium of the cable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges went on' to say - </para>

                            <para>- All things are possible when a good sound stable Government are in office. There is another way in which the High Commissioner would be able to act for Australia very much better than can several Agents-General - I refer to the matter of disseminating information concerning the Commonwealth. Each State representative is clearly under an obligation only to supply information pertaining to his own State. I do not say for a moment that he wishes to suppress information regarding Australia. But to disseminate it is certainly not his business. His business is to represent in as favorable a light as possible the conditions which obtain in his own State. </para>

But whatever competition may exist between State and State, we certainly ought to have in London a representative empowered to speak for the whole of Australia. I should like to quote still another extract from the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges, with a view to showing what the Canadian office is doing in the matter of disseminating information in regard to the Dominion- </para>

                        <para>The Canadian Office does a large amount of work in what I may call its Intelligence Department. It has a library well furnished with books, pamphlets, &amp;c, on Canadian matters; and the librarian himself is an index as to where information on any subject connected with Canadian interests can be obtained. Samples are kept of the various Canadian products, details of the productive capacity of the land, in short, every species of information that may be useful to intending and desirable immigrants, to manufacturers, to capitalists, and to mining investors. It seems to me that such a Department might also usefully be on the watch for probable markets for Australian products, seas to keep Australia informed where purchasers might be found, and possibly purchasers informed as to where the materials they are in need of can be purchased. </para>

                    <para>But, in addition to having a High Commissioner in London, Canada has agents in many provincial towns in England, whose business it is to advance the trade of the Dominion. To some extent, they are under the supervision of the High Commissioner, but act quite independently of him. </para>

Whatever the possibility of conflict may be as between the representative of one State and that of another, it would be impossible for a High Commissioner, who would devote his energies to furthering the interests of Australia, to do other than further the" interests of the States. There is just one other matter to which I desire to direct attention, and here I can look for the sympathetic support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> -  1  refer to the effect which the appointment of a High Commissioner may have upon the present States agencies in London. That, of course, is a matter entirely for the Governments of the several States who have the appointment of these officers, and can continue them if they wish. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. But while the Bill makes provision for the High Commissioner acting for the States if they so desire, it in no sense attempts - it would be futile for us to do so - to make any suggestion to those States as to what they should do. I should like to quote here a summary of a report received from the late Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers, who expresses the view which I have just enunciated, that if the High Commissioner is appointed, as his powers develop, there will be a tendency on the part of the States to transfer to him many of the functions now discharged by the Agents-General. This letter is certainly four years old; but further correspondence indicates that the idea contained in it has also been entertained by the Premiers of other States - </para>

                        <para>In a letter dated 14th September, 1904, the Premier of New South Wales submitted for consideration that the time had arrived when a High Commissioner for the Commonwealth should be appointed, the duties of the position to include those now performed by the Agents-General on behalf of the several States; that in association with the office of High Commissioner, or, if thought advisable, independently thereof, a Commercial Agency for Australia might also be established, with the object of representing the interests of all the States of the Commonwealth in Great Britain and Europe. If these suggestions were adopted, he thought that a considerable amount of saving on present expenditure, must result, and that the higher and better representation of Australian interests would be secured. New South Wales maintained in London an Inspecting Engineer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. W. Darley),</inline> whose services were found of great value in the matter of inspection of material for railways and other public works, and advising in engineering matters of interest to the State of New South Wales, and the experience gained in that respect induced the Premier to suggest that it would be of mutual advantage if such an officer were appointed to act for the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>-I think that he had to do with purchasing railway material and other things ; but other States continued to act independently. Of. course, under the Bill, the option will still be with them to join together in carrying out some such suggestion as that made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers, leaving other functions to be discharged by the High Commissioner. I have read the summary of the letter, because it seems to me to indicate the possibility of economies being effected later on. </para>

Thought, however, that the suggestion was premature, and would not be entertained until the High Commissioner had been in office for a year or two. Was confident the Government of Western Australia would be prepared to fall into line with any action, but failing united action, did not see "that much, if anything, could be done. </para>
                    <para>That indicates that there are some who hold the idea that upon the establishment of the High Commissioner's office, there will be a tendency for certain functions at present discharged by half-a-dozen officers to gravitate into the hands of one.

                        <para>The Commonwealth office in London was established in 1906. The necessity for some agency, apart from the Agent-General's offices which had been previously utilized for the Commonwealth business in England, was badly felt in the Defence Department in connexion with which the following work has to be undertaken in England. Supervision of orders for war material, and of their prompt and proper execution; the shipment of orders; collecting information on defence matters, &amp;c. It had been found that stores were frequently wrongly supplied, that old patterns were sent instead of new, that orders were not executed with despatch, that the most economical methods were not employed, and that delay occurred in the forwarding of - shipping documents, &amp;c. Since the opening of the office these defects have been remedied, and the requirements of the Department are now met to their entire satisfaction. </para>

In matters of defence- and other matters which spring out of them, we see nearly every day how necessary it is for Australia to be on the alert, and- to have a representative whose chief object would be the maintenance of a direct channel of thought, between" Australia and the Old Country ; who would, at many important functions, be able to take the' opportunity of conveying Australian truths to English ears ; who, in- matters of trade and commerce, might, by securing a little delay, prevent an evil which it would not be possible to undo later.

                            <para>- It has. I cannot say that the proposal to have one office has fallen through, but for the present it is in abeyance. It occurred to Ministers that it insight be well to ask the sanction of Parliament to the creation of this office. No overtures have been made with regard to suitable sites, but if we create a High Commissioner within a reasonable time, that is a matter which he will be better able to deal with on the spot than we could hope, to do- by means of cablegrams. </para>

                <para class="block">The Committee has already decided that a transfer or a change from subdivision to subdivision of an electorate cannot take place until the claimant has lived in the new subdivision for a month. But this proposed new section deals with an original claim for a vote, and I do not see why a claimant should be required to live in the subdivision for a month before he can make' a claim for a vote. The Franchise -Act provides that six months in the Commonwealth shall qualify an adult for a vote. Hitherto only that residence in the Commonwealth has been required, and if a man had been in a subdivision for only two weeks, but, of course, in the Commonwealth for six months, he could get enrolled. In some cases this provision, if adopted, will extend the qualifying time to seven months. We ought not to lengthen the time. The Minister  says  that for administrative purposes it will be more convenient to have a month's qualification in the case of an original claim, a claim for a transfer, or a claim for a change, from subdivision to subdivision. It is said that if we have one month's qualification an officer will be able to fill out the same card in each case. I nave had an opportunity of conferring with the Chief Electoral Officer about this  proposal.  I know, of course, that the official claim is that it will simplify the card because in future claims are to be entered on cards. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> pointed out that in the past we have had' three different claim forms, and that when men went to a new electorate they filled out a new claim instead of a request for a transfer, leading to duplications and swollen rolls. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> said that with the card system there will be only one claim, that_ is, for a transfer, or a change, or an original claim. But there are different lines in the claim. When it arrives at the head office it will be compared with the cards in the bureau, and' if there is a card which shows that the claimant is already enrolled, his name will simply be transferred, although he has made an original claim. I point out that if my amendment were adopted, it would only necessitate the use of a larger card containing two extra lines. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> pointed out that that was an objection because the present card is of a convenient size. I believe that unless this "amendment is made a large number of persons will be disfranchised. At present, when a man comes to Australia, he has only to remember that six months' residence will qualify him for enrolment. But if we adopt this proposed new section a new arrival will have to keep in mind two things, first, that before he can be enrolled he must have resided in Australia for six months, and in a subdivision of an electorate for one month.. At present people are altogether too diffident about getting enrolled, and we ought not to put any obstacles in the way. I hope that the Government will be able to see their way to agree to my amend- . ment. I believe that the only objections which can be urged against its acceptance are purely administrative. But surely it ought not to be beyond the capacity of the Electoral Department to find a way to overcome a difficulty of that kind. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no exception to take to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> concluding statement, because this is largely an administrative matter and does not involve any principle. Under ordinary circumstances I should have viewed with some dislike a proposal to require a month's residence. The provISion  has been inserted merely with a view to endeavour to come to a joint system in conjunction with the States. It is for honorable senators to say whether the advantage of bringing about a uniform system of enrolment is worth the little additional obligation thrown upon an elector. The proposed new section involves no matter  of principle. I am unable to develop any enthusiasm one way or the other. On the one side we have the mere requirement that an elector, if he has been in the Commonwealth for six months, shall be entitled to get enrolled, even though he may have been in an electorate for only a day. </para>

                        <para>- No, they are not uniform, but whilst in one State a month's residence might be required, the clause makes provision that in other States the absence of that qualification would not invalidate enrolment. I leave it to the Committee to decide whether they think the advantage of bringing about a uniform scheme of enrolment for State and Commonwealth which . would lead not merely to economy, but to the simplification of electoral provisions in the interests of electors, would not more than counterbalance the possible disadvantage to comparatively a small number of electors. At present a citizen, who wishes to become enrolled must go to one officer and fill in a particular form of enrolment for State purposes, and to another officer and fill in another form for Federal purposes. It is desired to establish a system under which a resident may apply to one official, and fill in one form, to secure enrolment for State and Federal purposes. That would prevent complication and confusion, and would be a very great advantage to the people, whilst but a very small number would be placed at a disadvantage. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will see that the residence qualification is dealt with in that sub-clause also. This proposed new section is proposed with the object of bringing about a uniform system, under which a resident, by applying to one official, and filling in one form, might secure original enrolment, transfer, or change of enrolment, for both State and Commonwealth. The advantage to the States and the Commonwealth of having the one machinery and one set of rolls for both, is obvious. The disadvantage that might arise under this provision would, I venture to think, affect but a very small number of persons, who, having been in Australia for six months, have not been resident for one month in the electoral division in which they seek original enrolment. I ask the Committee to agree to the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that some danger is involved in this clause. As soon as a man's name is placed on a roll, he can vote at once, and if the proposed new section were agreed to, we might have a transfer of a large number of votes from one electorate to another a day or two before an election took place. </para>

                        <para>- I had overlooked that. In that case, my objection would not lie. I had in mind the fact that in connexion with a certain election in Victoria, when certificates were issued by the Victorian Government, 200 or 300 voters were transferred at the last moment from one electorate to another. The contention put forward by the Vice-President of the Executive Council as to the advantage of securing uniformity in State and Commonwealth electoral machinery is a very sound one, and to secure that uniformity the Committee need not hesitate to incommode a few persons. </para>

If my proposal be in the nature of an attack upon any Administration, it was aimed at that which was displaced a few months ago. I gave notice of this motion on the opening day of the present session. I did so in pursuance of my previous action in this Chamber, which met with so complete an indorsement at the hands of honorable senators that it does not seem necessary for me to offer either explanation or apology in asking them to reaffirm their decision. At the present moment we have in this' Chamber a glaring instance of the urgent need which exists for further Ministerial representation. If we had more Ministers here, the Senate would not be confronted with the dearth of work which it not infrequently experiences. More Ministers would' necessarily mean more Bills. </para>

                    <para>. -I shall not detain the Senate at any length in discussing a matter upon which it has on more than one occasion expressed its' opinion freely and fully. When a similar motion was previously before this Chamber, I certainly voiced, in the main, the views to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has given utterance. But I would point out to him that there are one or two practical difficulties in the way of giving effect to his proposal. Very early in its history the Senate was invited to express its view upon this matter. It did so by adopting a resolution similar to that which we are now asked to reaffirm. There the matter rested. Practical considerations prevented the Government from giving expression to the view of the Senate. Apparently those circumstances have not since altered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has stated that measures introduced here should not be limited by Ministerial representation. I regard that suggestion as an affirmation that they are so limited, and upon that question I at once join issue with the honorable senator. I say that the number of Bills introduced into the Senate in no sense depends upon whether the Ministerial representation in this Chamber is large or small. Other considerations determine that. Only a few days ago the honorable senator himself pointed out that the Constitution imposes' certain restrictions in regard to the measures which can be originated in the Senate. Those restrictions play a very important part in determining the Bills which are initiated here. I do not say that measures are not initiated elsewhere which might very appropriately be originated here, and I shall certainly endeavour to see that more of those measure;; are originated here in the future. But by the adoption of this motion, I can scarcely hope to break down what has now become an established practice. Brief as has been my Ministerial experience, I cannot close my eyes to the fact that, as we multiply Federal duties and Federal Departments, it is inevitable that the number pf Ministers', which is at present limited by the Constitution, shall be increased. It seems to me that if we continue to add to the duties of Ministers we must sooner or later add to the number of the Ministerial team. I would also point out that since the establishment of Federation there has been no Government limited to seven Ministers. In every case there has been an addition to that number. I think, too, that I may safely appeal to honorable senators to say whether, even with that addition, there has been an idle man in the Cabinet. I am certain that in the course of time - it may be many years hence, and it may be few - circumstances will force an addition to the number of Ministers'. In that event, the decision of the Senate, in respect of this proposal, will not be lost sight of. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> however, can scarcely hope that the adoption of this motion will cause any disturbance in the Ministerial ranks. </para>

But when the proposal was first submitted, a full-dress debate took place upon it.

I cannot assume that the ratio of intelligence, is opposed to the proportion of votes on this question. I take it that there was equally as likely to be a plethora of wisdom with the majority as with the minority. I am sorry that my honorable friend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> finds that the encumbrances of office cause him to take a some what different view on this occasion. But perhaps I should not say that he takes a different view. I am somewhat puzzled at my honorable friend's attitude. He spoke in opposition to the motion, but he says that he is in agreement with it. Consequently, I do not know- how to answer him. I think I may as well leave the matter to honorable senators, in, the belief that the majority will re-affirm the previous decision of the Senate. </para>

Had I done so, I am sure that it would Have been unanimously . accepted. But I thought - and doubtless my honorable friends will agree with me - that it was desirable that there should be a short statement for the information and guidance of the Government in acting upon it. It is also more respectful and more in keeping with its importance that I should make a few observations embodying the facts and reasons which influence me in submitting the question for the consideration of the Senate. I may first remind honorable senators that twelve years ago, on the 29th April, a very interesting ceremony, and a very touching act of international courtesy took place in what is known as the Consistory Court of the Diocese of London. Under the authority, and in the presence of that Court, which had control over the precious manuscript which was the subject of the ceremony, the original log of the <inline font-style="italic">Mayflower</inline> was handed over by the Bishop of London to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bayard,</inline> then United States Ambassador to Great Britain, in order that it might be safely transmitted to America, and there given into the hands of the Governor of the State of Massachusetts, to be deposited by him in the State archives, or in the library of the Historical Society, and remain there for all time to come. On the occasion of handing over the manuscript, the Bishop of London said : - </para>
                </quote>
                <para>It seems to me to be of the greatest possible importance that a document which relates to a nation's history should as far as possible be in the custody of that nation; and it seems to me anomalous that a document of such importance to the citizens of the United States should remain in even such a dignified resting-place in England as the archives of the Bishop of London. </para>
                    <para class="block">In accepting the manuscript upon those conditions, and referring to the great act of international friendship and good feeling between England - the Mother Country of the United States, as she is the Mother Country of Australia - and the United States, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bayard</inline> said that he spoke -  with the strongest feeling of respect for this transaction, and for the spirit in which it has been conducted, for the amicable tone that should exist, and that has been proven to exist, between the two people of the two great branches of the English-speaking people of the world. I receive and will transmit this document to those who have been designated as its proper custodians. </para>
                    <para>I confess that it was that incident which led me to think that the logs and journals of Captain Cook's, ships, the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Resolution,</inline> should form part of the national archives of Australia, and that an application to the Imperial Government, in whose custody they now are, would pro.bably be received with favour. I was confirmed in that opinion when, some two years ago, whilst in London, I visited that magnificent treasury of historical docu-ments, the Public Record Office, .by the courteous invitation of the Master of the Rolls who is by law the keeper of the. records, and was shown these precious manuscript volumes. I confess - and I am not ashamed to confess - that it was with feelings of reverent emotion that I turned over the original leaves and read the story ; and I thought that mv fellow citizens in Australia should have the same opportunity and the same privilege if it were possible. On that occasion it was rather with bated breath, and with some degree of hesitation, that I ventured the hint that these documents ought to be in Australia. The Master of the Rolls and his very learned and distinguished <inline font-weight="bold">deputy, Sir Henry</inline> Max.wellLyte, thought, I fancy, that my suggestion was rather audacious, and it was hinted that there might be difficulties. My answer was, "These are our title deeds." I also mentioned the precedent relating to the log of the <inline font-style="italic">Mayflower,</inline> which, although connected with the history of the initiation of settlement in the United States, is less part of the title deeds of America than the logs and journals of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Resolution</inline> are our title deeds. I pointed out that we in Australia did not cavil at having documents like these reposing in the very heart of the Empire, like the mighty dead of our race who repose in Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's. But we felt that these were part of the history of a living and growing nation, and that they would more properly be here with us. Since then I have had more than one. courteous and sympathetic communication of the views of the Master of the Rolls and the  Deputy  Keeper of the Records. But I recognise that the object which we have in view is not one the attainment of which should. te in the hands of any private individual. It is a national object. It is worthy of the attention of the national Government. They should undertake it, and they should enjoy all l.he honour of securing the attainment of the object for the people of this country. I think, too, that when the time comes for the handing over of these manuscripts to Australia - and I have no difficulty in believing that the time will soon come, with the assistance of the Government and of the Prime Minister, in whose hands the matter will be efficiently left - it should be an occasion of ceremony and distinction, exhibiting the Mother Country's affection and consideration for Australia, and our equally affectionate gratitude to her. That, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> is the origin and basis of this motion.  1  think it will be agreed by every one that we should lose no chance of gathering in the Australian archives. -The importance of preserving public records is recognised by every civilized nation, and pre-eminently so- by Great Britain. At one time, unfortunately, it was not so. Ministers, for example, used, at no very remote period, to treat official despatches as their private property, and on leaving office, to take away with them manuscripts of great value, really belonging to the nation. The idea of allowing the public access to such private documents of historical interest, never seems to have entered into the minds of the authorities at that time, and is indeed a growth of recent years. In England, all these archives and public records are now most carefully preserved, inventoried, catalogued, and securely housed in that splendid and commodious edifice with which, no doubt, some of ray honorable friends are acquainted - the Public Record Office, in Chancery Lane, London. By Statute, the Master of the Rolls is the Keeper of the Public Records with the extremely able assistance of the gentleman I have mentioned, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Maxwell-Lyte. As an illustration of the treasures that are there, you find, in relation to shipping and navigation, and exploration over-seas, the logbook of every ship in the Royal Navy for the last 200 or 300 years. </para>

                            <para>- No; * he did not name it at all. I shall read that passage from the log. I am unable to enumerate exactly all the original documents connected with -these voyages which are in the Public Record Office. There is a series of them, including, I believe, the ship's log which was written by the first lieutenant. Whatever there is at the Public . Record Office ought to be secured for our archives. I know that there are some in the British Museum, and probably the one to which my honorable friend refers. There were two logs, namely, one written by the chief officer, and another written by Captain Cook from the time he left Cape Pallisser in New Zealand, until he passed Cape York in the month of September. </para>

                            <para>- In connexion with these archives, very much has been done by New South Wales. Some twenty or more years ago, she took up the duty of getting together the archives so far as she could ascertain their existence, and accessibility.  Her  own early records were very defective; and to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes this country is indebted for having, in 1887, when he was Colonial Secretary, authorized <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Bonwick, to supply the want of the lost originals of New South Wales, by making copies in London. New South Wales also took another step, for which I think she is entitled to our gratitude. She acquired the celebrated Brabourne papers, which were discovered in an old house of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Banks, in Soho Square. These very precious documents did not represent the whole of Banks' papers ; but they did contain various original letters from Captain Cook. Then, also, owing to the public spirit and the energy of New South Wales, and the appreciation by her public men of the value of other documents relating to Australia, we have a series of volumes of, I think, supreme historic value, issued by the Government of that State, and accessible to the people of this country at a very moderate cost. In Canada, too, the records are scrupulously kept. In 1872, the -Dominion appointed an Archivist, and founded an Archive Office in Ottawa, corresponding to the Public Record Office in London, as a repository of the public records relating to the history of the Dominion. These, subject to very careful regulations, are accessible to the public, and reports from time to time are issued, so that the public may be placed in possession of authentic information as to the course of their national story. I think it would be an excellent thing if Ave, too, established an Archive Office, under the control of the Commonwealth, as a repository of the archives which are available in connexion with our history. It is said very often that Australia has no history, but that I take leave entirely to deny. We have no history of desolating war perhaps, but you may have, as we have had in this country, moving accidents of flood and field in peaceful pursuits, as well as in the stormy theatre of war. </para>

                            <para>- It is one of. the glories of Australia, I think, that the matters to which my honorable friend evidently alludes have in no way retarded or affected that magnificent progress which is the wonder of the world. The beginning of it, at any rate, was when Captain Cook, on 28th April, 1770, first anchored his ship on the eastern coast of Australia. He entered then what is now called Botany Bay, and which he then named Stingray Bay. It is 'a curious incident that the first to step ashore was his wife's cousin, a boy named Isaac Smith, who was with him  as a midshipman, and who afterwards became an admiral of the British Fleet. When the boat passed from the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> to the shore, Captain Cook said, " Now then Isaac, you go first," and the lad jumped ashore. So that, although Captain Cook himself was not the first to go ashore, it was a connexion of his family who did. From Botany Bay, after many perils and adventures ; after, as his own report from Batavia says, " the most dangerous navigation that perhaps ever ship was in," he was off Cape York on 22nd August, 17.70. They then ran up the Union Jack, and took formal possession, in the name of George III., of the whole east coast, with all the bays, harbors, rivers, and islands situated upon it. The entry in what is called the official .log is as follows - </para>

                    <para class="block">The island on which this ceremony took place was named Possession Island, a name which it bears, I believe, to this day. It must be remembered that Captain Cook was not the first Englishman to visit Australia. That honour belongs to William Dampier, who made his first visit to the western coast of Australia in 1689, and revisited that part in 1699. It is a subject, perhaps, of interesting speculation as to what might have happened had Dampier, in the <inline font-style="italic">Roebuck,</inline> which gave its name to Roebuck Bay, in Western Australia, returned by the Strait of Magellan instead of by the Cape of Good Hope. It may be that he would have had the honour of discovering and taking possession of the eastern shore of Australia nearly 100 year's before Captain Cook was there. But although Captain Cook was not the first Englishman who visited Australia., it must be remembered that the inclusion of Australia as an integral part of the British Dominions took place when Captain Cook unfurled the Union Jack and took possession in the King's name. " It was only," as has been said, "a bit of bunting," but it was the symbol of the ownership and sovereignty which have endured to this day, and which, please God, will endure so long as we have health and strength and life to hold the country which Captain Cook gave us. The original record of that great fact, the beginning of our history, is, I think, worth having. That particular part of it is our own. It is our title, and upon that rests, I think, we may say all the subsequent Proclamations, Orders in Council, and the Parliaments and legislation . for the organization of the good government and the peace, order, and prosperity of this country. All those things are subsequent to and rest upon that act of Captain Cook, and that claim made by him in the year 1770. I believe that I am correct in saying that Sydney now possesses Captain Cook's Bible, which he read every. Sunday morning to his crew, the gold medal which was struck in his honour, and other relics. And we may well ask ourselves what are they in value to this young nation in comparison to the logs and journals which are now in the Old Country. Of course, in ' the case of despatches copies are as useful as the originals, but it is quite otherwise in the case of these logs. The originals we should possess as they are a part of the title to the country which is ours. I think that we should also have the log of the <inline font-style="italic">Resolution,</inline> on his third voyage in which we read the tragic story of Captain Cook's death at Owhyhee on the 14th February, 1779. I am sure that our request, so far as these original documents are available, would be favorably considered. We may fairly say that Captain Cook is ours. He is to us what the Pilgrim Fathers were to New England, what Champlain is to Canada, and very much what Clive is to the British Empire in India; he is the founder and the hero of the annexation, if I may call it so, of Australia to the British Crown.  His   personality, too, was of a character which we might well cherish.  His  life and death are part of our history. I am sure he is regarded throughout Australia as a national hero. He is a founder worthy of our reverence and our pride. He rose from the people.  His  own words prefixed to his log are a very touching reference to himself. References to himself were very infrequent, because he was of all men probably the most modest. In the preface to his log these concluding words are to be found- </para>

He served his country in scientific navigation, and in the cause of humanity. He discovered the means of preserving the sailor from the terrible scourge of scurvy. For that he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Society in the year 1776. By a rival navigator, La Perouse, he was described as " Cook, the Incomparable Navigator." Admiral Lord Colville, with whom he had served as the master of one of the King's ships, wrote, in 1762, of what he called his "genius and capacity," and spoke of him as "an officer qualified for great undertakings." That was eight years before he made acquaintance with the eastern coast of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hugh</inline> Pallisser wrote on the fly-sheet of the log, which had been given to him, these observations, which honorable members will probably be interested to hear - </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe it to be a well-known fact that, for the most part, the scientific results of Captain Cook's researches and his charts have retained to this very day their accuracy, and that, as regards many portions of the seas which he surveyed, the soundings have not been altered since his time. That is really one of the most wonderful tributes which could be paid to his unrivalled capacity as a seaman, to his scientific knowledge as a navigator, and to the extraordinary care he bestowed on all he undertook. This, I think, is all I need say in support of the motion. We in the- Senate are Australians sent here, with our comrades in the other House, to represent this united country. We are inspired with the hope that we may be able to do something to establish this young nation, and build it up in strength and self-reliance worthy of the noble Empire of which it forms a part. This island continent is ours, and nothing that serves to disclose the dawn of our ownership, and to make clear our moral right to it, can be of indifference to us. It is well to fortify our possession, just as it is well for an individual to fortify his possession by being able, at call, to produce his title deeds. I submit the motion with this short statement, leaving it entirely to the Prime Minister and the Government to take such steps as, with the assistance of the Imperial Government, will secure these documents and title deeds of ours from the Public Record Office, the British Museum, or whatever other place they may be deposited in, so that they may remain for all time in the custody of. Australia. I hope that the motion will be accepted with unanimity, and at once. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. He is now continuing the records, and has arrived at the intensely interesting 'point in General Macquarie's reign, when a struggling Colony, represented by a strip of land extending 80 miles along the coast and 40 miles inland, a Colony unable even to raise food for its own use, suddenly blossomed out, by reason of the passage of the mountains, into the great State it has since become. I make these remarks only in passing. I suggest for the consideration of the Ministry that the earlier records of Australian discoveries should have a place in the archives of the Commonwealth. That is cine of the directions in which I should like the motion to have gone. For instance, there are to be found in the Public Library at Sydney <inline font-style="italic">fac similes</inline> of charts published in London between 1530 and 1540, in the reign of Henry  VIII.  There are two maps of Jean  Roze,  and of the old cartographer, Des.celiers. There is also the " Dauphin " map, prepared for the instruction of the Prince who afterwards became Henry II. of France. I have spent a good deal of time in looking over these records, and I have been able to identify in these earlier maps, published between 1530 and 1540, a considerable number of the places that are to be found on. an ordinary map of Australia published to-day. To show how long ago Australia was' regarded with interest by the Mother Country, there is a medal of which it would be most appropriate for the Commonwealth to possess an example. It was struck by the Silversmiths' Company of London, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to commemorate the circumnavigation of the globe by that immensely great Englishman, Francis Drake ; a medal which shows the northern portion of Australia - Cape York, the Gulf of Carpentaria, and all the rest of it. I' have not one of these medals, but fortunately I have a pictorial copy of them which serves to show how many years ago Australia was known to Englishmen. I think that some of these records ought also to find a place in the archives of the Commonwealth. These ancient maps show conclusively that about the time that 'Columbus discovered the islands of the Spanish Main, Spanish navigators were investigating the east coast of </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia, whilst Portuguese navigators had made a. very complete survey of its western coast. The next stage, of course, relates to the Dutch discoveries and chartings, all of which lead up to the coming of the one time semi-buccaneer, Dampier, to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> made such eloquent reference, and who, as one of England's great navigators, has not received proper recognition in his own country. If one visits Western Australia one will hear plenty of talk in reference to the exploits of " Bill" Dampier, but none regarding those of James Cook, whereas in the eastern portion of Australia the position is entirely reversed. I have had the pleasure of sailing over the same seas and, with the help of Dampier's journals and the ship's charts, have traced Dampier's course along the western coast, and of seeing the ship on which I was a passenger drop anchor in almost the identical spot at which the anchor of the <inline font-style="italic">Roebuck,</inline> when navigated by Dampier, was dropped. I know, too, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has been over the same spot. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> spoke most accurately when he described the logs and records of Captain Cook as the groundwork of England's title to Australia. Unquestionably that is a fact just as it is a. fact that the ponderous parchment deeds of to-day may be traced back to scraps of paper of the size of one's hand. I know that the title to a most important property near Sydney is represented by a huge pile of parchment deeds which had their origin in a piece of paper of less size than an ordinary sheet of note paper, upon which was recorded the sale of a piece of the land for a few bushels of wheat. That being the case, surely the title of England to the freehold of Australia may be appropriately traced to the official records of its discoverer, and to the possession of it which was taken by him in the name of the Old Country, which has extended its influence, its power, and its . beneficent management of public affairs to all parts of the world, and not in the least effective fashion in the southern seas. </para>

The only fault that I have to find with it is that it is not sufficiently comprehensive. I should like it to embrace all ancient manuscripts relating to the records of the maritime, explorers of Australia. The early history of our country shows that there are many documents in the possession of foreign countries which will be of great historical value to us in time to come, hut 1 do not know that they possess any special value from the stand-point of establishing our title to the country. Australia, belongs to us, and I do not think that any European nation is likely to dispute its possession with us. </para>

I repeat that many valuable documents relating to the early exploration of Australia are to be found in Spain, Holland, and France, and, in my judgment, it would be wise to extend the scope of this motion so as to embrace them. In its present form the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is too modest. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator is a good Australian, and I am prepared to support his proposal. If he cannot see his way to enlarge its scope, I hope that the Government will apply to foreign countries for any documents which may be in their possession, and which may bc of historical value to us. Now that we have made a start in collecting records of Australian interest, I think it would be a wise policy to appoint a Committee, whose duty it should be to apply to foreign countries for any documents which may be in their possession relating to the early exploration of our country - documents of which we may have little or no knowledge. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has already observed, the amount of knowledge of the doings of the English explorer- Dampier which is possessed by the people of Western Australia is remarkable. Yet that navigator is seldom referred to in the eastern States. In Sydney one will hear all about the doings of Captain Cook, but little of those of Dampier. These facts evidence that our people are not as well informed upon the early history of Australia as they ought to be, and emphasize the desirableness of enlarging the scope of this motion. </para>

                            <para>. - I am sure that the Senate will re-  gard this proposal with warm approval. ! do not desire to discuss it, because I am satisfied that honorable senators generally will hail it as a move in the right direction. My purpose in rising is to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to consent to an amendment of his proposal. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, I do not think that it goes far enough. If we adopt it in its present form, we shall be tied down in our search to certain journals which are alleged to be located in a repository in London. I have very grave doubts as to whether the documents stored in the Record Office, London, can be regarded as the original logs of the ships specified in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon'</inline> s motion. I believe that those logs are to be found elsewhere. The documents stored in .the Record Office, London, are, I think, the journals of officers of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Resolution,</inline> and are largely copies of the original logs. That is shown by curious mistakes which occur in the spelling of names. Whilst I would regard even those documents as valuable additions to our historical records, it is more desirable that we should obtain their originals. So far as I can gather from the useful publication of Wharton, the Admiralty authorities of the time of which I speak imposed upon explorers the obligation of keeping ships' logs in triplicate. Captain Cook complied with that obligation. One of the journals which he kept is in the hands of the Admiralty authorities, another passed to  Her  Majesty, so that where that is I cannot say. </para>

I suggest that after the word "London" the words "or elsewhere" be inserted. My honorable friend will doubtless see his way to agree to that amendment. .The appearance of this proposal upon the business-paper has made me a little industrious, and as a result, I communicated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick,</inline> who can speak with so much authority upon this matter, and he has forwarded to me - in addition to other notes - a supplementary letter, which reads - </para>

                            <para>To the notes handed you yesterday on the sailors' logs of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour,</inline> I venture to add a suggestion, viz., that before application is made for them (all in print as far as they relate to Australia) we should await the result of an application made to the Record Office about six weeks ago, bv the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, through the Colonial Office, for a set of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Gazette,</inline> also at the Record Office. There may be some chance of getting this, as there is a second set at the British Museum a few streets oil - only ten  minutes  distance, or less than that. </para>
                            <para>There are a number of documents of the Dampier period at the Record Office, probably of more importance than the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> sailor logs, upon which Admiral Wharton (late of the Admiralty) set little value. </para>

We are only beginning to see the importance of these manuscript treasures, and we can easily judge to how great an extent they will appeal to those who will come after us. Every year will add to the value of the documents, as every year will add to the difficulty of obtaining them. </para>

                        <para class="block">Executive Council in not speaking at length, but at the same time I would point out that this is rather a difficult motion to amend. Not only are the records of explorers and discoverers to be found in offices in London, and elsewhere in Great Britain, but they are also to be found in many of the continental countries in Europe. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has been, since the inception of this Parliament - as I also have had the honour and pleasure of being - a member of the Library Committee. A great deal of work has been done by that Committee in endeavouring to collate information relative to the discovery of Australia, and its early history. Difficulties have, however, presented themselves to the Committee from time to time. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is aware of one difficulty, which is that of finding out the 'best way to act in reference to the acquisition of documents of this kind. The members of the Committee about twelve months ago made representations, through the Prime Minister of the day, to the Home authorities, as to the desirableness of obtaining for our National Library many of the original records existing in '.London, which are of very little use and value to persons living there, but which will be a source of great interest and a means of profitable study to our own students and scientists, in the years to come. With regard to the logs and journals, as to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> asks that we should prefer a request to the authorities at the Public Record Office, my honorable friend has had an opportunity of seeing the originals; we can safely trust to his discrimination and judgment as to whether they are or are not. the documents which we desire to obtain for our National Library. If the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> be adopted, I would point out that it would refer simply to the logs of Captain Cook's ships, the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Resolution,</inline> deposited, at the Public Record Office or elsewhere. But there may be at the Public Record Office logs and journals concerning the voyages of other navigators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has contended that the ambit of the motion is not sufficiently wide, and that if we obtained the original records of Dampier's voyages and of those of other navigators, we should be in possession of records relating to the discovery of the whole of Australia, rather than of a portion of it. We should, I think, endeavour to obtain the records of French navigators, such as La Perouse and his successors. We should obtain records of the voyage of D'Entrecasteaux and. Labillardiere, who were sent out in search of La Perouse; as well as the original records of Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese, and of other French navigators. The motion is not sufficiently wide to cover those cases. But I need only point to the map of Tasmania to show the importance of obtaining, other logs than those of Captain Cook. Many of the geographical names of capes, bays, and islands in Tasmania are French. I mav refer, for instance, to the River Huon, to Bruni Island, to Freycinet Peninsula, to D'Entrecasteaux Channel, Recherche Bay, and other features of Tasmanian geography in proof of what I say. Therefore, if we desire to obtain a comprehensive library, enshrining the original records of discoveries in all parts of Australia, we have not merely to go to London and endeavour to obtain the logs and journals of 'Captain Cook, but to continental countries for the purpose of obtaining, if possible,, original documents relating to other explorers. It is, of course, quite right that we should endeavour to obtain the original logs of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Resolution.</inline> I am inclined to think that if a request for them were made by the Commonwealth Government, backed up, as it will be, by a resolution of this House of the Legislature, the British authorities could hardly disregard such a respectful application. If we could obtain those documents, <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> would be a first step in the right direction. I am well aware that the honorable senator who has submitted the motion has, as a member of the Library Committee, taken a very active interest in endeavouring to obtain for the National Library works of the character referred to. He will agree with me, from what he knows, that we shall be far more likely to succeed when we submit requests for original documents, if the application were made on the initiative of a branch of the Commonwealth Legislature. </para>

                                <para>- I am not in a position to say definitely, but I believe that the Home authorities did not seem to be imbued with the feeling that the Australian 'Commonwealth would exactly appreciate the documents at their proper value. Some time ago we were favoured with a visit from two representatives of the Colonial Office, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Lucas and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pearson.</inline> I, with other members of the Library Committee, individually and collectively, had the honour of approaching those gentlemen, unofficially, of course, with regard to the matter. We expressed a desire to obtain from the archives in London all documents relating to the foundation of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Lucas and his colleague showed themselves to be personally interested, and, personally, seemed well disposed towards such a request. But they seemed to be of opinion that the Home authorities feared that if they complied with a request from Australia they could hardly refuse to entertain a similar one from 'Canada. Quite recently, on the occasion of the tercentenary of Champlain, one of the very earliest of Canadian pioneers, the Canadian people would have liked to obtain original documents stored in the Public Record Office and elsewhere with regard to the British occupation of Canada, The British authorities, however, had reluctantly to refuse to give up such documents as they had in their custody. Notwithstanding that fact, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Lucas and his colleague, if I interpreted their attitude correctly, were personally disposed to recommend favorable consideration of our wishes in this respect, but thought that we should be more likely to meet with success if a strong request were made from Australia - one carrying even greater weight than that made by the Government of the day at the instance of the Library Committee. A resolution of this Senate would be indicative of the strongly expressed wish of the Australian people, and for that reason I have very much pleasure in supporting the motion. </para>

He has told us how much they are valued in England. I am personally aware that all he said is true. We have to remember that Great Britain is the Home of our race; and I think it is natural that she desires to keep under her own care, not only the documents relating to the early history of Australia, but those which pertain also to 'Canada, South Africa, India, and other parts of the Empire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has referred to the visit to Australia of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Lucas. He said, with some hesitation, that in his opinion these gentlemen were favorable. I would not have introduced their names into the debate had he not first mentioned them. I am in a position to affirm most positively that their feeling was that the Home authorities would not like to part with the documents. </para>

It should also be remembered that we are dealing with the Home Government, which has tried on every opportunity to gratify Australian sentiment. There is nothing that we can ask for and can reasonably use which they will decline to grant. "We should approach this subject with a little moderation.

                                <para>- lt must be remembered that these logs and various documents refer not only to Australia, but to the whole of the Pacific. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said, that Captain Cook traversed great regions throughout the Southern Hemisphere. It is not as if Captain Cook was merely the discoverer of the East Coast of Australia. He was  a  navigator over huge areas, and the Home Government could not separate the documents - could not send to us the parts referring to Australia only without also sending the parts relating to vaster regions outside Australia. Therefore, I feel more than hesitation in supporting the motion as it is worded. I think that we should ask the opinion of the Home Government. We might ask them what they can do to gratify our laudable desire in the matter. I noticed that all the speakers this afternoon, except <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> seemed to assume that these documents belong to us. I deprecate the expression of opinion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that they in any way constitute title deeds. . 1 venture to say that if they were given to us and lost with the ship conveying them to Australia- </para>

                            <para>. - The motion has certainly been the means of provoking an historical discussion which must be of interest not only to ourselves, but to the public of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> desires to obtain the originals of everything done outside ourselves in pointing out to the world what Australia is, and how it has become what it is. I do not suppose that there is a single senator or intelligent member of the public who will not clearly appreciate what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has expressed. But the more the discussion has extended, the more convinced have I become of the ineffectiveness of a motion of this kind. The subject as outlined by my honorable friend's speech is a very wide one. How much of these important historical records we are entitled to ask for, and how much of these documents which may be ' historical records are genuine and of use to us, is a subject on which neither the mover of the motion nor the Senate is competent to give an authoritative opinion to us, or, perhaps, to others. I believe it is almost an axiom that about the least effective instrument on earth is an abstract Parliamentary motion. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will agree with me that his motion is, to a very large extent, fraught with deep historical interest. But in my opinion the object may be best achieved by the Government appointing an historian or geographer, capable of analyzing the documents, finding out what it is that we want, and recommending to us, as the </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">National Parliament, what we should seek to obtain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is aware that the Record Office of every nation contains a huge mass of forgeries and of misleading documents, which many of us know are not worthy of the term " historical." By his motion my honorable friend has opened out a vast field of geographical and historical research. Does he mean that we are to approach the Home Office, and other offices too, with a bald proposal to take oyer, if they wish to give it to us, an undigested mass of material which, for historical or social reasons, may be absolutely worthless, or, worse than that - absolutely deluding to succeeding historians? This line of thought has been suggested to me by his own elaborate speech, which showed how vast and wide this field of investigation is. We all admit its value and its interest to us, but the more its value and interest are shown to us, the more necessary it becomes that the exploration of this field of research shall be made under the guidance and advice of a competent man. I have no wish to resist the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has in view, but I feel that his motion, if carried either in its original form or in an enlarged form, will fail to achieve the purpose which Australians, . and probably the Colonial Office, desire, and that is to seek historical documents which will be of real use to us, and of value to our historians, and probably to succeeding legislators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has shown, perhaps, for the second time, how important, from the historical and social point of view, the possession or the investigation of these records is to us as a great, and, possibly, important, nation. But that work is so important in itself, and should be of such vast use to us and to historians, that it ought to be begun systematically and thoroughly, under the guidance and advice of a competent man, acting under the authority of this Parliament. I feel that if the subject is not approached in that way, it ought not to be approached at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> speech has made that aspect of the question to me clearer and stronger. He has shown the importance, the necessity, and usefulness of this kind of work. It ought to be undertaken, I repeat, by a specialist, whose advice and direction on that important point we should first take.  His  advice, and the reasons for it, should be submitted to the Parliament, and then, having obtained an authoritative opinion from a competent authority, the Parliament could ask, not only the Mother </para>
                        <para>Country, but other nations, which have done work in. connexion with Australia, for certain records. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will fail in the very object which he desires to attain, unless he seeks to achieve it in the way I suggest; and that is through the medium of a competent authority. I shall welcome, as the result of this debate, the appearance of an item on the Estimates as soon as possible, to enable a competent scientific, historical, or geographic authority to begin this work immediately, and to continue it. </para>

However, I do not intend to oppose the motion. If the Parliament is voting money for a competent research, I take it that the motion is intended as a more or less gratuitous hint to the Government that they are not asking Parliament to vote sufficient, or that the persons who are intrusted with the investigation and research, are not doing the work properly. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will express himself clearly on that point. If the Government are providing money for an investigation, and it is going on properly, I feel that by that investigation and this debate, we may attain, our object in a far better way than by the carrying of this motion. </para>

                            <para>.- We are all, I am sure, obliged to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> for bringing this matter forward. The honorable senator has opened up a very much wider field than his motion at first glance appeared to do. I rise to emphasize <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger's statement that if this work is to be gone about at all, it must be placed in charge of some competent authority. When in Canada, on two occasions, I visited the Dominion Parliament House, where I found that a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> Fraser occupied an office under the title of Archivist. He had filled the position for a number of years, and in addition to some duties about the Parliament House, his business was to look after the archives, to search out all records, and see that they were genuine.  His  work has resulted in the collection of an enormous mass of literature and historical records of the early days of Ontario. I am glad to be able to say that one of our Federal 'Governments have done something in this direction by securing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick's</inline> collection, which is a very valuable one, of early records of Australia. It has been said that the Imperial Government might be unwilling to let us have the early records referred to in the honorable senator's motion; but I do not think that that will be found to be the case. When we occupy our own house, as we probably shall in three or four years' time - and we should be making preparations for the purpose now - I think we shall find that the Home authorities will be willing to give us anything of this kind for which we ask as a people. We already have proof _ of their willingness to do so in the original Queen's Commission giving the Royal assent to the Commonwealth Constitution, the table on which it was signed, and other mementoes of the inauguration of the Commonwealth, which are exhibited in the Queen's Hall. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger that this business should be gone about in a proper and systematic way. Visitors to the Old Country will know that, for instance, at Burns' cottage, there are a number of forgeries of the poet's letters, and the very greatest care should be taken in these investigations. I may mention that the Canadian Archivist, to whom I have referred, was asked last year or the year before, to spend his holidays in Europe, and his leave was extended for three months. During that time he visited a number of the European capitals, looked through the records he found there, and was able to bring back to Canada a number of records of interest concerning the State of Ontario. I am very glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has given us this breath of the past and turned our minds into a new channel I feel that the honorable senator is building better than he knows, and by his motion is laying the foundation for the compilation of a mass of records of our early history. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not wish to add very much" to what has already been said ; but I should  like to express my sympathy with the motion and my entire agreement with the suggestion that in embarking upon this field of exploration care should be taken to give us some assurance that the records we secure shall be originals. If we required merely copies of such records, we could .get them to-morrow. Many of them are to be purchased for a few shillings at any bookseller's. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> does not desire that we should get forged copies of these records, in which the handwriting of the originals is imitated. I rose particularly to refer to some remarks which h:ive been made in connexion with the work of Dutch and French navigators. Honorable senators will recognise that in approaching the Imperial authorities for these original records we should be very much in the position of a son who goes to his father and says : " I have now a house of my own, and I ask you to give me my birth certificate and other family records particularly concerning myself, that I may have them in my keeping." We should not be in the same position in asking the French or Dutch authorities for records in their possession. We can approach the Imperial authorities as members of the Imperial family, in asking for these historical documents which specially concern the part of the Empire we occupy. I think it would be a matter for regret if any attempt were made to include in the motion a proposal to go further afield. We could hardly say to the people of a foreign nation : " We are in possession of Australia, and we want the early records of your nation which have any bearing upon the history of the country which we now occupy." </para>

I think I should emphasize the fact that the Library Committee, of which I have the honour to be a member, has not by any means neglected this particular matter. They  interviewed  the representatives of the Colonial Office who recently visited Australia, and have done  what  it  Was  possible for them to do in this direction. It remains now, since I hope a similar motion will be carried in another place, for this Parliament to strengthen the hands of the Library Committee, so that in any further application they may make to the Imperial authorities it will be clear that they have the Federal Parliament at their back. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will see his way to accept the amendment suggested by Senator Millen. That would widen the field of exploration and increase the opportunities afforded to secure the documents for which Ave are seeking. The motion has my warmest  sympathy, and I hope it  will  be carried  without  a division </para>

                            SYMON (South Australia) [5.35]. - May I be permitted to say that the motion has been accepted and dealt with in the Senate in the way which  might have been expected from any assemblage of Australians interested in their country, in the sources of its geographical, as well as its political, existence, and anxious to secure possession of  what  I may call the evidence, at least, of how we came by it. I have A'ery great pleasure in accepting the amendment proposed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, because, as the honorable senator pointed out, there may be some uncertainty with regard to the exact custody of the original documents, which we affirm it is desirable should be in the possession of this country, as having, with all deference to any other view, I think, the best right to them. Some honorable senators in discussing the motion in a way which has thrown great light upon a very large field which might be opened up in this connexion, have, if they will allow me to say so, to some extent overlooked its terms. I think that was notably so in the case of my friend,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline>
                            The motion is couched in terms which, it must be admitted, are by no means dictatorial. It is courteous in every way. It does not express even a request on the part of the Senate or of this Parliament. All it does is to affirm what I think every man who is an Australian citizen., whether by birth or Otherwise, should be ready tc affirm, that it is desirable that we should have the originals of these logs and journals. It is desirable that we should have them, and that the Government, who are far more competent for the purpose than any historiographer, such as suggested by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline>
                            Ledger, should bring the matter tinder the notice of the Imperial authorities. I was greatly struck by what
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                            said in this connexion. I believe that we  have a right to expect a favorable answer to our request, for family reasons, as the honorable senator suggested, if for no other reasons. If we cannot secure the originals of these documents, we shall then have to consider whether we ought to be satisfied with copies ; although copies are of no use to us for the purpose for which we desire to secure the custody of these records. We should look upon the request as addressed, not to an alien nation, but to our Mother Country. And the applicant may be described in Rudyard Kipling's words -

                                <para>- He may even borrow money from the old man, and in time of difficulty be willing to leave his title deeds under the old roof ; yet the time may still come when he will say I should like to possess my deeds myself. In such a case, unless the parents were of a very cantankerous disposition, they would probably hand over the deeds. I think that the log and journals of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour,</inline> recording the hoisting of the Union Jack, and the taking possession of the whole of the eastern part of Australia in the name of King George, for the British Crown, may be regarded as chronicling the start of our history, of our ownership. It is in that light that I regard these original documents as our title deeds. It would probably be of no service to us to flaunt them in the face of a foreign nation that came here in order to dispossess us; but they give us some consciousness of having a moral right and, indeed, a legal right to the country, because, although effective occupation is essential to holding our own, still, when we run up our flag, we declare that we are in possession. It is an evidence of our right to effectively occupy. That is my answer to Senators Pulsford and McColl, whose observations in respect to enlarging the scope of the proposed investigation were most pertinent and interesting. But I do not wish to enlarge the scope of my proposals. I take the view which was so well expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> that we ought to do one thing at a time. Let us first get the documents which form the title to our estate. The fewer we specify the more likely are we to concentrate attention upon them, and the greater will be our claim to them. 1 listened with great interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's observations in regard to early Australian maritime records. It is true that many of the old navigators of Australia were foreign navigators, but they are nevertheless heroes of Australian history. Such men as Torres, Bass, and Van Diemen- </para>

                                <para>- Yes ; and particularly - of Kangaroo Island, where the names of a number of capes and places- remain French to this day. Possibly, an application for historical records of value to us would be received with favour by France; but I doubt it. When we ask that country to supply us with documents which constitute our title deeds to Australia, its Government may say " We decline to give you those documents, because one day they may be our title deeds to Australia.'.' They may regard us as interlopers. At the same time I feel sure that the Government will not lose sight of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said in this connexion. I happen to be a member of the Library Committee  - that is why I did not mention the matter previously - but I wish to say that that body is rendering the greatest possible service to Australia in collecting valuable documents relating to its early history. From the very establishment of the Federation special attention has been devoted to this work, and, as honorable senators are aware, a most valuable addition was recently made to our archives in the shape of the Petherick collection. I was very glad to hear the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick,</inline> which was read by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. The interest which that gentleman takes in this matter is evidenced by the collection which he himself made, and which has now passed over to the Commonwealth. At the same time I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger that we ought to create a new Department. My honorable friend would make an excellent historiographer royal himself. But I do not think that we are quite ripe for the appointment of a royal historian, and I feel sure that the interests of the 'Commonwealth in that regard are perfectly safe in the hands of the Library Committee and of the Government. My sole object in submitting this motion was to strengthen the hands of the Government in preferring the request which it suggests, and, by identifying the documents which we desire, to pave" the way for a favorable reception of that request. My hope and belief is that before long the Commonwealth will be in possession of the title deeds to our country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has just mentioned to me that there are  199  volumes of Australian exploration in the University at Caen, Normandy, amongst which are some of the journals of Captain Flinders. We all know that Flinders was treated with great harshness by Napoleon Bonaparte, who had him imprisoned in Mauritius for a long time, and despoiled of his journals and charts, owing to the jealousy engendered by his navigation of these waters and his interference with attempted French settlement here. I am glad that we all take a patriotic view of this matter, and that we are about to take a step towards securing evidence of our right to be here. </para>

                <para class="block">My task on this occasion will be a very brief one, because the amendments of the law which I seek are of a very limited character. At the same time the scope of those amendments is larger than their phraseology indicates. I wish to point out that there is a very considerable difference between the Old-Age Pensions Act, which was previously operative in New South Wales, and the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act of the Commonwealth, in respect of a matter of great importance - that of thrift. I regret that the latter Act is absolutely opposed to the encouragement of thrift. It penalizes those who have been thrifty by reducing their pensions if they are possessed of any accumulated property. I hold in my hand a letter from the Commonwealth Old-Age Pensions Office, Sydney, which shows how paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> - which I desire to amend by substituting the word " fifteen " for " ten " - operate. The letter has reference to an aged lady, of eighty-nine years, who, under the New South Wales law, formerly received a pension of  .£10  a year. But because she has a small income which is derived from a lodger - the house seems to be managed by her daughter, who is sixty-five years of age - her pension has been reduced to <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per annum. The letter from the Deputy Commissioner reads - </para>

                        <para>- Under the New South Wales law a pensioner was permitted to ha.ve accumulated property of the net value of £390. But under the Commonwealth law the net value of a claimant's . accumulated property must not exceed £100. In other words, the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act aims a distinctive blow at thrift. It discourages people from making provision for their old age, because if they become possessed of a small property in the shape of bricks and mortar which may return them practically nothing, although it may provide them with a shelter for their heads, they are ineligible to receive a pension. There is this important factor to be considered. A pensioner receiving 10s. per week is allowed to earn 10s. per week, if he can. But if he has an income of 10s. per week from property, Heaven help him ! He will get nothing worth speaking of by way of pension. I know the argument which can be used, that such a pensioner will leave property behind him. But that property will be of advantage to some one in the community, and, therefore, to the community itself. We ought not, in my opinion, to attach too much importance to the possession of a little property, while we allow full scope for earning up to 10s. per week. The amendments in the Act sought to be effected by my Bill are certainly technical. Therefore, they are not, perhaps, on the face of them, of a character to appeal directly to honorable senators, or to leave much scope for debate. But the reason for the Bill arises from a desire on my part to retain to the pensioners of New South Wales that which has been theirs hitherto, and to extend the same benefits to the thrifty poor throughout the Commonwealth. It is one of the charges against old-age pensions - the only charge I have heard against the system - that they tlo not encourage thrift, but induce careless ness. The , Commonwealth Act- certainly strikes a greater blow at thrift than did the New South Wales Act. Personally I do not place thrift upon the apex of all the virtues. A man may starve his wife and children to provide for his old age. Thrift in almost any form may run to the vice of penuriousness. It is always possible to have an extreme of thrift. I do not worship thrift to any unreasonable extent, but I do think that it is opposed to public interest that the Commonwealth Act should positively discourage thrift, as it does, in comparison with the Act which was in operation for nine years in New South Wales. It may be said that this Bill ought not to have been introduced by me, because it involves the expenditure of money. But I would draw attention to section 53 of the principal Act, which distinctly provides that no moneys can be paid under it except they are appropriated by Parliament. Therefore, this cannot be alleged to be a money Bill. It is not a measure that requires to be covered by a message from the Crown. Consequently it is not a Bill that involves the expenditure of money in the slightest degree. It is a machinery Bill. It no more involves the expenditure of money than did the Post and Telegraph Bill, which was introduced in the Senate, and indirectly involved the expenditure of enormous sums, but which, nevertheless, was merely a machinery measure. It provided the machinery for the expenditure of money, but did not appropriate the money. Neither does this Bill of mme. </para>

                        <para>. -I  take the opportunity of saying a few words, as my name has been mentioned as that of the only member of the Opposition present. I am very glad indeed that the Bill has not been brought forward by a member of the Opposition, because, if that had been the case, it would have been- said to-morrow that we had introduced the subject for advertising purposes, or for " stone- walling. " But, as the measure has emanated from a Ministerial supporter. I have no doubt that the intention is quite correct. My principal reason for rising is, however, to refer to a South Australian case which  1  mentioned to the Vice-President of the Executive Council yesterday. I shall for the present withhold the name of the person affected. I have known him for a number of years. He is nearly seventy years of age. He applied for an old-age pension. After waiting several months, he was told that he could get a pension of 3s.  4½d.  per week. He informed me that he had written frequently to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardiner,</inline> who is in charge of the old-age pensions work in South Australia, asking why the amount fixed by Parliament had been so reduced ; but no notice was taken- of his communication. Therefore it fell to my lot on Tuesday last, before I left Adelaide, to interview <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardiner</inline> on the subject. He admitted in his return that last year he had earned £30 and had a daughter  who owned a property. She was kind to her father ; she did not turn him- out of her home, but allowed him to remain and kept him. For that reason £13 was deducted from his pension. If he had paid  5s.  a week for the accommodation he would have been entitled to that amount. But, because the accommodation was provided by his kind daughter, its value was accounted to him as income. His income was put down at £30 from personal exertion in the previous year, and at£13, being the value of the accommodation provided by his daughter, so <inline font-style="italic">£9</inline> per annum was all that he could possibly be allowed as a pension. This is the statement of the Deputy Commissioner. If the leader of the Senate wishes I can reveal the name. If it is said that the intention of this Parliament when it passed the law, is being carried out, I shall be very much astonished. </para>

What I want to know is whether the treatment of this old man is according to the law or the regulations thereunder. Is it a fair thing, I ask honorable senators, that an old man should be deprived of a pension of 5s. a week simply on the ground that he has been furnished with accommodation of that value by his own daughter ? Suppose, for instance, that one of my daughters said to me, " Father, come and stay with us and share our last crust," would it be a fair thing to deprive me of the sum of 5s. a -week ? </para>

                        <para>. - This is a measure which I think should commend itself to the Senate. The objection may be raised that it will increase the cost of the representation of Australia in London, but I do not hold that view. There may be some extra expense on the part of the Commonwealth, but that will be more than compensated for by the large saving which will be made by having a responsible head to look after </para>

                    <para class="block">Australian finance and commercial matters. When one recalls the statements which were made to the people when it was proposed to establish the Commonwealth, one can only marvel at the length of time which has elapsed before this measure has been brought forward. I can recall eloquent speeches made by various gentlemen who paraded Queensland on behalf of Federation. I well remember the people being told that the time was not far distant when Australia, instead of speaking with six voices in London, would speak through one individual. I suppose that nearly every member of this Parliament has had that ideal before his. mind ever since Federation was accomplished. But it is only at this late moment that we are getting a close grip of the question. The Government have very wisely refrained from suggesting who should be High Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is time that the Government did bring down a Bill to provide the machinery for the office of High Commissioner so as to enable an appointment to be made as early as possible. There are a hundred and one reasons why Australia should have a representative in London. The transfer to the Commonwealth of the debts of the States is a matter which must be settled before very long, and in connexion with that matter we shall require the services of a man of financial ability as High Commissioner in London. It seems to me that matters of finance will be amongst the most important with which the High Commissioner will have to deal. It would be like putting the cart before the horse to take over the debts of the States before appointing a High Commissioner. There are now before Parliament certain very important naval and military proposals, which will involve the expenditure of very large sums of money in the course of a very few years, and in connexion with that matter also we shall require the. services of an able representative in London. </para>

                        <para>.- It is quite certain that at some time or another the Commonwealth must have a High Commissioner in London. Whether the psychological moment for his appointment has now arrived is really the question before the Senate. The Vice-President of the Executive Council answered very goodnaturedly, and effectively from his point of view, the numerous questions I put to him while he was moving the second reading of the Bill. I put those questions because every candidate for election to the Federal Convention that framed the Constitution voiced the opinion that by the appointment of a High Commissioner for the Commonwealth a great deal of State expenditure in London might be saved. It was said that if a High Commissioner were appointed, the State Agents-General would, as a matter of course, no longer be required. </para>

                            <para>- I am satisfied that we shall not require six Agents-General and a High Commissioner as well. But if we are to continue in the course which we are at present following, and if some of my honorable friends are to continue their efforts to show that the States and the Commonwealth are absolutely different, and that the sooner their financial relations are separated the better, I am not so sure that we can look for any saving from' the appointment of a High Commissioner. It appears to me that the financial interests of the States and the Commonwealth are one and the same, and I am therefore unable to take the view which some honorable senators take on this question. In appointing a High Commissioner now, contrary to the will of some of the State Governments, and without, I think, the approbation of any of them, we shall be violating the promises made by those who were elected as members of the Federal Convention. </para>

                            <para>- No, but I think that at the various Premiers' Conferences which were attended by Federal Ministers something should have been done to settle the question which we are now discussing. Some effort should have been made to discover whether on the appointment of a High Commissioner the State Governments would be prepared to transfer to him some of the duties now carried out by their Agents-General, or whether they " would continue to be separately represented in London. Apart from the financial question, there is, I think,, no other subject on which there should have been- a freer exchange of opinions between the representatives of the States and the Commonwealth at the Conferences to which I have referred. To a great extent, the duties we require to have performed in London are duties in which we are all interested. It is impossible to separate the interests of great States like New South Wales and Queensland from those of the Commonwealth. The. matters to which the States, great and small, must give attention in London are matters with which the High Commissioner will have to deal on behalf of the Commonwealth. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said that the appointment of a High Commissioner is a natural outcome of Federation. I quite agree with the honorable senator, if at the same time an effort is made to redeem the pledges given to those who elected the members of the Federal Convention. The Commonwealth is subject to good and bad years, to times of wealth and prosperity, and times of terrible depression due to drought, and will any honorable senator tell me that it is a commonsense or business-like proposal to create a seventh Department in London to look after our affairs there. I may be told that if we make this appointment, the State Governments will join us in the matter, but I know that officers holding high salaried and honorable positions at the other end of the world, in which they are brought into contact with the most charming associations, are in possession of billets that could not easily be done away with. I. should like to know why some determined effort was not made at the Premiers' Conferences, and especially at the one recently held, to have this matter threshed out. The Commonwealth representatives had a right to ask how far the representatives of the States would approve of the appointment of a High. Commissioner, and to what extent they would be prepared to make use of his services in order to economize in the expenditure on their London Departments, and the representatives of the States would, I think, have been bound to reply. </para>

                            <para>- We are drawing a bow at a venture. I admit that to me the most interesting part of the speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council was that in which he said he felt certain that if a good man were appointed, and central offices established, the State Governments would be encouraged to transfer certain of their functions to the High Commissioner. I think, however, that the honorable senator must admit that the State Governments are not at present very strongly in favour of this appointment. We know that a certain amount of State jealousy exists because people have not yet recognised that we are absolutely one and indissoluble. Whilst this feeling of jealousy continues, although one or two of' the Governments of the States might agree to transfer their business to the High- Commissioner, others might refuse to do so, might continue their separate London offices, and even pay increased salaries to their representatives. That would bring about a condition of affairs contrary to that which we desire to bring about by the appointment of a High . Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- When honorable senators consider the duties which the High Commissioner will have to perform, they will see that there is something in my argument. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said that the value of the trade between Australia and Great Britain is about <inline font-style="italic">j£6o,</inline> 000,000,  and that sometimes false prejudices arise amongst the people of Great Britain, due to misconceptions and misrepresentations which a High Commissioner could correct. The six Agents-General of the different States are able men, and politicians with a great knowledge of their respective States. They possess collectively a knowledge of Australia which no one man could be expected to have, and I have been astounded that it has never entered the minds of Federal Ministers to ask the State Agents-General to meet once or twice a week, or daily,' if necessary, as a Council of Advice for Australia. Surely these men would be in a position to correct am misrepresentation of the kind referred to? </para>

                            <para>- These men are on the spot in London, and I do not see why we should not make use of them, to correct misrepresentations, and to allay false prejudices in connexion with questions of trade. » During the past nine years they ought to have been meeting in conference once a week for the purpose of .discussing these points, and of correcting any misrepresentation of Australia. As a matter of fact, I believe that every such misrepresentation which has been made public, and which has been- calculated to injure Australia, has been corrected. The gentleman who usually replies to these misrepresentations is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> the Agent-General of New South Wales, who is a most efficient statistician. But under the plan which I have outlined, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> might have been deputed to reply to questions which required the possession of statistical knowledge, whilst another Agent-General might have been authorized to answer questions relating to the lands of Australia, and so on. I cannot conceive that any man whom we may choose on behalf of the Commonwealth will be able to do more in this direction than the six Agents-General. The Vice-President of the Executive Council next touched upon the question of immigration, and here, I think, his arguments were extremely weak. He said that in connexion with any scheme of immigration which we may adopt, the policy of the Commonwealth would be to obtain British, immigrants, and he then declared that no better - he afterwards said "no other" - officer could be intrusted with their selection than the High Commissioner. That may be a very good argument to use in a law Court, but it is not one which he should address to the wise senators whom he sees around him. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that I supported it, but I certainly made a grab at a portion of that money on the first available opportunity. Tasmania - owing to the shortage in her revenue, consequent upon Federation - has not sufficient funds, to provide her people with a perfect system of education, or to embark upon any scheme of immigration. Therefore, when this Parliament voted £20,000 for the purpose of advertising Australia, one of the first acts of the Tasmanian Tourists' Association, of which I am  President,  was to ask the Prime Minister to grant it a couple of hundred pounds. Every State but- Tasmania has embarked upon a system of immigration. They have their own agencies abroad, they grant assisted passages to immigrants, and in every way they give effect to their own policies. When the Vice-President of the Executive Council says that the selection of suitable immigrants - after the Commonwealth has adopted an immigration policy - must be in the hands of the High Commissioner, I ask him how the Commonwealth can adopt such a policy ? It is an anomalous position for the Commonwealth to say to the States : " If you will find us the land, we will find you the men." Where is the sense underlying any such proposal? If the Commonwealth Parliament chooses to " vote £100,000 to advertise the resources of Australia, I will guarantee that every penny of it will be expended in cracking up the resources of the States by means of the publication and distribution of pamphlets. </para>

While I was in London I heard with very great pleasure of the proposal to purchase a site for Commonwealth offices there. I inspected the suggested site with Captain Collins, and I certainly regarded it as a most central one. </para>

                            <para>- I voted against the proposal on. the ground that the price demanded for the site was too high. 1 thought that by purchasing a site the Commonwealth would lay the foundation of a policy of which we all might be proud - a policy under which we should have a High Commissioner, and the services of the Agents-General would be dispensed with. I thought that Commercial Agents would be appointed for the States, that they would all be housed in the one office, and that people in the Old Country would be able to go to that office for all information  about the States arid about Australia generally. Unfortunately, we could not come to terms with the vendors in respect of that particular site. In the interval the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Pent purchased a part of the site on behalf of Victoria, and the Agent-General of this State is now housed there. Since then Queensland has acquired offices elsewhere, and Western Australia has completed arrangements for the accommodation of its representative in London. As a result, the Agents-General and the States are not taking the slightest interest in the appointment of a High Commissioner, so that it appears to me that despite his appointment they will continue to act just as they do now. </para>

Does not my honorable friend think that his interjection savours of an impertinence? He must permit me to put my own construction upon my actions. When I am' making a speech every sentence of which means that I do not desire to continue the Agents-General in London, it is a piece of gross impertinence for any honorable senator to declare that I do. We have been told that another duty of the High Commissioner will be to watch the legislation that is enacted by the Commonwealth. Can a High Commissioner discharge that duty better than can six Agents-General, especially if one of the latter is a high-class cultured lawyer, and the High Commissioner is not? Why should not our Agents-General meet together weekly for the purpose of ascertaining what the public of London think of Commonwealth legislation ? </para>

                            <para>- I am talking of a weekly meeting of those officers with a view to conserving the interests of Australia. Only this afternoon I heard some nonsense talked to the effect that the Agents-General are not elected by the people. I say that indirectly they are elected by the people. They are appointed by the Ministries of the day, who represent a majority of the electors, and who enjoy their confidence. It is so much nonsense - so much hypocritical Democracy - to say that the Agents-General do not represent the people. I hope the Vice-President of the Executive Council does not really mean that our legislation can . be watched better by the High Commissioner than it can be by the Agents-General. I think, too, that he made some reference to that much debated legislation - the Immigration Restriction Act. By each mail the Agents-General might have reported what was the public opinion of that Act in London. </para>

                            <para>- My argument is that those gentlemen could have watched the Commonwealth legislation and have reported to us weekly the opinion of that legislation which existed in the Old Country. I do not see that we want to exercise any .control over them. What we require is the opinion of the English people upon our legislation. I think it is rather a pity that this Parliament should ' require to be watched in regard to its legislation. But that it does need to be watched is clearly evidenced by its action in placing upon our statute-book the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act and the Trade Marks Act, both of which have been declared to be unconstitutional. Those measures would never have been approved by men who had the faintest knowledge of what the provisions of the Constitution mean. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council went on to. point out that information could be distributed through the instrumentality of the High Commissioner. </para>

                    <para class="block">But could one man in one office distribute information about Australia better than six men in six offices? My honorable friend argued that there is at present some conflict between the information disseminated. Probably that is so. When a State issues a leaflet about its tourist resorts, I dare say it is inclined to make comparisons at the expense of other States. But because leaflets have been issued advising people to go to Queensland, which is beautifully warm, instead of to a snowy  place like Tasmania, no harm is done, and even if we had a High Commissioner he could not prevent the circulation of information of that character. My honorable friend also urged that the High Commissioner would transact a large amount of business for the Defence Department. No doubt that is so. But the States will still have a great amount of work to do in London for their railways, and will have to maintain agents for that purpose. It is possible that New South Wales may maintain in London as big an office as we have, and, if that should be the case, it is likely enough that many people will think that New South Wales is Australia. We are told that because Canada has one office for her High Commissioner, that establishment is known as the centre of information about Canada. I should like to see the same sort of thing done in regard to Australia. But it is prevented by the want of harmony between the Commonwealth and the States. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has altered his estimate of Captain Collins. </para>

                            <para>- As far as I could ascertain when I was in London, Captain Collins is a very efficient officer. He is not paid a high salary, and does his work in an admirable manner. His Department is costing us £5,000 a year, and I presume that the Department which the Government propose to establish will cost . £10,000 more, making the total cost of the High Commissioner's Office £15,000 a year. The Canadian High Commissioner's Office costs £6,600 a year. He receives a salary of £2,000 a year ; an allowance, presumably for travelling expenses, of £400 a year.; an allowance towards cost of residence of £240 a year; and his secretary is paid £660 a year. There are also three clerks, an assistant secretary, and two or three messengers. The rent of the office is £1,300 a year, and contingencies amount to £400 a year. </para>

                            <para>- I have no sympathy with sending a man to London as a figurehead. We ought not to pay the High Commissioner a high salary to enable him to entertain and keep up a big residence. Probably, unless we provide in the Bill that he shall keep up a house, he will pocket the house allowance and live in rooms at a convenient hotel ! </para>

                    <para>It may be that it is most desirable that the High Commissioner at first should not interfere with the other offices. He should get his own staff organized, his office in working order, and then see how far he can discharge the duties now discharged by the officers of the various Agents-General. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is all very fine and seems very pleasant, but we shall be dependent upon what view the States take of our office, and of the efficiency of our High Commissioner, as to whether the Agents-General are going to be superseded in any way. </para>
                    <para>Except in so far as there should be Interstate conflict or conflict between the Government of the Commonwealth and that of a State requiring separate representation, all the diplomatic work can be arranged by one person. </para>
                    <para class="block">In diplomatic matters I quite agree that Australia ought to speak with one mind and one voice. </para>
                    <para>As to the financial work, it would be an advantage if it were all transacted by one person, as care would be taken not to make the Boating of loans conflict. On the other hand a State might object that a Commissioner subordinated State for Commonwealth business. </para>
                    <para class="block">The practical suggestion which I have to make here is that until the State debts are taken over by .the Commonwealth, and there is really some important financial work for the High Commissioner to transact, he should not  be  ^appointed1. A clause should be inserted .in this Bill, providing that the High Commissioner shall not be appointed until the debts are taken over. The arranging for the transfer of the debts will be the most important work this officer will have to do, and until that takes place I contend that there is no business to be transacted which would justify the appointment of a High Commissioner with a Department costing £15,000 a year. </para>

                        <para>. - Coming from- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> the last speech was intensely interesting. When honorable senators, particularly those on this side, have attempted to get the powers- of this Parliament extended in any particular, he has been one of the foremost in denouncing them as unificationists.  If it is suggested for a moment that there is any State power which this Parliament could exercise, or that some State functions should be surrendered to the Commonwealth, we are at once charged with endeavouring to hasten unification. Yet, during the whole of his speech this evening, the honorable senator laboriously pointed out that the offices of the Agents-General in the United Kingdom could, and should, be abolished if a High Commissioner is appointed. If that is not proposing what . we have been endeavouring to do, I do not know what is. I do not think that the appointment of a High Commissioner will tend to unification, but I am quite certain that if that argument had been used from this side we should have heard cries about unification, especially from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> This is a belated Bill, which should have been passed years ago. It has my cordial support, because 1 think it is quite time that we had a High Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, the time is- rotten-ripe. The Commonwealth has suffered in many ways from not having in London a representative ether than our official representative, Captain Collins. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> mentioned in his speech that four years ago I said that Captain Collins was unfit for the position which he was occupying in London. I dare say that, like many other honorable senators, I have said things which, perhaps, were foolish. I certainly have no recollection of having made the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> attributed to me, but if 1 did say anything of the sort - and 1 should like the honorable senator to produce his proof - I did Captain Collins a great injustice. I suppose that while I was Minister of Defence I had more to do with that officer than had any other Minister, owing to the fact that during the recess he had to deal more particularly with defence matters. I found that he was not only an enthusiastic, but a painstaking and remarkably capable man in his position. The correspondence satisfied me that in Captain Collins we have an officer of whom we might very well be proud, and one who is doing remarkably good work for the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Captain Collins discharged his duties in an admirable manner, but it should be pointed out that those duties were' of a strictly Departmental character, and not of the representative character which would attach to the office of High Commissioner. I express no opinion as to how Captain Collins has carried out certain duties which he has been called upon to perform, and which, in ordinary circumstances, would fall to the lot of a High Commissioner. On that point I express no opinion, and the opinion I have expressed has to do entirely with Departmental work, which, I repeat, he did in a most admirable fashion. Whilst I think that the appointment of a High Commissioner could well have been made at any time during the history of Federation. I venture to say that there never was a time, when the question has been so pressing as it is to-day. For handling the question of the State debts and the defence question we require a man of eminent skill, ability, and influence, with a good grasp of Australian affairs. We require a man of that type in London now as we never required him before. </para>

                            <para>- If this Parliament is not prepared to deal with the transfer of the State debts, I am satisfied that the next Parliament will receive such a mandate from the people, that that question will have to be dealt with. I am convinced that if Parliament does not act, it will find that public opinion is moving, and that it will be forced to act. Then, as regards the defence question, I look upon the recent Conference in England as merely the foundation-stone on which an edifice has to be reared, and the success of the whole scheme will largely depend upon the capacity of the man who will represent the Commonwealth. He must be, not merely an official, but a man who is in touch with the political life and aspirations of Australia, in order that he may be able to correctly represent to the Imperial Government and the Imperial Departments the true opinion and the true desire of Australia in the working out of that great scheme, which was barely outlined at the Imperial Defence. Conference. That important matter brooks of no delay. Next we have the question of immigration. I believe that there can be no effective immigration without dealing with the land question ; but we must have an immigration policy before we can have a defence policy. That the former means a land policy, I am well aware. At the same time,- when we have dealt, or are dealing, with the land policy, we want, side by side with it, an effective immigration policy - that is, a policy which will bring to us the right class of immigrant, to the right place, and at the right time. That means organization in Great Britain and on the Continent. To secure that organization, we must have an organizer, and he is not to be found every clay. Next, there is the question of trade. Our export trade to-day, great as it is, is only in its infancy. When one remembers the gigantic schemes of land settlement and irrigation which every State is proposing, and which will add immeasurably to our export trade ; when one recognises that we have merely touched the fringe of the European markets, that apples sent to the Continent have realized better prices there than even in England,  one must realize that we have an elastic market for all our exports, which is practically unexploited. There we must have organization to find the markets and the way to enter them, and, in order that our local Departments may be kept in touch with the London Department for the purpose of opening up this trade. </para>

                            <para>- The States are not doing this work to the extent to which it ought to be done ; but merely in a limited fashion. My ideal of a High Commissioner is that he should be the political ambassador of the Commonwealth and of the States collectively, and that attached to him each State should have its commercial and business agent to push its products; all to be guided, fashioned, and directed by the High Commissioner. That is what I believe the people will compel the States to do. I have a good deal of sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in one respect. We know that there is a possibility of the people's desire being thwarted in this matter, as it was thwarted in the matter of the State Governors. I am satisfied that  95  per cent, of the people who voted for Federation thought that they were going to have one Governor-General, and that the State Governors were to be abolished ; but their will has been thwarted; and it may be that the jealousy of the State and Federal politicians may thwart the realization of my ideal of a High Commissioner ; but I am convinced that, sooner or later, the people's will will be expressed in no uncertain way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> remarked that some of the statements made in this debate were " so much hypocritical Democracy " - a rather startling phrase, I thought. So far, the only speakers have been the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the Government Whip. I do not know which of them was the representative of a " hypocritical Democracy." But it seems that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> was alluding to a statement which had been made that the High Commissioner should be elected by the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that it ever took any action. The Bill, as a machinery Bill, is probably as perfect as it could be, but the great difficulty in the matter is as to the person who is to be appointed High Commissioner. No matter what Government were in power, it is very likely they would make such an appointment for political purposes. That is one of the dangers of Democracy, or of any other form of government. </para>

                            <para>- No; I have absolutely no sympathy with that proposition. I think, on the contrary, that a politician should be appointed, because he would be more likely to be in touch and sympathy with the political sentiment of the country. We should have no means of judging, in the case of the appointment of a man who was not a politician, whether he was in touch with that sentiment. The appointment I should like to see made would be that of a man who is in touch with present day Australian opinion. I shall not refer to any names, but the names of certain persons have been mentioned in connexion with this appointment, who are not, I am afraid, in sympathy with up-to-date Australian opinion. I think that, at all events, the man first appointed to this position should be in the full vigour of life, and one who has not passed the meridian of his abilities. </para>

Some men are old at fifty, but I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will be smiling and jolly at 100 years of age just as he is to-day. Having in view the weakness of human nature, and the fact that the members of the present Government possess their full share of its frailties, I think they should give an early intimation of the person to be appointed to this position in order that Parliament may have an opportunity, if it thinks fit, to express an opinion on the appointment. </para>

                            <para>- We know that if the appointment is made after this Parliament is dissolved, it will be useless for the next Parliament to enter any protest. The High Commissioner will then be established in London, and he should not be recalled except for some very weighty reason. In view of the fact that the Government will be called upon to make this appointment for the first time, they would be well advised in pushing on with the Bill and disclosing the name of the gentleman appointed in time to give Parliament an opportunity to express an opinion upon the appointment. The Government appear to have a majority in both Houses of this Parliament, and they have nothing to fear from the adoption of such a course as I suggest. If the proposed appointment were such as would not command the support of a majority in both Houses, it would be most regrettable if nothing could be done to prevent it. </para>

I am almost certain that some member of the Government party in either the Senate or the House of Representatives will secure the appointment, and I may say that there are members of the party in both Houses whose appointment I should be prepared to cordially support. I recognise that this will be a party appointment, and while I should not object to it as such, I do say that the gentleman chosen should command the respect  and good feeling of the whole of the members of this Parliament. I do not think the salary proposed in the Bill is sufficient. I am prepared to vote for a higher salary. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that. I have noticed that in the Parliament of the State which the honorable senator represents a discussion has recently taken place as to the advisability of increasing the salary of the State Agent-General. No vote has yet been taken on the question, but I believe a majority have expressed themselves against the proposed increase. The salary paid to the Agent-General for Tasmania is £400 per year, and I confess I should be very doubtful about the wisdom of taking the job at that salary. Those who are opposed to the increase of the salary may be influenced by a belief that the present salary is sufficient, or by the knowledge that a Bill for the appointment of a High Commissioner is before the Federal Parliament, and that it may shortly be possible for the Tasmanian Government to have the work of their London office done through the office of the High Commissioner. I know that the State Government of Western Australia are looking for opportunities to save money, and I believe that they would be found to be in . a most receptive frame of mind should the Federal Government approach them with any proposal to have their Agent-General's Department incorporated with that of the High Commissioner. It should be borne in mind that if it were possible to induce the two States to which I have referred to make a start in this matter, the other States would very likely find it to their advantage to follow their example. </para>

                            <para>- They would be forced by a consideration of the attractions. I have said that I would be prepared to vote for a higher salary than. that provided for in the Bill. If we can judge by newspaper reports, the sister Dominion of Canada occupies a larger share of public attention in English and Continental circles than does1 Australia. I believe that that is entirely due to the commanding personality and liberal hospitality of Lord Strathcona.' I do not suppose we shall be able to find a Strathcona to represent us in London. Lord Strathcona has, indeed, been a treasure to the Dominion of . Canada, and seems to combine all the virtues desirable in a High Commissioner. If we could get a man to do similar work for Australia it would be greatly to our advantage. </para>

                            <para>- He has the advantage of being a very wealthy man, and one reason why I advocate the payment of a higher salary than that provided for in the Bill is that Lord Strathcona, because of his wealth, has set up a standard which the High Commissioner of Australia will, doubtless, be expected to make some effort to reach. In the circumstances, unless he is paid an adequate salary, the position can only be filled by a very wealthy man, and that must very considerably limit our choice in Australia. It would be unfortunate to have to ask a man to accept the position, not because he was best fitted for it, but because other men who might be better fitted would be unable, owing to their pecuniary circumstances, to accept it. That, I think, is a strong argument for increasing the proposed salary. I do not know whether there is any desire on the part of honorable senators to increase it, but I should favour a proposal of the kind, for the reasons I have stated." I hope that the Bill will have a speedy passage, and that the Government will take an early opportunity of making an appointment. I hope that, apart from political considerations, they will make the best appointment they can in the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I was struck by the weakness of the arguments put forward by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in urging the necessity for the appointment of a High Commissioner. The fact that a High Commissioner could speak with one voice for the whole of the Commonwealth is the most weighty argument in support of such an appointment. When the Minister spoke of the advantage it would be to Australia if the High Commissioner were intrusted with the carrying out of an immigration policy, it at once occurred to me that Canada has land to offer to immigrants, while the Commonwealth has none. The Canadian Government spend about £190,000 per annum on immigration. With respect to the advisability of this appointment, I should like to refer honorable senators to a report from the Australian Agents-General called for by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> some three or four years ago. In that report the Agents- General say - </para>

                            <para>- There is good reason to believe that the State Governments will not be prepared to give the High Commissioner full power to deal with State matters in London. There is a Bill now before another place providing for the' taking over of the debts of the States, and the passing of that measure might lead to action on the part of the State Governments to invest the High Commissioner with some of the functions now carried out by State Agents-General. In any case, I think it will be found that the State Governments will desire to continue their independent representation in London. Honorable senators should bear in mind that, although Canada has been represented in London, by a High Commissioner for the last twenty-five years, the Dominion still has a number of commercial agents abroad. Honorable senators may call them Agents- </para>

                        <para>The ordinary conception of a High Commissioner is an officer with considerable private means who will be able to entertain largely and attend to such diplomatic work between the Commonwealth and the British Government, as may arise from time to time. An officer having no such qualifications would be ludicrous in the extreme. </para>

                    <para class="block">That extract shows clearly that the High Commissioner must be possessed] of 'attributes which will enable him to discharge social functions. For that reason I am in favour of increasing the emoluments attaching to his office. Unless our High 'Commissioner is able to discharge these social obligations, the Commonwealth will be placed under a great disadvantage as compared with Canada. Five thousand pounds is not a very large sum to pay for our High Commissioner. Lord Strathcona spends a very much larger sum annually, because he is a wealthy man. But I do not think that we have a very wide choice in that direction. The report from which I have quoted sets down the expenses of the High Commissioner's office at £16,000 annually without taking into consideration the cost of a commercial agency and of paying an inspecting engineer. The cost of the last named alone, it is computed, would be £8,500 yearly. So far, the Commonwealth office in London has almost paid its way by reason of the advantages which Captain 'Collins has been able to secure for us. Therefore, if we had a capable staff under that gentleman, and a less expensive office than that which we contemplated establishing some time ago, we should have all that we at present require. Before we purchase a site for our offices in London the High Commissioner should be appointed and should be charged with the duty of recommending it. The report also states that the salary of the High Commissioner should be £5,000 per annum, but, in my opinion, that would provide only for a very inadequate representation. If we are to have any representation at all, the States ought to aid us in securing it. In other words, I do not think that I shall be able td support the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Has not the honorable senator ever heard of the general manager of a bank, and also of the manager of the head office of that bank? The High Commissioner will require a senior executive officer, and he could not, in my opinion, secure a better. man for the position than Captain Collins. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the salary which it is proposed to grant the High Commissioner is not sufficient for the position. If a proposal be submitted to request the other Chamber to increase the emoluments of the office by  £1,000  a year, I shall support it. </para>

In regard to the qualifications of the High Commissioner, I think that he should be a man of extensive Australian experience, and one who has been successful in his vocation. He should possess a certain knowledge of finance, and be held in great respect by the community in which he has resided. 'We must have a man of high character. </para>

I believe in doing unto others as I would have them do unto me, and if that is not good Democracy I do not know what it is. I have never been a Tory. A Tory is a man who belongs to a caste, and it seems to me that there is a certain Democratic-Tory-Labour caste in Australia. I feel confident that, although the appointment of a High Commissioner will have to be a political one in a certain sense, whoever may be appointed will rise to the occasion by sinking all party considerations and thinking only of the interests of the country. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that such men are so uncommon as some honorable senators appear to suppose - Human nature is very much the same allover the world. The Labour party contains within- its ranks men who are every bit as honorable as are senators upon this side of the Chamber. Probably they are all just as honorable. The High Commissioner should have under his control an Intelligence Department, which should be able to afford information to intending settlers in Australia, and to keep&gt; in touch with all great movements. Certainly the occupant of this distinguished office can make himself very useful in connexion with our Defence Department ; and he can also disseminate a knowledge of the Commonwealth by delivering lectures, and by answering letters bearing upon Australia generally. Much as I believe in State Rights, I hope that the States will recognise that it is to their interest to take advantage of the High Commissioner's office and to co-operate with the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator would take a trip Home he would obtain very valuable information as to what will be the duties of the High Commissioner. Recently we have heard a good deal of talk about the consolidation of the State debts. I have, been consistent in supporting the proposal for the consolidation of those debts from the period when the Federal Convention met up till now. All the leading financial authorities in the United Kingdom favour the establishment of one stock for Australia. In Great Britain, trust moneys can be invested only in certain securities, but no such limitation is imposed in regard to Government stocks. As a young man I was for a couple of years in a stock-broker's office, and I know something about that phase of finance. Everybody is aware that a unified stock like consols is very easily dealt with, and it would be found that if there were a single Commonwealth stock, it would be in greater demand by investors than are the stocks of the several States. I have heard it said that the Commonwealth has no security to offer. At one time I was inclined to hold that view. But the Commonwealth has such powers of taxation that the States, for their own comfort, would give us a guarantee that if their share of the Customs and Excise revenue was not sufficient to cover the interest they would make up the difference. If they did not we should, of course, put on direct taxation to raise the required amount. </para>

                        <para>. - I <inline font-style="italic">shall</inline> support the second reading of this Bill. So far from its being a premature proposal, I think the- matter has been delayed much longer than it should have been. Australia has arrived at such a position of dignity and importance in regard to trade, commerce and general development that she needs representation at the very heart of the Empire. In my opinion, an appointment should have been made long before this. ' Australia owes it to herself as part of the British Empire, that she should be represented in London. Canada has been represented there for about a score of years; and Canada's over-sea trade is very much less than that of Australia. Canada has, in addition to her High. Commissioner, commercial agents in nearly all the large centres of Great Britain - in Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, and other cities of great industrial importance. We need a representative in London, so that when statements are circulated about Australia, which could not be justified if inquired into, they may be forthwith contradicted. The time has come when (he States must be content to have not Agents-General but General Agents. When a High Commissioner is appointed by the Commonwealth, it will be for the States to determine what they shall do in that respect. If they see fit to avail themselves of the services of the Commonwealth representative we shall be glad. If they do not, I think that public opinion will force the State Governments to make use of the opportunities given to them under this Bill, because it will be recognised that the expenditure of the States in this regard is a good deal too high, and that the creation of this office will afford an excellent opportunity for the making of savings. I agree, however, that much depends upon the man appointed. I confess that I have tried to worm something out of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but he is about as close as an oyster, and declares that he does not know. Perhaps if I were in his position I should not know any more than he does. I admit, after all. that it is for the Ministry to take the responsibility of the appointment. They must be prepared to stand or fall by what they do. </para>

                            <para>- No. I hope, however, that no derelict will be appointed. The High Commissioner must be a man of capacity. He must be not only in touch with political feeling in the 'Commonwealth, but must have some commercial knowledge and capacity for business. No doubt he will have to attend many social functions. He will not be able to escape them. He ought to be . able to hold his own on such occasions, and his wife also should be able to hold her own in the social life of London. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly do not think that the salary proposed is too high. We ought not to expect any man to make a sacrifice. We should pay him a salary sufficiently large to enable him to discharge his duties properly, and not expect him to dip into his own purse. If the salary is not high enough a premium is offered to men who will be prepared to pay something to hold high office. Therefore, though' I do not propose to submit an amendment myself, I should be inclined to vote for' an increase of the salary. </para>

                            <para>- We shall certainly fix a minimum, and if the High Commissioner chosen is worth more we should pay him more. As to the site of the offices in London, I think the situation proposed some time ago was a remarkably good one. My only objection to it was that too much money was asked for it. If we can secure a site in the neighbourhood it will be as good a position as we can get. The term of appointment is to be limited to five years. Personally, I think that period too short. We ought not, in my view, to appoint the High Commissioner for less than seven years. We shall be asking him to break his connexions in Australia, and if he be a professional man, it will be difficult for him returning at the end of five years to pick them up again. I notice that, the Bill provides that the High Commissioner shall carry out such instructions as he receives from the Minister, but no indication is given as to what Minister is intended. </para>

                            <para>- Then I am content. I shall give the Bill a general support, because I believe that we shall be doing a right thing in appointing a High Commissioner, and also because we shall afford the means of saving expense to the States, and enable the whole of Australian business in London to be concentrated in one quarter, so that whoever wants information in regard to these matters may be able to get it there. I hope that the man who is appointed to the office will be able to lay hold of the very large and important questions which must very soon be dealt with, especially the question of transferring the State debts which, I think, ought to have been tackled long ago. </para>

The only reason why I think they have not felt justified in giving their consent is because they have not had sufficient confidence in this Parliament. I believe, however, that as soon as anything like a fair arrangement is made, they will be only too willing to agree to a transfer of the debts, especially if it can be shown that it will mean a relief in the interest bill. </para>

                            <para>- I am not giving the reason why the States have not agreed to transfer the debts, but merely stating the feeling which, so far as I can learn, has . influenced them. I do not say that it is justified, but I hope that it will be dissipated, and that the States will realize that the Commonwealth is working for the advancement of Australia as a whole, and will handle the debts in such a way as to bring benefit to the States, and lead them to come into a closer and more sympathetic relationship with the Commonwealth. I am prepared to support the Bill. </para>

I desire to know whether the Vice-President of the Executive Council can furnish the Senate with information showing, as from the 1st of January last year, the particular hotels in which such telephones have been installed in Sydney and Melbourne, the number of such telephones in each hotel, the date on which they were installed, the number of applications which have been received from that date in Sydney and Melbourne, and _ refused, and the reasons why such applications have been refused. </para>

                        <para>- Because it will be easier for the Department to furnish the information. I am given to understand that in certain hotels in Sydney and Melbourne, and without the slightest difficulty, public telephones have been installed, at which the public pay1d., or whatever the price of the call may be, while other hotels equally reputable, . and just as frequently tenanted by respectable visitors, have been met with a refusal. If that is the case, I think the Senate and the other House should know, why any discrimination is made. If there are to be public telephones installed in hotels, well and good. Let the rule apply all round ; but if they are to be installed in some hotels, and denied to others of equal repute, then the Senate and another place should know exactly the rea sons for such discrimination. I have limited my inquiry to hotels in Melbourne and Sydney for the purpose of simplicity and expedition, in order that the Department may not be able to say that it will take a long time to obtain the information. </para>
