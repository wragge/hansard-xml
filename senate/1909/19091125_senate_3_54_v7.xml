                        <para>- I should like a direction from you, sir, as to the order of business to-day. Yesterday was the date fixed for the Select Committee on the Press Cable Service to present its report, and, when I asked for leave to move for an extension of time, an objection was made, and I then gave notice of a motion for today. I desire to know, sir, whether the motion is to be treated as private business, or how it can be dealt with at present. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> before you reply to the inquiry, I desire to point out that the honorable senator has opened up a rather large question, which, for obvious reasons, it is not desirable to discuss now. I am quite prepared to move the postponement of Government business until his motion has been dealt with. That course, if adopted, will' get over the present difficulty, leaving to a later period the determination of the larger question as '.o what procedure ought to be adopted in such cases. </para>

                            <para>- I have given some consideration to the question of how a motion of this character ought to be dealt with. It appears to me that a motion to appoint a Select Committee for the purpose of inquiring into a matter is purely private business. But, once the motion has been agreed to. the inquiry is being conducted on behalf of the Senate, not on behalf of a private senator, of the Government, or of the Opposition, and should be treated as a matter relating to the business of the Senate. From that stand-point, I think that a motion of the- character now under consideration should take precedence of other matters which may be placed on the notice paper. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, if there should be any feeling on the part of honorable senators that it is undesirable to adopt that course immediately, I am quite prepared, if it is possible to postpone the business on the notice-paper, to allow the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to be taken now, without giving a definite ruling. But my opinion is that such a matter is the business of the Senate, and should, at any rate on future occasions, be so treated. I desire to intimate that, in future, when a date is fixed for a Select Committee to bring up its report, an order of the day will appear on the notice-paper for that day. If a Select Committee were making an inquiry which, in the opinion of a section of honorable senators it was undesirable to continue, it would be quite open for the Senate to' withdraw the power which was intrusted to the Committee. In that way, the Senate itself would be protected, and it would not be possible, by means of Standing Orders or otherwise, to prevent its will from being carried out. In the present case, I think it would be just as well to adopt the course which has been suggested by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and honorable senators will have an opportunity, if they see fit, to take exception to the action .which I contemplate pursuing in the future. </para>

                            <para>- I beg to ask a question, sir, about the decision which you have just given. I am sure that you will permit me the liberty of saying that I very largely sympathize with your view that such matters arc the business of the Senate, not the business of either the Government or private senators. I should like to know, sir, whether I am to understand that, as the business nf the Senate, a matter would be free from the obligations of the Standing Orders, because your statement has left that rather indefinite in my mind. </para>

                        <para>-  The Senate has done nothing of the kind. My honorable friend has made sufficient unwise observations in connexion with this matter already, and really should not interfere with things that he does not understand. It is principally for the reason that I have given that I am now moving that the extension of time be limited, for the purpose of framing and bringing up the report of the Committee. I do not wish to interfere with the preparation and submission of the report in any shape or way. I mentioned that view of the question, when I took a certain point of  order last night, as to which you, sir, sustained my view. But, although I think it advisable that the report should be prepared and presented, I venture to say that the adoption of it will never be moved in the chamber. The whole inquiry has been very largely a waste of time, and waste of energy, and a waste of public money. </para>

                        <para>- There will be no opportunity for moving the adoption of the report this session, and the time of the Senate is too precious to admit of a lengthy discussion of the question. I might submit a number of propositions on this matter, but I am rather inclined to think that I have said sufficient to warrant my amendment. By all means let the report be presented, and then it will be seen how truly futile the proceedings of the Committee have been. I also draw attention to a notice of motion given by the  Chairman  of the Committee this afternoon - the most condemnatory proposition that could have been submitted by him. I am not attempting to discuss the notice itself. I simply draw attention to its terms. The honorable senator comes here, and tables a motion asking the Senate to grant the Committee leave to do that which, in direct contravention of the Standing Orders, it has been doing ever since it was appointed. </para>

I think that the wholesome rule is not to debate anything relating to a Committee until a specific motion is before the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I am not attempting to discuss the notice of motion. I made the citation without any comment. The notice asks for leave to admit the press to the sittings of the Committee. We know what follows. I think that motion ought to have been discussed before the motion now under review was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> It seems to me that the whole object of the motion of which notice has been given this afternoon will be set aside, if authority be given to the Committee to take further evidence. I do not think that statement is out of order. It may be sailing pretty close to the wind, but I cannot help that, because an unusual set of circumstances has arisen. Such a position probably never arose before in any Legislative Chamber in the world, as that of the  Chairman  of a Select Committee actually giving notice of a motion for leave to admit the press, although the press has been attending the sittings all along. He is also asking by the present motion that the Committee have leave to examine witnesses. See how the two motions conflict. One has reference to taking evidence - the other to leave to admit the press. I think I am simply doing my duty as a member of the Senate, and as one charged, to some extent, as every honorable senator is, to see to the proper expenditure of public money, in moving the amendment. </para>

                        <para>-  I submit, as a point of order, that the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> cannot be received. The motion under consideration is that the Select Committee have extended time for the presentation of its report. The Senate, after due deliberation, gave the Committee power to examine witnesses and call for persons and papers. The Committee has almost concluded its work. But it has not completed the examination of one witness, who did not feel himself justified in giving answers to certain questions. That witness is to be examined again. The Committee is, therefore, simply carrying out the mandate of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the honorable senator, I point out that the Committee was appointed originally for the purpose of inquiring into the conditions which control the cable service and matters connected therewith. The Senate, in appointing the Select Committee, fixed a date on which it was to present its report. The report was due on the 24th of Novembei. There is power under the Standing Orders to extend the time given to a Select Committee for the presentation of its report, but it is necessary that a motion should be submitted for the purpose. That motion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has just moved, but it is open to amendment by the Senate if it thinks fit. The Select Committee is a creation of the Senate, which can control if in any way it sees fit. The Senate might, if it pleased, withdraw the power of inquiry given to the Select Committee in the first instance. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators might reasonably ask to be allowed to dissociate their views as to the desirability or otherwise of appointing this Select Committee from the matter now before the Senate. Honorable senators are aware that I was opposed to the appointment of this. Select Committee. I considered it pernicious, and I think that it is possibly worse now than I thought it would be at the time it was decided to appoint it. At the same time, there are other matters which should be considered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> just now referred to an attempt to kill the Committee. The view I take is that it is not necessary for the Senate to consider an expedient of that kind. I believe that, provided that a sufficiently liberal supply of rope is given to the Committee, an act of suicide on its part will relieve the Senate of any necessity to commit murder. The real question before us now is whether we should or should not take advantage of a slip on the part of the Committee, in order to retrace a step which we previously took, however false that step may have been. If those in charge of the Select Committee had paid a little more attention to the Standing Orders, the motion now before the Senate would have been submitted yesterday, and in that case the Senate would, I think, have done what it has done before, and have granted the extension of time asked for. I have never known a House of Parliament to refuse a request by a Select Committee for an extension of time. Through a perfectly natural oversight which we. can all understand, those in charge of this Select Committee allowed a day to slip by, and it is now sought to repair the omission of yesterday. In the circumstances, I do not think that we should decline to do to-day what we should probably have done as a matter of form yesterday. We can pass judgment on the report of the Select Committee when it is brought up, but at present we are asked merely- </para>

I have had a good deal of experience of Select Committees, and I have never known a case in which a request by a Select Committee for an extension of time within which to complete its investigations and submit its report was refused. It seems to me almost improper that the Senate should deny what I think this Select Committee has a right to ask. But I should like to be informed by some members of the Committee whether the object of the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is to secure, not merely the further examination of witnesses, but the compulsory disclosure by certain witnesses of information which they object to disclose. </para>

But if it is merely what it appears to be, a proper request by the Committee for further time to complete their investigations and submit their report, it should not be objected to. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators are aware that when the motion for the appointment of this Select Committee was originally discussed, I opposed it as strongly as I could. I considered that the appointment of the Committee was a great mistake, and my view of the matter has been strengthened rather than weakened by what has since taken place. However, I think it would be rather a weak and cowardly thing to take advantage of a slip on the part of the Committee ; and, holding that view, I can be no party to an attempt to suppress the Committee in a summary manner. </para>

                    <para>.-.! do. not think that we can dissociate the object for which this Committee was appointed from the motion now before the Senate. The appointment of the Committee was asked for as a matter of public importance. We were told that the supply of cables was very costly, and that the conditions under which they were supplied to the press in several of the States were unfair; that the news supplied was inadequate, garbled, and inaccurate. We have learned, from press reports of the evidence given before the Select Committee, that these allegations have absolutely failed. We do not find that the press of the country are dissatisfied with the conditions under which they are getting cable news. We do not find that the news is garbled or inaccurate. </para>

                        <para>- We are discussing at the present time a motion for an extension of time to enable the Committee to pursue its inquiries, and bring up its report. An amendment has been moved to confine the purpose for which the extension shall be given to the preparation and presentation of the report. It is not wise to anticipate the report, which may be presented by the Committee; and the remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is now making would be more appropriate when the Committee's report is submitted. The only question we have now to consider is, first, whether the time should be extended, and next, whether the extension should be limited to a particular purpose. </para>

I opposed the inquiry because, in my opinion, it is an inquiry into the private business of certain people. We do not know how much further it is intended to take it, or whether this motion is to be used as a means to compel people who do not feel inclined to do so, to publicly disclose matters affecting their private business. I have no wish to object to an extension of time in a fair way ; but we should understand that members of the public are not to be compelled by this Select Committee to disclose their private affairs, and that the Committee will take advantage of the extension of time merely for the purpose of preparing and presenting their report. </para>

                        <para>- I was going to use a stronger expression ; and I shall accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> word. I think that they are sometimes appointed for unworthy objects. The Senate appointed this Select Committee to make a certain investigation. That investigation, whatever its value may be, is proceeding. The Committee, through its  Chairman,  asks the Senate for an extension of time it should have asked for a day or two earlier; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, that is no reason why it should not be granted now. The position could not have been put more plainly or more wisely than it was by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> The honorable senator is a member of the Committee, who was not, I think, in sympathy with its appointment or the objects supposed to be in view. I wish to know for what reason we are asked to refuse, not a courtesy, but an ordinary formal request. Upon what ground are we asked to refuse it? Because we are told that if we extend the time within which the Committee may report to the Senate, the Committee will be able to discharge its duties, to complete its examination of witnesses and to bring up its report. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> with that candour and courage which always distinguish him, wishes us to defeat the motion in an indirect way by restricting the duties of the Committee. I never heard  of such a thing in my life. It would be far better for us to negative the motion. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. But I wish to know the reasons why we are asked to take any such step. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has said that the Committee was appointed for the purpose of providing cheap news for a new labour daily journal. It is a most extraordinary reason to advance against the proposal to extend the time within which the Committee may report. I do not know whether the Committee was appointed for that purpose or not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> may be much more in the "know" than I am. But if his contention be right the functions of the Committee were dealt with when it was appointed. The next reason urged against the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is that the Committee has been a failure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has declared that he has read that statement in the newspapers. I read a good many things in the newspapers, but upon a matter of this sort I prefer to rely on the report which will be attached to the evidence which the Committee will present to the Senate. Why should the Senate sit in judgment on the utility of the Committee in this premature way? All (hat we are asked to sanction is an extension of the time within which the Committee may report until next Wednesday. If its report is not then forthcoming we shall be afforded another opportunity of dealing with the matter. I protest against the Senate being asked to sit in judgment on the Committee upon the strength of certain newspaper statements that the purpose for which it was appointed is absolutely at an end. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was himself a member of that body for some time. He now affirms that it is a futile Committee, whose proceedings- involve a waste of public money. That may be a satisfactory reason why its labours should be terminated, so far as he is concerned. But I wish to see his evidence in that connexion. We ought not to sit in judgment on this Committee now. The time to do that will be when its report is presented, accompanied by the evidence which it has taken. Of course, it may be, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council has stated, that the more rope we give the Committee the worse' it will be for it. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. We shall simply extend the time within which it was empowered to present its report under the original order of the Senate. I do not propose to indulge in prophecy as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has done, because I recognise that one ought not to prophesy unless he knows. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> prophecy, like many others, is extremely vague. He says that the Committee is going to attempt something in the nature of the coercion of witnesses. </para>

                        <para>- If, when he is asked whether his mother knows that he is out, a man declines to answer, all that the Committee can do is to ask the Senate to deal with him. Therefore, it would be ludicrous to refuse to extend the period within which the Committee must present its report, unless we decline to sanction its existence an hour longer. It would be a very unjust and improper course to adopt at the present stage. Further it would be a wasteful method, because all the expenditure necessitated by the appointment of the Committee has already been incurred, and I make these remarks as one who did not approve of its appointment. It would be a reflection on the Senate if we adopted the method which we have been asked to adopt for terminating its labours. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. After listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> speech I could not help being suspicious. That speech at once indicated the guilty mind. I. think that, in the absence of a suspicion of that sort, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> motion would have been regarded as a formal one. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> raised ghosts in this Chamber of which we are entitled to take cognisance. If it be an easy matter for the Committee to commit suicide, by all means let it do so. But if it can live under the auspices of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> let it live. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> why he requires an extension of the time within which the Committee may present its report, I shall be perfectly satisfied. </para>

                    <para>.- I merely wish to say that the Committee has yet to examine three witnesses. I need hardly reassure the Senate that it does not propose to put anybody in gaol. All that it is empowered to do is to obtain evidence: If witnesses refuse to give that evidence, the Committee must report to the Senate, upon which will be thrown the onus of taking action. Everybody who is familiar with the Standing Orders must recognise that the Committee has no power to compel witnesses to answer questions unless the Senate chooses to exercise the necessary power for it. In this matter I am entirely in the hands of honorable senators. I frankly confess that if the amendment be carried, I shall quickly send in my resignation, because I shall regard the course adopted as an at tempt to burk inquiry. But I would ask honorable senators to suspend their judgment on the Committee and its work until they have obtained its report. As a member of that body I will undertake to say - if the extension of time proposed be granted to it - that not only the evidence but probably the report of the Committee, will be placed in the hands of honorable senators before the session closes. I will do my best in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- I can. So far as I am aware, only another meeting of the Committee will require to be held to enable it to complete the taking of evidence. Only certain questions remain to be dealt with. The members of the Committee have been very regular in their attendance, with one exception, who shall be nameless, and, therefore, they are all <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with the evidence which has been taken. Consequently, I fail to see any reason why, within a few days, a report cannot be framed for presentation to the Senate - two reports, including a dissentient one, if necessary. I am not too confident that by Wednesday next the report will be ready, because the Committee has' lost a day through being unable to meet this morning. It will have to arrange for another meeting, at which the three witnesses to whom I have referred will be examined. It is my intention to push the inquiry to a termination as speedily as possible. </para>

                    (Western Aus that the question  before the Senate is second in importance to no matter which has ever been submitted to this Parliament, and offers every justification to each honorable senator to state the reasons for the opinions which he holds concerning the financial agreement. The arrangement precedent to the submission of that agreement to the Parliament has been so largely discussed by previous speakers that I do not intend to offer more than a few passing observations. I think that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline>
                    took up indisputable ground when he asserted that the arrangement owed its origin more to a political necessity than to a national need. From the commencement of the Premiers' Conference to the submission of the agreement by the Prime Minister to this Parliament, there has been a series of political machinations. It has been an attempt to save, at all cost, the skin of a party which was created out of the
                    <inline font-style="italic">debris</inline>
                    of a number of parties. It has been an attempt to solidify that
                    <inline font-style="italic">debris</inline>
                    into a form which would be presentable to the people at the elections. That is, I think, a fair definition of the situation. It is offered without prejudice. It is based upon the evidence of political procedure and political organization, since the inception of this Parliament nearly nine years ago. The component parts of the present united party who are seeking to establish this financial agreement without the alteration of a comma or the crossing of at were in the greatest political antagonism for a number of years. Who would have dreamt twelve months ago of ever seeing Senators Millen and Best seated side by side at the Ministerial table? Those who have for years witnessed the very bitter political conflict between those two honorable senators and others whose names I may feel it necessary to mention, must be astounded to-day to find that practically out of nothing something was created which made it possible for Senators Millen and Best, and I might include
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline>
                    to sit together in brotherly harmony under the flag which has been painted presumably by the combination of the State Premiers and the representatives of the Commonwealth. I do not want to enter very largely into the question of the origin of this agreement. It is enough for us to know that it was hatched under very dark, degrading circumstances. It was hatched under circumstances of which I venture to say even its strongest advocates are not prepared to de- clare that they feel proud. It was hatched under circumstances which were dark and dreary.

                            <para>- "Undoubtedly the honorable senator keenly feels the sting of my assertion. It has penetrated to his very soul. I believe that this is the first occasion on which he has been able to realize the position in which he is placed. In this debate there has- been no opposition offered to a good many features of the agreement. I think that on the "whole we may fairly congratulate ourselves upon being unanimous regarding one or two principles of the Bill. In the case of some Bills it is absolutely impossible to obtain unanimity regarding almost any principle involved therein ; but in the case of the present Bill. that cannot be said. For a few days I have listened very carefully to the discussion. I have not heard a single honorable senator oppose the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> method of distributing the Customs and Excise revenue, and therefore I think it is fair to say that on one principle involved in the Bill the Senate is unanimous. Nor have  1  heard a single senator oppose the payment of 25s. a head to the States. In fact, I think that I heard one of the strongest de-claimers of some provisions of the Bill assert that if it were really necessary for the time being that the States should receive more than that amount per head he would be quite prepared to vote accordingly. I believe that some honorable senators on the other side are conscientious in their support of the measure. I suspect that they believe that it is a right and becoming, one for the Senate to pass. There are others who accuse honorable senators on this side of the chamber of being opposed to the measure simply because they belong to a certain political party. I am suspicious of the sincerity of those who make that accusation. </para>

I am, however, doubtful as to whether, in regard to this measure, he has given expression to the best elements of his judgment. I am not opposing the Bill because of the proposed 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment to the States. I have no desire to shut off the contributions which the Commonwealth makes to the States. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> last night, though supporting the Bill, supplied one of the most cogent reasons for opposing its principal provisions. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was speaking, he said that he was prepared to limit the new arrangement to a term of years, and he also said that he would not necessarily limit the contribution to 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> His great point was that he was not prepared to cast a vote that would give away the control that this Parliament possesses over the finances, the management of which has been intrusted to us by the people. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may have had some« practice in trickstering. I have not. If a man says to me, " I intrust you with certain powers on my behalf," and I accept that trust, I am bound to discharge my duty until the man demands the return of it from me. Can any honorable senator say that the people of Australia have made such a demand with reference to the trust given to us? No one except the six Premiers, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, the Minister of Defence, and the Treasurer - nine persons in all - has demanded the surrender of our trust. </para>

                            <para>- These gentlemen may represent the people in certain capacities, but I venture to say that they do not represent the people with reference to this question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> in replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> made this significant declaration. He said, in effect : " Whilst I support the Bill, I am also fully seized of the belief that inside of three Parliaments from now the arrangement inserted in the Constitution will have to come out of it again." What are we to understand concerning the mental condition of a man who says, " I am prepared to agree to a proposition in perpetuity," whilst in the same breath he says, " I know that in doing so I am committing a great blunder, and doing a thing that cannot last for more than nine years " ? Surely it is fair to say that no real political acumen is displayed by one who takes up a position of that kind. I oppose the making of an agreement in perpetuity, because I am convinced that this Parliament has been intrusted with constitutional power to handle the finances of Australia as it may think best. </para>

                            <para>- I think Parliament should provide by making a payment of 25s. per head to the States, but I have no sympathy with those who would go to the people and say : " You gave us a power which is too weighty for our shoulders, too mighty for us to handle, and too great a responsibility for us to sustain. Therefore, we hand it back to you." Were I to give a vote in favour of such a proposal, I should feel, when I faced the electors again, that I was one of the meanest men in the Commonwealth, and deserved to be politically wiped out, because I had not had the courage to uphold the powers intrusted to me.' A man who is afraid to bear responsibility is not worthy of 'being a representative of the people, and ought to be discredited by them. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps there is only one other form of despotism which can be compared to it - that of Free Trade, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is the advocate, and which would leave Australia a barren waste, or would make it a great big hunting ground for the importing classes in the Commonwealth and the exporters who live elsewhere. There is only one other point in connexion with this matter to which I wish to refer, because I recognise that the numbers are up. Indeed, my only reason for occupying the time of the Senate at all on this question is that I believe it to be of so much importance that every member of the Senate who has an opinion upon this financial agreement should express it fearlessly and publicly. The embodiment of the agreement in the Constitution for all time must have the effect of changing the fiscal policy adopted bv Australia. Last night we listened to one of the champions of Protection. </para>

                            <para>- It would perhaps be a more accurate description of the honorable senator He set aside the suggestion that the observance of this agreement for all time would be an obstacle to the establishment and continuance of a Protective policy in the Commonwealth. But the honorable senator did so only in words, and in a very few words at that. The honorable senator did net attempt to suggest any means other than the imposition of a revenue Tariff to make good the inevitable <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> reduction of revenue from Customs and Excise when the population of the Commonwealth had been considerably increased. I am satisfied that the fiscal policy which Australia has affirmed is endangered by the combination of the elements of which I have spoken. I see two representatives of those elements before me - two distinct types of politicians. We have in this Senate, sitting side by side, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the one a life-long advocate of sound Protection, the other, a rabid single taxer, when I knew him first, and now a Free Trader. These honorable senators represent two distinct types of politicians who have met together in support of the proposal. They have taken with them <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> I do not know what they have done with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> because no one has ever known what policy that honorable senator believes in. We know the politics which the other three senators I have mentioned have professed. </para>

                            <para>- My recollection of events is not so dim that I do not know precisely what I am saying. In my opinion the policy of Protection, and, indeed, the policy of honour, have been sacrificed in this attempt to "meet the political exigencies of the party opposite. Now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has entered the chamber, I shall repeat what I said during his absence. If the honorable senator intends to take the logical stand which a man ought to take on a question of such vast importance he should not forget what he said last night. No member of the Senate has more strongly condemned the proposed provision for the embodiment of this agreement in the Constitution for all time. The honorable senator said that he was satisfied that whilst this Bill provided for a return to the States of 25s-. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for all time inside the duration of three Parliaments, that provision would require to be altered. </para>

                        <para>. - I feel that, on a matter of so much importance, it is the duty of every member of the Senate to give his reasons for the vote he intends to cast. I recognise that by this time there is very little new to be said on this subject, although there may be a good deal to be said that is true. After a number of honorable senators have spoken upon a question which, like that now before the Senate, is by no means a new question, it is difficult to say anything of interest. But I have a duty to perform in this matter. I am often reminded that I am a member of the States House, and that the interests of the State I represent are in my hands as one of its representatives. The Federal Parliament has within the last few months very radically altered its tone. It will be admitted that for over eight years the tone of this Parliament was decidedly a national one, but those who in time to come will have the duty cast upon them of writing its history will have to admit that quite a different tone has been expressed in recent legislation. They will have to admit that this Federal Parliament has now fallen upon evil days, and takes by no means the stand which it has taken in years past. Any one who watches events in the Commonwealth must recognise that a process of reaction has set in, though it is true that it may indirectly advance Democratic principles at a later stage. We see a so-called Liberal party for the time being swallowed up by the most Conservative elements in our community. Although this is a young country, there are to be found in our community tendencies as conservative and reactionary as any which are. evidenced in older countries of the world. They have been displayed in this Parliament by various persons who, similar to those which are adopted in other Democratic countries? Are we to continue the policy of taxing the poorer sections of the community, and allowing the rich to escape? That is the kernel of the whole question as it presents itself to me. Consequently, in subscribing to this agreement the reactionaries are laying a foundation upon which they must build so far as class interests are concerned. They know that if they are able to embody in our Constitution the principle of indirect taxation many articles which have hitherto escaped taxation will be taxed in the future. Thus, they will be able to tax the poorer sections of the community, whilst permitting the rich to escape. It is the duty of the Labour party to point the people of this country to the character of the pro- . posed operations of these reactionaries. A year or more ago the Labour party held a Conference in Brisbane for the purpose of framing a policy for the Federal Labour party. At that gathering a financial scheme was propounded, with which I confess that I am more pleased the more I examine it. I feel confident that its framers had only the best objects in view. I was present at the Conference in question, and I am able to say that party considerations were entirely excluded from the discussion of this important matter. We had only one object in view, namely, to remove the misrepresentation which had been consistently hurled against us. It had repeatedly been asserted that the Labour party knew nothing whatever of finance, and that if they did, they had not the courage to place a financial policy before the country. Now we all recognise that until  political parties assume the responsibilities of government they are accustomed to fight shy of propounding .a financial policy. But if there is any party which has ignored that practice it is the Labour party. At the Brisbane Conference it undertook to lay its proposals before the country. It was argued that it was our duty to be perfectly candid with the people and to embody our views in a platform. Accordingly the Brisbane financial scheme was formulated. It is rather strange that many of our political opponents, who have . undertaken to criticise the scheme adopted at that gathering, now pretend to understand the meaning which the delegates had In view much better than did the delegates themselves". They go to the length of flatly contradicting those who actually "took part in its deliberations. Instead of crediting us with a knowledge of what we did and intended to do, they say that we did quite the opposite thing. Whether they believe their own statements I cannot say. But certainly the delegates at that Conference understood perfectly well what they were doing. They all recognised that it was utterly impossible to devise a scheme for the adjustment of the financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth, which would last for all time. All that they could reasonably hope to do was to affirm general principles, and to allow time and circumstances to operate in respect of those principles. In the first place they laid it down that a <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> amount should' be annually returned by the Commonwealth to the States. That was a principle which was radically different from any which hari been embodied in the schemes which had been submitted at thePremiers' Conferences. Honorable senators will doubtless recollect that at those gatherings new schemes were invariably submitted. I do not say that the Premiers were inconsistent in adopting that attitude. They were doubtless obliged by the fluctuations in our Customs and Excise revenue to cut their coats according to their cloth. But the delegates to the Brisbane Labour Conference recognised those fluctuations just as much as did the State Premiers. They realized that it was impossible to stipulate that any arbitrary amount should be returned to the States. For that reason they refrained from declaring that the scheme elaborated at the gathering in question should be operative for all time. As a matter of fact, it would he presumption on the part of any Parliament or any generation to say that they would legislate on this matter for all time. But that is practically the attitude which is taken up by those who say that the proposals on which we came to an understanding at the Brisbane Conference were to last to all eternity. The delegates who were' appointed to draft a Constitution Bill ten or twelve years ago, had a much longer experience of politics than had the majority of the delegates to the Brisbane Labour Conference ; but even those politicians, with all their experience, were unable to lay down a financial policy for the Commonwealth for a longer period than ten years. In view of the changing effects of our Tariff, and the possibility of changes being introduced into our fiscal system, we should be foolish if we departed from, the sound -policy laid down at the Brisbane Labour Conference. I am quite confident that no definite period was mentioned during its proceedings. It was quite another idea which we had in our  minds. The Federation was started with a great deal of doubt as to whether the delegates to the Federal Convention had acted wisely in framing the financial provisions as they did. No provision was criticised so much as was the so-called Braddon clause. It started its career with the appellation of the Braddon " blot," but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and other members of the Government, together with several other honorable members, have lived long enough to change their opinions, and to now refer to that provision as the Braddon " blessing." Of course, they may have had very good reasons for altering their opinion; and I do not say that they had not. But surely all the circumstances point to one fact, and that is that we cannot afford to be dogmatic on a matter which is so liable to change as is that of the Customs and Excise revenue. As the scheme of the Brisbane Labour  Conference has not yet been placed before the Senate, except in a general way, I propose to quote from a leading Labour newspaper, one of the clearest expositions of that scheme which I have yet seen. I feel sure that the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker's</inline> exposition of our scheme will be more intelligible to the readers of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> than would any account which I could possibly give.

                    <para>The truth is that the Fusion Caucus, at the instigation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston,</inline> boldly appropriated the Labour scheme, and sooled their press dogs on to lie about it in order that they might impose it upon the public as their own. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is undoubtedly the clearest account which I have yet read of the financial scheme of the Brisbane Labour Conference. Twenty-five shillings per head may be a very fair amount to return to the States for this year, and for as many years as  we can see into the future; but in these matters,' we really cannot see very far ahead. All that we have ever attempted to do has been merely to make estimates for the coming year. That has been done at a great expenditure of labour by the officials at the Treasury. With the best statistics and data which could possibly be secured, all that they have ever yet been able to do has .been to present a forecast for one year, and very often the actual returns showed that the estimates were very much out, one way or the other. We cannot, therefore, afford to be too dogmatic or presumptuous in estimating the amount to be returned to the States. So far as we can judge at present, we think that  25s. <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> is a very fair amount to fix ; -but we have to consider the possibility of the amount having to be altered, and the effect of such an alteration upon the States. I have been so often reminded that the Senate is the States' House, that I am never likely to forget that I have to look after State interests. I am told that I was sent here as a State- representative, and, viewing the matter from that stand-point, let me point out what may happen to Western Australia. At present, the  25s.  per head, with the ad,ditional sum which is provided, is, I think, a very fair amount to return to the State. But with another gold rush such as occurred some years ago, the people would be contributing to the Customs and Excise revenue, not <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> or  ^3,  but perhaps <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> or £8 per head. In the past, the people of Western Australia have _ paid that amount per head ; and I know sufficient of the mining possibilities of that State to realize that it is quite possible that the conditions which prevailed then may be repeated in the future. In no other part of Australia are there such great possibilities of mining development as there are in Western Australia, so far as surface indications point. I speak as an old miner who has travelled the State and who knows its mining history fairly well. There is nothing very wonderful in imagining that we may have in Western Australia at any time as great a rush as we had twelve or fifteen years ago. The possibilities are so great that he would be a presumptuous person indeed who would say that as great mining discoveries will not be made in the future as have been made in the past. Any morning we may wake up to see it announced in the press that another field equal to the Coolgardie has been discovered. Another great development of mining in Western Australia would cause the Customs and Excise revenue of that State to rise to enormous proportions. If that should happen, dissatisfaction amongst the people of Western Australia would be no name for the position that would be created. How, in face of these possibilities", can we presume to legislate for all time? Does any one suppose that if the people of Western Australia were paying through Customs and Excise <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> or  ^7  per head of the population, they would be satisfied to receive only  25s.  per head from the Commonwealth? Certainly not, and I for one scout the idea that any State in the Commonwealth would be satisfied to allow the "other States to benefit from such an enormous sum of money paid by them whilst receiving so little back. The whole principle is wrong. Such an amount of dissatisfaction would be created that revolution would break out. A few years ago we had resolutions tabled, and even carried, in the Western Australian Parliament, expressing dissatisfaction with Commonwealth policy. Not only should we have resolutions of dissatisfaction passed under the conditions which I have described, but we should have the people shouldering their guns, and all the rest of it. Some time ago our political opponents were no more in favour of making the proposed alteration of the Constitution than we are to-day. If we look through the pages of the reports of past Premiers' Conferences, we shall find sufficient proof of that statement. It will be found that the policy laid down by our present opponents never included the suggestion that the Constitution should be altered, and that the power now vested in the Commonwealth Parliament should be taken away from it. At that time there was no stronger champion of the rights of this Parliament than the gentleman who now occupies the position of Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. It would be taking up too much time to quote more than a few passages, but I will certainly quote sufficient to prove what I have said. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who was with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest at the Brisbane Conference in  1907,  will no doubt recognise some of the statements, and will remember the circumstances in which they were made. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John,</inline> as reported on page  52  of the report, said - </para>

                        <para>The present action of the Commonwealth Government in trying to make an amicable arrangement suitable to all parties with the States does not warrant any distrust of it as if  it  is  trying  to get the last farthing, or trying to get everything for itself and to give nothing to the Slates. There is another reason even stronger than the reasons I have given, and that is that it would be impossible, I think - absolutely impossible - to get the Federal Parliament to agree to it. They would never agree to give away the principle embodied in the Constitution - namely, the supremacy of Parliament in regard to finance after ten years.  Could there be anything more decisive than those words? Could there be anything more sweeping and more resolute than the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest a few years ago? Let us hear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest again -  lt is necessary that the Federal Parliament should have this power - not necessary that it should use it. I do not think it is likely to be used ; but it is necessary to have the power, seeing that we propose, in order to give financial security and in the presence of the States - to cut ourselves adrift for ten years ahead from the financial position which we occupy under the Constitution. </para>

It may be that they will work so well and give so much satisfaction that they will go on for an indefinite period. If, on the other hand, they are found irksome, if they are found not to meet the requirements of the States - well, at the end of ten years they can be brought to an end. I can only say that, the more I have looked at these proposals, the more moderate, the more reasonable, and - I will not use the word "generous" - the more liberal they seem to me. I hope that when you consider the matter you will not forget the position under the Constitution and the difficulties which surround the Federal Government in dealing with matters of this sort - how difficult it is for any Government to go to a Parliament and ask that Parliament to give up a power that is given it under the Constitution. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is an unblushing admission, which  1  feel- is humiliating to Australian politics. It is plainly put forward as a plea in favour of the financial agreement that it will enable the Fusion party to hold their seats at the coming election. I think I have shown that the Labour party put forward their Brisbane scheme not with the hope of making political capital out of it, but at a time when a general election was far off. Notwithstanding the declaration of our political opponents that we knew nothing about finance we were not only eminently successful in framing a scheme in the best interests of the people of Australia, but were capable of showing the way to some df the so-called financial experts of this country. Had some of the members of pur party possessed the experience and opportunities which these experts have had we might bulge as large in the public eye as financiers as they do. At all events, we were bold enough to strike out for ourselves and devise a scheme which the whole of the States have since accepted. Our political opponents have adopted it holus-bolus. Indeed, they have gone one better, and have said, " This scheme is not only good for to-day, but for all time." When such high compliments have been paid to our scheme, it is unnecessary to elaborate the point further. Before I sit down, however, I should like to say a word with reference to the party aspect of this question. So far as I am acquainted with what has been said in the course of this debate, that has not been touched upon. I refer to the attitude taken up by the Labour party 'in the various States. The secret Conference of Premiers was quite unlike previous Conferences, inasmuch as it was attended by representatives of only one political party in Australia. The Leader of the Labour party in Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bath,</inline> attended the Conference held in Brisbane, and, I am pleased to say, took up there a non-party attitude. We naturally expected that a gathering of the kind would be free from any party complexion ; but, strange to say, instead of the Leaders of the Oppositions in the various States being invited to attend the secret Conference held in Melbourne in August last, they were ignored, and invitations to attend that. Conference were given only to those who were considered safe - that is to say, to those who were of the same political complexion as the present Fusion Government. It is true that men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston</inline> and the present Minister of Defence were of a doubtful political character a few short years ago, but for the time being they were looked upon as safe from the Fusion stand-point. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bath</inline> referred to this matter in the State Parliament of Western Australia not long ago. In order to explain the position I may say that the Premier of Western Australia, to whom I give all credit for the attitude which he took up, recognised that this was not a party question, and invited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bath</inline> to accompany him to the Melbourne Conference, the idea in his mind being that Western Australia should be represented at that Conference by representatives of the two political parties in the State. However, in course of time an objection to this came from the Premier of New South Wales. This, in my opinion, was a piece of political impertinence on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade.</inline> The people of Western Australia, and not the Premier of another State, had the right to dictate who should represent them at the Conference. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> objected, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bath</inline> was informed later that his presence at the Conference to be held in Melbourne would be embarrassing. I have not the slightest doubt that a representative of Labour would be very much out of place at a Star Chamber gathering of the kind, and that his presence would be very embarrassing to the other gentlemen present. In the circumstances, I was not surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bath</inline> should be given to understand that he was not wanted. I regard the holding of that secret Conference of Premiers as a humiliation to Australia. This is one of the freest countries on the face of God's earth. Every man and every "Woman in our community are as much upon an electoral equality as it is possible for the law to place them. I believe that every Australian has been humiliated by the holding of a secret Conference from which the press and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters were excluded. It is a degradation that such a thing should take place in a free country such as ours, with a free Parliament and free institutions which compare favorably with those of any other country in the world. This, I believe, was the first gathering of its kind in Australia, and I hope for the credit of the Commonwealth that it will be the last. lt marks a degrading page in our history that a Conference upon public affairs should be held in the dark. It was more like a gathering of criminals than a Conference of representatives of a free country. It was at this secret conclave and in this Star Chamber fashion that this Fusion bargain was struck, and" it was struck in order that some people might save their political skins in the coming electoral fight. What a miserable position to occupy ! What a miserable thing it is that for the sake of winning an election men should be capable of casting a stigma upon the conduct of public affairs in Australia!' It is the kind of thing one might look for in Turkey or in Russia, but not in a free country. In order to gain a few votes and the political influence of the State Premiers in the coming fight, members of the present Federal Government were prepared to eat their words and to go back on the principles they had been advocating for the settlement of this question. Honorable senators opposite laugh, but there is not much heartiness behind their laugh. There is no sincerity in it. </para>

                            <para>- All that the public have been permitted to know of the proceedings at the secret Premiers' Conference is that the Conference received a certain letter from the great leader of Free Trade, the man who won a prize for an essay on Free Trade or something of the sort some years , ago. We found that gentleman " sooling " on the Revenue Tariffists to seize their opportunity to fix the great burden of taxation on the shoulders of the poor people of Australia. He urged them to seize that opportunity because if they did not they might never have such an opportunity again. That is about all the information we have concerning what took place inside the closed doors of the chamber in which this secret Conference was held. So far as I am concerned I have finished with this matter. It is humiliating that this Parliament should be influenced by such a Conference, and that an agreement from such a source should be submitted here. I believe that the electors of Australia will punish those who have humiliated them by violating their free institutions in this way. Every right thinking man in the community will regard it as a stigma on the fair name of Australia that the Bill we are now considering should practically have been initiated at such a secret gathering. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with considerable amusement to the speeches of the last two honorable senators who have spoken. The impassioned tone they adopted shows how dreadfully they are exercised in their minds about the agreement embodied in this Bill, and the future that awaits them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie complained that a radical alteration has recently taken place in the tone of this Parliament. He has said that a process of reaction is going on, and that the Liberals have been swallowed up ' by the Conservatives. I should like to ask the honorable senator who is responsible for the present condition of affairs? Only a year or so ago we had a Liberal Government in power in the Commonwealth, supported for a considerable time by the Labour party. The members of the Labour party in another place voted against a. want of .confidence motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in that Government, and ten days later they jumped the position of the Government themselves. If honorable senators opposite are dissatisfied with the present condition of affairs, and with the Fusion Government, they need not look very far to discover who brought the Fusion Government into being. </para>

                            <para>- I am reminding honorable senators opposite that the fathers of the Fusion are the members of the Labour party in the Federal Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie also said that the bargain now before the Senate was at the back of the Fusion; but the honorable senator cannot show that when the Fusion party was formed this bargain had been discussed, or had even been thought of. The honorable senator told us that in spite of every other party the Labour party have secured a White Australia, absorbing, as honorable senators opposite always do, the credit for everything good, even to the Ten Commandants. I wish to take exception to one or two statements in which the honorable senator dogmatised very strongly. One is that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> arrangement was never mentioned before the holding of the Labour Conference in Brisbane a year or two ago. He said that that Conference presented a brand new scheme which had never been thought of before, and that their scheme had practically been filched by the Fusion Government. The statement that a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> arrangement was never mentioned before the holding of the Brisbane Labour Conference is absolutely wrong. It was mentioned in 1901 at the Conference held in either Sydney or Melbourne. It has been advocated since 1901 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Johnstone,</inline> the Statistician of Tasmania, As a matter of fact, it was seriously considered by a sub-Committee of the Federal1 Convention, prior to the adoption of the draft 'Constitution Bill. So that the honorable senator's statement, that it is absolutely new, utterly fails. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie also declared that the proposal to insert in our Constitution any arrangement which might be arrived at in substitution for the Braddon section had never previously been mentioned. Again, his. statement is absolutely wrong. It was mentioned at the- Hobart Conference of Premiers in 1905. One of the resolutions adopted, by that gathering reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">This quotation shows that the Premiers then anticipated that whatever was substituted for. the Braddon section should be embodied in the Constitution. In: discussing the proposed extension of the Braddon section, an agreement was arrived at under which all necessary alterations were to be made in the Constitution. So- that the proposal to embody an agreement in the Constitution is not a. new one, but has been discussed for years. The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> regarding the Fusion party I pass without notice. They are simply the explosions of disappointed office-hunters - of men who have been hurled out of office for the good of the country - and we may accept  hem for what they are worth. . The whole of the opposition to the proposed agreement is not based upon the agreement itself, but upon an intense dislike of the Fusion Government. As a. matter of fact., every honorable senator who has addressed himself to this Bill has accepted the agreement. But honorable senators opposite have opposed the proposal that it should be embodied in the Constitution. We were also reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hender.derson</inline> of the disgraceful exhibition which had taken place in connexion with this matter. He said that certain lines - of conduct had left a stain of -degradation upon the Fusion party. When future readers of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> search the records of this session to ascertai'n where the stain of degradation rests, they will not have far to look, but it will not be on the Fusion party that the strain of degradation will rest. We have only to recollect the attempts which were made in another place to prevent the transaction of business, in order to locate where the degradation lies. </para>

When we listen to the criticism to which this agreement has been subjected by members of the Labour party, we must recollect the circumstances of the past six or eight months, and discount that criticism accordingly. I say that that criticism is discounted in the country. The country knows exactly the position of affairs, and the general public know exactly what appraisement to put upon all this loud talk about degradation. They regard it only as so much nonsense. Had the Labour Government remained in office, and been afforded an opportunity of meeting the State Premiers, and of subscribing to the agreement which is now under consideration, they would have jumped at it. </para>

                                took up an attitude of slavish servility to the State Premiers - an attitude which  H-as  an absolute burlesque of statesmanship. One has only to read the report of the proceedings of the Conference to realize that. It has been said that the Senate is the guardian of State rights. It is true that it is not merely a second Chamber or a House of review. But honorable, senators have also to guard the rights of the States as separate entities under the Constitution. To insure that, the States are equally represented in this Chamber. They have a parity of representation .here so that we may be in a position to resist unjust attacks on the States, and to conserve the rights which belong to- them. But my honorable friends opposite absolutely fail in their duty in that connexion. No man who signs the Labour pledge can ever be a true representative of a State in this Chamber, because he has to put his party above his State. The interests of his State must always be subservient tq those of his party.

                            <para>- To keep the Commonwealth and the States apart, and to keep other parties in this Parliament" apart, is the object of the Labour party. They can then score upon every occasion, as they did for a considerable period. They remind me of the animals in the fable which, whilst other animals were fighting, ran away with the bones. This is the most important measure which could be submitted for our consideration. It affects the future interests of the States and of the Commonwealth in a way that no other measure could do. The agreement provides first for an investigation into the question of the transfer of the State debts. We have been asked why the Commonwealth does not take over those debts confidently with entering into this agreement. But I would point out that it is impossible to adopt that course, because simultaneously with taking over the State debts we must deal with the question of the transferred properties. The agreement recites that after the 1 st July next the Commonwealth shall annually return to the States  35s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in lieu of the present arrangement, and that a special concession, beginning with  £250,000,  shall be made to Western Australia on account of her peculiar Tariff circumstances. It amazes me to find the representatives of Western Australia opposing an agreement which contains such a provision. If the Bill be defeated they will never obtain from me a vote in favour of similar treatment being accorded to their State again. ' Tasmania is just as hardly pinched financially as is Western Australia, and has not the resources and territory of the latter upon which to fall bark </para>

                            <para>- That is quite a gratuitous impertinence. This concession to Western Australia means that in twenty-five years that State will receive  £3,250,000  more than the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance. Yet its representatives are prepared to forego that consideration. The final clause of the Bill provides that the proposed agreement shall be submitted by referendum to the people. No objection has been urged against an inquiry being conducted into the question of the transfer of the State debts, or to the annual return of  25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States, or to the granting of a gratuity to Western Australia. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has raised an objection to the granting of special treatment to that State upon the ground of privilege. But that idea has been expressly repudiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and consequently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> stands almost alone in his contention. The latter's statement that the agreement involves the humiliation of this Parliament I regard as so much idle nonsense. We are dealing with one people who are our masters. We have to deal with their funds, and the allocation of those funds is in question at the present time. Is it not fair to say to them, " We have arranged how that allocation shall be made, and we ask you to say whether or not you approve of our scheme " ? In doing that we do not contravene the provisions of section 87 of the Constitution. This Parliament merely says, " We will not only decide what ought to be done in this matter, but we will ask the electors to approve' of it." In this connexion the fact must be recalled that the Commonwealth Government were not responsible for the holding of the Premiers' Conference. They attended that gathering as other Federal Ministers have attended similar gatherings during the past nine years. But the Conference was called bv the States, and the Commonwealth Government would have been lacking in courtesy if its representatives had not attended &gt;t in response to the request of the Premiers. Of course, it has been said that the Premiers should not have interfered in this matter - that the Senate is the guardian of State rights. But what would the people have thought if they had not done so? Seeing that next year the Braddon section will expire, that a general election, the result of which nobody can foresee, is looming ahead, it is evident that if an adjustment of the financial relations of the States and Commonwealth be not arrived at this session, it is improbable that a settlement of the question will be effected next year. Thus the State Premiers would have found themselves at the end of  1910  utterly helpless, and at the mercy of whatever chance majority there might be in this Parliament. So that the State Premiers, instead of being blamed for the action which they took, are worthy of all praise. Had they not acted as they did, they would have been guilty of a gross dereliction of duty and neglect of the interests of their constituents </para>

                            <para>- The State Premiers struck the psychological moment ; they came expecting to get more ; but made a very good bargain. The way in which some honorable senators speak of the States is very amusing. They speak as if the States were the creation of the Commonwealth, instead of <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> It should be remembered that, apart from the thirty-nine questions which the people empowered this Parliament to deal with, there is an enormous area of interests and industries left for the States to deal with. The ambit of the States is far wider than is that of the Commonwealth. The immediate development of Australia depends more Upon the States than it does upon the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was organized, not so much to attend to internal matters, as to deal with external matters with which the States, when divided, could not deal. </para>

                            <para>- The Federation is a partnership, each partner being dominant in its OWn sphere; but not trespassing on the sphere of the others. There is a large area of the functions of government with which the States have to do, and the development of the country lies as much with the States as it does with the Commonwealth. The time was, as I said, just now, critical ; and had not the Premiers taken the action which they did, they would have been brought to book by their own Parliaments and their own people whenever they went to the country, if any mishap had occurred to the finances. The settlement of this question before next year was a matter of life and death to the States. It was a question of their solvency or their insolvency. If there is any justification required for what they did, it is only necessary to cite those who said here, " Why should. we give the States any of this money ? It is quite within the province of the Commonwealth to take the money, and it should take it and use it." </para>

                            <para>- I shall tell the honorable senator about that by-and-by. The State Premiers were alarmed at the language which was used in the Senate. They were afraid, as has been said, of financial strangulation. Since 1901, they have been trying to obtain a settlement of the financial question. They have not delayed at all, but have made an appeal year after year. They have held Conferences, they have met the statesmen of the Commonwealth time after time, and tried to secure a settlement. Was it any 'wonder that they did their best towards getting a settlement this year? A good deal has been said about the Brisbane Labour Conference, and credit has been taken for all that has been done there. But as I have already shown, the question of an agreement for a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment has been talked of for the last eight years, and was not first mentioned, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said, at the Labour Conference. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Convention appointed a Committee, and that was one of the phases of the financial question which were discussed. The question of putting an agreement into the Constitution, which we are now told is absolutely new, and has been sprung upon the people, was discussed and approved at the Conference held at Hobart in 1905. The two principles under consideration, therefore, are not new in any way. In spite of what may be said by those who attended the Labour Conference at Brisbane, I say that the report of the proceedings, where it refers to a fixed payment of 25s. per head, means a payment which would be permanent. It can only be read in that way, because a payment which would be made from year to year, as was stated inferentially to-day, would have been simply laughed at by the States if offered. They wanted to get a guarantee of permanency. </para>

                            <para>- It is very astonishing how the Federal Labour party and the Labour party in New South Wales and other States differ on this financial agreement. We find that it is indorsed by the Labour party in New South Wales; I believe almost unanimously. They say that the scheme is framed as nearly as possible on the lines of the scheme of the Brisbane Labour Conference, and give their adhesion to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> sneeringly said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> was a mere gramaphone for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade. Mr. Holman</inline> is the one man in the Labour party who was able to master the Brisbane scheme. He was the one man to put it into shape and explain it to the Labour Conference. </para>

People are quick to notice anything that is likely to hurt them, and if this agreement had been fraught with all the dangers which honorable senators on the other side have suggested we should have had an uprising against its acceptance, not only in Victoria, but in the other States. There is another organ which is quick to see the trend of public opinion, and that is the press. Apart from one or two journals, have not the newspapers throughout Australia ratified the agreement? If they were not sure that it was a good agreement, if they thought that their States would be injured, would we not have had strong protests backing up the contentions of honorable senators on the other side? </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that matter a little later. When the Federation was established at the beginning of the century it was complete, except in one particular. For days, weeks, and months, the framers of the Constitution wrestled with the problem of finance, but being unable to come to a settlement they adopted section 87, known as the Braddon " blot," as. a refuge of despair. They said " We cannot settle this question; we cannot anticipate the requirements of the Commonwealth, in the future; we shall take this provision for ten years, and then see what experience may suggest." The adoption of this financial agreement will complete the Federation. It will put the crown on the Federal body, and on the compact between the Federating parties. It will fill the gap which was left open by the Convention. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill before the Senate involves two questions; first the division of the Customs and Excise revenue, and second the taking over of the State debts. Australia has to develop on two lines; that is, on Federal and State lines, and we must give fair play to both the Commonwealth and the States. We have no right to take from the States anything to which they are entitled, nor have they a right to ask for more than we are able to give. We say, " This agreement represents the best we can do for you at present ; we can spare  25s.  a head to you ; we are prepared to accept the agreement and leave it to the people to say whether it shall be disturbed or altered at any time." No doubt the enormous responsibilities which are coming upon the Commonwealth, such as the transfer of the Northern Territory, the construction of transcontinental railways, and other matters, will necessitate a loan policy. We cannot expect to saddle the present generation with the cost of works which are intended for future generations ; but any borrowing must be entered upon very cautiously, and then only to such an amount as is necessary for reproductive works. What does the treating of the States in this liberal way mean ? It means that when we take over the State debts, as must bc done, there will only need to be one borrower, and the States will probably be able to get along with the payment from the Commonwealth together with some reasonable direct taxation, without having to go into the loan market. At any rate, if they did have to borrow they could borrow what they required in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The States can get local loans if necessary. When the State debts are taken over and the question of the transferred properties is settled and we know exactly how we stand, there should be absolutely sound finance in both the Commonwealth and the States, and with ordinary prudence and common sense it should never be departed from. The manner in which the revenue is distributed will make Governments careful. They will not be anxious to embark upon hair-brained schemes or incur unreasonable expenditure. It will also have the effect of stopping unreasonable demands from people; it will mean an honest distribution of the charges, and cause not only the States but also the Commonwealth to practise economy with the taxpayers' money. The reference of this financial agreement to people will be a good thing in other ways. For instance, it will mean their financial education. I remember that when in the old days it was proposed to refer some matter to the people of "Victoria the then Premier asked, " What does a ploughman know about finance ?" I suppose that some persons would make that remark to-day. But the people are getting very shrewd ; they are getting politically educated, and the reference of this financial agreement will educate them on the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth. It will enable them to keep both bodies straighter in the future than they have ever been able to do in the past. The whole position will be sounder if the people ratify the agreement. I believe that both in the States and in the Commonwealth the electors will be more careful in choosing representatives. I believe they will be more careful to see that candidates know something about the financial position in order that mistakes may not be made. I believe that the agreement, if ratified, will ere long justify itself even to those who at present are opposing it not on its merits, but simply for party purposes. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will release the State Treasurers from the uncertainty which has hung over them for years.  K'o  State Treasurer can make up a Budget until he knows what the Commonwealth is going to give to him. lt will create a clearer division between State and Federal finance. lt will remove any conflict between the two governing powers, and bring about harmony by placing each State in a fairly sound position, and enabling State Ministers to know the amount which they will receive from Customs and Excise. lt will make for the more rapid development of Australia, both in regard to the influx of population, and the settlement of the country. It will remove a great source of uneasiness arising from financial difficulties. I believe that the agreement will be ratified by the people by an overwhelming majority. Since the Conference between the Premiers and Federal Ministers, we have had a general election in one of the States. The result was that the Premier and his Government were returned to power with a stronger majority than before. That was an indication of the approval with which the agreement is viewed by the elector. Of ;course, it does not suit the Labour party, lt means a triumph in Parliament, and a triumph in the constituencies for the Fusion Government. Probably, if I were a member of the Labour party, I should take exception to the agreement for party reasons, just as they are doing. They object- to it because they fear the future. It may mean political oblivion for some of them. We cannot help that. I think that the agreement will make for the good of Australia, and bring about a settlement of difficulties which were almost the despair of the framers ot the Constitution, and which have never yet been satisfactorily adjusted. It is said by some critics, that Protection is endangered bv this agreement. I look upon that as a mere bogy. One of the reasons why I favour the agreement is that it does not necessitate the 25s. per head being paid to the States out of Customs and Excise; we need not obtain the money from thai source unless we like. We can obtain ic from direct} taxation, or by any other method. The whole objection to the agreement on fiscal grounds is brought forward to cloud the issue, and to endeavour to score a point against the Government. I am convinced that Protection will not be endangered in any way. The Commonwealth has sovereign power in the matter of taxation ; and if, in time to come, it was found that the Commonwealth could not afford to pay the  25s.  per head--- </para>

                            <para>- It might conceivably happen in twenty-five years ; but if it should happen, it will be perfectly -easy for the Commonwealth Government to go to the people and say, "Weshall either have to reduce this amount, or else we shall have to raise the money in some other way." The people will then decide, just as they will decide whether they will adopt this agreement or not when the matter is submitted to them. The Commonwealth will be free to adopt any Tariff that it chooses. It can impose duties as high as it likes on articles produced in Australia without having any regard to the agreement. The money will have to come out of the same pockets. The matter affects the same people in Commonwealth and States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> said that by passing this agreement, we shall be entering upon the beginning of strife. I do not believe that. I believe that we shall be entering upon an era of peace between the Commonwealth and the States. Just as the Braddon section as it was framed by the Convention, was submitted to the people after it had been revised by a Conference of Premiers, so the people have a right to be consulted now with regard to the modification of that section, at the end of the ten-year period. The people have a right to determine whether or not the amended condition shall be put into the Constitution and remain there, or whether the new arrangement shall be open to be varied from time to time as Parliament mav decide. </para>

                        <para>.  - This matter has been discussed at considerable length, and it is remarkable to observe that no opponent of the proposed agreement dissents from the principle which it contains. Differences of opinion are concerned entirely with matters of detail. I welcome the Bill, and intend to vote for it as it stands. I believe that in regard to all legislative matters we should try to meet the wishes of the people, and I am convinced that this agreement is in accordance with the wishes of the people of the whole Commonwealth, who will ratify the Act of this Parliament, and agree to the insertion of the new arrangement in the Constitution. No law passed by Parliament is not liable to be altered. It we find that the new scheme does not work it will have to be modified ; and I see no harm in obtaining consent to its modification from the same people who, in a few months, will be asked to determine the question. Many honorable senators seem to think that it is degrading to Parliament to submit this matter to the people. I cannot see any degradation in it. The people sent us here to represent them; and if we cannot unanimously agree on any particular proposal, I see no harm in referring the matter to the people, who are our masters. What possible degradation can there be to Parliament in allowing the people to decide ? I believe that the people will gladly accept this scheme, and that it will prove a blessing to the Commonwealth. Hitherto the States have not known how much money they would receive from the Commonwealth, and could not lay their plans for carrying out public works until such time as the Commonwealth Treasurer delivered his Budget statement. Under the present scheme the State Treasurers will know exactly the position they will be in. They will know what their income will be, and can shape their expenditure accordingly. I have seen the supporters of this Bill described as " State Righters." Well, I am proud of the title. I am by no means ashamed to stand up for the rights of the State which sent me here. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; I am at ali times prepared to do what is fair and right for the Commonwealth ; but I am not prepared to take away the just rights of the States for the benefit of the Commonwealth. Strong States will make a strong Commonwealth. If we arrive at a satisfactory agreement as to the finances, we shall remove altogether that hankering which I have heard expressed on the part of some people for getting back to the system of government that prevailed before the Commonwealth was established. The agreement will result in the country having more confidence in the Federal Parliament and the Commonwealth Government. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has remarked, the Government of my own State has appealed to the people since this agreement was arrived at. That Government has been returned by a large majority, indicating that the people of Queensland are solidly in favour of the agreement. I am confident that T shall be doing justice to my own State in supporting this Bill. Of course, I do not suppose that the most eloquent  speaker  on such a question could affect any votes. Honorable senators have made up their minds. I know that I have done so. A man who had not made up his mind on such a question would not be fit to sit here at all. There is no necessity, therefore, for long speeches. I welcome this Bill heartily, and hope that it will be passed through the Senate very soon, in order that it may be referred to the people early next year. </para>

                        <para>-- As the second-reading debate is about to close I wish to say a word or two with respect to the measure. Before I proceed to the Bill itself, however, I should like to observe that there is no honorable senator who more unfairly misrepresents his opponents and imparts greater bitterness into our debates than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> Consciously or unconsciously he made a statement that was absolutely incorrect in regard to the party of ( which I am a member. He said that we are bound bv our organizations, and that we are mainly responsible to them; that we have to obey their dictates, and that, in a measure, we do not represent the views of the constituencies which returned us. No honorable senator knows better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> however, that no man can occupy a seat in the Senate unless he has behind him a sufficient number of .electors to return him. It is to the voters who returned him that a member of this Senate is responsible. It is true that any one who comes forward as a Labour candidate gives his written pledge to the organization that he will if returned do all that he can inside and outside of the Parliament to advance the planks of the Labour platform. But it is on that platform that he seeks the suffrages of the electors. And if the electors by returning him approve of that platform, how can it be said that the interests of the Labour party are inimical to the interests of the electors? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has on more than one occasion reminded me that in March next a certain section of the community in Victoria will be after my political scalp, and that he will himself be one of the scalp hunters. </para>

                            <para>- I am not complaining of that ; but I say that the honorable senator owes his seat in this Chamber mainly to the support given him at the last Federal election by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> When the honorable senator tells us that the great metropolitan newspapers of Australia represent public opinion, I remind him that the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which is one of the great metropolitan newspapers of the Commonwealth, and which has the largest circulation of any newspaper published in this State, and so, according to the honorable senator, must represent the opinion of the people of Victoria, is opposed to the proposal to make this financial agreement binding upon the people of the Commonwealth for all time. That being so, according to the honorable senator's argument, the people of Victoria must also be opposed to it. I have listened with interest and with some pleasure to the speeches which have been delivered from both sides on this question ; but there was one with which I was particularly pleased, because it differed so much in tone from the majority of those which have been addressed to the Senate. I do not intend to disparage the members of the party with which I am associated when I say that I refer to the speech delivered by one of giant mind in this chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> It was the speech of a statesman. It was lofty in tone and lifted this question completely out of the ruck of party politics. </para>

                            <para>- That may be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser's</inline> opinion, but it is not mine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> pointed out that this Parliament is the dominant Parliament, and the National Parliament of Australia. It has been given power by the people to deal with certain questions, and undoubtedly that which we are now considering should be dealt with by this Parliament, and not in the roundabout way proposed by the Government. If it is not it should be dealt with in the ordinary way by the people at the general election. When honorable senators opposite told us to trust the people, I admit that I interjected. It tickled me to hear the expression of this new-born faith and trust in the people coming from men who for years have distrusted the people, and have withheld power from them. They have held the opinion that only a certain , section of the community should be entitled to vote for the Legislative 'Council in this State. </para>

                            <para>- That is one point which must be considered. Honorable senators opposite tell us that we should trust the people, but who are the people we are to trust? We say that the majority of the people should be trusted to express by their votes their opinions on this question at the next Federal elections. But honorable senators opposite do not propose that. They propose that it should be embodied in the Constitution if a majority of the people in a majority of the States approve of it. I point out that they will have practically no option but to do so. They will have to decide for 25s. per head of the population or for nothing. Naturally they will vote for that which will give them as nearly as possible what they desire. </para>

When honorable senators opposite talk of the question being treated as a non-party one, I am not unmindful of the fact that already announcements have appeared in the press that because certain honorable members in another place adopted an independent and manly attitude on this Bill, their political existence is threatened by the Fusion party. It is said that large funds are at present in existence, and will be made available to fight these gentlemen who at one time were supposed to belong to the Fusion party, but who broke away from it, exercised their own judgment, and voted in accordance with the dictates of their consciences on this measure.

That is not the kind of treatment to which some members of the Fusion party are being subjected at the present time. Honorable senators opposite speak of the Labour party as a bound and fettered party, but would this agreement have been carried in another place if some men had not sunk their individuality and suppressed their opinions, and if some, as the newspapers said, had not remained like dumb dogs, afraid to express any opinion ? </para>

I do not know where he got his information from. I am not so sure that the Bill will go through the Senate, at any rate in the form in which it was presented. There are fifteen honorable senators on this side alive and well and prepared to exercise a vote. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> they will number sixteen. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> last night pointed out that the Bill had good features and bad features, and that when it got into Committee he would endeavour to eliminate its bad features. When we reach the Committee stage the bad features of the measure may, despite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> prophecy, be eliminated, and it may be made a much better Bill because of the opposition of the Labour party, supported by two or three other honorable senators, than it was when it was presented. </para>

His  services are always requisitioned for these afternoon meetings of ladies. He flits hither and thither, but what influence he exercises or good he accomplishes time alone will determine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> expressed himself as a warm supporter of this Bill on many grounds, but I think the chief reason he gave for supporting it was that it would insure for all time to the State Treasurers a fixed sum per head of the population of their States, and would be the means of attracting population to the States. If that statement be true, is it not remarkable that since the Braddon section was embodied in the Constitution, the State Treasurers have never been impelled by a similar incentive to take action? If a return upon a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis will prompt the State Treasurers to bring immigrants to Australia, why did not the operation of the Braddon section induce them to bring immigrants here? They would have consumed all sorts of commodities. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator. There is sufficient land in Australia to support a population of  50,000,000  or  60,000,000.  But that land is extensively monopolized. Instead of an increasing population being permanently settled in the rural districts of Victoria, this State is year by year losing its rural population. </para>

                            <para>- If the adoption of the proposed agreement results in the attraction of a large population to the various States the Commonwealth will year by year have to return to the State Treasurers a larger sum, and consequently it will have less and less to meet its growing expenditure. How then will it obtain the necessary funds with which to finance national enterprises? I venture to say that those who are supporting this Bill hope to see a revenue Tariff enacted and a borrowing policy adopted to both of which proposals I am opposed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to occupy the attention of the Senate very long. First, because I recognise that this agreement has been discussed at . very great length, not only here, but in another House, and through the press. I also recognise that it has been brought forward at a time when, if we were to discuss it as fully as each of us would like to do, we nrght unduly prolong the session. For those reasons I intend to be as brief as I can. I agree with everybody who has stated here or elsewhere that nobody disputes the fact that, as between the Commonwealth and the States, not merely for the period of ten years which was laid down in the Braddon section, but for an indefinite period thereafter, there should be, as between States and Commonwealth, an allocation of the Customs and Excise revenue which would be equitable to both parties, considering their respective responsibilities with regard to the development of this country. I have noticed that from time to time reference has been made to the fact, based upon a statement which was some time ago prepared by the Statistician of Tasmania, that the Commonwealth responsibilities. were equivalent to, if memory serves me, 13 per cent, of the total responsibilities. I had occasion when a Minister of the Crown to point out the fallacy of such an observation, for this simple reason that at that time the estimate was made on the services of a particular year  -  a year when the Commonwealth had not assumed anything like the responsibilities which it has since assumed or is now assuming or about to assume. But so far as the general question of the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue is concerned, I do not think that there is a dissentient voice here or elsewhere as to the necessity of allocating it as between the Commonwealth and the States in a way which shall be considered equitable and just - proportioned to their respective responsibilities. It has to be remembered first of all that the Constitution in section 87 declares that for a period of ten years and thereafter until this Parliament otherwise provides three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue shall be given to the States, and the remainder used by the Commonwealth for its own purposes. I am well aware that it may be said that before section 87 was accepted the Constitution contained a provision which made such an allocation permanent. We are all agreed upon that. If the fact that the Constitution originally contained a perpetual provision of that character has any significance, and I do not consider it has any great significance on this question I would remind those who hold that belief that subsequently to the first referendum the people again accepted a Constitution with a time limitation on section  87  by a far greater majority than they had accepted the original draft. </para>

                            <para>- There was no more in the Constitution. I do not wish, as I said before,. tq labour my "argument or to occupy the time or attention of honorable senators at too great a length. But I do wish to point out that the first Constitution was only submitted to four States, and that the Braddon clause was a perpetual provision. In New South Wales  71,595  persons voted for the Bill, and  66,228  against it. In Victoria  100,520  persons voted for the Constitution and  22,099  against it. In South Australia  35,800  persons voted for the Constitution, and  17,320  against it. In Tasmania  11,797  persons voted for the Constitution, and  2,716  against it. The Constitution was, therefore, approved by  219,717  persons, and disapproved by  108,363,  leaving a majority of  111,349  in favour of a Constitution with a perpetual provision of this character binding the Commonwealth for all time.

                            <para>- I am not accepting the interjection of my honorable friend applauding my argument in this respect, in the sense that I think that they voted solely and simply on account of the alteration. . I have qualified any statement. I have already stated that I do not believe for a moment that any alteration in the attitude of the people was wholly influenced by the alteration of a single clause, but I do wish to point out to honorable senators, particularly to those who have said that there was a permanent provision in the .Constitution originally, that the Constitution was approved with that provision in it by four States. It has since been approved of by five States by overwhelming numbers, as compared with those who approved of it with a perpetual provision. I need hardly go any further on this point. I do not wish to weary the Senate. I can say that with regard to South Australia, Tasmania, and with regard to the general total, all that I have been quoting as to New South Wales and Victoria similarly applies. I need only, in summarizing, mention as an il lustra- tion that at the first "referendum 219,712 persons voted for the Constitution, and 108,363 against it, leaving a majority of 111,349 in favour of it. On the second occasion when Queensland voted, 377,988 persons voted for the Constitution and 141,386 against it, leaving a majority of 236,602 in favour - of it. In fact, a greater majority in point of numbers, than had voted for the Bill originally. In Queensland, it is but fair to say, 38,488 persons voted for the amended Bill, and 30,996 against it. </para>

We had been told throughout the Colonies of Australia - we were not then the Commonwealth - that the Braddon " blot " was a curse upon the Constitution. I never believed it. I do not believe it to this day. I am perfectly prepared to continue the Braddon section under a similar set of circumstances to those which existed when the Constitution was adopted. I am perfectly prepared to see the 87th section of the Constitution continued until the Commonwealth Parliament is prepared to do what it considers the right thing in accordance with the responsibilities and duties imposed upon it. </para>

                            <para>- But what is the position now ? For ten years practically this Parliament's powers in this regard lay dormant. The subject was left entirely to the States. What has been the history of those years? I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and through you every honorable senator, what has been the history of the Commonwealth in regard to the settlement of this all-important question? I sav that it is all-important, because I have always entertained the belief, without any disrespect to the founders of our Constitution, that when they were endeavouring to secure Federation for Australia, after repeated efforts they found that they were baffled in endeavouring to settle financial affairs upon a basis that would be fair to all ; and in the hope that the Federal Parliament would be animated by Federal ideas, and moved by Australian principles, they came to the conclusion that, when ten years had passed, this Parliament would be able to come to some equitable arrangement - equitable not only to the Union itself but to every one of the States. Consequently they handed on the responsibility' to posterity - they handed it on to this Parliament. Ten years have nearly gone by. What has happened ? There have been Premiers' Conferences from time to time. Need one speak about the character of those Conferences? I do not wish to use any language that may be regarded as a personal reflection upon any one; but I do think that those who have given consideration to the reports of those Conferences - to all except the last one, of which, of course, and unfortunately, there is no report - must be aware that the Premiers, year by year, from being - I do not wish to say truculent, but from assuming a position to command and to dominate this Commonwealth, came to realize, as time went on, that their power was passing ; and as they approached the period when they knew that the Braddon section would cease to operate as a provision of the Constitution, and that all power would be left in the hands of the Federal Parliament, which would be untrammelled, we suddenly found that with remarkable alacrity they assented to an agreement. </para>

In , the earlier Premiers' Conferences I always understood - I may have been mistaken - that Commonwealth Ministers attended, so to speak, without prejudice. That is to say, they did not recognise the Premiers Conferences as being assemblies held under the Constitution of the Commonwealth. They did not recognise them, as having any constitutional authority - as being bodies possessed of legislative, executive, or administrative power or responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- There, then, I say again, is the difference. How could there be a stronger difference? These gentlemen met together year after year and could come to no agreement. Eventually, however, they recognised that the termination of the Braddon section was approaching. A gentleman in another branch of the Legislature, who has had some association with the imposition of this limitation upon the Federal powers, wrote a letter to them and in effect said. " Time is in favour of your enemies, the Federal Parliament. ' ' Are we the enemies of the Premiers? Are we the enemies of the States of Australia? Yet, on the strength of this letter, these gentlemen consented to an agreement. Before that Conference took place it was understood that the Federal Government would be represented in it. It was understood that the Prime Minister would be present. He was present. I may have been mistaken - I do not think that I was - but I want to say here and now publicly - because I understand that statements which T have made elsewhere have given offence - that before that Conference took place&gt; so far as I was concerned, and so far as every member of the party in this Parliament with which I had been connected was concerned, we understood distinctly that no arrangement would ever be entered into on behalf of the Commonwealth that was not of a temporary character. I challenge any member of the party as well as the Prime Minister, to deny it. </para>

                            <para>- Have I not just said that I owe a duty, not only to my own State, but to the whole of Australia? My responsibilities are not to my own State alone. I have read most carefully the utterances upon this measure, particularly those delivered in another place. I have searched eagerly, hopefully, anxiously, but I regret to say, vainly, for any explanation of that change of attitude on the part of the Prime Minister. The only hint of an explanation that has been given so far as I know was contained in his very lucid speech which summed up all the arguments which have been used on the subject, and which is a veritable storehouse of resource for every one who wishes to argue or has argued in favour of the Bill. The explanation was. " I went into that Conference not thoroughly realizing what were the responsibilities of the State Treasurers. They met me, and they had never previously realized what were the Commonwealth's responsibilities." Of what use then have all these Conferences been ? Are we to believe that they were all "flim-flam?" Are we to believe that although Conferences were held in 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908 and 1909, it was only at the Conference of August, 1909, that for the first time since Federation the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States realized each other's responsibilities? I ask the people of Australia, Is that good enough? If that really be so, I can quite understand why a little more than twelve months ago we in this House, and our colleagues in another place, my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best, amongst others, though I cannot be sure as to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> were designated as brigands, pirates, and robbers, because we passed a Surplus Revenue Bill to meet Commonwealth requirements. I happened as a Minister of the Crown to be in one of the States where abuse of this character was levelled against us, not daily, but twice every day, because it appeared in the afternoon as well as in the morning newspapers. In common with other members of this Parliament who voted for the Surplus Revenue Bill, I was called a brigand and a pirate. Now I am invited to accept the assurance that the proceedings of all conferences prior to that of August, 1909, were only " flimflam," and that there was nothing genuine about them, at all. When one approaches one of the State Premiers or Treasurers for information on the subject, he is told, " We have got an agreement. Hush ; keep quiet. Pass it through ; it is all right." And if one asks, " How did you arrive at the agreement?" The answer is, "Oh, that does not matter." The responsibility of settling this matter has been left with this Parliament, and we are being invited by this Bill- to turn round and say to the gentlemen who have been calling us brigands, robbers, pirates, thieves, and everything else - </para>

                    <para class="block">Does any member of the Senate really believe that because of what took place at a Conference, the report of whose proceedings has never been presented to this Parliament or the country, and so far as I know will never be made public, he would be doing his duty in abdicating the trust committed to him by the people of Australia, and saying to them, " This is what you have to accept or reject - this or nothing?" I am aware that honorable senators have said that if we do not accept this Bill we shall be taking away from the people the right to vote upon the question.I deny that emphatically and absolutely. I say that the provision that is made in this Bill for submitting the question to the people is based upon the most specious argument, and is nothing but a delusion, a sham, and a snare. The people are not under this Bill asked to decide what they should be asked to decide. They are asked to decide something else altogether. </para>

                            <para>- I intend to give the Vice-President of the Executive Council an opportunity to say whether he will agree to put this question fairly to the people. As proposed in this Bill the question submitted would admit of only one answer, "Yes" or "No." It would be, "Are you in favour of this scheme - yes or no?" And if the people say "Yes" they will commit themselves to it without having been given the opportunity to say "Yes" or " No " to any alternative scheme, though there might be twenty or fifty alternative schemes proposed. But that is not the vital defect of the Bill. The vital defect is, first of all, that, as I have already pointed out, under section 87 of the Constitution, we in this Parliament are called upon at this period or a little later to make provision for the allocation of these revenues ; and without any mandate from the people, without any requests from them, so far as I know - and I do not believe that a petition on the subject has been filed in this Chamber or in another place - we are asked to turn to the people and say, " We resign our trust. We give it up to you. We do not feel confidence in ourselves. Will you have this or nothing?" </para>

                            <para>- It does not. It proposes the submission to the people of a question like that which I have already quoted : " Have you left off beating your mother-in-law - yes or no ?" It certainly does not propose a question so wide as those with which we were confronted in our old French exercises : " Have you seen my brother's hat?." to which the answer might be, " No, but I have seen the shoes of your mother-in-law's sister." Under the Bill the people would have to answer "Yes" or " No" to one solitary proposition submitted to them. </para>

                        <para>During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides - that leaves it entirely to us - of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure - and so on. I will support any member of the Senate who will propose that we shall go to the people with this question : " The ten years have nearly expired, when the power of allocating the revenue from Customs and Excise is left with the Commonwealth Parliament. Will you take back that power, or will you leave it with the Parliament?" But I shall not go to the people with this sham delusion and make-believe. I shall not ask them, " Will you take this agreement or nothing," and that is all they will be asked under this Bill. I believe in the referendum, but in an honest referendum, and not in a sham one, and a delusion. </para>

                            <para>- It is proposed to ask them to accept this or nothing. As a referendum the whole thing is a sham and a delusion. In order that I may make my position perfectly clear I wish to say that I am prepared to give the people of the Commonwealth the fullest opportunity of taking from this Parliament the powers which they have reposed in it under section 87 of our Constitution. But have they asked ' us to resign those powers and to abdicate our responsibilities? This is not a question of rights as between the Commonwealth Parliament and the people - it is a question of responsibilities. We are the trustees of the people. Yet we are asked to put to them a proposition which was framed in secrecy and mystery, and to become-what 7 Responsible legislators? No, but a simple conduit pipe between an irresponsible body and the people.' We are asked to sit back and accept their decision. If it be necessary to consult the electors upon a measure of this kind, scores of Bills which have occupied our attention should have been similarly dealt with. I candidly confess that my attitude to the provisions which are embodied in the proposed agreement is a secondary consideration. At the present time, and possibly for a long time to come, those provisions may be most advantageous both to the Commonwealth and the States,. But we have te remember that when this Parliament was created, when this Commonwealth was established, it was established for united Australian purposes. We have to recollect that under our Constitution the dominant responsibilities of government were imposed upon this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. We have to look after such an important matter as the defence of the Commonwealth. It is also in our province to deal wi.h immigration and emigration. Further, we have to consider the unpopulated territory of the Commonwealth, such as the Northern Territory. The islands of the Pacific, with which no single State could deal, are also within our future measure of responsibility. How are we to deal with these matters? Out of nothing? If the Commonwealth returns to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for all time, I am not sure that it will be able to meet its responsibilities without trespassing far too heavily upon the already over-burdened taxpayer of certain classes. </para>

                            <para>- No. If the honorable senator had paid me the courtesy of listening to me he would have heard me say that I do not quarrel very much with the details of the proposed agreement. For the present and the future, they may be most satisfactory to the Commonwealth and the States. If  1  had my own way, as a representative of Tasmania, I should require a larger sum to be returned to the States. But if we tie the Commonwealth down to return to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for all time, we have no guarantee that in the future we shall be able to meet our legitimate responsibilities. </para>

                            <para>- I am not concerned with any in-and-out business. Does the Minister of Trade and Customs desire to put the arrangement in our Constitution in order to take it out ?  His  is absolutely a novel argument. I have heard ,it stated that if we limit the agreement to ten, twelve, or fifteen years, it .will be a more hard-and-fast agreement than it would be if we inserted it in the Constitution. That is a most absurd method of reasoning. Why cannot we make an arrangement for the perpetuation of the Braddon section, or why cannot we do nothing at all till we have arrived at a definite agreement? If we do nothing until such an agreement has been made, section 87 will in the meantime automatically continue to operate.1s it not better to allow that Braddon section to operate until we have put this question to the electors : "Do you wish to adjust the financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth, or do you desire to leave the settlement of that question to the Commonwealth Parliament?" </para>

I do not propose to follow the honorable senator's method, otherwise I should only get it into far greater difficulties. He, as a Minister of that State, was afforded an opportunity to extricate it from its difficulties, but his efforts were crowned with signal failure. Why cannot we allow section 87 of the Constitution to continue to operate until we ask the electors the simple and straight question " Do you wish to alter section 87 yourselves, or do you desire the Commonwealth Parliament to alter it?" </para>

                            <para>- That does not matter to me. I believe that this Bill is being presented in its present form for party and political, and not for national, purposes. The only way in which the Senate can deal with the problems which are involved in it is by taking into consideration the fact that we have our responsibilities to discharge. Those responsibilities are imposed upon us. As self-respecting men we cannot evade them. We cannot shirk them nor can we, under the cover of a delusive and sham referendum transfer them to the people who under that referendum will not be entitled to give full expression of their opinions, but will only be able to say "yes" or "no" to the single proposition put before them. With us, on the other hand- </para>

                            <para>- This Parliament. On the other hand, it is left to us to discuss not only one, but half-a-dozen, twenty, thirty, or even forty propositions if we choose, and to adopt one or other of them without reference to the people. Yet we are asked to submit to the electors a single question, and we are told that if we do not agree to do so we shall be voting against the referendum. Nonsense. We must have regard to our responsibilities, and we must consider that in the light of the experience of the past ten years it is desirable that an adequate proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue should be returned to the States. We ought all to be in accord with any period for which this Parliament may think it necessary to make arbitrary provision. That we should make some provision for a definite period I am convinced. But to incorporate it in the_ Constitution at this stage of Australian history would be - I will not say suicidal - but fatal. It may be suggested that twenty-five years hence the agreement can be eliminated from the Constitution. But by what processes? We all know that relying upon the permanency, of such provisions of the Constitution certain interests will then have grown up. How are those interests to be dealt with ? We are only making provision for the creation of a diversity of vested interests, and regard would have to be paid to those interests before the people could be asked to eliminate the provision. A few moments ago [ said it was stated that if a provision were put in the Constitution it would be easier to get it eliminated if it were put in without any specific expression as to time than if it were put in for a limited period. I wish to say, in answer to that statement, that the people of Australia put section 87 in the .Constitution for' a period of ten years, and yet practically eighteen months before the expiry of that period this Parliament is invited to take steps to alter the Constitution in regard to that section. It has been stated that if we put a provision in the Constitution for fifteen or twenty or t went\- -five years there would be a moral obligation to respect that particular period. </para>

I recognise that the responsibilities pf the Commonwealth are paramount. They involve all matters which are of highest importance, not to a single State, but to the whole of the States. They involve defence, emigration and immigration, and a whole series, of expanding obligations. </para>

                            <para>- I am not concerned about that. What I am concerned about is that, for the purposes of this Bill, it has been frequently argued that the measure of responsibility between the States and the Commonwealth is a fixture. That has been put in the daily prints, and used in another place, but it is a fallacious statement, because it is a constantly varying measure. As our expenditure increases theirs  diminishes, or should diminish. Whether it did diminish or not is not for me to say. I am quite prepared to support any principle iri this Bill which means meeting the responsibilities of the States. But I am not prepared to support a proposal to place in the Constitution a perpetual provision which would not only block us practically from its revision, but would also block all future Parliaments of Australia. Nor am I prepared to agree to any scheme which is regarded as being of a perpetual character. </para>

I wish to place it on record at the present moment that I did nothing of the kind. The grounds on which I opposed that Bill were three. My first ground was that it proposed a policy which would destroy the policy with which twenty-five years of my life had been identified. My second ground was the excessive taxation with which my State was threatened. My third ground - and, rightly or wrongly, it was the strongest ground - was the equal representation of the States in the Senate. </para>

I am quite sure that we shall all be found fulfilling that duty at the proper time. At the beginning of his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> laid great stress upon the fact' that, whereas at the first referendum the Braddon clause was  a  permanent feature of the Constitution at the second referendum, it was only a temporary feature. He also attached particular importance to the fact that a larger number of people, and a larger majority voted on the second occasion than on the first. I remember the submission of the Constitution Bill to the people, and, to the best of my recollection, I do not think they attached very much importance at that time to the Braddon clause. It. was spoken and written of very largely as the Braddon "blot." A great many people did not understand it. </para>

                            <para>- Will the acceptance of this Bill by the people be a justification of it to my honorable friend's mind? I do not hold that an honorable senator should agree to a referendum being taken simply because a proposal is submitted. I think it is the duty of an honorable senator, if he disagrees with a proposal of that kind, to oppose it. In this case, we have not what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has tried to make out, but a clear straight out issue. He wants to put a different set of questions to the people. If the Bill is to go before the people, in what form will it be submitted? They will be asked, " Do you wish an amendment of section  87  ? Do you wish the elimination of certain sections, and the alteration of subsequent sections?" If they say "Yes," by a majority, the latter provision will become a permanent feature of the Constitution. But suppose that a majority of the people hold with my honorable friend and say "No," what would be the effect of that negative? It would be exactly that which he would bring about by any special questions which he might desire to have put to them. That is to say, if the people said "No" to his proposal, they would have affirmed that they wished the Parliament to retain its responsibility and to find a permanent settlement of this financial question. I resent the more or less offensive references which have been made to the State Premiers. Both in the Senate and in my State, I have found fault with the Governments of the States for approaching the Commonwealth Government in disregard of the fact that the State had representatives in this Parliament. I was a member of a State Government which was approached in order to become a mediator, as it were, on behalf of the States to the Commonwealth Government. The Premier of the day pointed out that if the people wanted to bring any particular grievance before the Commonwealth Government, they should act through their own representatives. And this is now done, and the Federal members, whatever side their politics may be, are consulted. But when the State Premiers are spoken of by one set of honorable senators as nobodies - only mere electors - and characterized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as audacious, because they threaten to use their electors' rights to oppose those who will not do them financial justice, it should be remembered that they are trying to bring about an agreement which will give financial stability to their </para>

Do we not know that such an idea is preposterous? Only certain powers and functions were handed over to the Commonwealth. No representative of a Slate can truthfully say that the Commonwealth has not been intrusted with full taxing powers. Are we not to consider the enormous financial responsibilities which have been left to the States? Are we not to remember that they have the interest on their debts to pay, and the natural resources of their territories to develop? </para>

                            <para>- How good the honorable senator is ! We have not given to the States one farthing more than they were entitled to. The Constitution empowers the Commonwealth to spend up to one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, and to return to the States what we do not spend. That we have done. To say that we have given the States what they were not entitled to is, therefore, absolutely unfair. What is the position now placed before this Parliament? We are asked to impose upon the Commonwealth that fair degree of permanent financial responsibility which should accompany the full power of taxation which the people of Australia have vested in the Federation. Where is the emasculation of this Parliament, of which we hear so much, in a recognition that the States are part of the Commonwealth, and that they have their functions and duties to carry out just as we have? Where is the emasculation of Parliament in frankly saying to the States, </para>

The relationship of our finances to the Customs and Excise revenue has led to some rather curious estimates.  I  have listened - rather amusedly at times - to premises from which absolutely contradictory deductions have been made, deductions which were also contrary to those which I should draw. Some of my honorable friends opposite are afraid of this agreement because they say it is going to destroy the possibility of resort to direct taxation. That seems to me anything but a sincere argument, coming from those who say that they are in favour of a land tax and a tax on wealth. </para>

But I am not going to SUPport a proposition to commence with taxing the man who owns £5,000 worth of land, and to allow all other land-owners to go scot free. Surely there is a great deal of political humbug, about a proposition of that description, and I. cannot believe that the members of the Labour party are sincere when they favour it. They want to tax the big land-holders with the few votes, whilst they leave to their colleagues, the members of the Labour parties in the various State Parliaments, the dirty work of taxing the small men with the many votes. </para>

                            <para>- I love them when they are honest and straightforward, but I do not like humbug and insincerity. There is a financial aspect of the proposition before us that has not been much referred to in the course of the debate. There is a Tasmanian aspect of it which I, as a representative of that State, am justified in putting forward. It has been the unfortunate lot of Tasmania, from the initiation of Federation, to have financial difficulties of a severe kind pressed upon her. We have never complained of that as a factor arising out of Federation. We  have taken it as a  natural  and inevitable consequence of the change of conditions that has been brought about. But, nevertheless, it is a fact that in the first year after Federation Tasmania lost the enormous sum of .£130,000 in Customs and Excise, about 16 per cent- of the total revenue of the State. Ever since that time the direct taxation of Tasmania has gone on increasing, until it has' reached the enormous amount of 100 per cent, more than the direct taxation imposed in some States, and over 80 per cent, more than the average direct taxation throughout the Commonwealth. Our direct taxation has reached a very high figure indeed. We are collecting now something like 29s. or 30s. per head, and the Tasmanian Treasurer, in consequence of this agreement, is obliged to increase that amount by 4s. per head. While we contemplate these facts, we have to consider what is the outlook for the Commonwealth itself. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, will presently be supporting a proposal under "which the Commonwealth will be pledged to an outlay of practically £10,000,000, on account of the Northern Territory. </para>

I am referring only to the financial responsibility that will be entailed upon, the Commonwealth. Tasmania will have to bear her due proportion, and although we are the smallest State, we shall look at the matter solely from a national stand-point. The acceptance of the Northern Territory involves first of all taking over the public debt, amounting to £2,31I4;000. Then there is a floating debt of ,£602,000 ; we are expected to pay for the Port Augusta' railway £2,250,000; and we are also asked to construct another line which will probably cost four solid million pounds. There is a sum of ,£10,000,000 of an obligation which apparently this Commonwealth is going to face. The Bill has passed the other House, and it is likely to pass the Senate. </para>

They must not be crushed and humiliated, and compelled to come here cap-in-hand to ask for what is their own. Then again, the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie railway is estimated to cost ,£4,000,000. It "will be easy to spend, ,£2,000,000 on the Federal Capital site. Defence will cost ,£2,000,000 or more. Any one who knows anything about the evidence taken by the Postal Commission is aware that at least £"2,000,000 will have to be spent to put that Department upon a proper working footing. In these items alone - apart from the ordinary tendency in a growing nation for expenditure to rise - we have- an outlook of expenditure amounting to £20,000,000. Is it not time for the Treasurers of the States to ask the Commonwealth : ' 1 What are you goings to do for us?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> says. " Trust the Commonwealth Parliament." What evidence has the Commonwealth Parliament given during the nine years of its existence of sympathy and consideration for the States?

I know that the extra money returned to Western Australia rightly belongs to the people of that State ; but still, the special arrangement was a perpetuation of the book-keeping system, and was unFederal. But what evidence has the Commonwealth Parliament given of sympathetic consideration to the States that were in financial difficulties, as was the case with Tasmania? The Premier of Tasmania came over to Melbourne a few years ago, and had a consultation with the Federal Treasurer with regard to a leakage of Customs revenue, involving a loss to Tasmania  acknowledged  to be about ,£30,000 a year. Was anything done to remedy that ? Nothing - absolutely nothing ! </para>

I may be wrong, but that is the view I take of them. There is no subject which has been so fully dealt with as this, and I suppose there is no subject upon which there is such a large amount of public feeling. I should like before Concluding to refer to a point which I have omitted. The argument raised by a good many of my honorable friends opposite has been that this financial agreement is going to destroy Protection ; whilst other honorable senators - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> for instance - hold the belief that it is going to give the death-blow to Free Trade. In all the calculations and estimates that have been made, based upon Customs and Excise, there has been one great factor that has been constant! v; lost sight of, and that is that nearly half our revenue is derived from, taxes on luxuries, such as stimulants and tobacco. Yet honorable senators have continually ignored that fact. They have argued that the agreement will interfere with our Protective policy. How will it interfere with the duties on those commodities ? </para>

But I am not advocating such taxation at the present time. The conclusion I have come to with regard to this Bill is that it proposes to ask the people, to affirm that the financial stability of the States shall be preserved, and that the Commonwealth Parliament must shoulder its own financial responsibilities. If we find it difficult to pay to the States 25s. per <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> from the revenue from Customs and Excise, there will be no occasion for us to go cap-in-hand to the States. We shall then be placed in the position in which our honorable friends opposite would like to. see us placed. We shall be obliged to resort to direct taxation, and will be able to tax land, wealth, or incomes throughout Australia. If the Commonwealth Parliament is not prepared to leave unpopular taxation to the State Parliament, and has the courage to impose it itself, it will have no difficulty whatever in financing its affairs, should this agreement be adopted. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot hope, at this stage, to say anything original on this question ; but when a matter of so much importance is to be submitted to the people, I think no member of the Senate should remain silent upon it. I wish to say a few words under three headings. First, as to the surrender of the power possessed by the Commonwealth Parliament under the Constitution ; second, as to whether the agreement is likely to injure <inline font-style="italic">Protection;</inline> and third, not as to the impossibility, but as to the improbability of our ever being able to take this agreement out of the Constitution if it is once placed in it. Whatever may have been the beginning of this question, it has developed into a bitter party strife. I regret that some honorable senators opposite should have availed themselves of every opportunity, not to deal with facts, but to make their usual insinuations against the party with which I am associated. It has been said that no surrender of our constitutional powers is proposed in this Sill, and that the authorities of the States have, if not equal, at least very important rights in connexion with this question. Let us consider the position in this State. I believe I am right when I say that it will be impossible for any candidate to be returned to the Senate in March or April of next year unless he receives the approval of at lead 200,000 of his fellow citizens. At the last election, I v.as called upon to deal with this question. As a candidate I had to give an expression of opinion upon it. But under this Bill, the matter is being taken out of our hands, although this Parliament is the only power that can finally determine the question. We have been invited to believe that the State Premiers were invested with power to dictate the terms and conditions under which the Commonwealth Parliament shall allocate the Customs and Excise revenue. Let me put this to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> I believe the honorable senator, as a member of the Ministry, was consulted to some extent, and that he was present and took part in the proceedings of the Premiers' Conference. I do not know whether the honorable gentleman tore up his blotting paper or not. </para>

                            <para>- I have to plead absolute ignorance on the point. J know nothing about it. But if I were to adopt the methods of honorable senators opposite, I might be as effective in insinuation. It is suggested that the Premier of Victoria, and I refer to him only in his public capacity, had a right to dictate the conditions on which this matter should be settled. I remind honorable senators that the honorable gentleman was elected, not as Premier of Victoria, but as the repre-' sentative of a particular constituency. He was returned by the magnificent number of about 1,200 votes recorded at one secluded isolated spot in the State. Yet he usurps the power to dictate the terms which are to be accepted by members of this Chamber, who received at least 133,000 votes. The Premier of this State was not elected to deal with this question. The State Premiers, no doubt, had a right to consider the matter amongst themselves. They held four Conferences before they were able to arrive at any definite conclusion as to what the J States should be prepared to accept. But now this national question has been made a mere party question. It is remarkable that all the State Premiers assembled at the secret Conference belonged to the one political party. This is a national and not a party question, and will honorable senators opposite contend that only those belonging to one political party in the Commonwealth should be allowed a voice in the determination of an important national question? Narrow as has been the party spirit which they have sometimes displayed, I do not think honorable senators opposite will make that contention. I agree with" the statement that a Premiers' Conference is an excrescence upon the Constitution. The State Premiers have no power under our Constitution, and they are unable to operate any Federal law. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, their rights are' only those of ordinary citizens. I wish now to deal with the question of the effect of this agreement upon the policy of Protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted figures from the United States, Germany, and Canada, to show that the Customs receipts of those countries increased at a greater ratio than did their population.

                    <para class="block">Protectionists on the opposite side have denied that this agreement is likely to injure the Protectionists' cause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> believes that it is not only possible, but probable, that our Customs and Excise revenue will increase in the same ratio with the increase of our population as in Canada. Let us see how it will work out. If our population increased by 36 per cent, we shall have a population of 5,814,000, and if our Customs and Excise receipts increased by 109 per cent., as in Canada, our revenue from that source would amount 1.0 ,£21,945,000, or a <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> return of no less than £3 15s. 3d. Is there any common-sense Protectionist in Australia who will say that it is possible to raise such a revenue from Customs and Excise under a genuine Protectionist Tariff? If we are to do this, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council hopes we will, it can only be under a revenue Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is not in the habit of quoting figures purposelessly, and merely to waste the time of the Senate. If he did not, by quoting those figures, intend to suggest what was not only possible, but probable, in Australia, I should like to know what his object in quoting them was. I have repeated the words the honorable senator used, and if he will not put his own interpretation upon them then I am compelled to use mine as to their meaning. Under our present Tariff we raise a revenue from Customs and Excise of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. 8d. per head, and the figures to which I have last referred would involve an increase of ;£i 4s. 7d. upon that. We find Victorian Protectionists of the stamp of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> contending that the destruction of the Protectionist Tariff under this Bill is a mere ghost ; but I ask the honorable senator to reconcile that statement with the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Similar figures were quoted from America and Germany, and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council did not believe that they indicated what was likely to occur in Australia, why did he travel the world for his facts? </para>

                            <para>- I am willing to accept the honorable senator's explanation and to withdraw what I have said, if he will say what he did mean by quoting those figures. If they were not meaningless, they meant something, and whatever the honorable senator's interpretation of them may be, they remain. If we develop the Commonwealth on those lines and increase our Customs and Excise receipts, it will be impossible for a genuine Protective policy to exist in Australia. It is remarkable that those who have addressed themselves to this question have never seriously attacked the position which is set up by Protectionists. They have merely disposed of it as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> did when he said, " Let us assume that it will have that result." But upon a measure of this kind we ought, not to assume anything. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may think so. At the present time the Commonwealth raises from Customs and Excise duties the second largest amount in the world - an amount which is only exceeded in the case of New Zealand. I voted for a Protective Tariff because I believed that it would result in the establishment of industries throughout Australia. It is because I believe that a scientific Protective Tariff will prohibit importations that I voted for it. To-day we are asked to bind the Commonwealth to annually return to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for all time. Do honorable senators think that it will always be possible for the Commonwealth to return that sum? I do not. I hope that within the next decade our Customs and Excise returns will drop by at least <inline font-style="italic">£ 1</inline> per head. If they do not, it will be apparent to me that Protection is a bogy. If we are compelled to return to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for all time after our manufactories have been established, we must cease all development in Australia. We must practically say good-bye to an effective defence policy, to a naval policy, to the transfer of the Northern Territory, and to the construction of the transcontinental railways. These things must either go by the board in the face of a falling revenue,, or we must enter the money market and borrow. Perhaps the Vice-President of the Executive Council will not accuse me of twisting his meaning if I quote a few other remarks which he made in moving the second reading of this Bill. He said - </para>

I say that they are guilty not only of bad finance, but of a cowardly act towards future generations. </para>

                            <para>- To me it is quite evident that in Australia there has been a borrowing mania. We have avoided our real responsibilities. We have made 110 provision for the establishment of a sinking fund in connexion witE our indebtedness, and it has been a common thing for the States to borrow even for the purpose of paying interest upon their debts. I do hope that the Commonwealth will never adopt a borrowing policy which does not make provision for the establishment of a sinking fund. I hope, too, that it will not borrow except in case of emergency. I do not think that the proposal to return to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for all time will receive the support of the Democrats of this country. We have had a rather long discussion upon whether an Act of Parliament in which the proposed agreement was embodied, and the operation of which was limited to a term of years, would not be more rigid than would the embodiment of that agreement in the Constitution. I say that no comparison can be instituted between the rigidity of the two proposals. While I do not deny that it would be possible to get the agreement taken out of the Constitution at some time or other, I say that it is very improbable that it would be taken out. In this connexion I wish to draw attention to the fact that we have had one constitutional referendum in Australia. It was taken at the last general election. Let us see what the figures relating to that referendum evidence?  1  find that in the three large States 788,1)2 electors recorded their votes, whilst in South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, only 148,000 votes were polled. What do these figures reveal? That if the proposed agreement had been embodied in the Constitution and five persons had voted for its excision as against one who had voted for its retention, it could not have been eliminated. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely. It is because of that that the first vote which  1  cast in my life was recorded against the draft Constitution Bill. I recognised that it would give men of the Fusion stamp opportunities to talk about trusting the people, well knowing that if a mistake were made it could not be remedied. Is it not possible to give the States the same security that they would enjoy if the proposed agreement were inserted in the Constitution, by embodying it in an ordinary Act of Parliament ? Let us assume that in accordance with the unanimous wish of the Commonwealth Parliament we undertook to return annually to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> Upon the strength of receiving that amount the States will accept certain responsibilities. Does any honorable senator think that the members of any party in this Parliament will lightly disregard their responsibility to deal fairly with the States ? But surely that is a very different matter from granting to one man the right to thwart the will of five men? The figures which I have quoted relate to the last constitutional referendum taken in Australia. Yet honorable senators opposite persist in saying that if the proposed agreement be embodied in the Constitution, the people can exercise it when they choose. Before leaving this subject I wish to deal with a few baseless assertions which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> I regret that he is not present, but the responsibility for his absence is not mine. ' He has made almost vicious assertions in this Chamber - assertions which have been repeatedly contradicted, challenged, and disproved. Yet it seems to be impossible for him to do justice to any subject without dragging in a reference to the Labour party, accompanied by such assertions. To-day lie repeated a statement which he made on a previous occasion when he was replied to by an honorable senator upon the opposite side of the chamber. He stated that the reason underlying the opposition of the Labour party to the proposed agreement was that we were disappointed office-seekers. Upon a former occasion when he made that statement it was replied to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in the following words - </para>

No doubt some honorable senators have disagreed "with his policy.

Was it his attitude in Tasmania which displeased <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> ? Was he to go to a secret Conference, as the present Prime Minister did, pledged to his own supporters in this Parliament to a temporary arrangement, and not only bind himself hand and foot, but ask his followers to slavishly follow him j not only to give away his own conscience, but to surrender the conscience and judgment of his supporters- who have followed  him so loyally for years ? Yet an honorable senator on the other side, who knows the facts, has the audacity to say that Labour men are partisans, and have no convictions or consciences. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister has used every known method to make a solid party ; but he has failed. Ours is the only party which is independent, and which is permitted to take its own view, without having newspapers and the Fusion Government backed up by State Governments, threatening to defeat its members at the coming election. Have not the Fusion organs, not only in Victoria, but in the other States, printed in leading articles and Parliamentary notes threats to members of this Parliament as to what would happen to them at the general elections if they did not support the Fusion programme? </para>

The Premier of New South Wales has made a similar threat. Not one, not two, but many, on the other side, would not accept this proposal for a moment if they thought that by taking up an independent position they would be again returned to the Chamber. The Minister says that the Labour party is solid against the Bill. ' </para>

If, however, it is true that we will commit suicide by our attitude on this question, what becomes of the accusation that we are engaged in electioneering tactics?

                            <para>- The figures for the only constitutional referendum which we have ever had show that five persons could not amend the Constitution if one desired to block them. This Bill reminds me of a referendum which might be suggested when the Labour party come into power. To follow the example of the Fusion party, we might ask the people, " Are you in favour of an exemption of £5,000 or one of £100?" and in whichever way they answered the question, they would be committed to a land tax. Would the honorable senators consider that that would be trusting the people? That would be about on a par with the referendum on this financial agreement. Is the honorable senator willing to support a referendum for an alternative? No. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> also remarked that our attitude on this question showed that we were willing to make the interests of the States subservient to the interests of our party. When did we do so? When was any accusation made by the States of our intention to do so? There is a suspicion on the part of not only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> and his party, but also the State Premiers, that the Labour party may get a majority at the next elections, and that they may not be able to dominate that party as they dominate the Fusion party to-day. I believe that if the members of the Labour party come back with a majority, they will not accept the domination of the State Premiers. The latter are making their last dive, their last desperate grip on those whom they are able to dominate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> also said that our object was to "keep parties apart. We are not particularly interested in keeping parties apart. But we are greatly interested in getting as many men into our party as we possibly can, not under a delusion or a snare, but on a definite political platform which they believe to be in the best interests of Australia. Can honorable senators on the other side say that ? Which of them can say that he sits to-day on that side with the same right to give vent to his political opinions as he did at the previous election ? There is not one honorable senator opposite who can justify his position. I was going to quote the words of Alfred Deakin, but seeing the unenviable position which honorable senator's occupy to-day, I shall refrain from doing so. </para>

                            <para>- Thank goodness I have never attempted, and hope that I shall never attempt, to persuade the honorable senator on any question which he has not thought out for himself <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> made the statement that the Federal and State Parliaments should be dominant in their respective spheres. I also hold that belief, but if each Parliament is to be dominant in its sphere, it should be dominant within the ambit of its Constitution. It is quite clear that we shall be dominant with regard to the Braddon section at its expiration next year; but it is not clear that that provision comes within the sphere of the State Parliaments or State Constitutions. If it does, it is remarkable that no honorable senator has attempted to prove that it does not exist in the Commonwealth Constitution to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> dealt very ably with that question when he said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> as representatives of Tasmania, represented not a few in a little isolated village, where, perhaps, 600 or 700 persons returned a man to Parliament, but a majority of the electors of the State, and that as members of the Commonwealth Parliament they had a responsibility to other States as well as to their own. That is a responsibility which, as he pointed out, is not shared by any State Premier. At the recent elections in Victoria neither party dealt in any way with Federal finance or the Braddon " blot," nor was it referred to in their manifestoes. They had no indorsement from the people. </para>

                            <para>- It was one of. the most successful meetings which  1  have fever attended, and although there might have been a dozen persons anxious to kick up a noise and disagree with us, I believe that 500 out of the 600 present were in favour of the views which I expressed concerning this financial agreement. My only hope is that when the Minister goes out to advocate this Bill to the people, his meetings will be as successful as the one I had the pleasure of addressing the other night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> candidly admitted to-day that a loan policy would be necessary. He boasted that he had sat in the State Parliament for twenty years, and that the people had always trusted him. But during the whole of that time the financial policy which he supported was one of borrow, borrow, borrow ; making no provision for the payment of the money borrowed. He has been a party to handing on debts to be discharged by future generations. That is the best that the eminent financiers with whom he has associated have been able to do. He expressed the hope that at the coming elections the people would consider well and would not return to represent them men who did not understand finance. Why does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> pick out the Labour members'' for his contemptuous scorn"? Does he think we are so ignorant that we cannot count correctly ? Does he think that our English is not as good as it ought to be? Does he think that our arithmetic is faulty? I would remind him that if we have not had the opportunities which some others have had, we have, at any rate, made better use of them than others more favoured by circumstance have done; and, at any rate, we do not sneer and assume airs of superiority towards those who, perhaps, have been ever* less fortunate than we have been. In conclusion, I have to say that my opposition to this Bill is confined to one portion of it. I am in absolute agreement with the proposal to pay 25s. per head to the States. I think that at present it is not too much. We can more easily spare such an amount to-day than we shall be able to do ten years hence. But I object to this Bill 'because, as an Australian, I recognise that one of the difficulties in the way of accomplishing the objects of Federation has been the continual tugging of the States. This is an attempt to compel the Federal Parliament to surrender one of its most important powers. I object to it on that ground. Last, but not least, I object to it because it is inconsistent to consent to a permanent agreement and at the same time expect to develop our Protective policy. I believe that if the necessary money is to be raised through Customs and Excise to meet this obligation to the States, we shall be driven into the position of either borrowing, as the States have done in the past, or of taxing the poor on those commodities which cannot be produced in Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate my namesake on the speech which he has just delivered. I feel proud of the name of Russell after having listened to such an eloquent deliverance, full of matter and of fact. The case presented by my honorable friend was altogether unanswerable. I must also congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating. His</inline> speech on this question was the best that has yet been delivered in the Senate. The matter has been very fully discussed on this Bill, and I was not disposed to participate in the debate; but it is so far-reaching a question that, as a representative of South Australia, I thought it right to express my views upon it. I am proud to say that five out of the six representatives of my State are against this obnoxious agreement. T have never denounced the Braddon section of the Constitution. I favoured it before I became a senator. I thought that the Federal Parliament might be addicted to extravagance. But since I became a member of the Senate and have had an opportunity of looking into the finances very closely,  1  have failed to discover a single instance in which extravagance has been practised by the Commonwealth Government. I did think that the Commonwealth might be rather severe on the States unless they were protected by the Constitution. But I have learnt from my study of the history of Federation that the Commonwealth has treated the States in no niggardly fashion, but most generously. I have interjected repeatedly during this debate - and it is a fact - that the Commonwealth has not only returned to the States the three-fourths Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled, but  £6,000,000  more than that, which the Federal Government could have spent had it wished. The Post and Telegraph Department has been starved in order to return money to the States. After an experience of eight or nine years of Federal Government, what have the people to fear? How has Parliament acted? How is it likely to act in the future? It has been just and generous. It has returned to the States more than they were entitled to. If some honorable senators opposite had had their way we should not even have accomplished the passing of the Old-age Pensions Act. I regret that this has become a party question. Though I am a member of the Labour party, it is not a party question with me. If I believed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> were on the right track, I should not hesitate to vote with them. But because I believe that they are pursuing a wrong policy, I shall vote in the opposite direction. What has led up to this proposal? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> let the cat out of the bag when he intimated that it has been submitted for political purposes. The Premiers of the States, being anxious to do the best they could for their Treasuries, took advantage of the circumstances in which they found the Prime Minister. He had just succeeded in forming his Fusion Government, and was in danger of being upset. The Premiers, realizing that fact, approached him with a view of getting as much money out of him as they could. One of the principal arguments which they used was this: " If you will yield to us in this respect, we will work in your interests and will oppose your enemies. When the election comes we will say, ' Down with the man who has the cheek to speak against this agreement.' " I- do not wish to speak of the Premier's disrespectfully, but at the same time they are not going to dictate to me as a member of this Parliament. I do not know the Premiers of five of the States personally, but I know the Premier of South Australia, and I hold1 him in high estimation. I am not going to say a word against him ; but what is his position as Premier of the State? He has twenty-one followers, there are twenty opposed to him, and he has only eight reliable men behind him. That is the position of a Premier who makes threats to "down " the Labour party. He is in somewhat the same position as the Prime Minister was some time ago. He is preparing to make a fusion. When forming his Government, he was willing, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was, that half of its members should be Labour members, so long as he was allowed to be Premier. He did not succeed in getting Labour members to join him, and he then made overtures to the other side, and in the near future his former enemies will be his colleagues. He is one of the Premiers who have said that they intend to pack the Senate. Three of my colleagues will be going up for re-election for South Australia very shortly, and I hope they will be returned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake</inline> at that election will be found fighting the Labour party, although not long ago he stood side by side with the late lamented Tom Price, and fought the National Defence League and the Tory element. Now he says, " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prime</inline> Minister, if you will meet us and assist us financially we shall be prepared to pack the Senate at the coming Federal elections." I predict that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake</inline> will have more trouble in securing re-election for his present constituency than Labour candidates are- likely to have in securing their return to the Senate from that State. He will have before him the most difficult task possible, and if he is returned he will be placed in the humiliating position of having to thank his former enemies for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake</inline> is no doubt proud of his position as Premier of the State. He seized it. It was not his by right. But he has got it, and he is now trying to "down" the party which, in the first instance, lifted him into the position of a member of the State Government. The threats of the State Premiers to pack the Senate will only induce the Labour party to make extra efforts in the coming political battle. The Labour party are in earnest. Their platform is in print, and their objects are pure and good. I quite recognise that the State Premiers have been very wise in their generation. They took advantage of their opportunity to induce the Prime Minister to give in to them. We cannot avoid the fact that the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States must have money to carry on, and I believe, with my colleagues, that if an effective Protective Tariff is administered on proper lines we must expect a reduction in the revenue from Customs duties. The time is perhaps not far distant when the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments will require money, and the revenue from Customs and Excise will not be sufficient to meet their requirements. I have always been one of those who have advocated the imposition of taxation on the land monopolist and wealthy man, and its removal from the goods consumed by the poor. I held those views long before I became a member of the Labour party. I was elected to the Legislative Council of South Australia in  1894,  and even before that I advocated the plank of the Labour platform referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> I advocated a land tax on estates over  £5,000  in value. I did so as the result of my reading when I was farming at Belalie. I hold the same views still. I am in earnest, and have never minced the matter. I have told the electors on every occasion that those were my views. I believe that a progressive land tax or a tax on large estates over  £5.000  in value is becoming more popular. We have been told even by members of the legal profession, that this Parliament has control not only over Customs and Excise, but over every form of direct taxation as well. If we yield to the Premiers in this matter, if we permit them to trample upon us, and say that we are unfit to perform our duties, they may come forward with a fresh demand, and insist that the taxation powers of the Federal Parliament shall be confined to Customs and Excise, and that the State </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Parliaments shall have control of direct taxation. I believe that if the Premiers approached the present Government on the eve of the coming Federal elections with such a demand, they would yield. Our rights to impose a land tax or an income tax may be disputed by the State Parliaments. I recognise the cunning and craft displayed by the State Premiers, who know that they will have difficulty in collecting the revenue they require. We have been told that we have now a Liberal Government and a Liberal Legislative Council in South Australia ; but what has happened in that State? The people have expressed themselves in favour of a "progressive land tax, and on two or more occasions have returned a large majority of members pledged to the imposition of such a tax. It has been passed by the House of Assembly, by far more than an absolute majority, for three or more years in succession, and the Legislative Council have refused to budge. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator can talk piety as much as he likes, but we want facts, and I have stated the true position. The Legislative Council of South Australia has refused for years to extend the franchise. Since I was a member of that House in  1894  they have been asked to extend the franchise, and have always declined to do so. Only the other day the present Government of that State carried a Bill for the purpose through the House of Assembly, and after its second reading had been moved by the Chief Secretary in the Legislative Council, the landlords and representatives of the wealthy classes there who do not represent humanity, but property, and property alone, without another speech being delivered on the question threw the Bill aside. The present Premier of the State has, of course, constitutional remedies, but he dare not avail himself of them. I do not blame the States for endeavouring to get the Commonwealth Parliament to collect money to hand over to them, and to receive abuse for so doing. If some arrangement could be arrived at with the States for a period of ten, years or thereabouts I should not object to it. But I cannot agree to embody the proposed agreement h* the Constitution for all time. Some honorable senators may think that I am not a true representative of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- But I have been a resident of that State for considerably more than forty years. I am well known there, and my word is respected. It is because I believe that I am right, that I take up my present stand. It is all very well to say that the Commonwealth will act liberally towards the States and that it will give them for all time more than it can afford. But why should we bind those who come after us? We have no right to do that. Need I remind the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the Federal Capital has yet to be established, that the Northern Territory has to be taken over, and that our expenditure upon defence will aggregate several million pounds? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has referred to the undertakings which lie before us. I hope that when he goes to his bed to-night, after he has said his prayers, he will meditate not only upon the interests of the States but upon those of the Commonwealth of which he is so prominent a member. We have no right to give away our liberties. In this connexion I do not need to again quote the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> They were words of wisdom, and let me add that he is not a member of the Labour party. That circumstance ought to  carry some weight with my honorable friends. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is one of the best statesmen that we har-e. 1 say that, although I do not always «gree with his views and although he was returned in opposition to me. But we must all admit his great ability. He says exactly what he means, and he neither fears his foes nor endeavours to please his friends. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> also will ponder over this matter. </para>

I now propose to quote a few lines from the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> in reference to this matter. As we all know, that journal is an anti -Labour one. It is a  Fusionist  paper, and is owned by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython. Here is what it says - </para>

                        <para>The strange feature of the battle is that there- arc no slain to be counted. Of all the alternatives to the Conference scheme not one showed its heaH. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper</inline> protests that he did not put his own scheme forward. He only sought to limit the duration of the Conference scheme. Nothing was heard of the Brisbane Labour Conference scheme. That was jettisoned in the Parliament, though it may come up as an alternative at the elections. The chances are, however, that the Opposition will be entirely destructive. So much has come to the Conference scheme that it stands where none other may stand. There is still the Senate to be faced, and report says that the balance is so nearly equal there that once again there will be days when one vote will determine the issue. Party lines are strictly drawn in the Senate, and the personal hostility of some senators to (he Prime Minister will be less effective on this issue than on some others which could arise. There were doubts once about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> but the Senate fight in Victoria will for the first time be strictly party. Three Ministerialists will be opposed by three Labour men, and any one coming between will make no difference. This fixes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Trenwith's  vote. The Senate Whip  says  that he can carry the agreement both in Committee and by the statutory majority, but it can only be done by constant vigilance. This done, the way will be clear for a prorogation. Another fortnight will probably complete the work of the third FederalParliament. </para>

                                will be prepared to undertake the whipping if the Vice-President of the Executive Council only gives him the wink.  1  hope that if the Bill be not amended in the direction that has been suggested, it will be thrown into the waste-paper basket. It may have served its purpose already, even if it be relegated to the waste-paper basket, because it was conceived, hatched, and brought before Parliament purely for political purposes. And those who oppose it will have the opposition to which I have referred. I suppose that Senators Chataway and Sayers will go over to Queensland to try to " down " those who have had the courage to oppose the Bill here. I believe it to be my duty to oppose the Bill as it stands. If I believed that the States were not receiving justice or fair play, and a good case could be made out, I would stand by them every time. Their interests, however, would not be sacrificed by the rejection of the Bill. We, as members of the Commonwealth Parliament, have more to think of than even the interests or thoughts or ideas of a Premier. We are the representatives of the people in the National Parliament. Those who want to vote differently from ourselves desire to make this Parliament subservient to the State Parliaments so as to save their political skins. Even

                        <para>. - I understand that the Leader of the Senate is anxious that the second reading of this Bill shall be carried to-night ; and I judge from his pleasing appearance, and the smiles of his supporters, that he has the numbers. I do not propose to try to induce any honorable senator on the other side to change his opinion on this question, recognising, as I do, that an effort of that kind would be merely a waste of time. Every phase of this question has been dealt with by different senators. It has been pointed out that if we pass the Bill, we shall be asking the people of Australia to take back a power which was granted to this Parliament in the Constitution. As that has been clearly proved, it need not be enlarged upon. It has also been clearly proved that the passing of this Bill will undoubtedly endanger the cause of Protection in Australia. But if I were to stand here and repeat these arguments until to-morrow night, it would not make any difference to a single senator who had, I believe for party reasons, to agree to support the measure, and only to look for reasons to justify his action. I do not believe that it would be of any use to prolong the debate. I understand that the Leader of the Senate is prepared to allow us to go home after the second reading has been carried. I simply desire to protest against the passing of the Bill, and to assure the honorable senator that it will meet with my opposition at every stage. If it is passed by this Parliament, I propose, as I have to consult the electors early next year, to oppose it on every possible occasion during the campaign. If it cannot be defeated here, I still have some hope that the intelligence of the Democratic people of Australia will prevent them from ratifying a measure which I believe will, if carried into effect, be to their detriment. I oppose the motion. </para>

In view of the tenor of the debate on the second reading, I can hardly conceive that there will be any debate on this clause, which provides for the rebate of £600,000 by the States to the Commonwealth. I ask the Committee to allow the clause to pass, in order to bring us face to face with what I take it will be the debatable portions of the Bill, when I shall be willing to report progress.

That was incurred as the result of old-age pensions, and as some of the States were relieved of the payment of pensions, I assume that they recognised a not unreasonable claim on the part of the Commonwealth to look to them for some assistance in the matter. The result is that they agreed, as part of the arrangement, to rebate to the Commonwealth £600,000, or half the anticipated deficit. </para>
