                    <para>. -  For the second time during the very few months that I have been its leader, it becomes my duty to inform the Senate that death has once more visited Parliamentary circles, and that, as a result,' we have lost the ' comradeship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Hutchison, late member of the House of Representatives for Hindmarsh, in the State of South Australia. I am' sure that, although we in this Chamber were not brought so closely into touch with the deceased gentleman as were the members of the House to which he belonged, we knew him sufficiently well to recognise the great loss which has fallen upon Parliament and upon the State which he so worthily represented. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchison</inline> was at all times a genial- comrade, and, I think I may say, an energetic and conscientious Parliamentary representative. That his absence will represent a loss to the councils of the nation, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am certain. But there is still a greater loss to which I desire to make a. passing reference, that to his family. I propose at a later hour to offer for the acceptance of the Senate a motion which I would have submitted now, except that it was thought desirable that it should be in similar terms to that which will be submitted elsewhere. I shall ask the Senate, sir, to adopt a motion conveying an expression of its sincere sympathy with the widow, who is now mourning the most severe bereavement which she could possibly be called upon to bear, and with the family who have been so suddenly deprived of their mainstay and breadwinner. </para>

                    <para>. - Death is a very sad thing at any time, from whatever cause it may arise. The fact that another member of the body to which we belong has been suddenly taken away, and that death has been, at any rate to my mind, unduly frequent since the Federal Parliament was instituted!, must indicate to the general public that the work therein is of a character which is not conducive to the well-being of the representatives of the people. To ' learn of the death of any one who may not have been the main support, or the breadwinner, of a father, or a mother, or a wife, or children, is sad enough-. But when we come to lament, as we are now doing, over the death of one who was a faithful representative of the people in another place, and who was also a. husband and the father of a considerable family ; when we think of all these things, and recollect that only a- week ago he was in the prime of life, and in healthy vigour, it must fill our hearts with grief. Only a week ago I travelled over from Adelaide with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchison.</inline> In the evening he was as well as any one could be; but on the following morning he was stricken down, and we know .the result. I was very pleased to hear that later the Vice-President of the Executive Council will move a motion of sympathy with the widow and the family of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchison.</inline> All those who knew that gentleman intimately must at all times pay a tribute to his sincerity, his earnestness, and his integrity. I hope that the Senate will not for a long time have to again lament such a sad event. </para>

                    <para>. - In politics all differences dis appear on the arrival of death. As one who was a fellow-representative of South Australia with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchison,</inline> but on another side in politics, I want to bear testimony to the genuineness of his character, his earnestness, and his sincere desire to do the best he could, not only for his State, but for the whole of the Commonwealth. By his death we have lost a comrade whose desire always was to promote the true welfare of the Commonwealth. On an occasion like this, no matter on what side of politics we may be, we can all recognise the value of one who has thus been taken away. I desire to pay my tribute of esteem to the memory of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Hutchison, and to proffer my sympathy to those whom he has left behind1. No words of ours are sufficient to console and- comfort his family in this time of distress, but it will help them to bear their affliction when they know of the deep sympathy felt for them in this their time of sorrow. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire the indulgence of the Senate while I say a few words in regard to our late comrade, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Hutchison. I was, perhaps, brought more closely in contact with the late honorable gentleman than was any one else, because, in the late Government, he acted for the Defence Department in another place. I feel sure that the Parliament is the better for having had him as a member of it. He was a fine man, though physically he was very weak. Notwithstanding that he suffered continually as the result of that weakness, his nature was a bright and cheery- one. He always had a sunny disposition. He met trouble and discouragement bravely, and in that sense his life will be an example to others. But he had more than that in his nature. Not born in Australia, he was a true Australian. He was one of those who looked upon political life seriously. To him it was not a sport or a profession, but his whole life. There are those who know that, even on his dying bed, his mind continually reverted to his work in Parliament, and his expressions of opinion showed that his mind was still thinking over his responsibilities as a legislator. While he may not be called a statesman, sir, he was a patriot. He was one who loved his country. He was prepared to devote all his energies and all his strength to promoting what he believed to be the ' true interests of his country. It is well known to his friends that, prior to leaving his home on the last occasion, he felt unwell. He was urged by his wife and family to stay at home, but in view of the fact that the session was drawing to a close, and that many important measures were to be dealt with, against the advice of those who loved him dearly, and at the sacrifice of his health, he determined to go to Melbourne and remain till the close of the session. He has paid the penalty of his steadfastness, but I am sure that the record of his earnestness, his intense devotion to his . ideals, his whole-hearted belief in his principles, and his determination to do what he considered to be his duty, will be an inspiration not only to the party with which he was associated, but also to the political life of the country. And, in sympathizing, with his widow and children to-day, we feel that when the first pangs of grief shall have passed, the best consolation will be the knowledge of his splendid political work, his great earnestness, and his intense desire to do that which he believed to be his duty. </para>

                    <para>- Before calling upon the business of the day to be proceeded with, it may not be amiss that I, in the position which I occupy as  President  of the Senate, should add a few words to those which have been so well expressed. It will, I am sure, be a matter of great gratification to the family of the late gentleman to know that there has been such a tribute pf esteem and admiration paid to his good qualities. It tends to show that, however divergent our opinions on political matters may be, however much men may determine to fight for their principles and views, nevertheless there is at the bottom a strong feeling of sympathy between members, and a strong recognition of the fact that men who come here are fighting for principles and for what they believe to  be best in the interests of our great community. When tributes of esteem come from all sides of the Chamber, that fact must be brought home to everybody. While death separates us, at the same time it unites us. It brings us together in this respect - that we have a sense of regard and esteem for all that was good in fellow citizens who have passed away, and feel that there is a comradeship between us all. Death has unfortunately thinned the ranks of the Federal Parliament during the mine years of its existence, but where a large body of men are brought together that, will always be the case. Death is no respecter of persons; it seizes the best of men, and frequently men whom we looked upon as being, in the prime and' vigour of life, and the least likely to be called away so early. I had not the advantage of an intimate personal acquaintance with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchison,</inline> but from all I have known of him and have learned" he was respected and esteemed as a man who desired to do that which was right and best in the interests of the country. </para>

                    <para class="block">I regard the seriousness of the industrial trouble at Newcastle as of sufficient importance to warrant the step which I have taken this morning. In my opinion, the Commonwealth Parliament cannot indefinitely continue to look idly on that dispute, and, perhaps, to close the session without taking any cognisance of it. We are charged with looking after the interests of the Commonwealth, and those interests are suffering in each of the States consequent upon the industrial trouble at Newcastle. We ought, therefore, to take some action with a view to bringing about a settlement of that dispute. The Commonwealth has the control and regulation of the transportation of mails from one State to another, as well as oversea, and without coal it will be impossible for it to discharge its proper functions. As the coal supply has been practically stopped, it is imperative that something should be done to reopen that supply. For some time past the coal trade of New South Wales has been in the hands of a trust, which is locally known as the "Coal Vend." I hold that the Constitution gives us authority to deal with monopolies and trusts, and consequently that we have full power to intervene in the present dispute if we choose to exercise it. </para>

                            <para>- I should like that question to be put in writing. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> should know that in New South Wales there is a Coal Vend which controls the coal trade of Australia. If he is not aware of that fact he must be a <inline font-style="italic">rara avis</inline> indeed. Not only does the vend control the coal trade of Australia, but it controls the coal trade of the whole of the Southern Hemisphere. That being so, this Parliament has every right to interfere in the present dispute. We cannot hope that the strike will be settled as the result of action by the New South Wales Government. It may be asked, Who is responsible for the present state of affairs? In order to determine that it is necessary to go much further back than the beginning of the strike a month ago. During the past year or so, the officials of the Miners' Union inform me that they have been paying large sums to victimized miners. An" amount of£10,000 has been disbursed by the Newcastle miners in this connexion. I claim to speak with some authority on this matter, because for many years I worked  in the Newcastle district, and occupied an official position in the Miners' Union there. </para>

                            <para>- I mean men who have been dismissed from their employment because they were prominent unionists. I need only mention one case to illustrate my statement. It is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burns,</inline> who was arrested on Saturday night last. He is the treasurer of the district organization, as well as the secretary of the Miners' Lodge at Maitland. To my own knowledge, he has been a victimized member of the union for several months. Honorable senators must not imagine that, because the men only threw down their tools a month ago, that that represents the beginning of the trouble. The fact is that, whilst the. miners were being victimized in a wholesale manner, the New South Wales Government did not deem it their duty- to interfere. But the moment that the men threw down their tools, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> announced from his place in Parliament that he would have the leaders arrested and put in gaol. Later on, he took a partisan action by declaring that the coal frcm the co-operative collieries would not be carried over the Government railways, thus bringing Government property into the dispute in the interests of one of the parties to it. The indignation which was aroused by his refusal to haul coal over the New South Wales railways was sufficiently strong, however, to cause him to back down. But his crowning act of folly was the arrest of the strike leaders within the past few days. T mention these matters to show that there is no hope of this dispute being settled as the result of action on the part of the New South Wales Government. </para>

                            <para>- Not so long as the law is violated by the men. senator DE LARGIE- I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is so one-eved that he cannot see an offence which is committed bv the other side. He cannot see anything wrong in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Albert</inline> B'rns being victimized by his employers for months. But the moment the men sav " We will work no longer for our employers, but we will work for ourselves on a co-operative basis," he detects some heinous offence in their action. Personally, I think that common sense will prevail with the people generally. The action taken bv the New South Wales Government has been of a most one-sided character. Even in the matter of the purchase of coal for the railways they have shown their partisanship. . At the commencement of the strike -they purchased about 10,000 tons of coal from the Ebbw Main and the Caledonian Company at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton. They were prepared to pay that price for it during the first few days that the strike was in progress. They did not then know whether the strike was going to end in a week or a fortnight. I do not say that that is an unusual thing to do in a time of strike. I can remember that during the maritime strike an enormous price was paid for Mount Kembla coal for the New South Wales railways. But when it came to buying coal from the miners, how different was the attitude of the New South Wales Government ! Instead of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton being considered a fair price, they have paid only 10s. per ton. The Government . that could pay <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton to the coal mine-owner can only afford to pay 10s. to working miners at a time when coal has gone up 50, or perhaps roo, per cent. They did not even ask the men whether they were agreeable to sell at that price. They practically commandeered the coal. As a matter of fact, a steamer had already contracted with the Young Wallsend Colliery and the Ebbw Main Colliery to take their coal, but when the vessel was brought alongside the crane there was none available, as the New South Wales Government had taken it. These facts go to show that if we look to the New South Wales Government for a settlement of the strike we shall be disappointed. I know the temper of the men ; and I can assure the Senate that such tactics will never bring about a settlement. The miners are the wrong sort of men to be bossed and tyrannize over in this manner. They will obey the law, as they have done in an admirable wav up to the present; but if they are to be treated in a high-handed fashion bv the Government of the State taking coal at a price that would have amounted to little less than confiscation had it been done by a Labour Government, they will resist. I wonder what would have been said if a Labour Government had been in office in New South Wales during the strike and had taken coal from the mineowners and paid them merely a ridiculously small price for it? There would have been an outcry throughout the country that the Labour Government were practising confiscation. The Wade Government have laid down a very dangerous principle. The cat may  come back to them some day or the other. They may live to rue their arbitrary 'action in taking from the coal miners their coal 1 at the miserable price of 10s. per ton. When we survey the power possessed by the Federal Government in relation to trade and commerce amongst the States, and recollect our right to control transport and our authority in naval and military matters throughout the Commonwealth ; when we recollect that the Commonwealth has power to acquire property on just terms from any State or persons for any purpose with respect to which we have power to make laws ; when we remember that we have power in respect to arbitration in disputes extending beyond one State, we must recognise that the Commonwealth authority is supreme. </para>

It would be nothing but presumption on my part if I were to suggest a course to the Government. If the responsibility rested with me, I. should not for a moment hesitate to suggest a remedy. I hold that the New South Wales Government are the most unlikely people to effect a settlement.- They have done the most foolish things imaginable. Last Saturday they committed almost a criminal act. Here were two men living in Sydney during a whole week, and the Government did not arrest them, although the warrant was signed there. They were arrested in Newcastle, in an open manner, at a time when a large demonstration was being held in the streets, and under circumstances that might have brought about bloodshed, which every one would have deplored. </para>

                        <para>. - It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that, some time ago, when a question arose affecting the Newcastle coal-owners, I took upon myself the responsibility of defending their action, believing that they had right on their side. On this occasion, I take the contrary view. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, I have had a long experience of the New South Wales coal-miners. I have had a training in all the various phases of mining, as well as complete association with all executive affairs connected with the industry. I have no hesitation in expressing an opinion  on similar lines to that enunciated bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. This dispute dates back further than a. few months. Any one who has read the history of the northern coal industry will know that repeatedly representations have been made by the miners as a. body for the rectification of what they consider to be injustices. They were entirely helpless unless they could get the ear nf the mine-owners. Rather more than twelve months ago I visited the district during a time when there was a strike in Western Australia. I went to a large number of the collieries in the north, and found that complaints were numerous. Men were suffering from pin-pricks, such as I have experienced many times while I was working as a- coal miner in New South Wales. They were simple grinning and bearing what, under ordinary circumstances, would have made men of more rash temperament take much stronger means to effect remedies. But their whole endeavour was to secure a peaceful settlement of every dispute that arose. The coal-owners from that time onward have continued to flout the requirements of the men. Undoubtedly they have done so because of the knowledge of the strength of their own combination.I have no hesitation in saving that the climax at which we have arrived is one that has been foreseen for a considerab'e time. Indeed it has been connived at. The whole  sin pertaining  to the present position mav righteously be charged against the coal-owners nf the northern district. It is well known to those who have had any connexion with coal mining, that it is an industry that stands, almost apart. It differs from other  industries in the fact that it is almost impossible for outsiders who are neither employes nor employers to grasp fully, and to deal with the many phases of any dispute that may arise. Such disputes have always depended for their peaceful settlement upon conferences, held from time to time between the representatives of the employe's and of the owners. I recognise that in New South Wales there is an industrial law which is supposed to apply to this industry. I know, also, how difficult it is to apply the law to an industry in which so many disputes based upon technicalities may arise. The coal mineowners have refused to adjust or to make any attempt to redress the grievances from which the men have been suffering. </para>

                            <para>- It is a fact beyond all dispute. They have absolutely ignored the men, and during the past two years have refused to do anything to redress the grievances which have been placed before them. In the circumstances men are forced to the conclusion that the coal mine-owners have been endeavouring, from month to month, to bring about the difficulty which has arisen in New South Wales. 1 shall not attempt to say for what purpose, but all the evidence furnished by the history of coal mining in the northern districts of New South Wales during the last few years goes to show that the employers have been endeavouring to bring about the present position. Whether the object has been to upset the laws of New South Wales, or to goad the men into rebellion against them, I am unable to say. We are told that the men who have gone out on strike have done so in violation of the law. The New South Wales Government made some attempts to bring about negotiations between the employers and employes, and failed. There are good grounds for suspecting that they never intended that their efforts to bring about a settlement between the parties should result in anything but failure. But, having failed to bring about a. settlement of the dispute by mutual arrangement, they have since done what every sensible person in the Commonwealth must regard as an attempt to bring about a bloody revolution in the disturbed districts. Many serious industrial disputes have occurred, and many strange actions have been committed by those concerned in them, but never before has any Government in Australia quietly permitted the law to be defied for four or five weeks, and then made a determined effort to bring about what might have been one of the greatest riots that the country has ever seen. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly they did. The partisanship of the New South Wales Government, and their desire to force the working men into an unbearable position, has been so apparent that it is impossible to ignore the criminal character of the act that they have committed. We who are personally acquainted with the men whom the Government of New South Wales have arrested, were astounded to learn that, after having a warrant signed in Sydney for their arrest, the Government should have gone to the trouble of engaging a special motor car 'to carry that warrant all the way to Newcastle. </para>

                        <para>. - No matter what opinions members of the Senate may hold, they will not deny that the difficulty with which we are now dealing is one which it is worth the while of the Senate to spend some time in discussing. Members of the Labour party in this Parliament have had the matter under consideration for some time, and were it not for a strong desire that nothing should be said or done which might in any way aggravate the position, this question would have been mentioned in the Senate long ago. I should willingly have brought the matter up, but we recognise that Senators de Largie and Henderson, who have had almost a lifelong experience of the coal-mining industry, and know more of the subject than do any other members of the Senate, were the -persons who might most intelligently deal with the question. It may be said that the Federal Government have nothing to do with this matter, since the dispute is confined within the borders of one State; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has clearly shown that its effects are felt not. only in other States, but even beyond the Commonwealth itself. It is consequently the duty of the Federal Government to take some action to terminate the dispute. The Vice-President of the Executive Council and the Minister of Trade and Customs may ask us what can be done? Ever since the Federal Parliament was inaugurated, members of the Labour party have been saying what ought to be done, but they have never been in a position to carry out their views. Our belief is that a disturbance of this kind, which has such far-reaching effects, should not be beyond the scope of the legislation of this Parliament. If we had had our way, Acts would have been passed, and steps taken long ago which would have rendered such a state of affairs as now exists in the New South Wales coal-mining districts impossible. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will refer to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he will find that, on many occasions, the members of the Labour party have expressed their opinions  upon these questions, and have indicated what ought to be done. What has been done by the Federal Parliament in the matter of industrial legislation? A Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which is scarcely worth the paper on which it is printed, has been passed. No doubt it has done good in connexion with the difficulties in which federations of industries extending throughout the Commonwealth have been concerned. Honorable senators will find that the object of the framers of the Constitution, in giving to the Federal Parliament the power to make laws in connexion with conciliation and arbitration, was that it might legislate for the prevention, as well as the settlement, of labour disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. </para>

                    <para class="block">High Court itself, have declared that, until a dispute has actually extended beyond the boundaries of one State, nothing can be done, whilst the Constitution declares that this power was given to the Federal Parliament for the prevention of these industrial disturbances. What has been done to prevent such disputes reaching an acute stage, or to prevent their effect extending beyond the boundaries of one State? Absolutely nothing. Any attempt which has been made by the so-called Liberal party or by the Fusion party to pass legislation to deal with industrial matters, or with monopolies, such as the Coal Vend really is, has been of such a limited character that it is of no use to the people of Australia. Until action- is taken in this Parliament which will have the effect, not only of stopping strikes after they have occurred, but of preventing them occurring, we shall not be carrying out our duties under the Constitution. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was being considered by this Parliament, the enemies of the working classes, and, in fact, of the whole people of the Commonwealth, in both Houses, did all they possibly could to cripple and maim the measure, in order that these difficulties might continue to exist. Until we recognise preference to unionists we shall never have a satisfactory Conciliation and Arbitration Act. When the men combine to protect their own interests and do what they can for their own elevation and betterment, they ought to be supported by the Legislature of the Commonwealth and of every State. And when the employers combine for the purpose of carrying on their industry in the best way both for themselves and for the public - because at all times, and by all sides, the interest of the public should be conserved - when both the employers and the workers combine in unions for the proper adjustment of matters in connexion with the trade in which they a're engaged, they ought to be supported by law. It ought to be the duty of this Parliament to pass a Conciliation and Arbitration Act which would assist both the unions of the workers and the unions of the employers to adjust their difficulties. Nothing of that kind has been done, and until it is. done the same confusion will exist in the future . as has existed in the past. A Bill) was brought down this session in connexion with the preservation of industries. But what has any legislation of that kind ever amounted to? When not one industry. but all (he industries, of the Commonwealth are jeopardised by the action of a monopoly of any description, is it not nearly time, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> that an Industries Preservation Bill was passed strong enough to enable the Federal Government to tell the monopolists that no longer shall they be allowed in interfere with the interests of the whole community, but that the Commonwealth is prepared to take over the industry, whatever it may be, if the workers and the employers engaged therein are not prepared to act satisfactorily towards each other. There is no doubt that legislation of that kind could be passed. lt ought to be passed, sir, and the High Court could not, I think, come to any other decision than that the Federal Parliament acted within its rights in passing such legislation. If, however, it decided otherwise, it would be within the power of the people to alter even the constitution of that Court, because I contend that the interests of the people of the Commonwealth should be considered in connexion with such legislation. Whether it is legislation dealing with the preservation of industries, or with the preservation of the rights of the workers, or of the employers to combine, it should be passed with a view to a settlement of any difficulty which would be likely to interfere with the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - There is no doubt that the matter brought before the Senate this morning is one of the gravest possible importance, and I think that every honorable senator will agree with me that this is no occasion on which anybody ought to attempt in any shape or form to do anything which would . be comparable with the action of a man- taking a lighted torch amongst inflammable material. We ought to form a quiet and deliberate judgment, and to do all that we can to lessen ill-feeling and bring about peace again. I, as every honorable senator will have been doing for weeks past, have thought a great deal about this strike. I have been troubled, too, that we, as a Federal Parliament, have not expressed any opinion on the matter hitherto. The opinion which I think I would have asked the Parliament to express is that it was the duty of all parties to come to terms as quickly as possible. I take the view we must all take, that the work of the miner is hard, disagreeable, and dangerous beyond the average of the work in other industries, and that he is entitled to a great deal of sympathy from all classes of the community, and to vigilance in seeing that his interests are looked after. We are also bound to remember that the coal-owners do not consist, as is sometimes represented, of twenty or thirty individuals. That is not the case. In the northern part of New South Wales, that is north of Sydney, there are no less than eighty coal mines, and in the south and west together about forty coal mines, making a total of about  120. </para>

I have no doubt that a number of these mines are held by one proprietary, but I am also quite certain that there are a very large number of shareholders. I. hold in my hand a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Joint Stock Companies Year-Book</inline> for  1907.  It gives a list of most of the coal mining companies. I find one company which has  320  shareholders, and another company which is reported to have over  300  shareholders, and I have no hesitation in saying that the shareholders in the coal mines of New South Wales number some thousands. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie cares to take this book,- he will find a record of the dividends paid by a large number of the mines. He will find that whereas a good many of them have paid substantial dividends, more of them have paid for many years very few dividends. He will also find a record of the Sydney Colliery Company, which, after spending several hundred thousand pounds on the work of sinking a shaft and finding coal, has at last suspended operations owing to want of funds. </para>

                            <para>- The circumstance in connexion with that mine which interests us at this moment is that several hundred thousand pounds have been lost. I suggest to honorable senators that this is the time when we are bound to look the facts in the face - not the facts in relation to one side or the other, but the whole of the facts. We ought to approach the consideration of this question with a determination to do all in our power to mete out justice all round. It is many years since I first expressed the view that whenever either party to a dispute between labour and capital invited the other to a conference that request should be acceded to. I cannot conceive of any position in which it would not be wise for a conference to be held, and in this present trouble, in which the interests of the great masses of the people in all the States are concerned, conferences seem to me to be more desirable than ever. This is a time in which, I think, none should seek to stand simply upon their bare legal rights. They ought to be prepared for the gracious surrender of a portion of their mere technical and legal rights in the interest and for the sake of the welfare and the trade of Australia. I noted with some surprise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> spoke of the men going out on strike because of the pin-pricks which they had suffered. </para>

                            <para>- But I am not aware of any general statement having been presented to the people of Australia which called for any public expression of opinion or any legal interference. I suggest to honorable senators that before the trade and commerce of this great continent was attempted to be dislocated in the way it has been there ought to have been a greater attempt to secure publicity to what was a wrong, or alleged to be a wrong, and some open, plain, and manly attempt made to secure a right without, in the first instance, breaking the law in any direction, and causing loss and suffering, not only within the mines, but without them. We must all feel - I have .always felt - 'much admiration for men who are prepared to throw from them their means of support and to endanger the well-being of those who are dear to them. But it is necessary for us all to remember that men are often led into these actions by mistaken advice. Therefore, I suggest that it is desirable, above all things, that we should look at this matter quietly and resolutely, and ask all parties concerned in the trouble to do their best to come to terms. If I were asking the Senate to express an opinion to-day, I would suggest that in view of the trouble and suffering which have already been brought on the trade and commerce of Australia, and of the fact that that trouble and suffering will be appallingly increased by a continuance of the strike, it is the duty of all parties con.cerned to strive to come together and to terminate this terrible dispute as speedily as possible. </para>

                        <para>.- I suppose, sir, that every honorable senator sitting on your left will say that this is a law-abiding community, and if I were to contradict that statement it would be urged that I was saying what was not correct. It seems to me that in the existing state of affairs - disastrous' as we know it to be - two things are required - first, that the law shall be upheld at any cost ; and, second, that we shall apply to the situation a little common sense. I should like to know if any honorable senator opposite can name one member of the Parliament who objected to the passing of the law which makes it an offence for a man to strike or for an owner to lock out? As a matter of fact, the whole of the Labour party throughout Australia agreed to that law, and assisted to pacs it. Yet that is the law which 12,000 miners in New South Wales are to-day ruthlessly breaking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> evidently feel that it is necessary to advance some reasons to excuse the action of the men in thus openly defying the law, and consequently they have put forward reasons which have not been urged by the men themselves, and which are not to be found in the list of forty or fifty of their grievances which were published after the strike commenced. Consequently it is idle to say that these men have been goaded into striking without notice, because of certain pin-pricks which they experienced years ago, and which they have omitted to mention in the list of grievances, which they knew would be scanned and criticised throughout the length and breadth of this continent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie commenced his address by declaring that this Parliament is supreme, and has power to settle this dispute. He then went on to say that the- Commonwealth- has control of the means of transportation, and chat the exercise of Federal functions is being stopped as the result of this strike. Whose fault is that? It is the fault of the 12,000 men who laid down their tools without affording the colliery owners a single opportunity of remedying any one of "their forty or fifty pin-pricks, or of considering any of the four substantial grievances, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> declares should go before the Arbitration Court. In considering this question we have to recollect the words of the leaders of the strike. From them we learn that their desire is to paralyze industry, so as to maintain unionism militant. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowling</inline> has admitted in the clearest possible language that the strike is intended to make unionism supreme. Therefore, when honorable senators opposite ask what can be done to settle the dispute, I say that I defy any man to show what can be done unless one side or the other will give way, or unless both sides will give way. The owners declare that they will not enter into a conference with the men until the latter return to work. Can any legislator say that they are wrong in taking up that position ? Are not the colliery proprietors right in saying, " Let the men first give some evidence that they are prepared to obey the law by going back to work, and then we will confer with them." </para>

I deny that honorable senators opposite have a right to bother us in this matter if they are not prepared to exert their influence with a view to inducing the miners to obey the law and be loyal to the courts that we have established. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has talked about pin-pricks. Does he think that pin-pricks are a justification for paralyzing the industries of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable senator suggest that there is not much difference between earning 12 s. and 14s. per day and earning nothing ? Would not these miners have starvation staring them in the face were it not for the support which is being dragged out of men who cannot afford to give it? Why cannot honorable senators opposite go to Newcastle and advise these men to resume work ? We shall never settle this matter by talking. Somebody must give way. The miners ought at once to accept the offer of the owners that conditionally upon them resuming work the colliery proprietors will meet their representatives in conference on the same day. Surely it cannot be urged that until their four principal grievances are settled  they ought not to resume work? Are not those four grievances quite capable of engaging the attention of the Arbitration Court for two or three months? In the interim is no coal to be hewed? Apparently the miners can afford to go to regattas and races, and to indulge in fishing. I believe that they would resume work but for the advice of the leaders. The whole position discloses an absolute want of common sense and honesty on the part of those leaders. It is the duty of honorable senators opposite, not to come here and talk about doing impossible things, but to counsel the miners to exercise a little common sense by receding from the position which they have taken up and by agreeing to resume work on the day that the owners meet their representatives in conference. </para>

                        (Western Australia) ^12.29]. - I do not think that this is the time for discussing whether or not the Newcastle miners were right in coming out upon strike. The fact is that they are out - 12,000 of them. Even if the whole of the Federal Labour party and all the State Labour parties throughout Australia were to visit Newcastle and counsel the miners to resume work, I am not sure that the latter would do so. They would quickly tell the Labour members to go back.

                        <para>- The fact is that these men are on strike, and will not go back unless the employers will meet them in open conference. If the employers have the good case that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> indicated, why will they not meet the men? If the men have no. case, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> says, why do not the employers let the public have an opportunity of judging ? One is tempted to enter into the merits of the case in dispute, but I do not intend to do so. I shall. confine my remarks to what can be done at the present juncture. We are faced with the situation that one side is prepared to enter into an open conference, whether they are right or wrong, whether they have a good case or a bad one. The other side say, however, "We will not enter into a conference, except on one condition, and that is that the men shall go back to work at once." In my judgment, these men have struck as the result of serious dissatisfaction, for the purpose of riveting public attention, in a dramatic way, upon their grievances. It is now said to them, " Go back to where you were when the public were regardless of your grievances, because, by your action, you. have lain idle the industries of the Commonwealth." Does anyone think that the men are going to be such fools as to give up the position which they have secured, by means of which they have been able to rivet public attention on their grievances, and to bring public opinion, to bear in the dispute between them and the employers? I have before me the history of one of the .great anthracite coal strikes in America, in which  President  Roosevelt intervened. Exactly the same sort of thing was said to the 150,000 men then on strike. The were told, " Go back to work, and we will consider your grievances." But they refused. Their leader, John Mitchell, said, " No ; before these men go back to work there must be the award of a tribunal with reference to their grievances." When  President  Roosevelt intervened, he never told the men to go back to work. He set about rectifying their grievances bv means of a Board. That was in 1003. Trouble again broke out in 1906 and 1007. On these occasions, when  President  Roosevelt again intervened, the coal-owners said, "No, we will not confer; our terms, or none at all." They  had locked out their men. What did President Roosevelt do then ? He had to face  practically  the same position as we have in Australia,  to-day.  He said to the owners, " Unless you do  confer, I will recommend Congress to take over your mines and work them in the interests of the nation." He did not inquire whether the employers or the men were right. He told them plainly that if they refused to confer, he would take Executive action to work the mines in the interests of the United States. </para>

                            <para>- It is impossible to invoke the Federal Arbitration Act, because, technically, the dispute has not spread beyond the limits -.of one State, though it affects every State in the Union. Therefore, apparently, the Federal law has no effect. The Industrial Disputes Act of New South Wales apparently applies. There is jurisdiction under it. One of the provisions of that Act is to the effect that every man who goes out on strike is liable to imprisonment. Therefore the remedy which the New South Wales Government has for the present trouble is that every one of the 12,000 miners shall be imprisoned. Is that a practicable solution ? Would that action end the strike? Every one knows that to attempt to put the Act into operation would precipitate a riot. Certainly it would do no good, so far as relates to putting coal on the market. The State Government hold the key of the position. They can, if they wish, settle the dispute in a very few minutes. There is a number of coal-mining leases in the district. The State Government are in the position of being able to demand that those leases shall be worked. If the lessees will not work them, they can, by Act of Parliament, cause them to be worked in the interests of the State. When a previous dispute occurred in the same district, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne was at the head of the Government. On that occasion the mine-owners refused to meet the men in conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne invited both parties to meet him at his office. The owners at first refused, but eventually consented, to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William,</inline> though they would not meet him together with the representatives of the men. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, therefore, met the representatives of the parties separately. After meeting the owners, he told them, as  President  Roosevelt had told the mine-owners of the United States, that it was his intention to ask Parliament to take action in regard to the leased mines. That intimation had the effect of causing the owners to change their tactics, and they agreed to meet the men. The present New South Wales Government, so far from taking any such action, has done nothing to induce the mineowners to confer with the men in open conference. When .the Broken Hill Proprietary Company locked out their men in defiance of the Industrial Disputes Act - and that they did so is not my statement, but that of the Judges of the High Court of Australia, who held the dispute to be a lockout - did the New South Wales Government put into operation the penal clauses of the Act? Since that time, or at that time, was any representative of the company proceeded against? Was any one of them arrested whilst attending a public meeting or in his own home? Are we not, then, justified  in branding the New South Wales Government as a partisan Government, when they allow the Industrial Disputes Act to remain a dead letter in the case of the Broken Hill Company, whilst putting into operation its penal section in a most inflammatory manner against the coal miners, and in taking action calculated to create a riot and disorder ? </para>

                            <para>- I say that the fact, that the Act was not administered in the one case, while it- has been put into operation in the case of the strike leaders, justifies the assertion that there is no hope of the New South Wales Government being able to end the trouble. Their conduct is rather calculated to inflame the men further. It will be useless for the Federal Government to intervene unless they are prepared to do practically what President Roosevelt did in connexion with the American strike? </para>

                            <para>- Yes; they should be nationalized, unless the owners will meet the men in conference. I believe that the Government have power to do this. We have power to make laws for the peace, good order, and government of the Commonwealth with respect to trade and commerce, intercourse amongst the States, defence and the postal service. All these matters are being seriously affected by the stagnation caused by the strike. If the Federal Government offered their services as arbitrator, they would be simply laughed at as the New South Wales Government have been laughed at. The Federal Arbitration Act is a dead letter because, technically speaking, the dispute has not spread beyond the limits of the State. Therefore, the Federal Government must either support the Government of New South Wales in putting 12,000 men in gaol, with the aid of the Military Forces, or they must' take up the position which  President  Roosevelt took up, and say, " This Government is not a partisan, but unless you are prepared to meet the men in open conference we will carry on these mines in the interests of the people of Australia." That is the only practicable course open. The course recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is that we should say to the men, " Having broken the law, you must pay the penalty, and be sent to gaol." Are the Government prepared to do that? </para>

                            <para>- But they will not go back. We might as well ask the moon to cease shining. These men mean what they say. It is idle to pretend that the strike is the work of a few agitators. That statement is simply a hoary piece of nonsense that is always brought forward when a strike occurs. If every, one of the union officials were put in gaol to-morrow, the strike would go on as dismally and as disastrously as ever. It is so much humbug to say that the leaders are responsible. If we are going to embark upon the course of punishing the leaders, see what it leads to logically. It means that we must put every one of the 12,000 men in gaol. Is that a practicable proposition? Do the Government feel disposed to back up the efforts of the New South Wales Government in that direction by calling out the Military Forces to help the police force? </para>

                        <para>. - I do not propose to discuss the merits of the dispute which has broken out in New South Wales. I question whether any of us have sufficient information about it. But I do desire, as strongly as I can, to impress upon the Senate the lesson the strike teaches, that the Commonwealth Government ought to have power to legislate to adjust industrial conditions in every State of the Commonwealth. This dispute, serious as it is, affects directly only an insignificant number of people, as compared with the enormous . number who are indirectly affected by it, and who will have no voice whatever in its settlement. Within my knowledge, hundreds of men in Melbourne and suburbs are concerned. I cannot say how many, but I do know that there are hundreds already out of employment, not because they have a right to accept or refuse an open conference, not because they have refused to go to work, but because the industries in which they are engaged are unable to continue. They themselves are absolutely helpless. There was an opportunity, during the present session, to pass" a Bill asking the people of the Commonwealth whether they desired that the Commonwealth Government should take a hand in any dispute of this kind that might arise. That Bill was not carried. The present strike emphasizes," as nothing else could, the necessity for such legislation. With reference to the action of the Government of New South Wales in connexion with the dispute, I have very little doubt as to what would be the proper course for them to pursue. The coal-fields are part of the State of New South Wales, and belong in the ultimate to the people of that State, and not to any mine-owners or miners. When the people's property on which they depend for their daily life is withheld from them by any party, it is the duty of the Government, who are the representatives of the people, to take whatever steps are in their power to place the people's property at their disposal. In my opinion the New South Wales Government have power to deal with the matter. I do not think that the Federal Government have the power. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that the Federal Government can, in the existing ^ circumstances, do anything whatever. We  are working under a written Constitution which does not give the Federal Government the power to intervene. I hope that in the near future it will give them such a power. </para>

                            <para>- I agree ' with the honorable senator. That is just what I have been urging. I think we ought to have this power, that the people of Australia desire that we should have it, and should be given an early opportunity of giving expression to their will in the matter. I shall in future regard the acquisition of such a power as a mission in which every member of this Parliament should join, in order that when an industrial dispute of this magnitude occurs, not some of the people, but all the people shall be considered. The effect of this strike or lock-out has been felt in every house throughout Australia already by the increased cost of living in one way or another. It has also been felt in thousands of houses in the Commonwealth; because of the lack of employment for the breadwinner, not because he did anything or refrained from doing anything, but because of a prime essential of our daily life, the fuel necessary for the generation of power and other purposes, being withheld from those who require to use it. It is not the mine-owners' fuel or the miners' fuel. It is the people's fuel. A comparatively few persons in a part of the Commonwealth ought not to be in a position to cause the whole of the people of the Commonwealth to suffer. </para>

It refers to the seriousness of the position which exists at Newcastle, but it has been obvious from many of the speeches made that, at any rate, one purpose of launching the motion was to urge that the Federal Government should take some action with a view to terminating this unfortunate dispute. I do not propose to say a single word as to the dispute itself, but to confine myself to the question whether or not the Federal Executive has any power to interpose in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and others have affirmed that the Federal Government are armed with authority to interpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> on the other hand, takes what 1 believe to be the correct view, and it is, at any rate, the view which appeals to the Government, that at present we should have no status if we attempted to interfere. </para>

He said that there were only two alternatives open to us. I dispute the statement he made entirely. The honorable senator said that one was that the Federal Government might send the Military Forces to assist the State Government to place the men on strike in gaol. That is not an alternative at all. It is impossible. </para>

                            <para>- The other suggestion was that the Federal Government should step in and nationalize the coal mines. The fact that we have not the power at the present time to do that is shown by the terms of a motion which the honorable senator has on the business-paper asking the people to confer upon the Federal Parliament the right to nationalize monopolies. It is obvious that at the present moment the Federal Government have no power to interpose in this matter in any way whatever. The Government take the view that unless circumstances arise to bring the matter within the ambit of Federal authority it would be highly injudicious for them to interfere. We should be very much in the position of a party going into a Court where a case is in progress and claiming to be heard in a matter in which they had no status at all. They would very properly be ordered to sit down, and their action would probably be regarded by both the parties to the case as more or less impertinent. The Government will be only too pleased should an opportunity present itself to do anything they can to bring to an -end the present distressing and unfortunate state of affairs, but until an opening clearly presents itself they take the view that it would be extremely injudicious, and might be disastrous, by interposing to enter a domain which at present, under the terms of the Constitution, is closed against them. </para>

                    <para class="block">Largie adopted a wise course in submitting his motion. I venture to say that had we remained silent any longer upon the industrial trouble in New South Wales, the effects of which are being felt in every home in the Commonwealth, our silence would have been construed as weakness. It would probably be said that we were afraid to discuss this question in the National Parliament. During the discussion many  facts have been brought forward to prove that if the Federal Parliament have not the power to intervene, they might before the end of this session be endowed with that power. A measure proposing the amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is at present before another branch of the Legislature, and, despite the decision of the High Court, I believe that a clause might be inserted in that amending Bill which would give the Federal Government power to at once intervene in this matter. I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> remarks as to the amount of capital invested in the coal mines of the Newcastle district. It was probably owing to a lapse of memory that the honorable senator forgot to mention the dividends which the companies working those mines have received. </para>

                        <para>In the Newcastle coal strike, the absentee land owner and shareholder had their heavy hands, upon everything. The Australian Agricultural Company owned 1,000,000 acres of land in the coal district. The shareholders lived in England, and enjoyed the fruits of a charter granted to them in 1824. In the 85 years that have elapsed, this company of foreign capitalists, who originally paid up ^483,000, have received about ^3,000,000 in dividends, or about seven times their paid-up capital - an average of ^35,300- per annum, equal to nearly 8 per cent. The Newcastle Wallsend Coal Company has 300- shareholders, foreign and otherwise, holding 10,000 shares, paid up to <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> each. In 1907 the reserve fund amounted to ,£28,158, indemnity account ^19,348, and insurance fund ^3,504. Added to these, from the year  1891  to 1907,. dividends amounting to ^302,250 had been paid. Allowing that ^10,000 per annum had been paid for the latter 'half of the year 1907, and for the year 190S, and the first half of 1909, the total amount received for an investment of  £100,000  was ^373,260. The capital was paid back 35 times over in iS£ years. They received' over £20,000 per annum, and doubled their capital in a period of about every five years. The Newcastle Coal Company has a paid-up capital of ^100,000, divided amongst 200 shareholders. Two hundred and eighty-six per cent, has been declared in dividends from July, 1894, to January, 1906. </para>

The output is only from 60,000 to 80,000 tons per fortnight. This answers the wages question, for it is obvious that the men, on the average, worked" less than half-time. If the men averaged <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> per week for a weekly output of 180,000 tons, they could only average <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 3s. 4d. per week for an average weekly output of 70,000 tons. </para>

Up to 1907 they had paid back their capital 6 two-fifth times. If we give £3,000,000 as their dividends up to 1909, they have paid back their capital about seven time's over.

These are figures which cannot be denied. Australia is face to face with a crisis, and some members of the Senate think that the Commonwealth Government have the power to intervene, but, if they have not, I believe that the members of this Parliament would readily run through the Conciliation and Arbitration Act Amendment Bill, which is now before the other House, with a clause giving the necessary powers, and thus enable the Commonwealth Government to intervene, and supersede the partisan action of the New South Wales Government: We have heard a lot about the miners going on strike and breaking the law. But what have their critics to say about the coal dealers in Newcastle, who have gone on strike five or six times; who have refused to sell coal for domestic and commercial purposes without an additional charge of from  300  to  400  per cent. Is not that a strike? In my opinion it is a strike of the most awful nature, but because a few unionists working the mines determined to throw down their tools, and because as a result of the paragraph I have  quoted they had no alternative, they are supposed to be law-breakers, while the .coal dealers who charge exorbitant prices are allowed to go scot-free. I hope that the Government will realize the gravity of the position in which they are placed, and take all legitimate means to try to bring this industrial trouble to an end. </para>

                        <para>.- It goes without saying that every member of the Senate is seized of the far-reaching importance and seriousness of the industrial war which is waging in Newcastle. Every honorable senator who is without bias will admit that the New South Wales Government have displayed hostility to the workers, and shown a partisanship which has not, I think, ever been exhibited before in Australia. In arresting the leaders of the strike movement they showed to what limits they are prepared to go. From day to day the strike leaders were in attendance at the Conference which was being held in, the Trades Hall at Sydney, and nothing could have been easier than for the Government to have them arrested on warrants in Sydney if they had felt disposed to take that course. But they did not do so. On the very train by which the strike leaders were travelling to their respective homes at Newcastle on Saturday night, the State Government placed about seventy special policemen. And, not content with that, they engaged a special motor car, probably the speediest which could be obtained in the State, with a view to sending on to Newcastle the warrants for the arrest of the men. Something happened to the motor car and something else happened, so the man in the street says, in regard to the plans which the Government had mapped out. I am informed, and <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> believe it is true, that what the Government had planned out for the Saturday night was that the motor car should arrive at a certain hour. The Government anticipated that immediately the strike leaders alighted from the train they would be received by their fellow workers, and would make their way to the place where the mass meeting was to be held, and that, when the mass meeting was proceeding, and the audience would number some thousands, the police would make their appearance with the warrants and arrest the strike leaders. Tn these circumstances, so some persons say, and I am not disposed to disbelieve the statement, the crowd would be so excited by the presence of so many strange policemen that the State Government anticipated that in all probability a riot would, be created, and would give them a splendid chance of saying, " What disorderly folk the Newcastle miners are !" But, fortunately, because of the mishap to the motor car, the plans which they had mapped, out could not be followed. </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe that this trouble has arisen from a determined effort on the part of the Coal Vend to weaken and to eventually break down unionism in the Newcastle district. But they have not the slightest chance of accomplishing their object. They may gaol a Burns, a Gray, and a Bowling from time to time; but the seeds of unionism can never be eradicated from that centre. This strike is a very serious matter to everybody in the Commonwealth. The industrial and commercial life of the community is in a state of disorganization. Many trains have been cancelled, causing very serious inconvenience to travellers. In some cases mail services have been limited, and if the- industrial war continues the probabilities are that in some parts of the Commonwealth people will not be able to get their mails more than once a fortnight, or perhaps once a month. " What can be done in respect-to this matter?" asks <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> I think that certain honorable senators have shown, this morning that we possess certain powers, and that if they were exercised to the full we could do much. In any case, they say that public opinion has had a marvellous effect on different disputes in days gone by. In connexion, with the industrial dispute at Newcastle, many gentlemen in this city, representing commercial, industrial and other pursuits, have been invited by the newspapers to speak their minds, and the great majority of those persons have expressed themselves as being in sympathy with the miners, and against the attitude .f, and the action taken by, the coal proprietors. It has been remarked that this discussion has been, so to speak, so one-sided, because the only senators who have spoken from the other side have been Senators Pulsford, Trenwith, Dobson, and Millen. With the exception of Senators Trenwith and Millen, the others expressed themselves in opposition to the miners' cause. </para>

                        <para>Two things are clear. First, the mine-owners refuse to work their mines except on terms intolerable to the miners. Secondly, the miners refuse to work the mines under duress. These two things, therefore, create a coal famine. That famine must end. It can only end by the Government taking possession of the mines in the name of the people, just as the commandant of a fortress would do with the common stock of food supplies. The Government made its initial blunder when it consented to the suspension of the labour covenants of the coal leases. It can rectify that mistake now only by giving notice to the mine-owners that if the mines be not working by a given date of a few days hence a Government receiver will be put into them and the mines be worked under Government supervision, pending the holding of the open conference which the coal-owners at present refuse. </para>

Personally, I am inclined to think that unless something is done to speedily terminate this industrial war, it will extend to every part of the Commonwealth. If the action of 12,000 miners, in striking against unfair conditions of employment, is causing' the. distress which we have been assured it is causing, what will be the result if many more thousands of unionists strike in sympathy with them against the Coal Vend ? Like other honorable senators who have addressed themselves to this question, T hope that the dispute will be brought to a speedy termination, and that it will be settled on equitable lines in the interests of the 12,000 men who are suffering because of their resistance to the unjust conditions which for a number of years have been imposed upon them by the coal proprietors of Newcastle. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry that I have not a little more to reply to than has been advanced during this discussion. The attitude taken up by the Government is one of " do nothing." If such an attitude will result in the settlement of the Newcastle strike, I shall be very much surprised. It is idle to suggest that the Commonwealth has not the power to intervene in this industrial dispute. The Constitution gives us full power in that connexion if we choose to exercise it.

                    <para class="block">Consequently, I contend that we have authority to settle any phase of this industrial dispute. Some reference has been made to the condition in which the miners of the Newcastle district to-day find themselves. Now, I am pretty intimately acquainted with the position that obtains there, and, though a good deal of hardship is being experienced, I can assure honorable senators that that hardship is not very much greater to-day than it would be if the men were working. The fact is that they labour for a miserable pittance, and many of them have doubtless realized ere this that the difference between starving whilst working and starving whilst being unemployed is very small indeed. I dare say that they will be able to keep body and soul together with the assistance which will be granted to them by their fellow unionists. The strike is not inflicting nearly so much harm upon the miners themselves as some persons imagine. Indeed, to many of the men it will be regarded very much in the light of a holiday. Anybody who is familiar with the mining industry knows that the work of the miner is the hardest that is carried on in the community. Yet for such work the men receive only a bare pittance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has said that the men have put forward no substantial grievance*. I admit that many of their grievances, by reason of their technical nature, cannot be understood by everybody. But I venture to say that one grievance has been ventilated by the men which all can appreciate. For instance, they demand an eight-hours day. Now, an eight hours day is supposed to be well established throughout Australia, but, strange to say. in this arduous and hazardous calling it does not exist. It must be remembered, too, that the coal miners of Newcastle have to travel enormous distances underground to their work - they have frequently to travel anything from one to four miles in a stooping position, and with a load of picks or ammunition tied round them in addition to their tucker tins and water bottles. This travelling is about the hardest part of the miners' existence, especially in the case of the older men. </para>

                            <para>- That is a suggestion which has been made time and again - a feasible suggestion, to. which effect should have been given long ago. Further, the trucks in which the coal is carried from the miners might easily be used to convey the men to work in the morning. These brutal conditions, which would have been abolished years ago had common sense prevailed, still continue. I repeat that one of the demands of the miners is for an eight-hours day from bank to bank. </para>

                            <para>- They are prohibited from doing so. In the great majority of mines in the Newcastle district there are inlets instead of shafts, and great trains of trucks coupled together are run at the .one time. If a miner boards one of those trucks he is fined. Indeed, it is quite a common thing for men to be fined for riding in them, not because the employers wish to be unfair, but because, should a breakaway occur and injury result to the miners, the employers would be liable to pay them compensation. Consequently they insist on the men walking to their work at a certain time. I do hope that before the miners resume work they will secure a recognition by the colliery owners of the eight-hours principle. </para>

                            <para>- It means pounds, shillings, and pence, too. If the eight-hour principle were recognised in the Newcastle coal-mines, the men would work a shorter day, and consequently the output would not be so great. I think that this discussion will serve to show that there is a real necessity for the Commonwealth taking action to terminate the existing dispute: For this Parliament to disperse without having attempted to do something in that direction would be verv disappointing to the country. I do hope that the Government will reconsider the whole position, and that they will see their way to intervene, with a view to settling this trouble. I ask leave to withdraw my motion. </para>

                    <para>- With the concurrence of honorable senators, I now  propose to leave the chair till a quarter to 8 o'clock this evening. I think that this lengthened suspension of the sitting is advisable, in order that honorable senators may be enabled to show their respect to the memory of their late friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Hutchison, M.P. I have also to inform them that I have had a document handed to me, which states that a memorial service will be held in the Queen's Hall at twenty minutes past 3 o'clock this afternoon, and that the funeral will start from the front of the Parliamentary buildings at half-past 3 o'clock for the Spencer- street railway station. Arrangements have been made for carriages to be available at that hour, in order to convey those who may desire to attend the funeral to the Spencer-street railway station. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to occupy the time of the Senate longer than to enter a protest against this practice of bringing down the Estimates at this late stage of the session. There is no time at our disposal now to give anything like adequate attention to their consideration, and, furthermore, we are handicapped by the absence of the Auditor-General's report. Although it is nearly six months since the accounts for the last financial year were closed, yet we are completely in the dark as to how the votes were expended in . that year. I am under the impression that at about this time last year we had the Auditor-General's report on the accounts for the previous year ; certainly we had an opportunity of perusing the document before we finally dealt with the Estimates. At present, honorable senators are not in a position to give to the Estimates that close consideration which the people expect them to receive. I hope that in the future, instead of resorting to the practice of passing monthly Supply Bills, the Estimates will be brought down earlier in the session, so that honorable senators may have a chance of dealing with the items exhaustively, and not be compelled to deal with them when some senators have gone to their homes, and others are making arrangements to depart, or- are fatigued and unfit to devote proper attention to the most important matters which can come before the Parliament. In what way are we now exercising our power of the purse? We are dealing with the Estimates at the fag end of the session without a report from the Auditor-General on the previous year's accounts, and with no information as to how the votes for that year were disbursed. </para>

                    <para>. - I am willing to assist the Government to dispose of the measure as speedily as possible, but I think it would facilitate its passage if the Minister of Trade and Customs would inform the Senate whether it sanctions any, and, if so, what, alterations of the usual appropriations for any constantly recurring items. If honorable senators were supplied with that information it would be possible' for them to devote their attention to those items. But if, on the other hand, we are simply asked to revote, as we do revote year by year, appropriations for specific purposes, I think that I am voicing the opinions of a good many honorable senators when I say there will be no opposition offered to any votes of that kind. If there are any increases proposed which might be lightly passed by the Senate without full consideration, and passed simply because of a disposition on its part to fall in with the other House and to early terminate the session, I think the Minister would not be treating us exactly as we would expect to be treated. But if there are any items on which increases are proposed, and on which there might be a reasonable ground for discussion, I trust that the Minister will furnish us with that information so that any discussion may be concentrated thereon. I know of no such items, but if the Minister will assure us that there are none, I wish a safe and speedy passage for the measure. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. When I asked that question in the Senate just now I indicated to Ministers that I did not do so in' a hostile spirit, but rather to facilitate the passage of the measure. I think it is due to honorable senators, who have just consented to the suspension of the Standing Orders, to facilitate the passage of the Bill through all its stages, that they should know whether it authorizes any extraordinary increases, using that word in the usual Parliamentary sense, and, if so, what they are. I have received no reply to my inquiry. If I receive an assurance of the kind I have asked for, I am quite prepared to accept it.  1  believe that if honorable senators received an assurance that the schedule, which covers over 200 pages, sanctions no extraordinary increases of expenditure, they would be prepared to meet Ministers and enable them, without delay, to get the ordinary supplies for the year </para>

                    <para>[9.41]. - I think it will be recognised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is asking a little too much when it is borne in mind that the Estimates show increases on the votes for the various Departments for the last financial year. It is difficult to answer a broad question as to whether it contains any increases of items of a non-recurring character. Take, for instance, the Department of Trade and Customs. This year we are asking for a vote of . £25,040 under the head of Quarantine, whilst last year only . £8,500 was expended, because the Quarantine Act only came into operation on the 1st July last. Honorable senators will see that necessarily a larger vote is required this year. In that case there is a substantial increase in these Estimates. There are also the ordinary increments of the salaries of public servants. If my honorable friend asks me whether I can call to mind any item of an extraordinary, contentious character, I confess that, at this moment, I cannot. Seeing that the Estimates were distributed amongst honorable senators months ago, and discussed in the Senate very fully for many days, and that various Supply Bills have been submitted, and the Estimates discussed in connexion with them, surely in these circumstances they should commend themselves to honorable senators. No doubt the schedule contains contentious items, but no item of what I might call an extraordinary character. </para>

But I still think that it would be very much better if he would give the Committee an assurance that the ordinary annual expenditure for the public Departments is not in any way exceeded in these ' Estimates except in specific instances which he may enumerate. I believe that the Minister of Trade and Customs would insure the passage <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> of the items contained in this Bill much more speedily if he gave that assurance. He has already informed us that amongst other items not included in the previous Estimates is one relating to the expenditure which has been incurred in connexion with the Quarantine administration. Was it not a fair thing that in introducing this Bill the honorable gentleman should have taken the Senate into his confidence by pointing out that above the ordinary Estimates of expenditure for the year we are asked to sanction an expenditure of so much for Quarantine ? I think, in his procedure, he has fallen away from grace. </para>

                    <para>. - Some months ago I brought under the notice of the Senate the position of the sessional typists who are engaged in connexion with our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. I understand that they are only temporary employes, and the time has now arrived when their services will be dispensed with. They occupy rather an unfortunate position, in that most of them desire to be re-engaged - they have no complaints that they are not well paid - and very few commercial houses are inclined to employ men who they know will remain with them only a short time. It does seem remarkable that in connexion with the Commonwealth Public Service no suitable arrangement has been made whereby these men can be transferred to other Departments whilst the Parliament is not in session. I understand that some difficulty is experienced in that connexion. I have been informed that during the past, few months consideration has been given to the question of effectively dealing with their case, and that we are likely to be favoured with a statement upon the position this evening. I shall, therefore, content myself with expressing the hope that some definite action will be taken in their case in the near future. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [9.58].- Some time ago the honorable senator saw me in reference to the sessional typists who at the present time are merely temporary officers. These officers, at the close of each Parliament, usually receive a week's pay in lieu of notice, and their services are then not required until they are re-engaged. It has been urged that they should be placed on the permanent staff. The matter has occupied the attention of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                    and myself, and a recommendation has been made that they should be placed on the permanent staff at a fixed salary. The conditions of their appointment will probably be that whilst Parliament is not in session their services will be utilized in any other portion of the Commonwealth Public Service in which it may be found necessary to employ them, subject always to the approval of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                    and myself. Upon our recommendation these typists will be placed in an exactly similar position to that of other officers of the permanent staff, and will have a fixed salary. It is contemplated that their salaries will range from £160 to £200 a year, and it will be necessary for them to pass a satisfactory examination before they are permanently appointed.

The walls present anything but a satisfactory appearance. I wish to inquire upon whom the responsibility rests of keeping the building in order, and particularly of mending the cracks which cause Queen's Hall to look much more dilapidated than it would otherwise do. </para>

Nevertheless the men, at whose instance I took action, and who are very experienced in connexion with building work, assured me that the structure is in a very bad way. On the score of economy, if for no other reason, it should be attended to. I do not know whether any improvements have been made since I directed attention to the matter, but I trust that it will receive the consideration of the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- This is certainly a matter that requires consideration in connexion with the building which we are now occupying. As we are tenants, it is our obvious duty to keep it in good condition. We owe a great deal to the Government of Victoria for allowing us to remain in occupation for so long a period. I understand that the building is being seriously damaged by reason of the smoke from a chimney in the neighbourhood. This smoke pours forth in great volume, and, not only blackens the building, but contains some chemical property which injures the stonework. </para>

I do not know whether the Federal Government have any authority in the matter, which certainly requires serious consideration. If necessary, they should approach the municipal authorities with a view to putting an end to the nuisance. All that is required is probably the regulation of the draught of the furnaces which produce the smoke. </para>

It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to maintain the structure. A little while ago a considerable sum of money was spent on painting and other improvements. The Joint House Committee are' exceedingly anxious to see that all necessary work upon the building is properly done. As to the matter referred to by

                            the authorities must, of course, be guided by the reports of their responsible experts, whose duty it is to see that property occupied by the Commonwealth is not allowed to get into a state of disrepair. It would be quite impossible for us to take action against the advice of our officers in relation to the building. I quite agree with

                        <para>- It commences in April next. As regards the increased expenditure on account of Papua, it is quite true that the original grant was £20,000. The expenses of administration for the current year are £25,000. The system adopted is gradually to bring the coast under discipline. The administration is moving inwards from the coast. Officers are stationed at various posts, and they have to assist the native police, by means of whom an endeavour is being made to instil ideas of good government and discipline into the natives. As to the  £t,ooo  that is to be spent in connexion with the delimitation of the Territory, it is hardly necessary to remind the Committee that Papua adjoins the possessions of the German Government. An Anglo-German Commission has been sitting for some time past, to define the boundaries of the two possessions. </para>

                        <para>-Captain Holden called upon me while I was a member of the late Government, and made certain proposals which were not adopted. But -he struck me as being  a.  man who could do good service in this regard if the Govern  ment  desired to do what he proposed. I did not know whether the statement that appeared in the newspapers was accurate. All this only goes to show the insincerity of continually inserting this line in the  Estimates.  The announcement is made that this officer is prepared to send to Australia some 300 or 400 retired English officers who have been serving in India, many of whom are possessed of substantial sums of money. Apparently the Federal and State Governments are not prepared to co-operate with him. Captain Holden had a scheme which he laid before the late Government, but it was left in an unfinished condition. It had been sent on from the Defence Department to the Department of External Affairs for report. He proposed to secure as emigrants to Australia members of the English contingent of the Indian Army who had retired. At present most of these men go to Canada or New Zealand, and very few of them come to Australia. Captain Holden is a retired Indian officer himself, and knows all the circumstances. He said that he would be able, with very little trouble, to induce a large number of these men to emigrate to Australia. They have been accustomed to a tropical climate, and would soon become acclimatized to Australian conditions. Most of them have a knowledge of farming, and would be prepared to take up agricultural pursuits. If we are to have an immigration policy, it seems to me that they are the type of "men whom we should desire to attract to th'is country. I must admit that many of my colleagues were not very enthusiastic about Captain Holden's offer, and the pressure of the work of preparing for the session made it impossible for the last Government to deal with it. I should like to know whether the present Government have given the matter any consideration, and whether they have received any reports from the officers of the Defence and External Affairs Departments in connexion with it, and, generally, what attitude they take with regard to the offer ? </para>

                        <para>- He proposed that he should open in India an emigration office, practically to secure these men. So far as my memory. goes, he did not ask for the payment of any salary by the Commonwealth, but that he should be recouped the expense of clerical assistance in collecting the men and sending them away. He proposed that he should be authorized to carry on negotiations with the Army authorities in India to select the men, and have them sent to Australia. The Commonwealth Government, on their part, were to undertake to be responsible for the payment of the pensions of these men in Australia, getting the money, of course, from the Imperial Government, and to co-operate with the States Governments in order to find them land, put them upon it, and give them such assistance, in the shape of plant, as they would require to make a start. It was certainly a business-like proposition. </para>

                        <para>- The paragraph which appeared in the newspapers yesterday shows that Captain Holden has already sent one batch of these men without any Government aid, and would be able to send several hundred more if he could secure the co-operation of the Government. The Lands Department of Victoria say that they do not know what to do with these men, and I can. quite believe the statement. I dare say that the authorities of the Lands Department in Tasmania would be in the same fix. In each case they would require, first of all, to secure the consent of the landlords before they could do anything. But the proposal brings us up against the question whether it is of any use to continue voting money for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth unless we are prepared to take the necessary consequent action. Of what use is it to advertise our resources amongst these men in India, if they are not given an opportunity to take advantage of them when they come to Australia? </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Government might enter into negotiations with the State Governments. But in a happy-go-lucky style they are spending money in advertising the resources of Australia without any plan of co-operation with the States. I think that the State Governments are largely in fault, because I know that various Prime Ministers have endeavoured to induce the State Governments to co-operate with the Commonwealth authorities in this matter. Up to the present, apparently, they have not been inclined to do so. I should like to hear from the Minister of Trade and Customs what is the present position in regard to this vote. </para>

                    <para>. - I also wish to say a word or two upon the vote for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. We voted  £20,000  for this purpose last year, of which  £8,644  was spent. This year another vote of  £20,000  is asked for the same purpose, and I submit that until some arrangements are made between the Commonwealth and State Governments for the allocation of lands for immigrants it is futile to vote this money. There is plenty of good land in Australia, but the Commonwealth does not own an inch of it. In Victoria and New South Wales, we find that there are hundreds of applications from people already in Australia for every block of land opened for settlement. If the State Governments cannot supply the demand for land for the people who are already here, it must be impossible for them to meet, in addition, the demand for land by people introduced from oversea. The fact is that a vote of this kind should be preceded by the introduction of a Bill for the taxation of unimproved land values, which would have the effect of bursting up the large estates, and so making available lands for those who might be induced to come to Australia from oversea. I do not desire to repeat statements  I  have already made on the subject. But  I  hope the Government, even at the eleventh hour, will recognise that it is futile to vote £20,000 for advertising the resources of Australia when, if people come here from abroad, there is a difficulty in making land available for them. </para>

                <para class="block">My reason for submitting the motion is that about two months and a half ago, the Senate decided, by a majority, that something should be done towards defraying the expenses incurred by a number of men who, unfortunately, were involved in the new Protection cases before the High Court. I do not know whether honorable senators were serious when they supported the motion to which I refer. But I take it that they really desired that the Government should give serious consideration to the unfortunate position of these men. Without going into details, it is sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end these men were hocussed and made the catspaws for the political interests, not of parties, but, to a large extent, of the party in power today. I make the following quotation from a speech made by the Prime Minister on nth March - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>No one would look forward to once more considering the Tariff, but it was possible that this House, after the publicly-announced intention of. the Government, would supplement it with what is popularly known as new Protection, and whatever might be the result of present proceedings the Government is absolutely bound by its undertaking. </para>

                <para class="block">Since we carried the motion to which I. have referred, we have had no intimation that the Government intend to give it any consideration. I believe that on one occasion there was a bald announcement that the Government would do nothing in the matter at all. Surely, when a majority of the Senate give expression to their opinions, they are entitled to consideration by the Government, and not to be merely put aside by those who were responsible for the position which was created. Why did the men engage in this struggle? It was not a case of men striking or entering into open rebellion, but a case where, owing to laxity on the part of the Government, men felt themselves compelled to take action to secure the proper administration of the law of the Commonwealth. Through the neglect of Ministers to discharge their duty, the men appealed to the Court, and produced evidence to prove that the manufacturers, who were receiving the benefit of a law which individual members of Parliament supported on a definite promise, were not observing the conditions which they had agreed to comply with, and which that law imposed upon them. Not only did the Government fail to administer the law, but, within a few hours, the Parliament is to be prorogued, with no provision made for the establishment of new Protection, or to meet the just and reasonable claims of the agricultural implement workers. No doubt we shall be told that the present Government are not responsible for the actions of their predecessors. But let me remind the Senate that nearly one-half the members of the last Deakin Ministry, who were responsible for this mess, owing to lax administration, are members of the present Government, and that we have had a declaration from the Prime Minister that their policy has been accepted by those who belonged to the other party. If it is a fact, as claimed by the Prime Minister, that the Fusion Government accepted the whole of his programme, what has become of the assurance that they would mete out justice to the workers through the medium of new Protection? It may be very interesting to honorable senators to know that the last Deakin Government believed that the workers had so successfully proved their case in the Court that they issued a writ for  £20,000  against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. McKay. Why was the writ issued? Because the men had proved their case up to the hilt, and so compelled the Government to take steps to enforce the law which should have been, vigorously administered six months previously. Since the men have been loaded up with a debt for law costs, no stand has been taken by the Government, beyond saying that they would not accept the responsibility of paying the bill. The Senate, after a full debate, and in the light of all the facts, declared, by a majority, that reasonable costs should be paid to the men. But the Government said that, inasmuch as the law had been declared to be unconstitutional, they could accept no further responsibility in regard to the matter. Next we had the hoax of the men being promised that the law would be amended in some shape, or brought into operation prior to the termination of this Parliament. We are all aware of the changes of Government which have taken place. But I am not aware, nor is any other honorable senator, that there is any change in the opinion of the majority of the members of both Houses that the workers should participate to a reasonable extent in the benefits derived from the Protectionist policy. What was the object of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act? On the  21st  September,  1906, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The Government have given their anxious consideration to this matter, and I take it that every member of this Committee acquiesces in the idea that we do not wish to impose duties merely to enrich manufacturers. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Clearly, the fact is that the members of each House were deliberately asked to vote  for high Protection to many industries, on the distinct promise from responsible Ministers that the men, through the medium of new Protection, or in some shape or form, would be permitted to participate. Yet, here we are to-night asked to pass this item, and to close the last session of this Parliament in the course of a few hours. The manufacturers are enjoying all the benefits of a high Tariff, but the workers are not permitted to share in them at all, and are still each contributing 3d. or 6d. per week towards the cost of an action undertaken to secure the administration of a law which should have been administered by the Government of the day. I am not quite clear as to what will be the position at the coming elections in connexion with this matter. Can the Minister of Trade and Customs, who put the Tariff through the Senate, with a distinct understanding in the mind of every honorable senator who voted for high duties that the workers were going to enjoy a fair share of the benefit of the Protection, say to-day that the Governments with which he has been associated have honestly and fearlessly endeavoured to extend that measure of justice to the men? Or, are we to take it that the promise made by . Ministers was not made seriously, or was not intended to be carried out? To further delude the men, a Bill was brought into the Senate a few weeks ago which purported to extend the benefits of new Protection through the medium of an InterState Commission. What has become of it? Have the Ministry abandoned it? Was it because a few honorable senators criticised certain portions of it that it was immediately relegated to the same position as the Navigation Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether the Minister thinks that at this stage of the session it is time for him to play with public business; but I have no hesitation in saying that the accusation that we on this side prevented the enactment of a new Protection law for the benefit of the workers is without any foundation. Nor can I give my honorable friend credit for believing that his statement contains the slightest truth. We refused to accept a Bill which required the workers, after they had been involved in law costs to the sum of £1,100 or £1,200, to appeal to the State Premiers, to. Wages Boards, to Industrial Courts, to a Judge, to the Inter-State Commission, and thence to the High Court on constitutional points, because the men had asked for a simple, effective law which would secure finality on an industrial question without being subjected' to enormous law costs. Will my honorable friend assert for a moment that the Government attempted to establish an easy, simple, and effective Court to which the men might directly appeal in order to have their labour difficulties adjusted? On the other hand, can the Government say that the Minister of Trade and Customs has not shirked the responsibility of his position? The Government have a majority when they want to crack the whip on some item. Seeing that they can induce honorable senators to vote against their convictions and their principles, surely if they were really honest and believed that the Inter-State Commission Bill would have redeemed their promise to the workers in the protected industries they could have made a little judicious use of the whip? It seems to me that it is never used when it is a case of trying to get a little justice extended to the workers. When, however, it is a case of doing something which will cripple the workers, the whip will always be cracked by the Government. So fair the employes in the agricultural implement industry have subscribed £25511s. in small coins, because it has been proved in the Industrial Court of the Commonwealth that they are receiving less than a reasonable living wage. If men in receipt of small wages can make an endeavour to pay what they believe to be their honest debt in that manner, surely the Government cannot shirk the responsibility of helping them in some form or other? Let me illustrate the class of men whose cause I am pleading. When a workmate was recently killed the men, instead of taking the half -day off to attend the funeral, went to work, and gave the half-day's pay to the widow. In other words, in one establishment alone the men contributed £200 to maintain the widow of a mate who had been killed at his work. That case should indicate their character. These are not men with a weak claim, or no claim, who are endeavouring to drag money out of the Treasury, but men who honestly desire to obtain justice, who were backed up by the promises of the last Deakin Government, who provided the very money to pay the rent of the halls in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> made to Australia the promise which brought him back to power, and in which a Minister who sits in this Chamber spoke. How can the Minister of Trade and Customs tell these men, whose subscriptions paid for the advertisements of his meetings at which he told his hearers that they would share in the benefits conferred by a Protective Tariff, that he is not going to redeem his promise? I have no desire to be personal, but I say that the Minister accepted the assistance of these workers to provide a fund whereby he might carry on propaganda work for the purpose of educating the people up to the claims of the new Protection. He endeavoured to obtain that Protection, but failed to do so. The Prime Minister then promised that, in some shape, his pledge to the workers in the protected industries of Australia would be redeemed. But has it been redeemed? When this Parliament has ceased to exist, can the Minister face those workers, and say, " We would have dealt with the question, but we had not time?" Is that the explanation which he intends to give to the men who have so generously assisted him in the past? I ask for some assurance from the honorable gentleman that serious consideration will be given to their claims, and that some respect shall be paid to the majority decision of the Senate that the expenses incurred by the Agricultural Implement Makers' Employes Union shall be paid by the Commonwealth. I see my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> smiling, and he may well smile, because he has the enthusiastic admiration of those who sent him to this Parliament, and who are glad that the Fusion Government have proved sufficiently powerful to play the hypocritical game of introducing a measure which they never intended should become law. We know that when the Fusion Government was formed outside assistance was required to bring the various parties composing it into agreement. One section of the Fusion party had previously been described by the Prime Minister as " the wreckage of all the reactionaries of the Commonwealth, the remnants of the black labour party, and of all the other defeated elements in Australia." When the various parties to the Fusion had been brought together, representatives of the Chamber of Manufactures and the Chamber of Commerce actually met and made the Fusion what is today. While some honorable senators opposite were excluded from the conference between the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, representatives of these institutions were allowed to enter it. Apparently the dropping of the new Protection by the Government is the reward of those persons for the magnificent services which they have rendered to the Fusion party. </para>

                    <para>.This matter- has been exhaustively debated in the Senate. On the 9th December a motion was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> expressing the opinion that the Commonwealth should bear the legal expenses incurred by the Agricultural Implement Makers' Union in enforcing the provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1906. The result of the division on that motion was that fourteen senators voted for it and eleven against it. The Government, nevertheless, said that they did not intend to pay the slightest notice. When the next Supply Bill was brought forward, I moved a request with the object of reaffirming the opinion of the Senate that justice should ne done to the men. It must be apparent to everybody that they have been subjected to a gross wrong. Parliament, under the guidance of the Deakin Government, passed a Bill embodying the principle of the new Protection, and enabling Excise to be collected in the event of certain employers not paying reasonable wages and observing reasonable industrial conditions. The chief manufacturer in the agricultural implement making trade was not observing decent industrial conditions. So much "was shown when the subject was investigated in the Law Courts. If the Government of the day had enforced the law and had collected the Excise due they would have had a fund from which to pay the expenses incurred by the men, and they would at least have shown their sincerity with reference to the Act which they have placed upon the statute-book. But they were half-hearted, and seemed indisposed to defend their own Act. Consequently, a number of men had to provide out of their own earnings a fund to test the validity of the Act. We all remember how certain industries were picked out for special consideration under a Tariff which was brought before Parliament twelve months before the general Tariff Bill was introduced. The clear understanding was that these manufacturers were to observe the principles of new Protection, and pay their employes reasonable wages. They did not carry out their undertaking. Had . the Government enforced the Act, the employes would not have been compelled to pay these legal expenses out of their own pocket. I consider that an overwhelming case has been made out, and that the Government should accede to the request now made. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that this matter should have had to be brought up again. I can sympathize with the position of the Government, and their reluctance to initiate a novel precedent. But it has to be remembered that one branch of the Legislature has already expressed its opinion, and that the Government have refused to act upon it. In view of all the circumstances, I feel that the Government might well have acceded to the request that has been made. The men in question proceeded in all good faith under an Act of Parliament. If the law had not been discovered to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> I presume that costs would have been paid to them. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, had the men secured a material increase in their wages they would thereby have been enabled to bear these costs much easier. I think that a mistake has been made in imparting a controversial spirit to the application instead of endeavouring to get the money for the men by other methods. It is advisable that we should discuss the question temperately, having always in view the object which we profess - to get for the men affected the amount for which they have become liable. That is what I am anxious to do. I shall vote for the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell, although its adoption may have the effect of sending the Bill back elsewhere. I shall vote for it, because it will be a means of obtaining an emphatic expression of opinion from one branch of the Legislature. The men have undoubtedly sustained hardship. They are an association of honorable men. They have not endeavoured to get out of their liability by refusing to pay. They are week by week endeavouring to accumulate a fund out of which to pay the money. Having regard to their current responsibilities, it is probable that the debt will hang upon them like an old man of the sea for months, and, perhaps, years. Therefore, I consider that the Government ought, even at this late hour, to reconsider their position, and to meet the obligation. I am inclined to think that they, might try to modify the Bill that has been  presented. I understand that an undertaking was given by their predecessors in office that they would ask Parliament to grant to these men, not all that they claimed in the way of costs, but a substantial modicum of what they claimed, in order to relieve them of the heavier part of their burden. If the whole Bill cannot be paid by the Government, I earnestly urge that they should, if necessary, have the costs taxed. At any rate, they should arrive at a fair and proper decision, with a view of relieving the men of the great obligation that has been entailed upon them, as I think, unfairly. There is reasonable ground for complaint that action was not taken by the authorities before the men took proceedings. They were forced into action by tardiness on the part of the responsible authorities to accent responsibility. Consideration should surely be given to that fact. </para>

                    <para>[11.14]. - I am sorry that my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell, has seen fit to bring this matter up again. It has been twice before the Senate, and I do not see that any useful end is to be served bv blocking the Appropriation Bill. I wish to correct what is evidently a misapprehension in the minds of some honorable senators. The Government are just as full of sympathy for, and as anxious to do justice to, these men, as are any other honorable senators. But they have a serious public responsibility, which I hope they will discharge according to their best wisdom and judgment. First of all, it must be realized that the proceedings in which these men took part were entered upon voluntarily, and of their own volition. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> would have to be paid if these men are paid. It has been stated that Parliament authorized the payment of these expenses. The matter has been fully discussed in another place, and if it had been resolved there that the payment should be made, provision for it would have been included in the Estimates. It is true that we have recorded our view, but before the payment can be made it must have the sanction of both Houses of this Parliament. I would urge upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell that nothing is to be gained by persisting with the request he has submitted. It can only have the result of blocking the passage of the Bill unduly. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell will be wise in persisting with his request, whether to do so will block the passage of this Bill or not. It is not wise to rush a Bill of this kind through in a few hours, and we might very well call a halt to consider this very important question. Some little time ago a majority of the Senate, after due deliberation, decided in favour of the Government paying the legal expenses incurred bv the men in this test case. It is a remarkable fact that on the afternoon on which we came to that decision, the same matter had been discussed in another branch of the Legislature, and the Prime Minister had stated that he would not be a part to the payment of the expenses incurred bv the Employes Union. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> sneaking on the motion in the Senate, said that the Government would consider the Question, though the honorable senator knew that his chief had said that the Government would not pav the money. It is evident that there must have been hedging somewhere. I shall support the request, which, if carried, will involve no reflection upon the Department, but merely a ratification of the decision of the Senate that the expenses incurred by these men in testing an Act of this Parliament should be paid. The Minister of Trade and Customs has said that a misapprehension has existed. That may be, but it will not help the men. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> along with his chief, was an ardent advocate of the principle of new Protection. This Parliament passed a measure which initiated the principle, and these men incurred considerable expense in testing the validity of the Act. </para>

If you are successful in getting the Government to pay, which I consider they should, it was no fault of ours the Act was declared unconstitutional, therefore, the Government should pay.

Whether the amount claimed is sufficient or not neither the Senate nor the other House is competent to judge. On this side, as well as' on the other, it has been admitted that, inasmuch as the men were driven to test, and were defeated in testing, the constitutionality of an Act, consideration ought to be given to their claim. I suggest to honorable senators that if the claim is to be justified on a fairly equitable, ground, we cannot determine the amount. I think that the claim of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell,</inline> who evidently gave a great deal of attention and time to the case, ought to be submitted, like every other claim, to the taxing master before we are asked to vote any money. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see why I should not say a few words on the question. He stated that it should have been brought forward earlier. As a matter of fact, that was done. If ever a claim was made which had a basis of justice it is the claim which is now under Consideration. The employes in the agricultural implement industry took a certain action under an Act of. this Parliament, which every one had a. right to assume was constitutional, but on account of an imperfection in it they were mulcted in very heavy law costs, which they request should be recouped to them, as their action had the effect of proving that the law was ineffective. In other words, the request is that the Government, which ought to be responsible for the Act being imperfect or inoperative, should pay the costs of the appeal to the Court. In my opinion it is a perfectly just claim. I think that the action of any Government in resisting the just application of the men, who acted on the assumption that the Act of Parliament was quite reliable, is deplorable. </para>

                        <para>- I am continually asked, sir, whether I will allow honorable senators to catch their trains. An enthusiastic supporter of the Government, through rising when a vote might have been taken, made me miss my last tram. I do not see why I should not have the sympathy of  some honorable senators in my misfortune, and the only way in which sympathy can be secured is by their being placed in similar circumstances. What I wish to emphasize is that the Commonwealth Parliament enacted a law under which certain steps were taken by employes who were interested in the observance of that law. Upon being appealed to, the High Court declared that that law was' unconstitutional. All that these men now ask is that they shall be reimbursed the costs to which they were subjected in instituting proceedings before that tribunal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger claims that this question should have been dealt with earlier in the session, but I hold that the Government are entirely to blame in that connexion. Personally, I think that the men engaged in the agricultural implement industry have established a reasonable claim to compensation. </para>

                    <para>. - Upon a former occasion I voted in favour of a motion having a similar object to that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell has submitted. But it seems to me that tonight he was much more desirous of attacking the Government than of securing justice for those whose cause he advocated'. Since I voted upon the motion to which I have alluded, I have made inquiries into the legal position, and I am advised that the payment by the Commonwealth of the costs of the Agricultural Implement Makers' Employes' Union would establish a very dangerous precedent. Whilst everybody must sympathize with the men who have been led into this <inline font-style="italic">impasse,</inline> we must consider what would be the result if the Government conceded their claim. In addition, it cannot be denied that extravagant charges have been made in connexion  with their costs. For instance, we find an ordinary mechanic charging £5 5s. per day for' attendance at the Arbitration Court, when his ordinary wages would probably be about 12s. a day. Is not such a charge an attempt to rob the workers. But that is only one portion of the trouble. I am led to believe that under our system of government the constitutionality of any law enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament may be tested in the High Court. When this case came before that tribunal three Justices declared that the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act was unconstitutional, whilst two others affirmed that it was constitutional. If we are going to establish a precedent under which the parties aggrieved may take every law of doubtful constitutionality to the High </para>

To-night I repeat the offer which I made on a formeroccasion.If my honorable friends opposite can get thirty or forty men who will each subscribe £10 towards reimbursing the agricultural implement makers' employes the costs to which they were subjected in testing the validity of the Act,I am prepared to subscribe my share. </para>

We took over the officers just as we found them. They were experienced in the work, and, moreover, it has been the practice of the Commonwealth in taking over Departments from States to utilize the officers who have acquired experience in the work. </para>

It appears to me that the Deputy Commissioner for Old-age Pensions in New South Wales receives as much as the Deputy Commissioners of all the other States put together. The administration in New -South Wales has evidently been most expensive. It is really a serious matter, because we find the cost of the Public Service extending in all directions. 'It behoves us to look after these small leakages. Tf we are not careful, we shall have a " Black Wednesday " in the Commonwealth, such as we had in Victoria many years ago. If the Government had to take over the officers of the New South Wales office, they should have been put in positions commensurate with the salaries received. </para>

It was felt that the electoral officer, to whom my honorable friend has referred in terms of well-deserved commendation, had already such multifarious and burdensome duties to perform that it would be unwise to add to his work, whereas the gentleman who has been appointed was in close touch with the magistrates and others with whom he has to work in the administration of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. </para>

                        <para>- When the sitting was suspended, I was pointing out the disparity in the cost of the administration of the Old-age Pensions Office in Western Australia and Tasmania. I see that there is a footnote, which states that the Deputy Commissioner in Western Australia is also paid £700 a year as Public Service In spector, and that the Deputy Commissioner in Tasmania is paid by that State  as  Under-Secretary. Nevertheless, considering the greater area of Western Australia, and the probability that there are not so many applicants in Tasmania, and the delays there have been in the payment  of  the pensions to genuine applicants, I should like to know the reasons for the disparity in the cost. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that the reply of the Minister is an explanation.  I  take it that, when the staffs were appointed to the Old-age Pensions. Offices of the various States, it was not known how many applications would be made, nor how many old-age. pensioners there would be. In Western Australia there is a Deputy Commissioner at £100, a clerk at £185, and another clerk at £45, making a total  of  £33° <inline font-style="italic">&gt;</inline> while in Tasmania there is a De,puty Commissioner at £100, and two clerks at £185 and £160 respectively, with a long-service increment "of £20. Surely the clerk in Western Australia, who now receives ,£45, is* entitled to the same grading as the Tasmanian clerk, who receives £160? I take it that it is a matter of grading, and not a matter of the number of applicants, which could not have been known when the appointments were made. </para>

When we compare the greater distances, the increased trouble in obtaining evidence in proof of the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the applicants, and so forth, the position should be reversed so far as the cost of administration is concerned. In Western Australia  a  number of the applicants have had to refer to relatives or to acquaintances in the other five States. The inquiries from other States entailed a greater amount of work on the staff in Western Australia; and, ia  the circumstances, I cannot accept the Minister's explanation as final. </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that, and I look upon him as an ideal man for certain purposes. I believe he is kind of heart, but he does not show it in his manner, and he is not the right stamp of man to deal with the old folk who are applicants for old-age pensions. They are often illiterate and timid in approaching any one in an official position. Though the object of the Commissioner may be merely to hurry them along and get their explanations, if they are treated in a brusque and somewhat overbearing manner, they go away under the impression that they have been treated unkindly. I have no desire whatever to injure <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green</inline> ; but the numerous complaints I have received force me to the conclusion that he is not the best man for this work. I could mention other officers in Western Australia who would be much better fitted for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green's</inline> office is in the Federal building in Perth, and from what I could judge, he should have plenty to do with his duties as Public Service Inspector.

On one occasion, I witnessed the administration of the Act by a police magistrate, and I regretted to observe that it was not sympathetic. The applicant was an elderly woman who had no one to represent her, and she was treated with a brusqueness which I am certain did not betoken unfriendliness, want of heart, or lack of consideration, but was nevertheless calculated to inspire the applicant with the feeling to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has just referred - the feeling of doubt and misgiving m approaching persons in authority. The applicant in this case was told to come again and to produce certain evidence and documents ; and I felt sure she left with the intention that she would never come again, to undergo a repetition of the humiliation to which she had then, as she thought, been subjected. We have a right to ask that all officers administering the Act should administer it kindly, with a true sense of the responsibility imposed upon them, and with a due regard to the feelings which actuated this Parliament, and the people behind it, in passing such a measure. </para>

I have received a very large number of rather serious complaints from my own State. The investigation of many of the cases has been perfectly satisfactory to me, and in most of them to the applicants themselves ; but the evidence goes to show that there must be something wrong; with the administration of the law in Western Australia, I do not know what it is, but- I am of opinion that it is wanting in sympathy, and I think that if the Governmentadopt the attitude suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

I do not think there has been any intention on the part of the Government to select an unsympathetic officer, or that there is any intention on the part of an officer to be unsympathetic, but there are men whose natures are not warm enough to permit of their dealing properly with a system of this kind.

I shall certainly draw the attention of my right honorable colleague to the statements that have been made. Among the vast number of officials associated with the administration of the Act, there must be men of different temperaments. There are men whose intentions are good, but who have an extraordinary way of exhibiting what are perhaps the best of natures. On the other hand, they have sometimes a very difficult task to perform by reason of the peculiar disposition of the applicants themselves. Some of the applicants in the cases that have been investigated have been, to some extent, to blame for what has been the subject of complaint. As to'

If it is a fact that he is overburdened by his duties as Public Service Inspector, and that his duties under' this Act are thus made more or less irksome to him,I shall draw the attention of mv right honorable colleague to it.

On more than one occasion when I have drawn attention to the unsatisfactory way in which the office is being worked, from a Commonwealth point of view, the promise has been made that there would be appointed a gentleman who would be able to state exactly what property we had in the office, the extent to which it had depreciated, and the value of the type and other material there.

It is a very fair allowance, having regard to the manner in which our printing is attended to. </para>

I am under the impression that a very great deal ought to be saved in connexion with our printing.' When I observe the quantity of literature which is thrown away and wasted in one way and another, and find that our printing bill is running up to about £too,ooo a year, it suggests to me that a very great saving might be effected. It seems to me that £1,600 is a very large sum to vote for the distribution of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and Parliamentary papers. We ought to be able to make some saving, especially in regard to the printing and distribution of papers. </para>

If the Governor-General is willing to go to the trouble of travelling, I am sure that the desire is to encourage rather than discourage him. I know that every State is anxious that  His Excellency  should visit not only the capital, but also various parts of the State. I believe that honorable senators will willingly appropriate this item for the purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - With regard to the vote of £1,267 for stamp printing, I have made several protests against the treatment of certain employes in the Stamps Branch. I have been told several times that various reasons for continuing a degrading position of things are quite apparent. I intend to offer an effective protest unless I receive from the Minister very satisfactory reasons why the female employes are paid from 7 s. 6d. to £1 a week, and a distinct promise that the employes, particularly the long service employes, who have been working for sixteen, eighteen, and twenty years, will receive at once a considerable advance on their present wages. If that promise be not forthcoming, I shall move for a reduction of this item, and press my proposal to a division. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee such information as he mav possess in regard to the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> I have on more than one occasion called the attention of the Minister in charge of this' Bill to what I regard as the unfair treatment which is being meted out to certain female employes in the Stamps Printing Branch. We have been told that in some instances female employes who have been more than twenty years in the service of the State are not receiving the minimum salary prescribed in our Public Service Act, namely, £110 a year. We know that when the Commonwealth took over a number of State employes in other branches of the service their salaries were immediately jumped to that minimum. I dare say that the opinion of the gentleman who is in charge of the Stamp Printing Branch was sought by the Public Service Commissioner, but I have yet to learn that the provisions of a Statute are to be set aside merely upon his opinion. He himself has been granted a very considerable increase. Will the Minister of Trade and Customs tell the Committee what was his salary when he was in the employ of the South Australian Government? </para>

If we wish to get the best work, we must pay our officers in accordance with the value of the work which they perform. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson's</inline> complaints in regard to many girls and women who are employed in this branch of the Public Service are thoroughly justified. I hope that the Government, in order to secure efficiency, will see that justice is done to every one of their employes.

                    has had an opportunity of looking through the report bearing upon it of the Public Service Commissioner.- The position is that the Commonwealth determined to take over the Stamps Printing Branch. In doing so it took over fourteen employes who were previously engaged init. Three of these were permanent employes, who were appointed to permanent positions in the Commonwealth service at the maximum salary at which they had* been employed by the State, namely, £72- per annum. Eleven temporary employes,, whose duties are of a simple character, such as -perforating and counting postage stamps, were also taken over. Their duties can be readily learned by any girl in a fortnight or three weeks. Some of these temporary employe's, it is true, had been in the service of the State for fourteen or fifteen years. They were taken over by the Commonwealth at the same salary which they had been previously paid.

All these temporary employes were taken over by the Commonwealth at the salaries which they had been paid by the several States. The position is this. We started <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> new branch of the Public Service. It was considered that no injustice would be dene by allowing the employes in that branch to continue for some time on the old terms. In the meantime it was desired to ascertain what the requirements of the branch were, and what new machinery was necessary. The Public Service Commissioner has undertaken to revise the whole of the conditions in February next. He will" then determine what permanent staff is required, and what wages shall be 'paid. Under the circumstances, I suggest that my honorable friend might wait until the decision of the Public Service Commissioner is given. If the arrangement then made is not satisfactory, the matter can be brought up again. </para>

                    <para>. - I have had an opportunity to peruse the report which the Minister of Trade and Customs has before him, and I am dissatisfied with it. I do not doubt that the wages paid to the employes in the Stamps Branch axe those which were paid by the Victorian Government. I am quite satisfied that the Commonwealth took over the employes on the old terms. My complaint is against those wages being continued to be paid by the Commonwealth of Australia. Liberal advances have been made by the Commonwealth to most public servants. Some officers within a few years have been jumped up from £.180 to £200, £300, and _£3'5°. <inline font-style="italic">V**</inline> annum. The salary of the Commissioner himself has been raised from £1,200 to £1,500. Yet this same Commissioner has not been able to persuade himself that the women taken over at a wage of £1 per week are worth 25s. The time has arrived when a strong protest should be made against such administration. There is no necessity for the Commissioner to- wait until February next before determining that the services of any women are worth more than  £t  per week. It is an absolute disgrace to us that we should be paying such wages. A woman is worth more than £1 per week if she does no more than sit on a doorstep and sell matches. These women have to maintain themselves in respectability, and the wages which they are now receiving are quite insufficient. Though it has taken the Commissioner nearly twelve months to find out whether a woman is worth more than £1 per week, it did not take him long to find out that, in his own opinion, he himself was worth more than £1,200 a year. I, therefore, move by way of protest - </para>

He has also stated that the Commissioner will reclassify the employes in February next. In the meantime, however, it is necessary that this Committee should affirm the necessity of a living wage being paid. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that the wage at present paid to these employes is a disgrace to the Commonwealth. Yesterday we passed a measure increasing the salary of the Public Service Commissioner by £300 a year, yet there axe girls and women employed under the supervision of that gentleman receiving sums varying, to take the Minister's own words, from 9s. to £1 per week, after rendering fourteen or fifteen years' service to the States and Commonwealth, while the Public Service Commissioner has given us only nine years' service. The Minister tells us that if we are determined to increase their wages they will be dismissed. </para>

The time has come for this Parliament to insist on all its employes in every branch of the service receiving at least a living wage. If the Minister thinks that from 9s. to £1 a week is a living wage, the sooner he reconsiders his position the better. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister the administration of the Patent Branch, more particularly as regards the Commissioner of Patents. I have received from Messrs. Griffiths and Allen - I think that is the name - the following statement of a case - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>On the 30th March, 1909, the applicants through our firm made application to the Registrar of Trade Marks for an order for the lodging of , £40 as security for costs under section 46 of the Commonwealth Trade Marks Act, which reads as follows :  - " If a person giving notice of opposition or appeal does not reside in Australia the Registrar, Law Officer, or the Court may order him to give security for costs, and if the Order is not complied with the opposition or appeal shall be deemed to be abandoned." </para>
                    <para>On the 26th April, 1909, we received the decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks, to the effect that the opponents should lodge security for costs for the amount asked, on the condition that a similar amount be lodged by the applicants on the ground that they also were resident outside the jurisdiction of the Victorian Courts, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> in the State of New South Wales. To this latter condition we objected on the ground, that the Courts of any State are com-' petent to recover costs granted by the Registrar equally with those of Victoria, and that if permitted to stand without protest, this decision would place Australian applications outside the State of Victoria at a distinct disadvantage. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Without going through the whole history of the case, the facts are that the Commissioner was held by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs to have wrongly laid it down that security, for costs must be given in another State as if people in any State other than Victoria were outside the Commonwealth ; and his decision was therefore reversed. It is singular that the Commissioner of Patents should interpret, as applying to a person residing in New South Wales, a provision which allows the Registrar to order a person not resident in Australia, on giving notice of opposition or appeal, to furnish security. He appears to me not to be <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with the law which he is administering. On the 24th. November, I asked a series of questions of which I will read two, and the answers returned to them. They are these: - </para>

                    <para>The Commissioner of Patents had no alternative but to ask the applicant of No. 11396 to pay the fee prescribed by Regulation 14 for the necessary extension of three months. </para>
                    <para>The delay in acceptance - which rendered necessary the payment of the fee - was partly due to an oversight in the Patent Office (one month) during the Commissioner's absence, but for the principal delay (two months) that office was not responsible. </para>

                    <para>The Applicant's Attorney did reply on the 15th March last to objections raised by the Examiner. Owing to the absence of the Commissioner, who had previously dealt with, the application, the papers were held until his return, and reply was sent on the 29th April, and was received by the Applicant's Attorney too late to avoid a request being made for extension of time. </para>

                        <para>- Had it not been for the delay occasioned by the inaction of the Department, the application would have been in time. The applicant's attorney replied on the 15th March to the objections of the examiner, but the papers were not sent on until the 29th April, after the application had lapsed. These cases are not altogether creditable to the Commissioner. Let me refer to a third case about which questions were asked in another place. The Commissioner has objected to the application of one firm for the use of certain words, and has allowed another firm to use precisely similar words. He objected . to the use of the word " Dudley," presumably because that is the name of the Governor-General, and allowed the use of the word " Chelmsford," although that is the name of the Governor of New South Wales. When the head of the firm to which I have referred, greatly irritated by the lapsing of the patent, and the damage likely to be done to their business, wrote a strongly worded letter to the Commissioner, the latter threatened to suspend him for disgraceful conduct. I have read the letter, and do not think that under the circumstances it should have been objected to. However, the firm was not wealthy enough to appeal to the High Court, and, therefore, felt constrained to withdraw the letter and apologize. The Commissioner's action appears to me to be very high-handed) and in view ot the facts that  1  have put before him,  I  think that the Minister should inquire whether he is showing a proper capacity for his duties. </para>

                    <para>[2.9 a.m.]. - The Commissioner of Patents holds a high and important position. About 1,400 applications are dealt with by him every year, but, like the Justices of the High Court and every one else, he occasionally makes mistakes. I have no doubt that he honestly strives to do his duty, and it must be admitted that he is a man of great experience, having filled the office for a considerable time, and having had State experience in Queensland. It is quite possible that the Commissioner has made the mistakes mentioned, though I am not going to admit all that has been alleged, certainly not in one of the cases. In regard to exacting security for costs because a company was registered outside Victoria, the Commissioner was held by the High Court to have been wrong ; but, as to having refused permission to use the title " Dudley," while giving permission to use the title " Chelmsford," he may have been perfectly right. According to law no name can be used which is essentially and merely the name of a person; but "Chelmsford" is not only the name of a person, but the name of a place. It is by reason of that distinction that the Commissioner in his discretion saw fit to grant the application so far as " Chelmsford " was concerned. I am sorry to say that there is very strong feeling, at least on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffiths,</inline> against the Commissioner, and the latter has complained to me.  I  am not going to say for one moment that the Commissioner has been completely right or tactful in all he has done. </para>

                            did summon him under a particular section for misconduct. That summons was for misconduct, in regard to which the Commissioner thought he had power to take action, in connexion with a most improper letter, containing  a  charge, which, if true, or bearing the semblance of truth, would quite unfit

No one knows better than the honorable senator that there is, in this case, no necessity for imposing exchange in the nature of a toll - for that is all it means - as if on the transmission of specie from one bank to another, because, as a matter of fact, there is no actual transmission of specie, but only a bookkeeping adjustment. I hope that the banks, in regard to Commonwealth cheques, will follow the example which is set in connexion with Government cheques within a State, on which no exchange is charged, no matter in what part of the State they may be paid or presented. </para>

                    <para>. - In connexion with the Estimates for the Defence Department, I should like to direct attention to the fact that a military camp is to be held in January at Seymour, which it is understood will be visited by Lord Kitchener. The Defence authorities of this State do not regard as satisfactory the replies they have received to inquiries as to the number of men who will attend the camp. It must be remembered that it is proposed to hold an eight days' camp, which will start almost immediately after the Christmas holidays. In the circumstances, it is rather too much to expect the men to put in so much time in camp at such a period of the year, without some compensation. It is all very well to appeal to their patriotism; but that will not pay the landlord, the butcher, or the baker, and it. will not provide the men with clothing for themselves and families. If the Government wish to make a military display with a large number of men at that time of the year, they should be prepared to pay them for the four extra days which they will be asked to put in at the camp. I may mention that yesterday in another place, a half promise to give consideration to the matter was made. The Minister of Defence said that he could not give a definite promise because he was not Treasurer ; but that cannot be regarded as satisfactory to the men. I hope that the Minister representing the Department in the Senate will be able to give some assurance that the men attending the camp at Seymour will receive just compensation. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to know from the Vice-President of the Executive Council, when the Government propose to fill the vacancy of Chief of Ordnance on the Military Board? I should say that there never was a time in the history of the Commonwealth when the services of such an officer were more urgently required. We are initiating a new military system, and are ordering large quantities of ammunition and material. The position has now been vacant for over six months. I should like to mention also that it was understood that a British officer would come to Australia to take the place of  Colonel Bridges  on the Imperial General Staff, as that gentleman is now in England acting as our representative in the Imperial General Staff there. I should like to know whether that understanding is to be carried out. Then perhaps the Minister will be able to say whether the office of Inspector-General is to. be abolished or allowed to remain vacant, and whether, if it is to be continued, an Australian or an Imperial Officer will be appointed. At this hour of the morning I do not intend to debate these matters. But in view of the fact that the salaries for these positions appear on the Estimates although they have been vacant for six months it is not unreasonable to expect that the Government will be able to make some statement in connexion with them. </para>

With respect to the filling of the vacancy in the position of Chief of Ordnance, and the other position referred to, the delay is due to the fact that the whole of these questions may be brought under review in consequence of the alteration necessary on the passing of the new Defence Bill.

                    <para>. - In connexion with the vote of £.100 for the Commonwealth Council of the Rifle Association of Australia, I should like to refer to the fact that some time ago I brought under the notice of the Senate the inequality in the- grants to various rifle associations throughout the Commonwealth. The Minister at the time promised to bring the matter under the notice of his colleague with a view to having the grants made in proportion to the population of a State, the number of riflemen in the State, or the number of efficients. At present the grants are distributed on the principle that kissing goes by favour. I should like to' know whether any alteration is to be made in the distribution of the grants? </para>

I am sure he will see that it would be impossible,, not merely, at this late period of the session, but at this early hour of the day for us to discuss a proposition of that kind. At the same time, if he is content to take my assurance on the subject, I feel satisfied that there is no one in the Senate, and no section of the people outside, who would now venture to controvert the affirmation laid down in the motion. </para>
