                    <para>- I desire to refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> report of an incident which occurred here last night, with no desire to resurrect it, but merely to point out that, in the report, I have not been fairly dealt with. It says - &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> made an interjection which was inaudible.&#34; At the close of the incident I rose and distinctly stated that I had made no interjection which would reflect upon the honour or integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> When a newspaper takes upon itself the duty of reporting such incidents I think that in common justice to all concerned my statement should have been published, otherwise it looks as if I had been the culprit throughout the piece. I thought it well to draw attention to the unfair manner in which the incident was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> I hope that in the future when newspapers report such matters they will deal out even-handed justice to all concerned. . </para>

I do not wish to elaborate the question, but perhaps I may be permitted to point out that at present any one who wishes to get into the Navy, either here or in England, experiences considerable difficulty in ascertaining the necessary steps to be taken. </para>

At the same time, quite apart from my personal feelings, I would point nut that in bringing forward this Bill the Government are merely seeking to give effect to the wishes of Parliament as expressed by an Act passed in the closing days of last session. In so doing, they are, I might remind honorable senators, following the excellent lead set by two previous Administrations. </para>

                            <para>-By the Reid-McLean Administration, which made an effort to give effect to a Bill passed in  1904,  and by the Fisher Administration, which certainly did, in the closing days of last session by the introduction of a. Bill, seek to carry this matter further towards finality. &#34; I can only express the hope that the decision of honorable senators on the Bill will place the matter at that stage when we can reasonably say that finality has been reached. I do not propose to-day to ask their attention for ari&#39; undue time, because it appears to me that the question now is resolved into very narrow limits. I shall endeavour to make my statement as brief and business-like as I can. I ask honorable senators to bear in mind what is the main purpose of the Bill. I might summarize what has taken place since we last had before us a proposition dealing with the Capital Site. I would remind honorable senators, as a preface that, so far, Parliament has never expressed its wish, or arrived at any determination as to the Federal Territory, nor has it definitely determined the site of the city itself. What it did do by the Bill passed last year was to indicate a locality within which it thought that the city should be situated, and necessarily, by so doing it indicated a point round which the territory should lap. The last Government proceeded with commendable promptitude to give effect to that Bil-1. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Surveyor</inline> Scrivener was immediately instructed to proceed to the spot with a view to obtaining such a report as would enable the Minister, and later on the Parliament, to arrive at a determination&#39;. I desire to briefly refer to what has been the subject of some controversy with our legal friends, and that is as to the exact order of procedure under section  125  of the Constitution. I do not propose to enter into that controversy, but merely to indicate what appears to me to be the point about which it ranged, and that was as to whether or not the territory should be selected before the site of the city could be determined, or whether we could select the site cf the city first, and determine the territory afterwards. No doubt, from a legal stand-point it may be an interesting point, but to my mind the whole thing presented .itself in the way of two men approaching a turnstile through which only one could pass at a time, both being desirous of going through, and it not mattering materially which of them went through first. It seemed to me equally immaterial as to which step we should take first in this matter. It is quite obvious that it would have been impossible for Parliament to actively determine the boundaries of the territory without being satisfied beforehand that there was within the territory some site suitable for a city. On the other hand it would have been equally foolish to have definitely decided on a city site without paying some regard to the territory surrounding it. It seems to me that these two factors had to be considered together. Parliament having passed an Act indicating generally a locality, the previous Government, through the Minister of Home Affairs, deputed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> to proceed on to the land with a view to making inquiries and surveys. I should like to show that the instructions given to that gentleman were of a character to which no possible exception could be  taken. Whilst they directed his attention to those points which perhaps were of major importance, and which would naturally suggest themselves to the mind of any one, he was left the freest possible scope in the discharge of his duties. </para>

                    <para class="block">All these calculations dealing with water supply are on the basis of a consumption of 100 gallons per head per day. To show that these estimates are on a safe and conservative side, I would point out that the consumption in Sydney is less than 40 gallons per head per day, and in Melbourne 59^ gallons. It will therefore be seen that these calculations are based on more than twice the daily consumption in Sydney, and nearly twice the consumption in Melbourne. That part of the report deals more with the site of the city. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> went on to deal with the territory, but I propose to leave that to a later portion of my address. On the receipt of the report, the Minister constituted an Advisory Board, consisting of  Colonel Miller, Colonel Owen, Colonel Vernon,  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener.</inline> After an inquiry, the Board agreed generally with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener&#39;s</inline> report, but asked that certain contour levels should be made, suggested an exploration as to a practical route from the Capital site to the sea, and generally desired further information. The Minister promptly instructed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> to that effect, and he proceeded to ascertain additional levels. He reported in due course that he had taken contour surveys of 35 miles of levels at the heights of 1,825, 1,850, 1,875,1,900. 1,950, and 2,000 feet, with intermediate levels. He had also made an inspection of the country between Canberra and Jervis Bay with a view to determining the probable route for a railway between these places, and found that from about the 168- mile post on the Goulburn-Cooma railway line to Jervis Bay, a practicable railway, with a ruling gradient not worse than one in forty, and probably as flat as one in fifty, could be obtained. </para>

Time, of course, is some object? with a House which is so keen on proceeding with business, as the Senate invariably is. Dealing with the important matter of sewerage, the Board stated - </para>

                        <para>Respecting the sewerage of the proposed Federal Capital City, the Board considered that no engineering difficulties will be encountered in a satisfactory disposal of sewage, and the effluent from treatment works. It will be necessary to make provision for dealing with the storm waters, in which connexion the general fall of the land favours a satisfactory scheme. </para>
                        <para>The Board advised that there is a supply of perennially clear and pure water in the Cotter River. The catchment area of this river, above the point at which the gauge readings for igo8 were taken, embraces an area of about 0  170  square miles. According to the  1908  records the supply at the point of  gaugage  is sufficient for the domestic&#39; and civic requirements of a population of  250,000. </para>

The total catchment is about  500  square miles. Ornamental water may be conserved at the city by means of a weir at any one of the sites indicated on the map of the contour survey of Canberra. </para>
                        <para>The Board were of opinion that a practicable route for railway communication can be found between the site of the Federal Capital City and Jervis Bay, but considered that before the locality is finally decided upon an extensive examination of the intervening country should be made, in order that all requirements may be met. </para>

My honorable friend must admit that there can be no disadvantage in having two strings to one&#39;s bow. After some correspondence, and one or two interviews, which took place between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premier of New South Wales, and also between the Premier and the Minister of Home Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller, Mr. Wade</inline> submitted on the 16th. September certain propositions to the Parliament of New South Wales. These propositions, besides dealing with several matters to which I shall refer later on - matters&#39; which I may say relate to either of the proposed areas - suggested some modifications upon the area recommended bv the Advisory Board. The Minister for Home Affairs, having learnt of the suggested modifications, submitted them to the Advisory. Board, which reported, amongst other things, that the modified area suggested was somewhat less than that prescribed in the Act passed by this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade&#39;s</inline> attention having been drawn to that fact, an additional  area was included in the modification suggested, making the total area over  900  square miles, so . as to conform with the Federal Act. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that point immediately. I want now to invite attention to two maps which are hanging upon the wall of this chamber. A glance at them will enable honorable senators to follow my subsequent remarks more clearly. The map on the left hand represents the scheme recommended by the Advisory Board in the first instance. The area has been described as being somewhat .like a horseshoe, but I doubt whether it is entitled to such a. symmetrical comparison. The map on the right represents- the modification suggested by the Parliament of New South Wales. The area coloured on that map is the area which it is proposed by the New South Wales Parliament to vest absolutely in the Commonwealth. The other portion of the map, which is merely edged with red, and which it will be seen was included in the Advisory Board&#39;s original proposition, is the area over which the New South Wales&#39; Parliament suggested that the Commonwealth should have complete water rights. I want now to come back to the point at which I broke off just now, and to invite honorable senators to consider what the position is. It is this. We have never yet determined what the Federal Territory is to be. This Bill is submitted to enable Parliament to make such a determination. There are practically two schemes available from which to make a choice - that is, the scheme shown on the map on the left, which represents the Board <inline font-style="italic">&#39;s original</inline> proposition, and, secondly, that which is shown on the map on the right, which represents the modification suggested by the Parliament of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- The Cotter is in the portion which lies immediately to the west in either scheme. I have stated. that there are before the Senate two propositions for consideration, and I accept very fully the responsibility of placing, as far as I am able, the facts in connexion with each before the Senate. At the same time, I wish to make it clear that the Government, having fully considered the matter, have themselves decided which they consider is the better of these alternatives. I should like to add that, personally, when I first approached the subject, I did so with an intangible but, nevertheless, distinct feeling in favour of the proposition of the Board. Probably I entertained that feeling because it was the proposition of the Board, and because I reflected that the Board would probably be free from some influences which might, quite unintentionally, and honestly enough, have influenced the decision of the New- South Wales Parliament. I therefore approached the matter quite conscious of a feeling in that direction, rather than of an inclination to accept the suggestion of the New South Wales Parliament. But, for reasons, which I shall set out later, and which influenced the Government of New South Wales to suggest the modifications to the original scheme, I have come to a. conclusion - which I think the Senate will indorse. - that there are attached to the modified scheme advantages which more than compensate for the presumed disadvantages which might at first sight appear to be present. Before I proceed to deal with these alternative schemes, I should like to quote the resolutions passed by the New South Wales Parliament, and which relate to considerations that are common to both schemes. These resolutions deal with many matters which will have to be considered whichever scheme is adopted, and will form the basis of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, to be embodied as the first schedule to this Bill. The position is that an agreement or _ understanding has been arrived at on all the points touched, and is now being cast into legal phraseology by the legal representatives of the States and of the Commonwealth. I am happy to be in a position to say that the whole agreement in all its details has been assented to, except that perhaps there is an additional &#34;i&#34; to dot or &#34;t&#34; to cross. The document will be ready in a day or two, and will, as I have said, be inserted in this Bill. But the Government thought it inadvisable to delay the measure, seeing that the agreement will be printed and placed in the hands of honorable senators before they are called upon to arrive at a decision upon the matter. Dealing now with the resolutions of the New South Wales Parliament, which will form the basis of the agreement now being drawn up, they were these. The New South Wales Parliament agreed that they would -  surrender to the Commonwealth, territory containing an area of, approximately,  800  square miles, made up as follows :  - </para>

A large riparian question is opened up, but the matter is dealt with in the agreement which is being drafted for the consideration of both Governments. With regard to the control of these watersheds, if there should be any doubt in the mind of the honorable senator as to whether the resolution which I have read is full enough, I propose to quote from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> in introducing the matter in the New South Wales Parliament, and which will show that there was no reservation in his mind, but that it was intended to transfer to the Commonwealth the most complete and absolute rights over the waters in this water-shed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wadesaid</inline> - </para>

                        <para>We have recognised at all stages, in connexion with the discussion of this matter, that no sound objection can be raised to the Commonwealth having supreme control over the whole of the catchment area, because on the purity of the water and the control of the streams supplying it, is dependent the health and happiness of the people themselves. There is no reason  why  they should not have the same jurisdiction for protective purposes over the supply of water for domestic use as they have over the city itself. </para>

                            <para>- The circumstances may make its acquisition less desirable from om point of view. The other proposal to which I desire to refer is that which secures to New South Wales the reasonable use of the waters of the Murrumbidgee. That reservation is necessary to New South Wales because it has recently launched out upon a large and expensive water scheme at Barren Jack, the whole efficacy of which will be dependent upon the Murrumbidgee. The reservation, therefore, is not merely in the interests of that State, but is one in which the Commonwealth will readily acquiesce. I come now to the alternative schemes themselves, and I propose very briefly to summarize them. The proposition of the Board was for the surrender of 1,000 square miles of territory which is outlined in the irregular area shown upon one of the maps hanging in the chamber. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. The Federal area would abut immediately upon that area over which the Federation would have full water rights. The original proposition of the Board was that the Commonwealth should be ceded a territory embracing 1,000 square miles, and the alternative to-day is that it shall accept an area of 900 square miles, plus water rights over 580 square miles. Of the 900 square miles contained in territory  ref  erred to in the suggestions emanating from New South Wales, 435 square miles - embracing the area . immediately surrounding the territory - is included in the Board&#39;s original proposition. I use the words &#34; suggestions emanating from New South Wales,&#34; because I wish to make it quite clear that the alternative scheme presented by that State is submitted in the best of good faith, and in the most friendly way, in the nature of suggestions.

                    <para class="block">That telegram makes it abundantly clear that New South Wales, with some knowledge of the matter, has merely put forward for our consideration a modification of the Board&#39;s proposal, with an intimation - made in the most friendly and frank manner - that if that modification be not approved by this Parliament steps will be immediately taken to give effect to any determination at which it may arrive. That puts beyond all cavil the attitude of New South Wales upon the matter. I now wish to again direct attention to the areas shown upon the maps in this chamber. So far as shape is concerned it will be readily conceded that the suggested modification of the original area is a distinct improvement upon it. Its adoption would also confer upon the Commonwealth a further advantage in that it would leave the State railway which runs down to Cooma outside Federal Territory.- That line would form the boundary of the area which the New South Wales Government proposes to surrender. If without giving up any other advantages we can leave a State railway outside the Federal Territory it will be a distinct advantage te do so. </para>

                            <para>- Queanbeyan will be within the territory over which it is proposed to grant water rights to the &#39; Commonwealth. I am proceeding on the assumption that honorable senators agree that the shape of the block which is embraced in the modified scheme is an improvement upon the area that was covered by the Board&#39;s original suggestion. I invite the attention of honorable senators to the area which the Board suggested should be vested in the Commonwealth, but over which the New South Wales Parliament has signified its willingness to grant to the Commonwealth water rights. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> included that area in his original scheme for one reason only. That reason was that it was essential that those who controlled the Federal City should have control of the water passing through it. It was not included in his scheme because he thought that the water from that area was necessary to supply the requirements of the Federal City. He included it merely because he recognised that the water passing through the Federal City might become a public nuisance unless the Federation had the power to control it. In addition, it may serve a very useful purpose in that it may be artificially conserved for the purpose of beautifying the capital. All these advantages are secured under the proposal of the New South Wales Parliament. </para>

It is needed only for ornamental purposes. Surely the proviso which has been suggested, together with the undertaking by- New South Wales to prevent the pollution of these waters and to grant the Commonwealth power to construct any works that it may choose for the purpose of regulating the flow of this water to the Federal City, are sufficient to meet all reasonable requirements ! I shall now deal with the report of the Board upon this matter, and that document will speak with more authority than I do. I have already informed the Senate that certain resolutions were submitted to the New South Wales Advisory Board for their report - </para>

                            <para>- I have not that information with me at the present moment. But I would point out to my honorable friend that it would be inadvisable to base the rainfall over a large territory upon the record at one spot. . It would be safer to take as a guide the rainfall which is registered at a number of places over that area. That has been done in the figures which are set out in the reports of various officers. There is everything to justify the statement that the rainfall over the suggested area is an extremely liberal one. </para>

                            <para>- When my honorable friend talks of &#34; drinking purposes,&#34; I want to know how much is to be drunk. There is sufficient water in the Cotter as we know it to-day to supply the requirements of 250,000 people, allowing them twice as much as is consumed by the citizens of Melbourne. Then there are other sources of supply which will more readily fit in with any proposal for beautifying the city. I wish to impress upon honorable senators that by granting the Commonwealth water rights in lieu of sovereign rights, in respect of the land which is embraced in the 580 square miles to which I have alluded, there will be no diminution of the water supply, which can be concentrated upon the Capital city itself. Every drop which would have been available to that city if the area in question had been transferred to the Commonwealth will still be available for Federal purposes. Whilst that is so, a large increase has been made in the supply which will be placed at our disposal. That increase is represented by the flow down the Gudgenby River. The Gudgenby is reported by either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prettyman</inline> to have a catchment much of the same character, and the same high class as the Cotter catchment. It is steep granite country, and the water is described as being as pure as that of the Cotter. The area of catchment above the proposed site for dam at 2,750 feet, is 114 square miles. At that elevation of 2,750 feet, or at least 500 feet, above the highest city level - it will be possible to run off from the 114 square miles by gravitation 14,874,000,000 gallons per annum, capable of supplying. 407,500 persons with 100 gallons each per day. </para>

                            <para>- As a matter of fact it. is more. The height of the dam would be 2,750 feet, and the height of the city generally may be taken at 2,000 feet. But allowing for elevated buildings I was safe in stating that the dam was 500 feet above the city requirements. The catchment below the dam, which will be available by pumping if required, is sufficient for supplying another 151,000 persons; but this includes some water which comes from the catchment of the Naas River. I do not quite share the views of the Board, because it appears to me that if we have sufficient water, the fact that an additional stream runs our way would be no detriment, and might, in certain circumstances, be an advantage. From the report of the Board which I read, it will be seen that whilst they attach a distinct value to the inclusion of the Gudgenby, they do not see any advantage with regard to the inclusion of the subsidiary streams. I propose to put before the Senate the available supply from both these rivers. Together the reports show that by gravitation there will be made available from these two sources for the Capital site a supply equal to the requirements of 571,000 persons, and that by pumping another 151,000 persons could be supplied. Now the Paddy River, which I say again the Board has discounted as being of no additional value, is sufficient also, although it will be available by pumping only, to supply another 181,000 persons. These streams show, I think, an ample supply. But let me impress upon honorable senators that these are not the main sources of supply available to the city ; they are simply additional waters which, under this alternative scheme, could be made available for the city requirements. The main supply to the city is, as has been put forward by every one who has dealt with the subject - by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener,</inline> and before his time by other surveyors- that of the Cotter River. </para>

                            <para>- If I did not say anything about the supply from these areas probably the honorable senator would be the first to rise and state that nothing could be said for them. I think I can show that we can mass on the proposed city a body of water greater than can be put on any city in Australia. We can put on it a body of. water, not merely sufficient to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and everybody else 100 gallons a day, but enough to float the British Navy. With regard to the Cotter River, the figures which have been made available are for a year which was recognised as a dry year; which the rainfall shows was a remarkably dry year. Actual gaugings were taken for a year from 16th February, 1908 - a thing which had not been done before, because its necessity had not then arisen. From these figures it was ascertained that the mean daily discharge of the Cotter River was 37, 677,205 gallons. It will be seen that the Cotter River alone discharged in that year a quantity of water which was over 60 per cent. of the actual requirements of Sydney, with a population of something like 600,000. Or, to put the point in another way, in that year the Cotter discharged enough water to supply Melbourne and half Sydney, or <inline font-style="italic">vice vers&#226;,</inline> and still have a margin available. Taking all these rivers and massing them together, the official reports show that from the Cotter River, we have, as I have stated, an annual discharge of 13,752,000,000 gallons; from the Gudgenby we have a nearly equal supply, and from the other rivers to which I have referred varying supplies, all of which - excluding the Murrumbidgee - total no less than 54,224,000,000 gallons. </para>

The only question is whether, having got the proposed water rights vested in us, we shall not be in an equally good position to protect the waters from pollution. I perhaps have gone a little further than I intended in dealing with these figures, but interjections have suggested to me that some honor able senators are still under the idea that if they go up to Canberra they will be short of a drink. </para>

With regard to the Queanbeyan and Molonglo rivers, which are, of course, covered by the area over which it is proposed we should take water rights, the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> is that these waters should be used for the purpose of an artificial lake intersecting the Federal city.  His  estimate is that these waters - of course with a big run off - would be sufficient for a lake 4 miles long,&#189; a mile wide, and 40 feet deep in parts. There is a further advantage with regard to that proposition, and that is that within 3 miles of the city, passing away from the lake, there is a fall of 200 feet - a fall which it will be seen at once could be utilized at any time for the purpose of generating electric power. I have tried to put before honorable senators the reasons which induce the Government to invite Parliament to consider and accept this alternative proposition. So far, we have indicated merely in the most general terms the locality in which we think the Capita&#93; should be situated. We have to determine by leaps and bounds the actual territory, and the Senate has the proposition of the Advisory Board and the proposition which is embraced in the suggestions of the New South Wales Parliament. For the reasons I have given, the Government adhere to the view that the modification is an improvement, and it is because it is an improvement only that we invite the Senate to adopt it. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I can see. New South Wales has made a businesslike effort to bring this matter to finality. I shall be extremely disappointed if its offer is not responded to with equal cordiality by the Commonwealth. I do not propose to review the provisions of the Bill : they are such as honorable senators will be familiar with, inasmuch as they embody provisions which were in the Bill introduced in  1904  - provision for continuing the State laws after the transfer of the territory until the Commonwealth Parliament has legislated, and other provisions which are essential in the circumstances. I commend the Bill to the favorable consideration of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>SenatorColonel NEILD (New South Wales) &#91;11.37&#93;. - I rise to second the motion, and to express the view that the modified proposal is much more in the interests of the Commonwealth than was the original recommendation. It undoubtedly gives the Commonwealth a more compact territory than that exceedingly odd-looking piece of country which is shown on what one may call the first map. But the second proposition shows a much more compact territory ; it proposes to give to the Commonwealth a much larger area of land with water rights absolutely superior to those indicated in the first proposal. I regret that a much larger number of honorable senators did not visit the locality, but those who went there must have seen that all the statements made denying the abundant water supply of the locality were really the result of lack of knowledge. As a matter of fact, the last Government set up a very comfortable encampment to enable the members of both Houses to see the place ; it was very well fixed up. I do not know why more than seventeen members of this Parliament did not visit the camp. I believe it is a fact that some honorable gentlemen had been in the neighbourhood before, and therefore did not think it needful to go again. But there was this advantage to those who went to the encampment, that they were not looking furtively for an area of country, but were visiting a locality the metes and bounds of which were clearly explained to them by that most indefatigable, most excellent surveyor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener,</inline> who was in charge of the whole enterprise. I do not think that I am trespassing on propriety when I take this opportunity of saying how admirably he caused the inspection of the site to be successful on the part of every one who went there. Every person in the employment of the Commonwealth carried out his duties in a completely satisfactory manner. Certainly, I spent the whole or part of five days there, and whatever doubts I may have had with regard to the water supply were utterly dissipated by what I saw. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know how far the honorable senator went. The fact that in the sources of water supply considered, the Upper Murrumbidgee is not mentioned - although it runs through the Territory - because its waters are not supposed to be of a desirable character, shows that there has been no attempt to magnify the importance of the water supply. It is proposed to give to the Commonwealth complete rights over 900 square miles, and a perfect jurisdiction over the water supply of another 500 square miles. Surely that ought to suffice for the greediest man with regard to what the Commonwealth demands should be. For all useful purposes the Commonwealth will have dominion over something like 1,400 square miles of territory, as against 67&#189; square miles, which is the territory of the Capital of the United States of America. As to human occupation interfering with the purity of the water supply, what about the human occupation of the portion of England which supplies London with water, or the human occupation of lands in other parts of Great Britain which supply the great cities there ? There is not the slightest expectation of any one now living being likely to be inconvenienced by lack of water at the Federal Capital, which can never be either a business centre, a commercial centre, a manufacturing centre, a mining centre, or an agricultural centre. For all future time we can only expect the Federal Capital to be a bureaucratic centre, like Washington. It is not even likely to be used for the training of armies, though its suitability for this purpose is mentioned in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener&#39;s</inline> report. It is scarcely likely to be considered desirable to bring large bodies of troops at great expense to manoeuvre over country where they are never likely to be called upon to conduct operations in actual warfare. The military operations of the Commonwealth will be conducted in future, as they have been in the past, in suitable localities near to the seaboard. Now, the Cotter water is amazingly pure. </para>

But in its course through that State it is not fed by a single affluent of any kind worth mentioning. It is ridiculous for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> to make such an interjection in face of the positive records ot the Cotter, showing a volume of water more than sufficient to supply the needs of the whole population of Melbourne and half the population of Sydney in addition. The water supply is more than ample for a population of a quarter of a million. But it is by no means likely that a quarter of a million people will live in a bureaucratic centre in a more or less out of the way portion of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will not be here for al! time, and need not trouble himself so much about the far-distant future. Those who have seen the junction of the Cotter and Murrumbidgee can appreciate the value of this water supply. The site is one that is not to be soon forgotten. The pure stream of the Cotter comes down with sufficient force and volume to travel on its own side, after joining the main stream, whilst the muddy waters of the Murrumbidgee travel down along the opposite bank, the waters only merging far down in their course. It is an interesting sight, showing, not only the purity of the Cotter, but the power of the stream to maintain its own character for purity for a considerable distance. I am not exceedingly enthusiastic about this particular site. I look upon its selection as a compromise. Were it not for the water supply and geographical position, I own that I should not care very much about the site. I do not think very much of the soil. But we do not want first-class alluvial land to build houses upon. We do not want the best agricultural soil in the Commonwealth for the purposes of the city. </para>

In saying that I look upon this more as a compromise than as an ideal site, I am not throwing discredit upon <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> area. I am not discounting it. But there is nothing about it which causes me to be enthusiastic, and therefore my comments are not these of a fond lover, but of a candid friend. Having regard to the tendency of population to the eastward and northward of Australia, I admit that the present railway communication does not. make the Yass-Canberra locality an. ideal one. But with the construction of a railway from Yass, I think it will be reasonably convenient to all. I know the locality well, and am speaking from ample knowledge. I know that it possesses an adequate water supply, and am convinced that it has all the qualifications which will make it a suitable future home for the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">The measure is merely a monthly Supply Bill to meet the ordinary recurring expenditure of the Commonwealth. There are not included in it any items which go beyond that description. But I may take this opportunity of informing the Senate - as I do with great pleasure - that there has been an improvement in the revenue receipts, both as compared with the Estimates and as compared with the receipts for the corresponding period of last year. The Customs returns at the end pf September- that is, for the first three months of the present financial year - amounted to  ,&#163;2,926,455,  being an increase of  &#163;49,731  over the receipts for the corresponding period of last year. That increase, which is, of course, satisfactory, is the more so for the reason that it was anticipated that there would be for the whole year a deficiency of  &#163;43,985.  In the Post Office we may say that a very healthy state of affairs is shown. The revenue for the term mentioned has been  &#163;881,517,  being an. increase of  &#163;60,612  over the corresponding period of last year. The estimated increase for the present year was  &#163;140,000,  of which amount the Treasurer has already received &#163;60,000. So that, on the whole, we may take it for granted that on the revenue receipts, the position of Australia is to-day extremely satisfactory. I invite the co-operation of the Senate in passing the Bill through today. When we get into Committee I shall endeavour to furnish any information that honorable senators may desire to have. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government must be congratulated upon this occasion upon having brought the Supply Bill forward in such time as will enable it to be passed so as to permit the public servants being paid in the middle of the month. But I wish to remind the Senate that although the last Supply Bill went through this Chamber in four hours, yet it was endeavoured to be made out by a Minister in another place that, owing to the action in the Senate, the Government was not able to pay the public servants their salaries on the proper date.I am glad tha&#39;t on this occasion the Government have taken steps to prevent such a difficulty occurring. </para>

                        <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has furnished the Senate with some details with regard to the revenue from Customs and Excise, and from the Post Office. He stated that from his point of view the financial position of the Commonwealth is satisfactory. I take the contrary view. Some time ago, Parliament, in obedience to the mandate of the people of Australia, passed a Tariff which was designed to protect and create Australian industries. If the Tariff had been effective the revenue most certainly would not have increased as it has done. I gather from the statement of the Minister that, the returns being considered satisfactory, it is not the intention of the Government to carry out the mandate of the electors and frame a Tariff which will be sufficiently protective. Everyone knows that if a Tariff protects it fails to yield revenue. The kind of Tariff that I want is one which will create the maximum of industries, whilst giving the minimum of revenue. That, I believe, is the kind of Tariff which the large majority of the people of Australia wish to have. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council has congratulated the Senate upon the nature of the receipts under the Tariff, but that does not entitle the honorable senator to debate at length the question of the means which should be adopted to raise revenue. </para>

That statement was perfectly relevant to the motion for the second reading of this Bill, inasmuch as the Senate is now asked to vote a large sum of money for administrative purposes. But remarks regarding the necessity for raising revenue, or as to the advisableness of giving effect to any mandate by the people, are not relevant to it. The question under consideration is merely whether a certain amount shall be voted for purposes of administration, and upon this motion the honorable senator is not entitled to deal with the whole question of taxation. He had his opportunity of doing that when the motion for the first reading of the Bill was submitted. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad to learn that the postal revenue is rapidly increasing. That being the case, I do hope  that at a very early date the Government will take into consideration the advisableness of instituting a system of penny postage throughout the Commonwealth. I know that that is a reform which does not appeal to a great many persons, but I have always been in favour of it. I have never regarded the Post and Telegraph Department as one which ought to be required to pay its way. If that principle were laid down in connexion with it, I recognise that a large number of the conveniences which are now extended to residents in the outlying portions of Australia would have to be withdrawn. If the Department should pay its way anywhere, certainly it should do so in our cities. But in my judgment it should be used largely as an aid to the development of the resources of the Commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that at an early date adequate facilities will be granted to persons resident in the outlying portions of the Commonwealth. I do think that our telephone charges in Australia are too low. They are much lower than those to be found in any country whose conditions at all approximate to our own. I can only conclude, therefore, that our telephone system is being conducted at a huge loss. </para>

                            <para>- A too slavish adhesion to the procedure laid down by Parliamentary authorities who lived and moved under circumstances altogether different from our own may land us in serious trouble. At the present moment we are dealing with the question of granting Supply for certain public services, and I was certainly under the impression that on the motion for the second reading of this Bill I should be quite in order in claiming that the charges made for the use of our telephones are not sufficiently high. It appears to me that that question directly affects the administration of our telephone system. This is not a taxation matter. It is merely a question of payment for services rendered. I have already pointed out that our telephone charges are lower than those to be found in any country similarly circumstanced to our own. The service does not pay. It is one of great utility, more particularly so to the residents of our cities. It is probably one of the most effective labour-saving machines which has been discovered within recent years. There is not a single business firm in Melbourne or in any other city in the Commonwealth which does not annually save a large sum by the use of the telephone. Many of our private citizens also find it of very great financial advantage to them. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is entitled to his opinion as 1 am to mine. If the facts were . investigated I think it would be found that I have hold of the right end of the stick. I should like to see the telephone service extended very much more widely throughout the Commonwealth. I think that the Department ought to strain every nerve to give as large a proportion of the people as possible the benefit of this service, and to do so at a comparatively cheap rate. But if we charge very much less than the service actually costs, it will be impossible to extend telephonic facilities- to country districts in any degree commensurate with their necessities. I trust that at an early date the Government will review the position and put the service upon a fair paying basis. There are firms in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and Brisbane which annually save hundreds of pounds at a cost probably of &#163;4 or &#163;5 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10.</inline> I do not think that that is the way in which our Government Departments should be conducted. I have no desire to see the Post and Telegraph Departments worked at a profit, but certainly there ought to be no loss sustained in connexion with our telephone service. It is a vast laboursaving machine. I find, too, that the landlords are benefiting by the use of these machines. They have seized upon them as a means of raising rents. The cheap telephone is rapidly being capitalized by our land-owners. A few minutes ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie asked me whether 1 favoured placing the Postal service upon a paying basis equally with the Telephone service. </para>

                            <para>- I&#39; wish to point out to the honorable senator the difference which exists between those services from my point of view. The telephone is chiefly used in our big centres of population, whereas the Postal service penetrates to the utmost limits of the Commonwealth. There are thousands and tens of thousands of persons to whose doors . the telephone will not be brought within the next few years. These persons must be served by the Post Office. Consequently I hold that residents in our large centres ought to be well satisfied to pay something additional in order that those who go out into the wilderness to blaze tracks and to do our pioneering work may enjoy their postal services at as cheap a rate as possible. Recently, I had occasion to interview the Secretary of the Postal Department with regard to some mail services which had been established in Queensland and by the State authorities, but which had been &#39;recalled by the Commonwealth authorities. The people in these districts were complaining that the postal conveniences were much less under the Federal Government than under the State Government. The Secretary told me that the Government would not give him money to continue the services, and that, therefore, he was compelled to stop them. That is not the spirit in which the Postal Department should be conducted. If men are driven into the back blocks by force of circumstances to earn a living, surely the added disability of being deprived in a very great measure of postal communication should not be piled on to the other disabilities in connexion with their peculiar circumstances. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to take this matter into his consideration and make representations in the &#39; proper quarter. According to the last report of the Public Service Commissioner, a huge army of temporary employes is continually engaged in our Public Service. That is a thing which requires the most careful attention. There ought not to be such a number of temporary hands employed in the various Departments. The work of temporary men is, as a rule, more or less unsatisfactory. They can only be engaged for six months at a stretch. In many cases they are just beginning to be useful when they are turned into the street and cannot be re-employed for a like period except in particular circumstances. This system does not tend to efficiency. Men who are employed in that fashion never become such effective servants as those who are permanently employed. I agree with the Commissioner that the army of temporary employes ought to be much reduced. If these men are required in such numbers a large proportion of them ought to be placed on the permanent&#39; staff. That would be better for the men and better for the Commonwealth. It would also be better for the permanent employes, especially in the Post and Telegraph Department. I have been told by a number of  permanent officers that a great part of their time is taken up in instructing a continual procession of new hands, coming and going through the office, and never becoming as efficient as they ought to be. The attention of the Government has been directed to this matter very forcibly, I think, by the Commissioner, and I trust that at a very early date something will be done to rectify a very gross mistake, so far as administration is concerned, especially in the Post and Telegraph Department. When the last Supply Bill was before the Senate I referred to a complaint on the&#34; part of officers in the General Post Office, Brisbane, with regard to fines which had been imposed by the Deputy Postmaster-General. The Vice-President of the Executive Council promised that he would look into the matter and see whether something could not &#39;be done to relieve the tension, which undoubtedly exists. The men believe that they are being unfairly treated. They have appealed to me on various occasions. I have put the matter before the Government several times, but so far as I have, heard, nothing has yet been done. I suppose that on the present occasion my remarks, although they will appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> will pass through the ears of the representative of the Government, and will be forgotten, and that nothing will be done. That is the usual method &#34;in regard to these matters. Unfortunately members of the Government do not seem to feel that they are under any obligation to pay the slightest attention to complaints which are made by honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> concluding remarks, of course no Minister has the right to do other than welcome any inquiries directed to him as to the working of public Departments or public matters. But I think that a Minister may reasonably ask that those who push such inquiries should refrain from jumping to the conclusion that promises given here have not been kept. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had merely put a question and waited until I had replied he would have found that there was no justification for the imputation which he threw out. My promise to the honorable senator that the matter would be inquired into was immediately attended to. The Post and Telegraph Department was communicated with, with the result that reports from Brisbane were called for. The reports, when they were received, were found not to be sufficiently lucid ; further information was solicited, and that is now1 being obtained. The .honorable senator will therefore see that I did endeavour to give effect to the promise I made to him. </para>

                            <para>- It is something even to have brought the honorable senator to that frame of mind. With regard to telephone rates and facilities, T suppose that every one will assent to the general proposition that the rates should be made as low and the facilities as numerous as possible. I would remind the honorable senator that it would be indiscreet to deal with these two matters at present, when we are on the eve of receiving- a report from the small Committee of financial experts which was appointed by the Government to endeavour to ascertain exactly what these services cost, before a final revision of the rates was made. That is how the position stands. No one,&#39; I am sure, will be more desirous than my colleague to reduce as far as he possibly can the rates at which these facilities are made available to the public. </para>

                        <para>. - In connexion with the vote for Parliament, I desire to draw attention to the class of books which are being supplied to the Library, and to point out the harmful effect of such books upon the interests of the Commonwealth. On a recent occasion I criticised a volume entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australian Socialism,</inline> by a member of the Senate, which has been placed in the Library, and it is on that account that I again draw attention to the book. I quite believe that the Library contains a number of volumes that misrepresent Australia. But as the authors of them are unknown men, and irresponsible, so far as this country is concerned, we can treat them as being of no account. When, however, a member of this Senate writes a book, it is natural to expect that it will create more attention and carry more weight than would be the case if the author were unknown. We need not trouble about the harmful effects of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger&#39;s book in Australia, because here public opinion is able to appreciate the distinctions which exists in our politics. But in foreign countries - in America, for instance - the book may be taken as an authoritative statement from a person who knows the inside of public life in Australia, and is acquainted with the real distinction between political parties. In England also the book may be taken as an authoritative statement concerning public life in this country. It is for this reason that I draw attention to the dangerous effects the work is likely to have. </para>

                            <para>- That is a very adroit way of the honorable senator to draw attention to a work of his own. I have to confess that I did not know of its existence. I have read various articles from his pen in magazines, which tended to show that he was a confirmed Free Trader. But since then, by his party connexion, he has practically repudiated his life-long convictions on fiscal matters. </para>

I propose now to put aside my own insignificant opinions on literary matters, and to quote the opinion of a man who is an authority on economic subjects. When I state that he is the holder of the responsible position of professor in a German University, it will be seen that he speaks with some authority. </para>

                        <para>Incidentally, I would like to point out how hard it is for a foreigner to obtain accurate and reliable informative works on the economic and social questions which have received the attention of Australian legislators from time to time. For instance, a politician named St. Ledger, who is one of the Queensland members of the Federal Senate, has written a book on Socialism in Australia. I have read that book very thoroughly, and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that it is, to my mind, an entirely misleading production. The people of Australia know, just as well as I know, that the Labour party throughout the Commonwealth, and the Socialistic party are not one and the same body. </para>

                        <para>You have a Socialistic party in Australia, but Tom Mann and Andrew Fisher would never be placed in the same category by people having any intelligence. The production I refer to is the worst book I have ever read on Australia - and that by a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator !</inline> It bristles, with mistakes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. St.</inline> Ledger comes from Queensland, and apparently has gone to no pains to investigate the subject of Socialism in Australia beyond the borders of his own State.  His  statement that Lane was the founder of Socialism out here is apparently made because he speaks out of his knowledge of the movement in Queensland only, and has not dipped into the archives of other States. Place the book in the hands of a foreigner, and the standing of the author will endow it with a certain atmosphere of authority. </para>

                            <para>-  I rise to order. Can an honorable senator be permitted to read a lengthy criticism of a book and its author simply because the volume is to be found in the Parliamentary Library ? It appears to me that if this practice is to be allowed we might debate a Supply Bill for months. An honorable senator might take up book after book and criticise it. </para>

                        <para>Unless he has a sufficient prior knowledge of the. subject to detect the inaccuracies, he will accept as true statements which are not in accordance with fact. The position is entirely unfair to foreign students of Sociology, and it seems as though political considerations have reigned in this connexion, rather than established facts. For myself, I think that truth should be placed first in the publication, political motive second. </para>

As a result of that interview he arrived at the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and the Labour party were grossly misrepresented outside the Commonwealth as well as inside it. He left the Leader of the Labour party under the impression that that party was simply an enlightened1 wing of a new Liberalism. As a result of his interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> he arrived&#39; at the conclusion that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> were grossly misinforming the public in regard to the nature of Germany&#39;s naval policy. He carefully explained, not only to that gentleman, but also to other Australians, that it was lamentable that two such journals should impart misleading information to the public upon that subject. </para>

                            <para>- This alleged German professor visited a friend of mine, and told him that we were being grossly misinformed in regard to German matters. He added that the ideas which we entertained in reference to Australian Socialism must be all wrong, because he had received a different explanation of it from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> himself. My friend advised the professor, before concluding that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and the Labour party were the sucking doves of Liberalism instead of the roaring lions of Socialism, to read my book. He did so. He remained some time afterwards in our midst. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever time he may have remained, he was careful not to comment in public upon the accuracy or inaccuracy of the statements contained in my book whilst he was in Australia. He was equally careful not to utter a single word condemnatory of those two awful journals, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and their misrepresentations of German naval policy. What did he do? He waited until he was clear of Australia, and then he delivered his attack upon me and my book. Most Britishers will regard conduct of that sort as cowardly. If he be a professor and a University man, surely, as he had interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> for the purpose of deriving some impressions of Socialism, he ought to have extended to me the courtesy of a visit before attacking me. It is to be hoped that the chivalry of German soldiers is of a higher character than that of some alleged German professors. A professor who indulges in conduct like that of which this alleged German professor has been guilty is a discredit to his class and to the University to which- he says he belongs. I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and the professor for having done a great deal to advertise my book. I think, however, that I am justified in making this explanation, in view of the criticism of this awful German professor. In reply to the statement that the book can be obtained in the Parliamentary Library, I wish to say that I am informed that it is never on the shelves, and that it has been ordered six deep already. </para>

                            <para>- No. The reason why my book cannot be obtained is that the demand for it is far in excess of the supply. As against the criticism of this alleged German professor, who is more or less a discredit to his class and to his university, I may mention that my book has been favorably reviewed both in Australia and England. Lest honorable senators or the people of Australia may think otherwise, I may be pardoned for mentioning, in opposition to the views of this alleged German philosopher, that two reviews of high standing throughout the world - the <inline font-style="italic">Contemporary Review</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Academy</inline> - have spoken most highly of it. The former has not merely reviewed it favorably, but has recommended it to the attention of every British politician. In view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s criticism, and of the adverse comments by this alleged German professor, I must ask my honorable friends to purchase a copy of the book, and I promise them that from it they will gain some very useful information. They will find in it a paragraph which states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> in speaking of the Socialistic programme, made this declaration - &#34; Eliminate Socialism from the Labour party, and the Labour party has nothing.&#34; </para>

                        <para>. - I have no desire to discuss the merits or demerits of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger&#39;s book, but I think that a serious situation has been disclosed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. It is not the first time that a book has disappeared from the Library, and I think that it is time some drastic action was taken. Upon a previous occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> at considerable trouble, produced a book of poems. Ex-Senator Higgs discovered it, and while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger&#39;s book has attracted some attention, it is not a circumstance to the attention which was attracted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> poems. We know that honorable senators , found those poems very useful. They were quoted by all sections of the Senate. But, as the demand for those poems increased, the book suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. When a book has been published by an honorable senator, which will go down to history as one of the works of our early poets, it is a serious matter that it should suddenly disappear from our Parliamentary Library, and that we should be unable to replace it. Discarding the light and airy paths of poetry, another honorable senator has recently ventured into the domain of political economy. And, again, the same thing has happened.  His  book has disappeared in the most mysterious manner. </para>

                        <para>. - As a member of the Library Committee I take a good deal of exception to tome of the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> The Committee placed only two copies of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger&#39;s book on the Library shelves. This number does not appear to be sufficient to supply the demand for the work, and, in view of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, I shall make it my business to interview the Librarian and see_whether the supply cannot be increased. I have made inquiries, and have found that the book has not been kept out longer than the usual time allowed under the rules of the Library. So far as the disappearance of <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> book of poems is concerned, that appears to me to be a very much more serious matter. We have, at all events, two volumes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger&#39;s book available for honorable senators, but I gather from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> book of poems has been taken away and has never been returned. The Library -Committee find that occasionally members of Parliament who take books from the Library do not return them. In some cases book&#39;s &#39; have not been returned for a very considerable time. I shall make it my business, in view of what has been said to have inquiries instituted to see whether it is not possible to recover from members of Parliament books which, in some cases, have been held back for two and three years. </para>

The last time the question was asked, I informed the Senate that a communication had been addressed to the  Chairman,  of the Postal Commission, and the reply was that the Commission anticipated closing the taking of evidence within a period of three weeks from the date on which the reply was written. They would then proceed to consider the evidence with a view to the preparation of their report. Speaking from memory, I think the letter concluded with the statement that it is not likely that the report will be presented this session. </para>

                            <para>- I am not so much concerned about the increase of salary which this gentleman has received, as with the fact that employe&#39;s in the Department who are entitled to the minimum salary, are not receiving it. When the Stamp Printer has been given a higher salary than he received before he was transferred to the Commonwealth service at least justice should be done to other transferred employ&#233;s in the same Department. If the Stamp Printer is to be the sole judge as to whether employes in the Stamp Printing Department should receive the minimum salary of&#163;110 a year, a provision of an Act of this Parliament may be openly evaded. Are we to understand that the overseer of a particular Department is to decide whether the work of employes engaged in it is worth the minimum salary fixed by the Public Service Act? I believe that some of the employ&#233;s to whom I have referred are entitled to the minimum salary of&#163;110 a year, although they are not getting anything like that salary. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is landing himself in a dilemma. Suppose that the appointee is acceptable to Parliament, or, if you like, to the people of Australia, then the insertion of a date does not matter. Again, suppose that the appointee is unacceptable either to Parliament or to the people, the time of appointment does not matter. What practical purpose can be achieved by inserting a time limit, I cannot see. It must be obvious that no purpose can be achieved. On a previous occasion I stated that the appointment of a High Commissioner was of as&#34; grave importance and responsibility as the appointment of a Judge to the High Court Bench. I am not aware that when the original or subsequent appointments to that Bench were to be made, honorable senators on the other side, or a single member of this Parliament, had the audacity to ask the Government to name a time limit. Why should they ask for a time limit in regard to this particular appointment ? For the purpose of criticism they may say. But how can criticism avail them under &#39;a time limit? What sort of Government would it be which, charged with the control of the affairs of the Commonwealth, would accept dictation regarding an important appointment? As other important appointments are not subjected to such a restriction! as a. time limit, why is one desired in this case? It is patent on the face of it that even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> had a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> purpose in moving his amendment, it will be absolutely futile to effect any good object. But if it is submitted for the purpose of trying to drag a tin pot or can across the floor of the chamber, then it is a mere waste of time. I cannot see what practical or useful or immediate object he seeks to attain. If he dreamt that he would embarrass or influence the Government by the adoption of these tactics, then if he is successful he is simply declaring his opinion that they are not fit to be trusted with the making of this important appointment. If he really holds that view he should take direct action. I hope that the amendment will not be pressed, or that if it is to be pressed we shall get an indication of some useful purpose which it is hoped to serve. </para>

                    (South Australia) that circumstances alter cases. I fancy that it applies here, because in the opening speech put into the mouth of the GovernorGenera&#93; by the Fisher Government there was a notification that a Bill for the appointment of a High Commissioner would be introduced this session. I venture to say that if that Government had introduced a Bill it would not have contained either a date or a name, and would have been accepted by honorable senators on the other side without any question. The&#39; responsibility for making this appointment rests with the Government. I do not agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                    that the Government is simply a Committee for the purpose of carrying out the wishes of the Senate. Ministers are put in the responsible position of the leaders of the Parliament, and if we have not sufficient confidence in them to give them an opportunity of making this appointment at what they believe to be the proper time, we ought not to allow them to remain in office. If the Bill is passed and the appointment of a High Commissioner is delayed, Parliament can always call the Ministry to account. We can even go so far as to refuse to vote Supply until we know who is to be appointed. I do not see any necessity to put in the Bill either a date for making the appointment or the name of the first High Commissioner, I hold myself at liberty to condemn the Ministry if they do not make an appointment within a reasonable time, or if they do not appoint a suitable man. I intend to vote for the clause as it stands.

                        <para>- They might find it very inconvenient to do so. It is inconvenient for the Government to appoint a member of Parliament to a public position during a session, because it involves the vacation of his seat and the election of another member. It seems to be taken for granted that the High Commissioner must necessarily be a man. But in these days of women&#39;s rights is there any good reason why this officer may not be a lady of great intelligence ? </para>

                    <para>. - I hardly expect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will withdraw the amendment, because, much as I should like him to do so, it is quite obvious that he is taking a deep interest in the discussion. He appears to be following every word, and, therefore, I assume that he regards his proposal as vital, at any rate&#39; to his political future, if not to the fate of the Bill. I should not like him to think that&#39; by silence on my part I consider for a moment that there is any reason why this amendment should be made. I was amused yesterday, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> when I pointed out that this is quite a new practice which is sought to be established here. He amused himself - and I think that one or two honorable senators followed suit - by saying that I was merely opposed to the idea because it is new. Nothing was further from my thoughts, and nothing, I venture to say, was further from my general course of political action. What I did say was that, hieing new, there ought to be some good sound reason for its introduction. I asked what was that reason, and no one has yet given an answer to my question. No one has yet given the real reason for submitting the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely stating facts. Only a few months ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and others expressed confidence in the Government to the extent that they granted supply. That being so, it is curious that the same honorable senator should now desire to register a lack of confidence in the same Administration. I feel sure that the amendment springs solely from a suggestion which sprung from ex-Senator Higgs a few years ago. On that occasion, I strenuously opposed anything that would hamper the Government of the day in performing an act of administration. I was then in Opposition. It is hardly likely that I am going to change my attitude now. </para>

                    <para>. - I am opposed to the appointment of a High Commissioner until the States agree to surrender some of their powers in regard to representation in London. I think the appointment premature. But, although some years ago, when I was sitting in Opposition, I expressed the opinion that the choice of the Government should be submitted to Parliament, I did so because I did not think at that time that we had responsible government. I had no confidence in the Government. In the present instance I have confidence in the Government, and shall vote so as to express the opinion that it is a right and proper thing that they should appoint their own officer. </para>

That being the case, why insert in the Bill an amendment requiring the choice of the Government to be submitted to Parliament? Parliament always has power to review any appointment. </para>

We must all recognise that it would be most undesirable, for any Government to make an appointment of such importance whilst Parliament was in recess. At the same time,  I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> amendment, because its adoption would not conduce to the maintenance of the dignity of this Chamber, and because it might land us in trouble. But I do hope that before this Bill leaves the Senate the Government will be able to intimate that they intend to make an announcement in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner before the session closes. </para>

                        <para>- Personally I should have been very glad if the Government had disarmed the previous amendment by stating their deliberate intention to make this important appointment before the prorogation nf Parliament. Of course I can conceive nf circumstances which might render it impossible for them to make the appointment within a month or two. But I cannot consent to allow the Bill to pass from the Senate until we have had a de- finite pronouncement from the Government upon this matter. </para>

                <para>It will thus be seen that if an incapable person be appointed to the position of High Commissioner, it is within the power of the Parliament to remove him. That, I take it, is a sufficient protection against any abuse of power on the part of the Government.&#39; Knowing that that provision is contained in the Bill, the Ministry will exercise the greatest care in making an appointment. But I hope that they will hold themselves free to exercise their own discretion in this matter, and that they will not yield to any influences which may be brought to bear upon -them! </para>

                        <para>- If the position were being offered to my honorable friend, 1 could not conceive of any difficulty occurring. But in other circumstances, such a limitation might have the effect of restricting the choice of the Government. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> tell me the date upon which this session will terminate? The Government have never yet considered the question of who should be appointed High Commissioner, and I think it would have been wrong for them to do so until this Bill had been passed. Our first duty is to ascertain whether Parliament is willing to create this high office. Until we have ascertained that, we cannot consider the propriety of making any appointment at all. When the Bill has been approved by both branches of the Legislature, we shall give the question of selecting a suitable gentleman for the office of High. Commissioner the earliest possible attention. That is all I can say. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking of the present Parliament, but of any Commonwealth Parliament. Would it not be better to submit to Parliament the name of the gentleman who is to be appointed; High Commissioner before he leaves for London than to permit him to go there and perhaps be subsequently recalled ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has affirmed that the proposed appointment is analogous to that of- appointments to our High Court Bench. I say that there is no analogy between the two things. In the one instance gentlemen were appointed to dispense justice who should be entirely above suspicion ; whereas in the other, the Government intend to appoint a representative of the Commonwealth in London who will have nothing whatever to do with the dispensing of justice. I did expect that the Vice-President of the Executive Council would have made some reference to my amendment. But like other honorable senators who have found themselves leaders of this Chamber, and who have been supported by brutal majorities, he did not condescend to refer to it, because he recognises that he possesses the requisite numbers. If he had not those numbers, he would be the very first man to ask me to withdraw it. I shall press the amendment, and I hope that honorable senators will see that there is reason for declaring that this Parliament should have some voice in ratifying such an important appointment. </para>

They will be going before the country at the general election, and I think they would do well to show that they are not afraid to face Parliament or the country. </para>

                        <para>- You appear, sir, to know more than I do myself about what I am going to say. You have apparently decided, before you hear it, that what  1  am going to say is out of order. Clause 2 is still open for discussion by the Committee, and I intend to discuss it until I am ruled out of order. As one of those who believe that a High Commissioner should be appointed at the earliest possible date, I would go further than is proposed in the clause and say in the Bill who the High Commissioner should be. I was prepared to compromise the matter by fixing a date before which the appointment should be made, but that was not agreed to by the Government. It will be a cause of the greatest dissatisfaction to the country and to members of the Parliament if this appointment is made at a time when it cannot be effectively criticised. There is grave danger that this may occur, because the Prime Minister has in the past been dilatory in the making of an important appointment. I refer to his delay in appointing a Lieutenant-Governor of Papua, which gave rise to the greatest dissatisfaction and discontent, and resulted in the most disgraceful disorganization of the public service of that Territory. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Prime Minister will be guilty of similar inaction again. I impress upon the Government the necessity for making this appointment before the close of the session. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a hurry. I believe that a High Commissioner should be appointed, but I think the appointment should be made when the representatives of the people in Parliament assembled may have an opportunity to approve of the appointment if it is a good one, or to condemn it if they consider it a bad one. I hope that an appointment of which we can all approve will be made, but we should have some assurance from the Government that it will be made without undue delay, that is to say, within the course of the next six or seven weeks, so. that both Houses of this Parliament may be able to express their approval or disapproval before the close of the session. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend, even with his Scotch frugality, would not expect to get much relief under that heading. The &#163;2,000 is appropriated for an express purpose. It is not desirable that the gentleman who goes Home to re present Australia shall simply go for the purpose of spending money, or making unnecessary parade. Our object is to send him there with an allowance which will enable him to maintain his position comfortably to himself and without discredit to Australia. The Government think that, in fixing upon a salary of &#163;3,000, they fixed upon a happy medium. For that reason I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to withdraw his amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I have some sympathy with the proposition that perhaps a higher salary might be attached to the office, because I believe that a low salary has a tendency to restrict the field of choice to men of less wealth. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> amendment had been carried, I might have been prepared to vote for this amendment, because then we should have had a check over the appointment. I am not like some honorable senators on the other side. I have no confidence in the Government. I feel confident that this appointment will be made for purely political purposes, especially in view of the action of the Government in rejecting the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline></para>

                        <para>- At that time I was 1,700 or 1,800 miles from Melbourne, and consequently I did not hear the honorable senator&#39;s reasons. What duties will the High Commissioner be called upon to discharge? He is not going to London to be a leader of society, or to incur very large expenditure in connexion with functions; but, from the remarks of honorable senators on the other side, one would think that he is to be much the same as a Governor, who is generally valued by the amount of money which he is able to spend. If I understand aright, the duties of the High Commissioner in London will be to represent Australia in all capacities ; to give information to the press regarding the state of affairs here, and, if he finds that Australia has been traduced, as it has been dozens of times, to supply a prompt contradiction from his office, and to see that the business of the Commonwealth is conducted to the best possible advantage. If we were sending a man to London with the object of keeping up a big establishment and making a splash, probably he would require a salary of &#163;10,000 or &#163;15,000, because there would be much advertising going on, and he would be the centre of a coterie. But that is not the sort of representative we want. It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> should give better reasons than I have yet heard for increasing the salary. </para>

                    <para>. - Before asking leave to withdraw the amendment, I desire to say a few words for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> I am one of those who. do not wish to see this appointment necessarily go to a rich man. Many a rich man would be prepared to take the position for the sake of the honour and glory attached thereto; but if we value a poor man in the office, we should enable him to maintain his position with others! I had not noticed before that the allowance of &#163;2,000 does not include travelling expenses. It seems that they will be quite exclusive of that sum. I may mention that the Ambassador for the United States occupies a house in Park Lane for which I do not believe he pays a penny under &#163;2,000 a year. In order to save time, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who gave me to understand that he was in favour of increasing the amount, has withdrawn his support, and another honorable senator, who said that he intended to support my proposal, has also changed his mind. </para>
