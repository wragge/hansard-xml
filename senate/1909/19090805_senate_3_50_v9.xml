I hope that he will look into the matter. </para>

                    <para>I am submitting this motion now, because it is desirable that the Senate should take into consideration, concurrently with  another  place, a matter which has arisen under a practice which members of Parliament have followed in inserting cross-headings  in  reprints  of  their speeches from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Contention has arisen on the subject, and a lengthy debate took place elsewhere. The question was referred to the Printing Committee this morning, and we . were informally asked to express an  opinion  ; but having considered the subject, we came to  the conclusion that we had  no  power to take any. cognisance whatever of matters related to the printing of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It seemed to us that all matters relating to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> were under some authority -apart from the Printing Committee. Standing order  36&#34;  defines the powers of the Printing Committee chosen by this Chamber. It says - </para>

                    <para>Those members of the joint Printing Committee who are chosen by the Senate considered that. under the standing order which I have quoted they had no power to interfere in any way with respect to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Therefore we were disinclined to take into consideration any matter which might arise in respect to reprints of speeches, unless some authority from both Houses were given to us. In&#39;tne event of such authority being given, I presume that the joint Printing Committee would be prepared to consider the whole question, and to furnish a recommendation. As this . report will be submitted to another place to-day, I am moving the adoption of it, so that if it be deemed desirable, authority may be issued simultaneously by the two Houses under which the Committee will have power to act at once in regard to the matter in question. </para>

                            <para>-  On a point of order, I desire to ask, under what portion of our Standing Orders is there power for a full debate to proceed at this stage of our business ? The matter is&#39; not one of privilege. The Standing Orders have not been suspended, but we are apparently enjoying a full debate at a time and under circumstances which appear to me to conflict with the order of business laid down by those Standing Orders. </para>

                            <para>-  With great respect, I wish to point out that two totally different matters are involved. The leave given was practically to suspend the standing order requiring notice of. all motions to be given. But I take it that there , is a difference between the suspension of Standing Orders . which was done to enable the motion to be moved, and a suspension of Standing Orders to admit of a full debate. I take it that the object of the permission was to enable the motion to be submitted formally. </para>

                            <para>- No ; the consent given was to the motion being submitted, not purely as a formal matter. The motion having been proposed, it must be open for debate. There would be very little value in submitting the motion at all if it had to be adopted without debate. </para>

                            <para>- I hope not, The reason why this unusual course has been taken was to place the Senate in a position to act simultaneously with another place on a matter which has been deemed to be of considerable importance. Much contention has arisen with regard to honorable members having their speeches reprinted from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in pamphlet form at their own personal cost. The right has hitherto been claimed to insert cross-headings in those reprinted speeches. In some cases the right has been exercised to eliminate portions of speeches. But we understand that the Treasurer has issued instructions that in one particular case what has hitherto been done should not be allowed. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I want to know. We came to the conclusion that such a matter was outside our authority, as denned by the Standing Orders. Consequently we declined to take any action, unless the matter should be specifically referred to the Committee by one or both Houses. That is the position which we have taken up. That is the eminently reasonable position which we ask the Senate to indorse. If the report is adopted the Senate will be in a position conjointly with another place to authorize the Committee to deal with the matter. But until the Joint Committee is given this authority by the two Houses they will rightly refuse to have anything to do with the question, as it is entirely outside the ambit of their existing authority. </para>

No dou&#39;bt the Printing Committees of the two Houses very usefully meet together, and consult as a Joint Committee, but I doubt whether the Printing Committee of the Senate was so appointed. Whether it was or not makes no difference in the proposition I submit, that some person who is not a member of this Chamber has been interfering with the proceedings of one of our Committees. I say that that is highly improper and most indecent. We have the assurance of the  Chairman  of the Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> who devotes a great deal of time and attention to his duties, and the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who has seconded the motion, that the Committee have been considering something which they had no business to consider.

I take it that the honorable senator proposes to move the adjournment of the debate. I suggest that as there seems to be an insufficiency of matter on the paper to occupy our attention this evening, this would be a very happy subject for a series of light brigade charges all round the Chamber, and the gallant six hundred might have a lovely time later on, whilst this afternoon we might proceed with public business. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It is a matter of common complaint, that the various Departments -are continually undermanned, and that the necessity for utilizing the services of temporary employes is, therefore, very great throughout the Commonwealth. Now I, for one, object to the appointment of temporary employes wherever the adoption of that course can be avoided. Of course, I recognise that we must have a few temporary employes, but  that kind of employment ought to be reduced to a minimum. The work of the Commonwealth ought to be performed by men and women who are permanently employed in its service, and if Parliament is to sift this matter to the bottom, and obtain &#39;a thorough grip of it, the printing of the return to which I have directed attention is absolutely necessary. It appears that the Printing Committee is appalled at the cost which that work would probably involve. But it may be that the Commonwealth is incurring a very much larger expenditure as the result of inefficient organization than it would be called upon to incur if the publication of this return assisted honorable senators, and this Parliament generally, to obtain a clear grip of the position. In that way, the cost of the printing of the document might be saved a hundred times. In any case, the information which it contains ought certainly to be in the possession of honorable senators, and of every member of this Parliament. We cannot obtain a true grasp of the position which obtains in our Public Service from the stand-point of temporary employment in the absence of this report, which we ought to be able to peruse in the most convenient form. </para>

I presume that the desire of Parliament is to afford honorable senators reasonable facilities in this connexion, so long as the exercise of those facilities does not throw any additional burden upon the public taxpayer. In order to arrive at what are reasonable facilities, it is necessary for us to understand the condition of affairs which obtains at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has stated that this question was referred to the Printing Committee. I take exception to his statement.

                            <para>- Will the honorable senator tell me the form in which it was submitted? I am assured that there has been no reference of this question to the Printing Committee by any person in authority. Of course I might have written to the Committee in reference to it, and any other senator might have adopted the same course. But certainly there is nobody who has authority to refer this question to the Printing Committee except the two branches of the Legislature which appointed it. The mere fact that some person may have suggested that it was desirable for the Committee to consider it, did not constitute a reference to it which the Committee was bound to accept. I am informed that there has been no formal reference of the matter to the Committee, and certainly there , has been no legal reference of it to that body. I do know that the Prime Minister, in speaking in another place, did suggest that probably a way might be found of overcoming the difficulty which has occurred if the Committee would take the matter in hand and make a formal recommendation in respect of it. I cannot see that the Printing Committee which was created for a specific purpose has any authority to move in this matter unless the Houses specially delegate this duty to it. For that reason I am not at all certain that the Committee has not acted a little prematurely. Coming to the facts of the case I should like to remind honorable senators that this question is not a new one. It was originally raised in a letter from the Government Printer to the Treasurer in 190I3. Finding that the practice was commencing to develop, that officer wrote to .the head of his Department and practically asked for instructions on the subject. In reply, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner placed upon record a minute to the effect that he was not prepared lo do anything more than approve of an absolutely accurate reproduction of speeches embodied in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard-</inline> But from that time onward, in those ways which are so suggestive of human nature, there has been a gradual departure from that regulation. I do not say that any party or any individual has been, more blameworthy in this connexion than has anybody else. But the fact remains that there has been a gradual weakening of the practice laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner until an entirely different practice has sprung up. This practice recently reached a point when it was again brought under the notice of the Treasurer, who has now decided to revert to the terms of the minute written by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. I submit that whatever action the Committee may have taken in this matter cannot alter the facts of the case. Those facts are that if the speeches of members of this Parliament are to be reproduced from. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> they must in future be reproduced accurately. That practice has been departed from, but is now being reaffirmed. </para>

                        <para>.- From the remarks made by the Leader of the Senate, I understand that objection to the present practice was taken in the first place by the Government Printer, mainly, I suppose, on the ground that the insertion of cross-headings involved additional labour, and therefore additional expense.

Are we to understand from the Leader of the Senate that in future no cross-headings will be permitted? The next thing we shall hear, I suppose, will be that no member of Parliament will be permitted- </para>

                            <para>- Sub-editing is permissible in some directions. The next thing we shall hear, I suppose, will be that no member of Parliament will be permitted to alter his speech, in order to make it appear to the public a different utterance altogether from that which was actually delivered to the Chamber. Personally. I do not see the slightest objection to cross-headings appearing in the speeches which are reprinted for members of Parliament, and &#39; distributed throughout the country. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to oppose the amend.ment, and support the motion, because, I think, unless the report of a Committee is of an extraordinary character it ought to be adopted, in the belief that its members have given very full consideration to its subject-matter, and made the best possible recommendation. Personally, I shall be very pleased if this matter of the reprinting of speeches is referred to the Printing Committee, so that the members of each House may know exactly where  they stand, and what privileges they possess. I have heard - and probably that is why the matter came before &#39;the Printing Committee - that there has been a very great deal of mutilation of reprinted speeches, or, at all events, a very great deal of alteration of them. </para>

                        <para>. - The report of the Printing Committee would have gene much further if they had gone to the root of the matter and proposed a remedy for various things which have been suggested here this afternoon. The use of cross-headings is not the only matter to be considered. I quite agree that it is wrong for cross-headings to be used in a speech which was not uttered on the floor of either House of Parliament. I think that any pamphlet from the Government Printing Office, which purports to be a reprint from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> ought to be a faithful copy of the official report. That is a fair thing to do. We ought, to very jealously guard <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and see that it is a correct record of speeches delivered in Parliament. But if we want to achieve that result we must go&#39; much further than the mere question of cross-headings. We are informed by those who have an opportunity to know the facts - men engaged in the printing of the speeches - that the number of changes which are made after certain members of Parliament get their proofs from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is something disgraceful. </para>

There may be an odd figure, or a slip of some kind, to put right, but, apart from that, I have never had to alter a sentence. If we want to go to the root of this matter, more power ought to be given to the Printing Committee. Indeed, it does not suggest anything, and I think it is just as well that there should be no suggestion made. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the Printing Committee has done the right thing, but I should think twice before I would empower any Committee to authorize very drastic alterations. We know that there are alterations going on at the present time, and that individual members of Parliament take liberties which ought to be curtailed. If we are prepared to go so far as to intrust the Committee with some power of censorship over that sort of thing, we shall- be taking a drastic step; but whether we would be justified at present in doing so. I have very grave doubt. I should require to give more consideration to the matter than I have been able to do to-day. That there are things to be remedied, that there are things being done which should not be done, in connexion with the production of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I am quite assured. I do not wish to cast any reflection upon individual members of Parliament, but I am informed that this privilege has been taken advantage of so freely that the way in which speeches have been mutilated has become a positive scandal, notwithstanding the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that that was not possible. </para>

I consider that the terms of that notice ought to be strictly enforced. I am told that the original proofs sent to members of Parliament are still kept at the Printing Office. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the reports make the speeches a little bit better than they appear when delivered, but, at any rate, they are accurate. I believe that, members of both Houses of Parliament are very fairly and ably reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> We have nothing to complain of on that ground. . But there have been occasions when an honorable senator has made an admission that he might consider damaging in reply to an interjection, and I have been unable to find a report of the incident in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It appeared to me that the whole paragraph must have been cut out. When one hears a certain thing said in reply to an interjection one ought to be able to find it. in the report, however convenient it might be for the honorable senator making the statement to have the passage left out. I can say that since I have been a member of the Senate I have never asked  for a single alteration to be made, except perhaps a correction of a word or a figure, in a case where my meaning may not have been nuite correctly conveved.I know that other honorable senators have been in the same position. I was under the impression until last month that no member of Parliament was allowed to alter <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I believed that the  President  and </para>

                        would not allow alterations to be made. I do not know how it is that another practice has crept in, but it is a good thing that attention has been called to the matter, and I am quite sure that if any practice to the contrary has arisen it should be put a stop to. If any member of Parliament is allowed to cut out a passage, or to alter it, the report will not be a true record of what he said in Parliament. I am very glad that the matter has been brought up, and 1 shall support the motion for the adoption of the report.

                        <para>. - I shall not discuss the addendum to the Committee&#39;s report, because it seems to me that there is really nothing in it. If we were being asked to refer the subject in question to the Printing Committee, it would be proper for us to discuss the whole matter, so as to give the Committee an idea of what we wanted to have done. But apparently nothing is to be referred to the Committee, and it appears to me, therefore, that the debate is largely a waste of time. It is useless to discuss what we should like to have done. If a definite motion is brought forward, expressing what the Senate desires the Committee to do, then will be the proper time to discuss the whole matter fully and to convey to the Committee an idea of what we wish. I should like to say, also, that I always feel inclined, when an honorable senator desires, to have a paper printed, to vote for his proposal. The paper which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> desires to have printed is rather a formidable document. It is in the form of a return which the Public Service Commissioner is required by the Public Service Act to furnish to Parliament. Section 40, sub-section 7, of the Act provides that - </para>

                            <para>- I was about to add that the part of the document relating to the Post Office contains many pages which are full of names. -Undoubtedly the cost of printing the return would be considerable. On the other hand, it appears to me that a printed copy of the document would be largely valueless. The only reason for printing it a J; all would be to give honorable senators an opportunity of watching the administration of the Departments by the Public Service Commissioner, and of seeing that the very dangerous section of the Act in regard to temporary employes is not abused. There is no doubt that the weak spot in our Public Service administration has regard to that very question of temporary employment. It is a most difficult question to deal with, and the power is a very dangerous one to put in the hands of the Commissioner. Unless this document be printed, very few of us will be sufficiently industrious to send for the return and wade through its many pages, some of them containing only one name, in order to ascertain details regarding temporary employment. If the paper were printed, it would be readily available ; we could keep it in our boxes, and could refer to it conveniently. </para>

Whenever an honorable senator asks that a paper shall be printed, my inclination is always&#39; to support him, but, in view of the very great cost that would be involved in printing this particular paper, and considering that the Printing Committee has doubtless given the subject full consideration, I feel inclined lo vote against the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I consider that the matter of temporary employment in the Public Service is so very important that if the Commissioner himself or the Minister at the head of the Department drew attention to any particular matter relating to it the report should be printed. But it is- evident that the Printing Committee have given careful consideration to this particular document, and, inasmuch as one of the members of the Committee tells us that the printing of it would cost  .&#163;500,  and having regard to the fact that it is not important that the paper should be printed, seeing that no question of principle is involved, I do not feel inclined to vote for an amendment which would entail so much expenditure. Consequently I shall not vote against the recommendation of the Committee on this occasion. </para>

Whether a person was employed for six hours or six days, or six months, his name is included.

Every page is closely filled with a type-written statement of the employes, the number of days they worked, the number of hours on each day, the amount of pay received, and so forth. Any one who knows anything about printing is aware that tabular matter is the most expensive form of printing. Some honorable senators understand that thoroughly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon, Senator Chataway,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

I say confidently that the cost of  printing  this document would be enormous, and out of all proportion to the benefit that would be derived from it. It did not appear to us that we should be justified in recommending the printing of a document, the only effect of which would be to make the bound volume of parliamentary papers too heavy to be carried about. The return is clearly typewritten, and ca.ni just as easily be read in this form as if it were printed. I also desire to point out that the Printing Committee has not deprived any senator of the right to move that the return be printed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has had that right from the moment the paper was laid upon the table until now. He can at any time bring down a motion for the printing of the report.

I was present at the meeting of the Committee this morning, and I can assure the Senate that we did not have one division, nor did any member of the Committee express a wish to have any paper printed that was not agreed to unanimously. There was not one member of the Committee present at the meeting held this morning who was desirous that the huge document referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> should be printed. I have stated the lines on which the Committee are working, and I think they must commend themselves to the Senate. </para>

So far as I am concerned, I should like to wipe the slate clean, let  by-gones  .be bygones, and start <inline font-style="italic">de novo.</inline> Let us find out who is responsible for the proper conduct of the Government Printing Office ; whether it is the principal officers of Parliament, the  President  and  Speaker,  the Printing Committee, or the Houses themselves. The members of the Printing Committee should know exactly where they are in the matter. This morning, they found themselves in such a position that they could not deal with the matter submitted to them. I should be glad if the Vice-President .of the Executive Council would submit some motion on the subject so that the members of the Printing Committee may not again be placed in. the unenviable position in which they found themselves this morning. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> upon reflection, will be prepared to admit that we should not be justified in wasting the large amount of public money which would be involved in the printing of the document to which he has referred. I think, generally, that the conduct of the Printing Committees should be upheld by both Houses, and that the members of those Committees should not be subjected periodically, as they are, to criticism, practically charging them with neglect of their duties. </para>

                            <para>- Before calling upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> to reply, I should like to say a word or two with reference to the control of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and. the reprinting and alleged alteration from time to time of speeches appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff are under the control of the  Speaker  and  President,  who are responsible for the proper conduct of the business of reporting the debates in Parliament. The principle they have laid down is that the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff shall make a correct report of the speeches uttered in both Chambers. Proof copies of their speeches are sent to members of Parliament, not in order that they may rewrite them, or cut out large portions of them, but in order that they may have an opportunity to see whether the reports of their speeches are correct records of what they have said. Where figures and quotations are used, it is frequently very, necessary that members should have an opportunity of seeing that the figures and references are correctly cited. Beyond that, I do not think they should have the right to alter their speeches as reported. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of debates is supposed to be a correct record of what takes place in Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Exception is taken to the elimination of certain utterances by members from the report of their speeches. In certain cases, where the members concerned have desired it, personal recriminations passing between them have hitherto been excised from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. The reason for that is that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> goes forth to the world as a record of the proceedings of our Parliament, and where, unfortunately, in the heat of argument, members utter recriminations which are in no way connected with the subject-matter of the debate, it is thought much better that they should be omitted. What is really required is a record of what has been said on the subject-matter under debate. Beyond this, no honorable senator has a right to delete anything from the report of his speech. A little time ago, I felt that many utterances took place in Parliament&#39; which, perhaps with advantage, might be omitted from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. But it was pointed out to me that as such utterances very frequently become interwoven with the debate, it would be a matter of very great difficulty to eliminate them. The only course to take in the circumstances was to allow them to appear. But where personal recriminations arise, that are in no sense interwoven with the debate, it was thought wise by the late  Speaker  and myself that, with the consent of those concerned in them, they should be eliminated. </para>

I wish to say that, as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is published with the imprint of the Government Printer, and is presumed to be a correct record of what takes place in Parliament, the  President  and  Speaker  should certainly be consulted before an \ attempt is made to issue copies of the speeches of members of Parliament from the Government Printing Office with the authority of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. We have been told to-day, by the Vice-President of  the Executive Council, that instructions have been given to the Government Printer that when members of Parliament desire to have copies of their speeches printed for their own purposes, they must be treated as if they emanated from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> under the control of the two Houses. If that course be adopted in the future, there can then, I presume, be no objection to the matter remaining as it is at the present moment. But if it is contemplated for a moment that members of Parliament should have the light to insert cross-headings, to omit portions of what they have said, or to insert fresh matter in the reports of their speeches reprinted for their own purposes, that, I think, should not be permitted without express authority from the officers who represent Parliament itself. </para>

                            <para>- In, reply to the question put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> I may say that if the report be adopted, it will be perfectly competent for any honorable senator to give notice, and move that any particular document concerning which no recommendation has been made bv the Printing Committee shall be printed. A little time ago, reports were submitted by the Printing Committee in which the words &#34; Not to be printed,&#34; appeared against the reference to certain papers. Some little difficulty arose from the use of those words, because, after a report had been adopted, it might be thought desirable to have a paper printed- which the Printing Committee had reported should not be printed. In such cases, it became necessary to rescind so much of the report of the Printing Committee as prevented the printing of the paper before a motion that it toe printed could be submitted to the Senate. The Printing Committee, having considered the matter, determined upon the use of the words, &#34;No recommendation&#34; in their reports, thus leaving it to honorable senators to submit, at any time they saw fit, a motion for the printing of a particular document on which the Committee made no recommendation. While I point this out, it is only fair  to say that it is perfectly competent for any member of the Senate to submit an amendment upon a motion for the adoption of a report from the Printing Committee asking for the printing of a particular document, so that, if amended, the motion submitted, would lead - </para>

                        <para>. - Very briefly, I desire to express my pleasure at having listened to the explanation which you, sir, have made to the Senate in regard to the reprinting from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of speeches in pamphlet form. I must candidly confess that I had but a dim idea of who constituted the controlling forces in that connexion. But, having heard your explanation, I feel convinced that in the future I shall be able to approach the question from a proper stand-point&#39;. Whatever view the Vice-President of the Executive Council may take of the position, I, as a member of the Printing Committee, have no hesitation in declaring that, whilst the question to which I have alluded may have been brought before the Printing Committee in an informal manner, there was enough formality about it to convince me that some important statements had been made regarding the alteration of speeches reprinted from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in pamphlet form. The Committee were face to face with a certain document, which had been brought from the Treasury and presented to it through its  Clerk,  and which was afterwards explained by the1 Postmaster-General. Indeed, the whole procedure adopted seemed to be enveloped in a halo of formality. I heartily concur with those honorable senators who have expressed a desire that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shall be maintained as a correct record of what is said and done in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> stated that in my opening remarks I had affirmed that huge slabs had been cut out of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of some honorable members&#39; speeches when they were published in pamphlet form for distribution amongst the electors. When he made that statement the honorable senator was under a misapprehension, inasmuch as I was very careful to avoid referring to anything which had been done in that connexion. Now that the Committee&#39;s report has been presented, I am extremely glad to know that this question is not likely to crop up again. </para>

                    <para>. - I merely wish to make one remark to the Committee. I was asked yesterday whether any information was available as to the cost which would be thrown upon the public funds if this proposed new clause were agreed to. In reply I stated that it was extremely difficult to form an estimate of the cost which it would involve, inasmuch as a great deal would naturally depend upon the way in which the Act was administered. That is to say, a more generous administration of its provisions might admit as invalids those whom a more rigorous administration would exclude. I am, however, informed that the cost of paying invalid pensions would amount to&#163;250,000  annually. </para>

When we are considering a Bill to amend an Act, it is so difficult to follow the two that I did not notice that we were asked to make a distinction between Asiatics and African negroes. In my opinion, it is an undesirable distinction to make. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that we should not include aboriginal  natives. That argument, however, cannot be used against the inclusion of the African negro, as we are not making any special provision in regard to him.

                <para>The argument which was used in regard to the exclusion of aboriginal natives does not apply to the Maories, who are here, or to the kanakas, who are here, and can remain if they like, or to the African negro. It would be a deplorable thing if a distinction were made in favour of the Asiatic as against the African negro. We have some very reputable citizens who are African negroes. We also have in Australia some aboriginal natives of Mauritius, which I believe is regarded as part of Africa. </para>

                    <para>. - It appears to me that when the principal Act was before Parliament, and a hard line was drawn between people of our&#39; own colour and people of other colours, it was perhaps consistent, at any rate logical, to exclude all the latter people from the benefits of the law. As a result of an amendment made elsewhere we have broken through that line and decided to grant old-age pensions to Asiatics who are naturalized residents of Australia. That being so, it does not appear to me to be either reasonable or logical to shut out the African negro, and still less does it appear to me that we should shut out the Maori, who may be said to have some claim upon our consideration. For that reason I am quite prepared to accept the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Whether we should recommit the Bill in order to amend another clause is a matter on which I am not quite &#39;clear. The Bill will have to go down to the other House, and it may tend to expedition if it is sent down as it is, and I undertake to get an amendment made there. </para>

All through, the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has been that the cost was the primary, in fact, the only  reason for revolting against any amendment which emanated from this side. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is consistent, because he has been voting for the extension of the privileges of this measure all through. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and his friends opposite have not been doing so. They have been voting against the extension of privileges to people of their own race, whilst at the same time they are prepared to extend their sympathy to coloured races.

                            can get up and contradict my statement if he pleases. The records will show whether I am correct or not. Every amendment that has been moved from the Opposition side of the Chamber to extend old-age pensions to people of our own nationality and colour has been resisted by the very gentlemen who are now ready to adopt this proposal for extending the measure to coloured people.

                        <para>- The honorable senator can blow his soap bubbles into the air as much as he pleases, but I shall make no effort to get him out of his fix. There is need for &#34; sunlight,&#34; or some other kind of light, to be introduced into his mind in connexion with this subject. The attitude of the Government is very inconsistent, when they agree to extend the benefits of this measure to a large number of coloured people, after resisting the same consideration being given to white men and women. The supporters of the Government are welcome to their idea of what old-age pensions legislation should be. I am satisfied that the country should know how questions of this kind are being treated by the present Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not waste much time in attempting to answer an excited ebullition of mental sterility. But there is one point which has been made to which I shall venture to reply. An endeavour has been made to represent that the Government have accepted amendments coming from the Ministerial side of the Chamber, while resisting those coming from the Opposition. I reply that the very amendment under consideration offers a flat contradiction to that statement. This amendment has a dual origin. It was first suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> and has been enlarged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> In both cases it was accepted by myself on behalf of the Government. To turn round and say that we accept amendments simply because they come from our own side, while resisting all that come from the Opposition, is to get as far from the truth as the honorable senator generally does. </para>

He voted for amendments to benefit people of his own  Tace  and his own colour. His amendment was one of many  that  were moved in another place, when the Millens and the Pulsfords were fighting against the Batchelors and those who wanted to liberalize the Bill, but, apparently, only <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor&#39;s</inline> amendment was accepted. </para>

                        <para>- The amendments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will, in all probability, entail additional expenditure. I am not concerned about that. Human life and suffering should receive the fullest consideration at our hands. But when the Government readily accept amendments in respect of coloured people, and vote as vigorously as they can against amendments intended to confer benefits on the white section of the community, we are entitled to draw attention to the fact. &#34; The Vice-President of the Executive Council says that he accepts amendments from either side. I do not. see, however, that there is any need for him to work himself into a state of frenzy respecting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s utterances. There was nothing wrong in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s desire to ascertain whether the amendment would entail additional expenditure, &#39; because that has been the reason why the Government have more than once opposed amendments. Evidently the present amendment will entail additional expenditure, but as it was moved by a Government supporter it was accepted, and the Government consequently had to accept the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to the same effect. </para>

                    <para>. - It was. scarcely fair of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to make the last remark. My amendment was absolutely consequential on a clause inserted in the other House on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor.</inline> This is an amendment with regard to invalid pensions, similar to that already inserted in the Bill with regard to old-age pensions. As for the matter of expenditure, I suppose that the&#39; amount involved would be quite negligible. The intention is to bring the two parts of the Bill into unison. I think that the amendment made elsewhere did great credit to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> and those members of the Labour party who were with him. </para>

It is nothing of the sort. The amendment carried at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> means that those coloured people who are naturalized subjects of the Commonwealth, but who were originally debarred from obtaining old-age pensions, are now to be able to obtain them. We know exactly the responsibility that we are undertaking. We know how many Asiatics, Kanakas, and Maoris there are in Australia, and how many are naturalized. We know the liability that we have incurred through the amendment to section  16.  But what does the present amendment mean? In the first place, there is no question of naturalization in connexion with invalid pensions. Any person who comes ashore in Australia, and is able to earn a living, will, if we pass this amendment, have a claim to an invalid pension. </para>

I believe the number to be  8,000,  or something like that. None of them will ever be eligible to claim old-age pensions under section  16. </para>

                        <para>- Only those who had been naturalized in the different States when the Commonwealth was inaugurated. We could not take away the rights of citizenship which they had acquired by their naturalization. Under the amendment submitted, every one of these coloured people will be entitled to an invalid pension, and it would not be necessary that they should be naturalized. A return has been furnished which shows that we have Chinese, and other Asiatics, and Pacific Islanders, in Australia to the number of 17,000 or 18,000. Of this number, only those who were taken over as naturalized subjects from the States will be able to claim old-age pensions, but every one of them will, under the clause before the Committee, be in a position to claim an invalid pension. We should understand exactly where we are in this matter. I am opposed to the clause, because it does not seem to me to be fair that the Commonwealth should undertake such a responsibility in respect of these 17,000 or 18,000 coloured persons. The amendment submitted in another place by the honorable- member for Boothby was of a very different character, because the number of persons affected by it was limited, and was known, since it covered only those who at the time of the inauguration of the Commonwealth were taken over from the control of the State Governments as naturalized subjects of the King. </para>

                    <para>. - I take this opportunity to protest against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s statement that the Government are inconsistent. In this matter they are not inconsistent at all, because they represent the black and coloured races. I am not like those honorable senators who say that the finances do not trouble them. They trouble me a great deal. I should be glad <inline font-style="italic">tolearn</inline> from the Vice-President of the Executive Council why he regards the financial position in a more favorable light to-day than he did yesterday. I say that we should not go in for taxation unless we cannot help it. We should be very careful about the financial responsibilities we incur. Yesterday we were told that proposals intended to assist aged women of our own &#39; race and others who it was admitted are entitled to consideration, would involve additional expenditure, and that the state of our funds would not permit us to give them the assistance desired. How is it that the state of our funds will permit of the adoption of the proposal now made? I am going to support the proposal, because I think it is just and necessary. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> recommended it in another place does not influence me. The Committee should've taken into the confidence of the Government. Let me say that if the Leader of the Senate desires to receive respect and consideration from the Opposition he will not continue to use such remarks as &#34; Will the Labour party be quiet, so that I may proceed.&#34; I do not think we should be treated in that manner. I made a suggestion yesterday that the Leader of the Senate had once belonged to the Labour party. That was considered wicked. </para>

                        <para>- We need not recognise a legal obligation to pay them pensions. The difficulty I see is that if we agree to the amendment we shall be admitting a legal liability to pay these coloured people invalid and old-age pensions. I am opposed&#39; to that. Our own white people are our first charge. We ought not to encourage coloured people to smuggle themselves in here. If they find that they have only to come to Australia to secure an invalid pension and to live here for a certain number of years to secure an old-age pension, we shall have hundreds of them coming here, and they will become a very serious charge upon the Commonwealth. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor&#39;s</inline> name has been mentioned in this connexion, I may say that I think he made a mistake in submitting the amendment which he did in another place. Had I been a member of that branch of the. Legislature, I should have probably opposed it, just as I intend to vote against this proposal, the adoption of which would open the door to a great deal of illegality in the way of coloured British subjects attempting to enter Australia. There are Chinamen in Hong kong, Red Indians in Canada, and various coloured subjects of the King scattered all over the British Dominions. </para>

                    <para>. - The more we examine this provision, the more unsatisfactory does it become. For my part, I would prefer to see it entirely eliminated from the Bill, especially in view of the fit of economy with which the Government are afflicted. If they really desire to economize, it should certainly be at the expense of the coloured races, and not at that of our own people. So far as the question of invalid pensions is concerned, I have no hesitation in saying that the most pitiable subjects for such pensions in the world are to be found in Victoria. I speak with considerable experience as a mining man, and I know of no part of the civilized world in which so many men with families dependent upon them become absolute wrecks at a comparatively early age. </para>

                        <para>- Under this proposal, there would be no need for these persons to become naturalized. If we cannot pay pensions to many deserving people of our own, because the Government desire to economize, I am not prepared to vote for the granting of pensions to members of coloured races. It appears to me that we were altogether in too great a hurry to affirm the principle which is embodied in the principal Act. But now that an opportunity presents itself, we ought to do our best to rectify some of its transparent anomalies. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that some misapprehension exists as to the effect of the amendment. In the first place, it must be recollected that it will not extend to coloured races anything which has not been granted to members of the white race. Its effect will merely, be to render coloured persons eligible to receive pensions under precisely similar conditions as are white persons. If a coloured man meets with an accident in the street, motives of common humanity prevent us from allowing him to die there. If he is unable to provide for himself, he is provided for in a State hospital, and thus becomes a charge upon the charity of the community. We are members of an Empire which recognises &#39;a certain proportion of coloured persons as British subjects. To my mind, they are not British subjects, but subjects of the British, and there is a very great difference between the two things. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend reminds me of the story of the man who was locked up. When his friends saw him in prison, they inquired, &#34; What are you doing here? &#34; In reply, he said, &#34; I have been locked! up, but I have committed no offence,&#34; to which they retorted, &#34;But a man cannot be locked up for nothing.&#34; The fact remained, however, that he was locked up. Whether or not coloured aliens can be admitted to the &#39;Commonwealth, the fact remains that they get here, and it does not matter to me whether or not that result is brought about by lax administration of the law. The amendment is a direct invitation to the coloured) races to enter the Commonwealth for the sake of enjoying a pension. The thing which annoys me most is the fact that these persons do not require to be naturalized; they are British subjects, no matter from what part of the British Dominions they come. My honorable friend who is in charge of the proposed new clause does not recognise any differentiation. His idea has always been to let them all come. </para>

Nor are they reliable as regards the number of coloured persons domiciled in Australia today. The Government have not been able to find money to extend the full benefits of this principle to the white race. They have declared that they are not able to grant a pension to our own women on reaching the age of sixty years. They are not prepared to give a pension to our invalids on the 1st January next. We are told that the state of the  finances  prevents them from acceding to our desire in those respects. Yet to-day we have the spectacle of their consenting to an amendment and being prepared to find means to support coloured people if they happen to be subjects of the King. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very sorry that some members of the Opposition are taking unnecessary alarm at what I term, and always have termed, a simple act of justice. The question of a white Australia is not involved in the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> nor is it involved in an amendment of a similar character, which is moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Honorable senators who are opposing the former are continually declaring that Chinese, Hindus, and Africans, who are prepared to work for half-a-crown a week, can flock into Australia with the expectation that when they have lived here for twenty years they will get an old-age pension. According to the laws of this country, a certain number of Asiatic aliens have been naturalized &#34;and obtained every privilege which a white citizen possesses, except as regards the right- to a pension. These persons are very few in number, and are fast dying out. We ought to be, if not generous, at least just to them. There is no danger in carrying this amendment. According to section 5 of the Naturalization Act an aboriginal native of Asia or Africa cannot now be naturalized in Australia. And unless a person is a naturalized or natural-born subject of the King, he cannot get an old-age pension. It should be borne in mind&#39; that these persons cannot come here. Suppose, for instance, that any Asiatic aliens did send in an application, unless they could prove that they were naturalized subjects, and had resided in the Commonwealth for a certain period, they would be put in prison, and then deported. </para>

                        <para>- This amendment does not involve the question of providing an old-age pension. It merely provides that whenever a. proclamation is issued to grant an invalid pension to our own people it shall also be granted to the few naturalized Asiatics who received the privileges of citizenship long ago. In view of the fewness of their number, and1 of the fact that no more are to be allowed to enter, we ought to treat them as fellow human beings. </para>

If it will not apply to any persons except Chinamen, and so forth, who came here twenty or thirty years ago, who are living here, and with whom no one desire. to interfere, why should it be inserted? If the words are introduced coloured subjects of the King who come here - and I do not care whether they come legally or illegally - will be entitled to an invalid pension. </para>

                        <para>- How would it be possible to discover whether a man of this class was here legally or illegally ? Why make this amendment ? Is it necessary ? Honorable senators who support it say that no person can get the pension who is not entitled to it. If that be the case, the amendment is not required. It will establish a very bad principle. It is like the thin end of the wedge. We propose to give Asiatics who are subjects of the King a legal status if they can get here. </para>

                        <para>- We do not know how they will come in. We do know that many have got in, and probably many more will come in the future. Decidedly, if they know that an old-age pension is awaiting them after twenty years, and that an invalid pension will be paid if one&#39; of them becomes permanently disabled, they will, of course, use every means in their power to come here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> advance the argument that, if Asiatics who are in the country  become ill and disabled, they have to be supported in some public institution or by private charity. That is quite right. I do not wish that any person resident in Australia who is poor or ill should be -made to suffer the pangs of hunger or from want of medical attention. But that applies to our own people, just as much as it does to others. Many of our people will not get pensions, and our first duty is to them. Honorable senators will be -on the safe side if they vote against the amendment. We are not quite clear as to the scope of it. It was never the intention of the people of this country that inducements should be given to coloured people either to come to Australia or to remain here. We do not desire to induce those who are in Australia to remain permanently. We should like them to get out as quickly as possible. But, if we place them upon an equality with our own . white Australians, . the inducement to remain will be strengthened. That is not a proper policy for the Parliament of Australia to adopt. </para>

                    <para>. - While we may be desirous of extending consideration to certain coloured subjects of the King, we must be careful not to perpetrate an injustice to others. Even with the addition of the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I am under the impression that we should be doing wrong by agreeing to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> proposal. The object of our legislation has been to keep out of this country all aliens, including Asiatics. There are several reasons for that policy, which. I need not enumerate. The principal reason is that Asiatics do not live up to the standard set by our white race. We ought not to offer any encouragement to the evasion of the Immigration Restriction Act, nor should we do anything that may increase the number of coloured aliens in the country. I have not yet heard any evidence which warrants me in believing that all the coloured people we have here are prepared to live up to the white standard. </para>

                        <para>- That is perfectly true, but in dealing with legislation of this nature we are not considering Fremantle only or the assistance rendered to certain honorable senators. We are dealing with a national problem. While I recognise the sterling worth of many of our coloured citizens, I have no proof that it is desirable to extend the benefits of this measure to 57,000 Asiatics. Let these people become naturalized. It- is not what their numbers are now that I am considering, but what they may be in the future. </para>

The effect would be to abolish any deduction whatever on the ground. that an old-age pensioner possessed a home. I ask honorable senators to consider that the ideal which every one of us has of an old-age pension is that in the- ultimate it may be paid to every citizen of the Commonwealth, irrespective of his pecuniary position. We all realize that the attainment of that ideal is at present impossible, but I think we are sensible that if we are ever to arrive at it, it must be by slow gradation. The new clause  I propose makes one step in that direction. Honorable senators know the circumstances of the inhabitants of Australia as well as I do. They are aware that many thousands of working men, of the class who will most largely avail themselves of pensions, are owners of their own homes. </para>

                        <para>- They have become possessors of their homes by industry and thrift, by stinting and saving so that they may be in a more or less independent position in their old age. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> refers to some who are possessed of three or four homes. I take it that people who are able to live without an old-age pension will not apply for one, and I remind the honorable senator that- the Act provides that any one who owns property of a certain value shall not be qualified to obtain a pension. I am pleading now more especially for members of a large section of the community who, after years of patient and strenuous endeavour, have been able to provide themselves with a roof to shelter their  old age. Under the Act, if an old-age pensioner has a house and land valued at  &#163;100, he is paid the full pension of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;26</inline> a year, but if his house is worth ; &#163;iio, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;x</inline> is taken off the pension paid to him. If he owns a house worth , &#163;200, a deduction of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> is made, and he receives a pension of only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;16</inline> a year instead of a pension of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;26.</inline> I am sure that honorable senators, and especially honorable senators opposite, will agree with me that we should offer every encouragement to our working people to secure homes of their own. </para>

                        <para>- But when a man sells his house he has to break up his home. He must live somewhere, and working people have their feelings, just as have other members of the community. A man may have lived in a dwelling for twenty, thirty, or even for forty years. He may have spent the best years of his life there. He has probably reared his family there, and some of his children may have died there. The home and its associations may have woven themselves around his very heart strings, so to speak, and yet under this law he would be compelled to abruptly sever those associations of years and to reside somewhere else, otherwise he would not be eligible to receive a pension. </para>

                        <para>-I cannot say whether the Commonwealth can do it. If I did not think that it could, I would not propose the amendment. Of course, I recognise that so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Savers</inline> is concerned, his interjection affords him a very easy get out. But he did not make that plea when the previous amendment was under consideration. He did not then inquire whether the Commonwealth could afford to pay pensions to all the coloured persons who chose to come here. On the contrary, he swallowed it without the slightest compunction. </para>

                    <para>. - I- have already said that my idea of an old-age pension is that it should be payable simply on the attainment of an age limit without any qualification whatever. I have also stated that I regard the scale and allowances provided for in this Bill as unfair, inasmuch as they are not comparative. Under one clause a more liberal allowance is made than is provided under other clauses. At the same time, I can scarcely see my way to support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> ; first, because it would not overcome the difficulties which are presented by the Bill, and secondly, because it would create greater difficulties. I suppose that the object of an old-age pension is to treat fairly all those who may be entitled to claim it. But under this proposal, whilst a man possessed of , &#163;310 in cash would receive no pension, another individual who had <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500</inline> invested in a house would obtain a full pension. If we are going to have a property qualification or a property disqualification, there ought to be some actuarial basis by which we can apportion the amount of the pension to that -of the property of which a person may be possessed. We must either do that or support the payment &#39;of universal pensions. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has a very laudable desire to protect the homes of certain people, I ask him whether it is quite fair that a man who has&#163;310 in cash should receive a&#39; pension- </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator regard that as a material factor in the argument? I have already stated that one claimant of the pension is possessed of a house which is valued at&#163;2,000. We all know that there are such erratic individuals in the community. They are quite content to live in a property of that kind and to end their days there, with the comforting knowledge that they will be able to hand it on to their children. An old-age pension which has regard to the necessities of the people must also take cognisance of the property which they possess. Until the time arrives when we can readjust the scale of charges contained in this Bill, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> not to press his amendment. </para>

This clause deals with the accumulated property which a claimant may have. It has been reported to me that in the case of a pensioner who is living in his cottage, it being mortgaged, no allowance is made for the interest which he pays. Section 25 of the Act says - </para>

                <para class="block">The provision means, I take it, that the interest on the mortgage shall be deducted from the rental derived, in order to get at the amount of the annual income. And in a case where a pensioner is living in his cottage the mortgage should be deducted from the capital value of the property. Obviously if an old person is living in his cottage, and its capital value is . &#163;150, and it is mortgaged for ; &#163;100, it is ridiculous to make a deduction of&#163;150. I am told that that is not being done. The Minister, of course, cannot give me an answer on the spur of the moment, but I ask him to make an inquiry. I think he will admit that the spirit of the Act is that where a man is living in his cottage the capital value shall be deemed to be the capital value clear of encumbrance. </para>

But, from my knowledge of the Act and the practice which prevailed under the New South Wales Act, from which our provision was copied, I feel perfectly certain that that which he says should be the practice is so.

                        <para>- I cannot agree with the honorable senator there. The purpose of this clause is entirely in the interest of the pensioner. At the present time, he has to file a return annually. It is not thought necessary to call upon a man to make a return of his property every year. It is not likely to vary very much, except in a very small number of cases. Hitherto it has been thought sufficient if we relieve him of the obligation to make an annual return, and simply require him to send in one whenever the Registrar notifies Kim to that effect. </para>

                        <para>- According to the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-book</inline> for 1909, the total number of inmates of benevolent asylums was 16,586. I venture to say that now that the Old-age Pensions Act is in operation, that number will be decreased by at least one-third. A considerable number of aged men and women have been inmates of benevolent asylums because their sons, daughters, or near relatives were not able to assist materially in their maintenance. But the very fact that the Commonwealth Old-age Pensions Act gives to these people the small allowance of 10s. per week will induce large numbers of relatives of our aged, poor to take them under their own roofs. That is a common-sense argument. Reasoning on that basis, I have no doubt that the number of inmates in benevolent asylums will be reduced by at least one-third. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the amount is very great. We must also remember that the parent Act provides for an allowance to such inmates for four weeks before they leave . an institution. </para>

                <para class="block">That is to say, if the inmate of a benevolent institution chooses to leave the institution, he or she is entitled to the old-age pension for four weeks before leaving ; that is to say, is entitled to receive <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2.</inline> That must be. deducted from the total expenditure which my amendment would involve. I have before me a statement from the Treasury Department of Victoria in relation to the average cost per week of inmates maintained in benevolent asylums in this State during the year ending 30th June, 1908. I am informed by the responsible officers that the average cost per week was 5s. 9d. per inmate. If we have regard to the higher cost of living in such States as Queensland and Western Australia, we may say that the average cost of maintaining inmates of benevolent asylums throughout the Commonwealth is 7s. per week. So that if my new clause be carried, any inmate of a benevolent asylum would receive the benefit of the balance of 3s. per week. I do not think that any argument on humanitarian grounds is needed to commend the clause to the favorable consideration of the Committee. We know that if the sturdy pioneers of Australia, many of whom, unfortunately, are to-day inmates of benevolent &#39;asylums, were granted the old-age pension, they would receive added comforts. Many little things would be given to them which to-day, I will not say are denied to them, but which the institutions really cannot afford to give. </para>

                        <para>- I do not mean that at all. It is very likely that the majority of the inmates of a benevolent asylum will be sixty-five years of age at least, and if these people had remained outside they would each be entitled to receive 10s. per week as an old-age pension. Therefore, the pensions ought to be given to them as inmates of these institutions. </para>

                <para>If aged people entitled to a pension can live with their families, and give the ios. per week towards their keep, let them do so. But if a number of our aged- poor, to whose indomitable perseverance, pluck, and endurance under trying conditions in the past, we owe the development of the Commonwealth, have no home to go to, and are compelled to remain inmates of benevolent asylums, we should give them the consideration I suggest, even though to do so would involve slightly differential treatment of the aged poor. I- shall not labour the matter further. I submit the clause for the consideration of the Committee, and hope that it will be incorporated in the measure. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I do not say that for all time we should shut out of view the necessity to reconsider this legislation in regard to the position of inmates of public institutions. But I do say that, seeing that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> proposes would involve a contribution to the State Governments, and bearing in mind that we are on the eve of negotiations with representatives of those- Governments to ascertain what our future financial relations are to be, a common-sense and business-like view -of the matter would suggest that this proposal should be left over until the negotiations to which I have referred have been advanced a stage or two. For this reason, I ask the Committee to discard the amendment. Even if we admitted the principle involved, I should still be very much disinclined to accept the proposed new clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has said that the cost of maintenance of the inmates of some of these institutions is 5s. 9d. per head per week. He proposes that we should hand over IOS. per head per week to these benevolent institutions in respect of inmates whose keep costs them only 5s. 9d. per week. </para>

                        <para>- When he leaves the institution- -when, possibly, he is carried in his coffin to his last home. The honorable senator has quoted from a circular representing the views of the authorities of four benevolent asylums in Victoria, who conferred on the subject. They made a very different proposal from that which the honorable senator has submitted. They undertook that, no matter what the pension was, and no matter what it cost to maintain a pensioner in a benevolent institution, they would secure to him every week a certain portion of the pension. That was a very much more reasonable proposal to put forward. It would command a larger measure of support than will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> proposal in its present form. If the Committee decided to pay pensions to inmates of these institutions, there would, under such a provision, be some guarantee that the pensioners would directly participate to some extent in the country&#39;s bounty. Seeing that .pensioners who would be inmates of these institutions would be amongst the oldest of our old people, and would in the natural order of events be amongst those who would soonest join the great majority, it would be inevitable that any balance in excess of the cost of their keep would go, not to them, but to the support of the institutions. </para>

                        <para>- Because the Committee might decide against me on the principle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> may not be able to understand the position, but I am satisfied that the Committee does. I feel certain that the Committee will not- adopt the proposal, in view of the fact that a liability of &#163;400,000 attaches to it, and that the money would go, not merely to State benevolent asylums, but to &#34; other charitable institutions,&#34; which would include denominational institutions. If we are to subsidize these institutions, we should secure some measure of control over them. Many of them are now under the control of the State Governments, and if they were to be subsidized by the Commonwealth that would probably involve a dual control. I venture to say that the Federal Government will not subsidize these institutions without claiming some right of supervision, and it would not be satisfactory to have a State as well as the Federal Government exercising control over the same institutions. The whole question is one which no doubt will require careful revision in the near future, but at the present moment, for the reasons I have given, I think it would not be judicious to adopt the proposal. </para>

                            proposes the payment of pensions to inmates of benevolent asylums who are successful claimants. If the Commonwealth does not pay the pensions to these men in the institution they can leave it and demand their pensions outside. If a pensioner elects to remain in a State institution, the State Government will be more foolish than I take them to be, if they do not immediately make a claim against the pensioner or the Commonwealth for his upkeep. A man entitled to 10s. a week is not likely to be kept in a benevolent institution for nothing. So that there would be no subsidizing of the State Governments. Many of our old men and women would be very much better off in a public institution than they could possibly be anywhere else. Many of them have no relations, and many who have would refuse to live with their relations. Very many are unable to look after themselves, and whilst individually they are not in a position to pay other people to look after them, collected in a public institution they can be attended to in the most effective manner, can secure medical attendance, be kept clean and healthy, and be much better fed than they would be possibly under other circumstances. Our benevolent asylums are run on socialistic lines, and that probably is the reason why the Minister is so pronounced in his opposition to this proposal. The honorable senator talks of other charitable  and denominational institutions. These I know nothing whatever about, &#39; but if they are engaged in charitable work at the present moment, I say, &#34; God bless them.&#34; The hearts of those in charge of  them are evidently warmer than are those of the members of the present Commonwealth Government. Inmates of these institutions who are qualified to obtain old-age pensions, ought to be given them.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline>
                            amendment provides that, should there be any unexpended balance after the cost of the maintenance of any inmate of a charitable institution has been deducted, the balance shall be returned to him upon his discharge from that institution. I do not know how much it would cost to maintain an inmate of one of these institutions, but I should think that it would almost absorb the whole of the pension of 10s. per week. But, should there be any unexpended balance, the proposal which we are now considering would be an eminently fair one. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has declared that, if adopted, that proposal would involve an additional expenditure of &#163;400,000 per annum. A large number of persons will undoubtedly claim the pension, and if they cannot obtain it whilst they are inmates of charitable institutions they will certainly leave those institutions and draw it outside. This Parliament has already . exhibited such lavish generosity that it has actually entered into an engagement to pay pensions to Chinese and coloured persons from any other portion of Asia. Yet we are asked to take up a. niggardly attitude in regard to old persons of our own nationality who have found a resting-place in our benevolent asylums and other charitable institutions. I do not think that the adoption of the amendment would involve the expenditure of a single additional shilling, for the reason that I have stated. In fact, I am not sure that the States will be justified in maintaining in their own institutions persons who should be in receipt of old-age pensions. If I were a member of a State Parliament, I should certainly see that the Commonwealth shouldered its obligations in this connexion to the last farthing. Doubtless there are plenty of watchdogs in the State Legislatures who will see that it does so. I shall support the amendment of

                        <para>- I said that the number of inmates in our various charitable institutions was more than 16,000. But I also assumed that one-third of that number would leave those institutions when they became recipients of old-age pensions, because the payment of those pensions would enable their families to provide them with that shelter and assistance which they were previously unable to afford them. I also stated , the estimated cost of my proposal at &#163;5,528 per week. If that sum be multiplied by fifty-two, we have an annual expenditure of &#163;277,456. That is a vastly different statement of the case from that which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> That honorable gentleman also declared that that amount would represent a contribution to the States. I have a keen recollection that, when the Surplus Revenue Bill was under consideration in this Chamber, members of the present Opposition &#34;were accused of robbing the States. The States themselves thought that we were robbing them, simply because we desired to pay a certain sum into a trust account, to provide the nucleus of an old-age pensions fund. So keenly did some of the States feel upon this matter that they tested the constitutionality of our procedure before the High Court. But they- lost the suit. That tribunal held that we were quite within our constitutional rights. The Vice-    President  of the Executive Council was himself loud in his denunciation of that machinery measure, and joined with- others in their clamour against the action of this Parliament. To-day, however, merely because he is the Leader of the Senate, he affirms that, if my proposal be adopted,  we shall be making a contribution to the States. But, even if we did relieve them of a burden in this connexion, we should merely be giving effect to the very spirit which underlies the original Act. In opposition to paragraph 3 of the clause which I have proposed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has asked, &#34; Where would the residue of the pension go if an inmate of one of our charitable institutions were to die there?&#34; In doing so he has gone to a ridiculous extreme. The clause merely provides that any balance which may remain, after paying for the maintenance of an inmate, shall he handed over to him when he is discharged or leaves the institution. </para>

With all due respect to the keenness of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I venture to say that paragraph  3 of my proposal is on all -fours with a section in the Principal Act which provides that before an inmate leaves a charitable institution he must be paid the equivalent of four weeks&#39; pension.  . I  mention these circumstances to enable honorable senators to discuss this matter fairly, squarely, and above board. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the honorable senator must recognise that his proposal merely involves a transfer of liability ? For that reason, which I think is an all-sufficient one, it seems undesirable at this juncture to press the amendment. I also suggest to honorable senators that the Principal Act was a very huge departure in Australian legislation, and that it is undesirable to make any changes which would involve a great deal of extra work and introduce complexity in the arrangements. I confess that, while having a great sympathy with the object in view, I do not see any possibility of pursuing this proposal to advantage at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that in Queensland we have a great many private institutions. I have looked up the report of the Benevolent Asylum at Dunwich for 1907. At the time it was submitted, the Old-age Pensions Act of the State had been in existence for six months, that is, from the 1st January to the 30th June, 1908. A number of honorable senators seem to think that on the payment of old-age pensions there will immediately be a very large reduction in the number of inmates in benevolent asylums. I have never held that view. I do not believe that it will make any great difference in that regard. From all over Australia, a large number of persons will drift into these institutions. . Many of these persons have no friends who will be prepared to take the old-age pensions and look after them. It must not be forgotten that the older a person gets the greater nuisance he becomes to those who have to look after him. I  suppose it will be generally admitted that when persons get into their second childhood&#39; they need more attention and care from their friends. Great credit is due to sons and daughters who will take the old-age pension for their parents and assume the trouble and liability of looking after them. I propose to quote a few figures from the report for 1907 to show that, in the case of Dunwich Asylum, there was just as large a decrease in the number of inmates before the Old-age Pensions Act came into force as there is now. In 1903 it contained 967 men and 173 women, making a total of 1,140 inmates, and representing a decrease of 45 for the year. In 1904, it contained 977 men and 155 women, making a total of- 1,132 inmates, and representing a decrease of 8 for the year. In 1905 it contained 1,016 men and ,-76 women, making a total of 1,192 inmates, and representing an increase of 60 for the year. In 1906 it contained 1,010 men and 169 women, making a total of 1,179 inmates, and representing a decrease of 13 for the year. On the 31st December, 1907 - that is, the day before the Old-age Pensions Act had come into force - it contained 969 men and 186 women, making a total of 1, j 55 inmates, and representing a decrease of 24 in the number for the preceding year. The ebb and flow was about the same before the introduction of the old-age pensions as it was at the time when this report was issued. The Old-age Pensions Act had not been in force long enough then to give a clear indication as to what might ultimately take place. But my opinion is that we shall not have a very large decrease in the &#34;number of inmates in this institution.

                        <para>- If that is so it only strengthens my argument. If the Commonwealth decides to hand over to the State a sum of I OS. per week per inmate, will it not offer an inducement to the State to recoup itself say 2s. or 3s. per week to meet the interest on the cost of the buildings, the cost of supervision, and all that sort of thing? I am not prepared to vote any money to relieve the State of any expenditure in that direction. Of the 1,483 inmates who were in the Dunwich Asylum in 1907, there were 450 persons between the ages of 60 and 70 years, and I suppose it is reasonable to assume that one-half of those persons were 65 years of age. There were 531 persons between the ages of 70 and 80 years, 159 persons between the ages of 80 and 90 years, and twelve persons over 90 years of age. Out of the 1,483 inmates, 927 were over the age of 65 years. </para>

                        <para>- That is hard for any one to say, but I believe that at least 70 per cent, of them will be found to be entitled under the Federal law to an old-age pension on the ground of residence in Australia for twenty years. In my opinion this amendment, if adopted, would not only relieve the States, but also cause a considerable amount of trouble in the matter of divided management. Whilst we are now prepared as a Federal Parliament to make provision for all old people in Australia over a certain age, and in the near future to pay invalid pensions, I look forward to the time when we shall likewise be able to establish our own Commonwealth institutions under one management. I am prepared to do anything to bring about that state of affairs. But meanwhile I would allow the States to bear the expenditure in connexion with benevolent asylums. I doubt whether, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> new clause were carried, the money would be of very great benefit to many of the inmates of the institutions, because when the cost of maintenance had1 been deducted from the ios. very little would be left for the inmates. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> proposed new clause. I have paid a few visits to some of the benevolent asylums of Victoria, and am acquainted with the fare which the inmates receive. It is not of the very best, owing to the fact that the amount of money provided by the Government for maintenance is so small. We are told that the average cost of maintaining persons in the benevolent institutions in this State is 5s. 9d. per week. What can we expect that the unfortunate inmates can get for that amount? They cannot have any form of luxury, and they are denied some of the creature comforts which would tend to lengthen their lives and be a source of joy to them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that the inmates should be given grog. There are many other creature comforts which would tend to brighten their remaining days. We are told that the new clause would lead to great difficulties in management. &#39; I do not see why it should, because the money would be paid by the Commonwealth Government on account of the inmates and would be held in trust for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> says that the Commonwealth will ultimately have its own institutions, and appoint its own managers. But in the meantime he would allow things to remain as they are. In these institutions there are many who have rendered yeoman service to this country. They are without friends or relations, and have no one to help and comfort them. What is to be done on their behalf? Are they to remain in the institutions and fed on the scantiest of fare, because they have no relatives and friends, whilst those who have relatives will be able to live outside and get the full benefit of 10s. per week? I see no valid argument against the proposal, and trust that a majority of the Committee will vote for it. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that we are overlooking the object of the Bill. It did not originate as a Bill to meet every possible difficulty, in connexion with the poor of Australia. We have had old-age pension systems in some of the States. It was felt that there ought to be one general system throughout the Commonwealth. That is the primary object of the measure. In constructing a general system we have endeavoured to make it more liberal than any of the State systems were. That is a big stride. I do not pretend for a moment that we are now doing everything that we ought to do. But we are making a good beginning, and if we are to proceed further we must possess knowledge and information. This Bill will be a means of furnishing us with information which will enable us to perfect its provisions. But if we load the measure with a number of provisions, kindly in their intention but ignorantly adopted - I do not mean to use that term in an offensive sense - adopted through our impulses and our Sympathy. we shall be making a mistake. I agree that we ought to have some system of providing .for those aged persons who have none to care for them. I agree that we should have some corporate institution that should be made as kindly and as homelike as possible. But at present we are at our wits&#39; end to know how we are to get the money for what we are about to do. We shall be acting wisely not to load this effort unduly. None of us contemplates for a moment that the best we can do now is the best that we are going to do. Certainly I. do not. I , consider that the- best we can do at this time will be rapidly improved upon. But I am sure that it can be most effectively improved upon by observing &#39;the working of what we are now able to do, and by discovering from actual experience and facts and figures how we can improve our system. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> that if this amendment were carried, we should not do any new work, although we should undertake a considerable amount of new expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so sure about that. The charitable institutions are for the most part conducted for a very small expenditure, which, of course,, implies that the provision made for the inmates is of a meagre, not of a generous, character. I have visited the benevolent institutions of this country whenever I could. I take an active interest in them. I have seen the fare provided. It is wholesome and sufficient nutriment, though I must admit that it is often rugged. Old people with poor appetites and failing constitutions cannot easily consume the food which is set before them. I know that, and am sorry for it. </para>

                        <para>- That&#39; is an unfortunate fact, which I do not overlook. We should not, I think, undertake this new proposal, for the reason that there is no positive knowledge as to what added expenditure it would involve. But we know that it would be considerable, and it is highly problematical whether the persons we hope&#34; to benefit would be relieved to any considerable extent. There is the certainty that the work is now being done. By carrying <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;</inline> s amendment we should relieve the persons who are now doing it. But we should simply shift the burden, and should not necessarily do the work better. I think it ought to be done better. I believe it will be done better if we take no step in the direction indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> but keep in mind the necessity for rapidly improving and making more complete and as humane and as sympathetic as we can, the treatment extended to our aged poor. </para>

                    <para>. When I spoke before, I had not closely read the wording of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> proposed new clause. It reads that the pensions are to be paid to the inmates of benevolent asylums, &#34; or other charitable institutions.&#34; That covers a great deal more than I had contemplated. I referred only to one institution. In the Queensland official volume from which I quoted, under the heading of &#34; Charitable Institutions,&#34; there are also the hospitals for the insane and the Diamantina Hospital for chronic diseases. I quoted the report of the Benevolent Asylum at Dunwich. There is another from the Jubilee Sanatorium at Dalby. All the reports to which I refer are for the year ending June,  1908.  I should say that to some extent these are complementary institutions. For instance, an inmate of the Dunwich Asylum who develops some chronic complaint may be transferred to the Diamantina Hospital. </para>

I. am pointing out that these are complementary institutions to  a  great extent. Many inmates of the Dunwich Asylum have been sent from there to hospitals for the insane. These latter hospitals contain many people who would !be entitled to a. Federal old-age pension under the proposed new clause. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator forgets that his proposed clause covers benevolent asylums and other charitable institutions. Undoubtedly the Dunwich Asylum and the Diamantina Hospital are charitable institutions, as are hospitals for the insane in various parts of the State The proposed clause would apply to inmates of all the institutions to which I have referred. I have not gone into the number of the inmates maintained in them, but I say that we should find the cost of maintaining them a little more than we should be paying the State Government for their up-keep. For every inmate of the institutions to which I have referred who would be qualified to receive a pension under the proposed clause the Federal Government would pay  10s.  per week to the State Government, because that is what this clause means. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but I. am dealing only with State institutions. I point out that we shall be paying to the State Government  10s.  per week for each of these people. It costs the State, say,  &#163;30  per year to maintain each of these old&#34; people, and the result will be that we shall be paying <inline font-style="italic">&#163;26</inline> per year over to the State Government, who will add the other  &#163;4  per year necessary for the up-keep of each of these inmates. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that it costs more than  &#163;30  per year to maintain the inmates of some of the institutions I have been describing. Old persons who suffer from chronic complaints cost more to maintain than do the inmates of ordinary Benevolent asylums. We should not take over the responsibility of paying pensions for each of the inmates of these institutions, because we do not know what the State Governments intend to do, and we should only be relieving their financial position at the expense of the Commonwealth, whilst at the same time we should have no guarantee that the inmates of these institutions would derive any benefit from the money we spent or would get any better treatment than they receive at the present time. </para>
