                        <para>.. - I rise to support the second reading of this Bill. I believe that it will do a great deal of good for the purpose for which it has been introduced. &#39; I do not think that it will lead to overlapping with what is being done by the States. We cannot have too much information about agriculture, and we cannot do too much to assist in its development. Agriculture is one of the main-stays of the Commonwealth. The more people we get on to the land, and the more we. do to assist them, the better it will be for the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to say whether the Bill is going any further or not. That is for the Government Co determine. The whole question with me is simply this - that if we have a Bureau of Agriculture, carried on by the Federal Government, much expenditure can be saved to the States. As we stand at present, if an inquiry has to be made into any agricultural matter, or experiments have to be conducted, the States act independently. We have had experts sent to America, to England, and to Germany, to find out what it was best to do in certain circumstances. In such circumstances, the efforts of one State often overlap those of another. If we have a Federal Bureau, one expert can be sent abroad by the Commonwealth, and the results of his researches will be. at the disposal of every State. </para>

                            <para>- I am not proposing to interfere with State Rights in any respect. But I do not see why each State should be put to separate expense in sending men abroad to conduct investigations for the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. There is nothing to prevent the central authority acting for the common good in such respects. There is no reason for saying that a man believes in unification because he believes in the Commonwealth performing a service for the whole of Australia. Before Federation, each State had a separate Post Office system, and a separate staff. Now we have a Post Office Department for the whole of Australia, controlled by one authority, matters concerning each State being under the supervision of a Deputy Postmaster-General. The same sort of thing can be done in regard to a Bureau of Agriculture. Each State can carry on its own functions, but the Commonwealth can assist all the States. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to give one or two reasons why I consider this Bill unnecessary. I have listened to nearly the whole of the debate on the second reading; but I have not yet heard any statement made which would justify the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture. No reason has been given why the Commonwealth Government should go to the expense of establishing a Department to do work which is already being done admirably by the State Departments of Agriculture. The people most interested in agriculture in Australia have shown that they are satisfied with the work which the State Departments are doing for them. They might agree that in the future it may be necessary to establish a Federal Department of Agriculture, but they certainly think as I do, that the time has not yet arrived for the establishment of such a Department. It has been urged that, under this Bill, experts might be appointed to investigate the various pests and diseases with which the agriculturists of Australia have to contend. I am of opinion that, owing to  differing climatic conditions in the different States, it would be better that the diseases and pests peculiar to each State should be investigated by a State expert than that the work should be undertaken by a Federal Department. It would be an enormous task for one office to undertake. Previous speakers have pointed out that at various agricultural conferences that have been held in different parts of the Commonwealth, this Bill has been protested against. Only last week, an Agricultural Conference held in Melbourne decided against it&#34;. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, who has taken a lively interest in the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, attended this Conference, with the object of explaining the Bill now before the Senate, to the agricultural experts assembled at the Conference. The honorable gentleman indulged in a great deal of special pleading to induce the Conference to recognise the virtues of this measure. An endeavour was made before the Conference met to find out the feeling of persons interested in agriculture throughout Victoria on this subject ; and at the conclusion of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick&#39;s address, the  Chairman  of the Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M&#39; Tier</inline> said that - </para>

These people know exactly what they want, and yet only nineteen out of seventy-five bodies interested in agriculture thought it worth while to reply to a circular sent to them on the subject, and the majority of the nineteen were antagonistic to the Bill. Some members of the Chamber of Agriculture objected to the Bill on the ground that it would merely lead to a duplication of billets. I think that they were perfectly justified in that objection.

                    <para class="block">This shows that those who are most interested in agriculture in Victoria, and I think the same is true of all the States, see no necessity for the establishment of this new Department. The Federal Government are, in fact, forcing upon the State Governments something which they do not desire, and which the people of the States are protesting against. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> direct attention to the fact that in .manufacturing and industrial matters the Federal Government adopt an entirely different attitude. They, are very careful to avoid interference with the rights of the State Governments in that respect. They -have intimated that they would prefer that the State Governments should themselves deal with such matters, and have gone so far as to waive some of the rights of the Commonwealth authority in order to enlarge the powers of the State authorities in dealing with them. I agree with other honorable senators that the Government have no real intention to pass this Bill this session. They desire merely that the second reading shall be carried, and the measure will then be dropped so that -when they go to the country they may be able to tell the farmers that they proposed certain legislation in their interests, but for lack of time were unable to carry it. I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill, because I believe it to be entirely unnecessary, and because I think that it would lead to the creation of a new Department which would involve considerable expense, and which for a number of years would be useless to the people in whose interests it is proposed to be established. The Government have not yet shown how they intend to raise the necessary funds to meet liabilities to which they are already committed, and yet they propose under this Bill to establish a new Department involvin&#163;r further expenditure, and which, in my opinion, as well as in the opinion of those most directly interested in the matter, would be useless. </para>

                        <para>. - I would support the second reading of this Bill if I thought that it represented a genuine effort to assist the agricultural industries of the Commonwealth. But, looking at it in its bald form, it seems to me that it provides an inefficient way of helping those interests. This leaflet of a Bill proposes no organization in connexion with the projected Federal Agricultural Bureau. It merely expresses a pious hope that something may be done in the future. In my judgment, it would have been very much better to leave the whole subject severely alone until the Government were prepared to bring down a Bill embodying a form of organization and prescribing the duties of the officers who would be attached to. the Department. I shall vote against the motion for the second reading of the measure, but I can assure the Government that when they make provision upon the Estimates for financing a sound scheme - in other words, when they show me that they really mean business, and that they are not merely seeking to advertise themselves - I shall be found supporting them. This Bill is nothing but a huge political placard. It is a bundle of vagueness from start to finish, and evidences no intention of a desire to assist those interests which it pro fesses to assist.

                    <para class="block">Some such declaration might have fitly taken the place of the Bill and would have deceived nobody, because it is an open secret that this measure is not to be persevered with. I recognise that the agricultural interests of Australia are at present fairly well served by the State Agricultural Bureaux. At the same time I admit that there is room for the establishment of even a seventh Bureau. When the Government submit a proposal for the payment of salaries to officers connected with this Department I, shall be. found voting for it. Probably when that time arrives the Ministry will have to rely more upon the votes of members of the Opposition than upon those of their present supporters. I shall welcome any sincere attempt on the part of the Government to establish a Federal Agricultural Bureau, because I hold that we cannot have too much knowledge upon matters pertaining to agriculture. We cannot continue to allow persons to settle in the drier areas of Australia, there to be brought face to face with problems which they have no means of solving. When they enter into occupation of the dry interior, it is of the first importance that they should know what breeds of wheat they ought to sow, and what kind of fertilizers they ought  to  use. Whilst the State Agricultural Bureaux are doing very good work, we could with advantage supply the people with very much more knowledge in this connexion. In America the Bureau of Agriculture, which has been organized on a substantial basis, has been the means of bringing untold benefits to the, agriculturist. For instance, it has been instrumental in abolishing pleuro-pneumonia in cattle.I need scarcely remind honorable senators of the serious nature of that disease, and of how it has driven many a man from his home, besides dissipating the earnings of his life. The United States Bureau has also investigated the causes of many other diseases  to  be found in plants and animals. Up  to  the present it has saved- the people of that country thousands and thousands of dollars as the result of its scientific research, and I feel that it is up to the Commonwealth to * establish an institution upon similar lines. I will vote for any proposal to finance this Bureau, and to organize it upon -a scale which will show that the Government really mean business. At present, however, the Bill is merely the expression of a pious hope on the part of the Government that something may be done. In reality, they intend to do nothing. One honorable senator has stated that it is upon all fours with the Census and Statistics Act, and the Meteorological Act. It is nothing of the kind. &#39; The Act under which the Census and Statistical Department was established defines the duties of officers connected with that Department. But the Senate is entirely in the dark as to what action- the Government propose to take in organizing the proposed Federal Bureau of Agriculture. T regret that they have not brought down a Bill which reflects an earnest desire to establish a Department which would be capable of doing good work. </para>

I should like to see excised from the Bill any provision which sets forth that the usefulness of the Bureau is &#34;to depend upon the goodwill or favour of the State Agricultural Departments. Under the Bill, the bureau may do certain things by an arrangement with the State Departments. But those Departments would act in obedience to the instructions of their respective Governments, and might be so jealous of their own status and investigations, that they would not readily lend themselves to any co-operation with the Federal Department. </para>

                            <para>- In that case, we . shall be struggling in hobbles, and shall certainly collide with the States at every step that we take. If there is to be a mere bureau for the purpose of gathering agricultural information, and disseminating it, let us understand that at once. But if it is to be established on the same basis as the American Department of Agriculture, and is to investigate diseases affecting animals and plants, it will be hampered at the outset, because the six competing Departments of the States will be only too anxious to safeguard their own status and resent any interference with their work. At the same time, I feel that there is room for a seventh authority. We should not, how?, ever, set forth that the usefulness of our Department shall wholly, or even partially, depend upon the good will or co-operation, of the States. We should take untrammelled control of our Department, and should not rely upon the co-operation of the States. If, hereafter, the Government should show an earnest intention to organize a Department, and submit proposals for financing it, I shall vote for them. But. at present, I feel that they are not engaged in a genuine effort, and therefore I cannot support the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not desire to occupy the time of the Senate at any great length ; but one or two statements have been advanced which seem to me to invite criticism. One of the most general statements made has been that the Bill does not really contemplate anything, but is a mere empty placard. Side by side with that statement we had a denunciation of the Bill because it was alleged that by means of it the Commonwealth Government would be duplicating the work which is carried on by the States. </para>

I should like honorable senators to make up their minds as to what it is that they mean. Is the Bill to be a mere empty placard from 1  which nothing will result? If so, it is clear that there can be no duplication of State action. </para>

                            <para>- The criticism directed against the Bill has been self-destructive. Honorable senators, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> have denounced the Bill because they say that it will involve an expenditure which is, in essence, a duplication of that already incurred by the States. I could understand that argument if it stood alone, but side by side with it we have those who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> have denounced the Bill, because they say that they are in favour of the Commonwealth establishing an Agricultural Bureau, but are not in favour of this Bill, because it is a mere empty placard, or, to use the words of the last  speaker,  a mere pious expression. Whether the Bill is to mean anything, whether it is to be a Bill under which active operations will be undertaken, or a Bill under which active operations will become extensive and prolonged, will entirely depend upon Parliament. At every stage it will have full opportunity of deciding how far the Bureau shall be an active agency, and, of course, that control it will exercise through the appropriation. No appointments could, or would, be made until Parliamentary sanction had been sought through the Estimates&#39;. That being so, honorable senators can see at once that they can dismiss all idea of any extravagance being incurred, unless it was extravagance to which they were parties. I would point out to honorable senators that, without the authority of an Act of Parliament, we have Departments in existence to-day. I make that statement in answer to the charge that this Bill is an empty placard, inasmuch as it merely affirms that there shall be a Bureau of Agriculture, and sets out to define its duties. It is said that because the Bill is not more definite, because it does not proceed to appoint various officers, therefore it is the mere declaration of a desire. But. in the Commonwealth, and also, I believe, in the States, we have Departments which have grown up . without Parliamentary sanction other than that expressed in the appropriations. This Bill can be as operative or inoperative as Parliament likes. The extent and area of its operations will unquestionably depend upon the appropriations which Parliament may from time to time sanction. </para>

I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was absolutely correct. Of those two Acts, the latter merely affirms that a meteorologist shall be appointed, and proceeds to describe his duties. This Bill&#39; affirms not that a Director of Agriculture shall be appointed, but that there shall be a Bureau of Agriculture, which, of course, corresponds with the declaration in the Meteorological Act that there shall be a meteorologist. </para>

As we read on we find that in the Act the duties of the meteorologist are set out, whereas, in this case, we find that the duties of the Bureau of Agriculture are set out. It is an absolute parallel. </para>

With regard to the Census and Statistics Act, the same parallel is observable. Senator Lynch has, I think, made a mistake in looking at the number of sections in that Act. He failed to recognise that the vast majority of them are obligations placed upon the public and directions to officers as to secrecy and otherwise. This Bill, I venture to submit, contains all that is necessary at this juncture;. It is a measure by means of which Parliament can authorize the creation of a public Department. . </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend has assented to that proposition. We could only spend money under the Bill in one way, and that is by the appointment of officers. I venture to say that no Government would be absurd enough to appoint officers to keep them in idleness. If we do employ officers we may assume that they will carry on some work. Whether it will be a duplication of work already performed or not is quite beside the point. It is clear from this admission that the Bill, if passed, would result in the creation of an Agricultural Department, in spite of all the statements which have been made by </para>

If, however, honorable senators do amplify them, they will not hasten the work one bit, because they will be inoperative until Parliament has made financial provision to give effect to them. It does not matter, therefore, whether the machinery is contained in one clause or set out at great length in twenty clauses. Whether Parliament wants this Department to be a large or small one must always depend upon the one fact of appropriation. I ask honorable senators to assent to the second reading of the Bill with a clear intimation that I shall have no objection to any reasonable proposals for enlarging the machinery clauses. </para>

                    <para>. - I appeal to the Government to report progress now. The Vice-President of the Executive Council invited honorable senators to suggest amendments. The division that has just taken place was somewhat surprising, and we have not yet had time to frame amendment?. It would be convenient to report progress, having regard to certain arrangements that have been made. </para>

Whether the Bureau of Agriculture Bill is to. be considered in Committee to-morrow or on Wednesday next makes very little difference, because it is plain that we have not much business to go on with, and that the Government have merely adopted this method of getting out of their difficulty. I suppose that had it not been that some honorable senators desired to go to South Australia to- day we should soon have disposed of the whole of our business.I have already expressed my doubts as to whether the Government are in earnest with reference to the Bill with which we have been dealing, and I intend to find out next Wednesday whether they are really sincere or not. </para>
