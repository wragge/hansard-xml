Is it his intention that representatives of the oversea Dominions shall be called in to assist that Council, and, if not, why is that omission to be made, seeing that we are trying to establish an Imperial Navy ? </para>

I anticipate that almost at any moment some of the measures will be forwarded. It is impossible to fix a definite time to which we can adjourn, because that might be too soon or too late. If honorable senators will consent to follow the practice which hitherto has been adopted, it will, I think, meet the general convenience. I suggest, sir, that the sitting should be suspended until the bells are rung. </para>

                    <para>. - The Committee will remember that some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> introduced into the Senate a Bill having for its object the extension to officers or members of associations applying to be registered under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the same protection against unfair treatment on the part of employers which, under the principal Act, was secured to organizations already registered. That Bill passed this Chamber, and was sent to the House of Representatives, where the Attorney-General had introduced a measure which provided for the same reform, but with certain other additions. Seeing that the two Bills were upon similar lines, the Attorney-General adopted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> Bill, adding to it, by way of amendment, that portion of his own measure which was not covered by it. So that we have here the measure which was originally submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> plus certain amendments relating to procedure which have been made at the instance of the Attorney-General. The main portion of the measure, however, is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s.</inline> Upon looking through these amendments, I find that it is very difficult to deal with them separately. I shall, therefore, limit my remarks to pointing out their effect collectively. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> sought to have passed into law two new clauses as additions to two sections of the principal Act. The two clauses which he proposed would have given protection to applicant associations. He proposed them as additions to the sections of the principal Act which extended protection to associations that were already registered. The Attorney-General thought it would be better to repeal those two sections in the principal Act, and to make this Bill cover both associations which are already registered and those applying to be registered. These are the principal amendments which have been made in the measure. Everything else, with one exception, is consequential upon them. .The main addition which has been made to the Bill is that contained in the amendment, which reads - </para>

                <para class="block">That is entirely new matter. It was inserted with the idea that, as this is a Conciliation Bill, the presiding officer should be empowered to see that, before legal action is taken, an opportunity is presented to the parties concerned of coming together in an amicable way. That is the sole purpose of the amendment. It is difficult to deal with these amendments separately, but if questions are asked concerning any of them I shall endeavour to explain them&#34; to the best of my ability. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline>
                    who introduced this measure, but, for the reason which I have stated, and because the amendments will necessitate some- consultation with the draftsman of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, it seems desirable that it should be in the hands of a Minister.

                    <para>. - When I learned from the Attorney-General that, on behalf of the Government, he had practically adopted the principles contained in the Bill which I was fortunate enough to pass through the Senate, and when I was informed that he intended to add to the measure &#39; one or two amendments relating to procedure, I was quite content to accept them. I realize that if a private senator introduces a Bill and it is transmitted by the Senate to the other House for its concurrence, it ceases to be a private measure. This Bill was sent down to the other House, where its principles were agreed to, and one or two procedure amendments made at the instance of the Government, thereby making it their measure for the time being. I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is quite in order in piloting it through the Senate at this stage. </para>

                        <para>- The Public Service Commissioner points out that, during the last two years, he had been able to absorb most of the boys who would otherwise have left the service at the age of eighteen years. He fears that in the next few years there will be some little difficulty in absorbing the boys, if they are required to leave at that age. He says that 153 of these boys will, during the next twelve months, reach the age of eighteen, and have, by examination, qualified to pass into other branches of the service. If this provision is not adopted, these lads will have to leave the service. The Public Service Commissioner anticipates _that,_ with the extension of age proposed, it will be possible to find employment for about 120, and that only about thirty will be required to leave. When considering the clause before, honorable senators expressed the opinion that before long the Public Service Act would require overhauling. There is something in. the contention. This provision would act as a stop-gap and would provide for these lads in the meantime until Parliament can bring the whole of the Act under review. It is hoped, also, that the experience of the provision will enable us to discover how far the expectation of the Public Service Commissioner as to its operation will be realized, and if it is found that, by extending the age to twenty years, these lads can be absorbed by other branches of the service, the provision can be made permanent. </para>

I give honorable senators the assurance that, for the most part, they are drafting or consequential amendments, and that none of them are of a serious character. The Bill, as originally drafted, contained a clause relating to the collection of State stamp duty in the case of bills of exchange or promissory notes. The clauses was amended- in the Senate, and the amendment now proposed by the House of Representatives is consequential  upon our amendment of the original clause. It is purely a drafting amendment.

When we were considering it sometime ago, there was a discussion as to whether certain stamp duties and charges; should be reduce&#39;d. Shortly afterwards, action was taken in the State of New South. Wales to reduce certain stamp duties. I should like to know whether any amendment has been made in another place to make the stamp duties on bills of exchange and promissory notes uniform throughout the Commonwealth ?

                        <para>&#91;4.19&#93;. - It will be remembered that, by clause  81,  the Senate sought to regulate the relationship between banker and customer so far as relates to the filling in of cheques. An endeavour was made to carry out a decision given by the High Court of Australia, and subsequently by the Privy Council, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Marshall</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Colonial Bank of Australasia.</inline> The Attorney-General, on inquiring into the subject, saw that the clause inserted by the Senate did not give the full relief that was intended, and that it was calculated to cause even more trouble and complexity. Therefore, the Attorney-General moved the substitution of a new clause in the following terms - </para>

                <para>That provision would have cast upon the customer the duty of exercising reasonable care in the filling up of his cheques. The other Chamber, however, declined to accept the proposed new clause, and have also struck out clause 81, preferring to leave the law as it now stands. It may be as well to remind honorable senators that in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Marshall</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Colonial Bank of Australasia</inline> it was held by the Privy Council that the mere fact that a cheque is drawn with spaces which may be utilized for the purpose of fraudulent alteration is not, in itself, any violation of the duty of a customer to his banker. That is the law as it stands. The other place has refused to alter that law so as to cast a duty upon the customer. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite true that the High Court and the Privy Council did give the decision mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best;</inline> but naturally, bankers think that that judgment was absolutely inequitable. Sometimes a man in his ignorance draws a cheque in such a way as to leave a space in front of the figures, so that a person inclined towards fraud is able to insert other figures. In the particular case referred to, a trustee robbed the estate on whose funds the cheque was drawn. Consequently, the bank was made responsible for the roguery of the trustee. No bank in the world can compel trustees to prevent the negligence of co-trustees. The bankers simply want the law to be made equitable. Surely we have a right to do what is fair as between banker and constituent? The law as it stands offers a premium to roguery. Why should bankers be made responsible for the scoundrelism of other persons? I speak on this matter as a particular banker, and am very sorry the other House has not accepted the amendment made by the Senate. This was one of the clauses in the Bill that the bankers of Australia thought most important for the safety of banks and of honest men. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to bring under the notice of the Senate the desirableness of extending some consideration to the relatives of an old public servant who passed away only a few hours ago. I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">chef</inline> of the Parliamentary Refreshment Room, v. ho, I understand, was for years prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth, a servant of the State of Victoria. He has been a Federal and State officer for some twelve years. The matter has occupied the attention of the Joint House Committee to-day, and that body has made a recommendation and an application to the Government. It has received a very favorable reply, but I do not know whether the Minister of Trade and Customs is in a position to give an assurance to this Chamber similar to that which, I believe, has been given in another place. If he can do so, I am convinced that he will be very glad. </para>

                    <para>. - Upon this Bill I merely desire to say that I think some definite rule should be laid down in reference to these allowances. At this stage of the session, we have no possible chance of inquiring into the merits of the cases which are enumerated in the Bill, though, as a matter of fact, two of them were recommended by me whilst I filled the position of Minister of Defence. My experience in that office has taught me that in cases of this kind the Minister of Defence is practically in the hands of his Department, and. that whether an officer&#39;s relatives secure compensation upon his decease depends to a great extent upon what they know of the way in which to get the ear of the Department. The cases of poor unfortunate persons who cannot get the ear of the Department will never be heard of. In instances in which the relatives can make out a good claim for the payment of compensation, the Minister is impelled to propose the granting of a certain sum. But there may be other cases, equally meritorious, of which he never hears. In connexion with military officers, a sort of rule has been laid down. I believe that the amount which it is proposed to grant to the widow of Sergeant-Major Fraser represents the leave to which he was entitled by reason of his years of service. But it does seem to me that the present haphazard kind of generosity that is granted in cases of this description is very inequitable.  1  would recommend the Government, during the recess, to consider whether a definite rule cannot be adopted </para>

                    that a very large question is involved. The cases which are now recommended have been under the notice of various Ministers, and will, I think, commend themselves to the Senate. The question of making more ample provision, by way of insurance or otherwise, to meet cases of the kind is certainly entitled to consideration, but no hard and fast rules can be laid down. The only principle which can be followed is that cases which come under the notice of the permanent head of a Department are brought under the attention of the Minister, who in turn brings them before the Cabinet, which is made acquainted with the character of each case. If there are cases of a similar kind in the Department a degree of uniformity, so far as principle is concerned, is established in that way. Probably the

                    has been injured, but he has to be supported, and if he is a married man, as I conclude

                    is, then a wife has also to be supported. But in the other case, the unfortunate
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crellin</inline>
                    was killed, and therefore only his widow has to be supported. I suggest that as a possible explanation. I do not say that it is a satisfactory one. But that is a point which might reasonably be taken into consideration. What the unfortunate widow is going to do with a solitary&#163;100, I do not know.

                        <para>- It might be. I wanted to bring a matter before the Committee. I knew that I could not submit a request without an instruction, and possibly not then. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Doutty,</inline> a postmaster in a railway suburb of Sydney lost his life through being required to take up his residence and duties in a brand new building which had not dried. Owing to the bricks and plaster being damp, he contracted a cold on the lungs, which resulted in his death. There is some difficulty, some refusal even, to acknowledge the case. Yet we are asked to vote amounts positively haphazard. I do not know that any one of the cases provided for in the clause is much more deserving than that case. Here we are asked to vote these amounts without any possibility of inquiry, without any means of knowing whether justice or injustice is being done, whether a favour is being shown or the opposite. Heads of Departments have practically, so we hear, the duty of recommending these amounts. We know that it is quite possible for such persons to take favorable views and unfavorable views, rightly and wrongly. Sometimes unfavorable views are taken wrongly, and sometimes favorable views are taken wrongly. Yet on no better authority practically thantheipsedirit of a high official, grants are recommended in some cases, and refused in others. This clause is the best possible proof that it is desirable that there should be established for the employes of the Commonwealth, indeed for all employes throughout Australia, a system of insurance which would make proper provision in the case of such accidents as those which are represented by the vote of&#163;342, the vote of &#163;100, and possibly some other votes. Then, again, we have a list of military allowances. Some sergeants, and so on, are refused compensation, and others get it. The whole thing is admirably designed to lead to the worst forms of favoritism, and practically corruption. We should do a harm to all of these folk if we refuse to vote the amounts. I suppose that the Bill will have to go, and that it will be one of the many measures which are thrust through, without the smallest need, at the very tail end of the session. All these cases might have been brought before us three or four, if not six, months ago. </para>

The Melbourne agents, Sanderson and Company, report that the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Sabine</inline> has returned to port. Her search has, unfortunately, proved fruitless, and no sign of the <inline font-style="italic">Waratah</inline> was observed. As to the stability of the vessel when leaving port, the attached report, recently received from the Government of New South Wales, shows that there were no apparent grounds for fear on that account. Some question was raised as to her stability, and we have been making inquiries from the various ports at which she called. The report from New South Wales is as follows - </para>

                        <para>This vessel (s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Waratah)</inline> was lying at the Central Wharf, in Sydney Harbor, for some ten days discharging inward cargo and loading outward cargo for South Africa and London, during which time she was seen by the various inspectors of this Department almost daily. These officers report that there was nothing in the vessel&#39;s trim to show that she was in any way unstable. They state that she left the Port on the 26th June, with a small cargo on board, in good ballast trim, and in perfect sen-going order, and that she had no cargo or bunker coal on an exposed deck. </para>

                    <para>&#91;8.13&#93;.-  Honorable senators are familiar with the provisions of proposed new section  7A,  and I merely wish to point out that in another place it was strongly urged that those provisions are calculated to interfere with many meritorious business transactions. Hence the amendment which is now submitted for our consideration. The chief point to be noted in connexion with the amendment is that it does not throw the onus of proof upon the prosecution. In this Chamber I had to resist a proposal to impose that onus upon the prosecution, and a similar proposal had to be resisted elsewhere. The proposed new sub-section provides that where a prosecution takes place, if the defendant can prove that the transaction in which he was engaged was an ordinary business transaction which was in no way detrimental to the public, and which in no way constituted unfair competition in the circumstances, it should be regarded as a legitimate defence. </para>

                    BEST (Victoria - Minister of Trade and Customs)  &#91;8.22&#93;.  - I would point out to my honorable friend (hat proposed section  7 a  deals with unfair concessions, and provides that it shall be an offence for any person to give, offer, or promise, to any other person any rebate or refund, on the condition, express or implied, that the latter person shall deal exclusively with him, either in relation to any particular goods or services, or generally. At the end of that proposed section, which is clause  5  of the Bill, it is intended to insert the proposed new sub-section which we are now considering.

Here we have the question of unfair concessions for the purpose of exclusive dealing. It seems to me that the object of the sub-section is to save the face of existing trusts. It is really a provision to nullify the Act so far as any existing trust or monopoly is concerned. Any existing agreement for exclusive dealing will be saved by the provision, unless the man can prove two things - first, that it is not detrimental&#39; to the public, which is a very difficult thing to prove- </para>

                        <para>- The success of his suit will depend upon that. In such circumstances it is very improbable that he will prosecute any existing combine which has a contract for exclusive dealing. Take, for instance, the Press Cable Association, which has a contract for exclusive dealing. There are senses in which the association can say that the contract is not to the detriment of the public, but there are senses in which it is detrimental to the public. The &#34;Court will; I suppose, decide according to the weight of evidence. I must confess that I am very suspicious of this sub-section, as it seems to be framed for the purpose of saving existing trusts and existing agreements. We all know that there has been a- preliminary skirmish. The Attorney-General&#39;s Department is right up against the responsibility of having to prosecute existing trusts. They are very powerful bodies, both politically and otherwise. I wish that I was a lawyer so that I could see the full effect of the provision, but to my lay mind it looks suspicious. I do not feel inclined to vote for it unless the Minister can give further information. </para>

                    <para>. -There appears to me to be an element of fairness in the proposed new subsection which commends itself to my judgment. Contracts for exclusive dealing were often, with our knowledge, entered into for purposes prejudicial to the well-being of the community, and, therefore, we had to legislate that such contracts were an offence. But it can easily be conceived that there are contracts which may be no offence at all, and no prejudice to the public, and, therefore, under the existing law the Attorney - General has power to prosecute, and to punish if he simply proves a contract for exclusive dealing, even though it is not prejudicial. This proposed sub-section, was, I take it, adopted in another place in order to protect such contracts from punishment, but in order that the validity, the. effectiveness, and the rapid motion of our existing law shall not be retarded, the onus of proof is thrown upon the defendant. The Attorney-General has only to prove that there is such a contract, and punishment will follow, unless the defendant can prove to the satisfaction of the Court that his contract is not prejudicial to the well-being of others. </para>

                        <para>- Of -course if it was unfair competition, it would be prejudicial. There might be such a contract to which there could be no objection, yet under the existing law punishment must follow if the fact is proven. This appears <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be a safeguard against the harsh and unwise action of the law- which generally is beneficent in its character, and tends to check a great evil. To me as a layman, it seems to provide a safety valve against unnecessary oppressiveness in connexion with our law. </para>

                    <para>. - It may seem rash for a layman to venture to express an opinion, but I think that the proposed new section as it stands - that is, without the amendment of the other House - will  not make any person liable to a penalty under the Act without a trial. The power df originating a prosecution is vested in the Attorney-General. When he has reason to believe- that any person is dealing exclusively with any person or corporation, he will appeal to a Court. The defendant will have full power to show that he is not dealing exclusively with the other person or corporation. In that case, the Court will necessarily be obliged to look upon him as innocent. </para>

This proposed sub-section if adopted will enable a person who is charged with exclusive dealing to call witnesses of his own. Very naturally he will feel inclined to call those who will vindicate him. But will there be an opportunity for calling rebutting evidence? </para>

                    <para>. - There has just occurred to me a very simple illustration which may commend itself to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and others. For some years I earned my livelihood by making boots. Now let me put a case which might very conceivably arise. Let us suppose that a man came to me and asked me to fit him with a pair of boots. Let us assume that I did so, and that the goods satisfied him. When I wished to charge him 30s. for the boots he might reply, &#34; But I never pay more than 20s.&#34; I might then remark, &#34; But I have experienced great difficulty in fitting you. I have had to purchase two new lasts, and therefore I must charge you 30s.&#34; To that the man might answer, &#34; I cannot afford to give you more than 20s.,&#34; and thereupon I might say, &#34; Well, if you will undertake to give me your custom in the future, so as to recoup me for the expenditure which I have incurred, I will let you have the boots for 20s.&#34; In that case an agreement would be entered into which nobody could urge was prejudicial to the public weal. In hundreds of cases concessions may be made and exclusive dealing may exist without the transaction being in any sense detrimental to the public. </para>

                        <para>- I am told that the Bill aims at suppressing unfair competition. But I say that competition succeeds only by being unfair. The competitive system itself succeeds only by a process of commercial cannibalism. That <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> indisputable. It is said that for many years we had a system of cut-throat competition amongst the shipping companies on the Australian coast. But those companies grew tired of that competition, and it is alleged that they have now formed themselves into a shipping ring or combine. So that on the one hand we are told that this is a measure which is designed to suppress unfair competition, whilst on the other we are assured that it is intended to suppress monopolies. Whether the operations of the shipping combine are to the injury of the community, I cannot say. But I understand that the Crown Solicitor is now inquiring into the existence of a combination in which it is said that the shipping companies and the Coal Vend ar-. largely interested. Indeed, it is urged that they are composed of the same persons. So that this Bill seems somewhat paradoxical. </para>

It makes provision for an entirely new offence where rebates, refunds, concessions, or rewards are granted upon the condition, express or implied, of exclusive dealing, and this amendment provides that if it can be proved on a prosecution that the transaction is not detrimental to the public, or unfair in the circumstances, that proof shall be deemed a legal defence. The Court has to satisfy itself as to these two important elements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has taken exception to the words &#34; unfair in the circumstances.&#34; But I would point out that those words are used throughout the principal Act.

It has been demonstrated that there are many contracts of a completely meritorious character. For instance, an arrangement exists between shippers and certain shipping companies here for the shipment of butter. The shipowners are tied down to certain dates and rates, and the shippers agree to ship by particular lines. That arrangement has been made by the State itself on behalf of the shippers. </para>

                    <para>. - I think it might be wise to call a halt in the enactment of this legislation. We have been waiting since five o&#39;clock this afternoon for a message from the other Chamber, and now it has sent us an amendment to this Bill which is worthy of close consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has likened the provision to a customer who had a foot which was difficult to fit, and who visited a bootmaker. He pointed out that in order to properly fit the customer the bootmaker might be required to purchase special lasts. In this provision I think that I can detect the cloven hoof of the Fusion Government, and the elector will shortly pass his verdict upon it. In order to make things as smooth as possible for themselves the Ministry are attempting to destroy the effect of the Bill we have passed. Being a layman it is rather difficult for me to grip the real intention of the amendment which we are now discussing. The Bill, as it left this Chamber, provided a penalty for certain offences. The measure was thoroughly discussed here, and I am under the impression that in the form in which it left the Senate it would achieve the ideal which we have in view, namely, the repression of monopolies. We were on the trail of the trusts. We endeavoured to penalize persons who act in restraint of trade. But with all due deference to the framers of the &#34;amendment, I say that if we accept it the vital principle of the Bill will be killed. Herein I see the cloven hoof.

                    <para>. - We all know that the shipping companies of Australia have formed a trust, that they keep trade to themselves, and render competition impossible by a system of rebates. They say to a shipper, &#34; We will charge you 10s. per ton freight upon your goods, but at the end of twelve months we will hand you back is. per ton.&#34; That will be paid into a trust account, and at the end of the year, it will be handed back to you.&#34; Of course, the undertaking is that if, in the meantime, they ship with any other firm, they will forfeit the money. The figures I have given are not correct : but that is the method by which the trust bind their customers. Let us examine the position in the light of the proposed sub-section. Suppose that the trust are prosecuted under the Act, as it will be when it is amended ; they will say that their defence is that that arrangement is not detrimental to the general public, because the latter have the opportunity to go to another firm and make a similar arrangement with them. They can prove that it is not detrimental to the general public, because, as a result of the increased trade and the better organization which has flowed from the trust, they are able to provide better steamers without increasing the freights. As regards unfair competition, the Shipping Trust can say that the competition is not unfair because it is always open to any other firm to do as they have done. They can say that they do not interfere with their competitors, because they do not cut the freights or run their steamers in competition ; in fact, that there is no element of unfair competition in what they do. It seems to me that on both of these points the Shipping Federation, if it is prosecuted, will be provided with a way out by this amendment. The Oil Trust, also, have a rebate arrangement with their customers. These two trusts can, if prosecuted, prove that it is not unfair competition, and that it is not to the detriment of the public. We wash our hands of the Bill. We have never believed that it would do what its authors claimed. We have always said that we did not want to break up the trusts. My honorable friends say that they are going to accomplish that object; but I contend that the amendment will provide a way out for the trusts. I suppose that when the Bill is passed, some prosecutions will follow, and that that provision will be found to be a back-gate to allow the trusts to escape. I believe that the amendment was framed for that purpose, and will have that effect. lt is evidently aimed at that secret -rebate arrangement which is the king-pin of the trusts, not only in Australia, but all over the world. It_ is a significant fact that this saving provision is tacked on to a provision in the Act which deals with rebates and concessions. I intend to vote against the amendment; but I do not propose to take up any more time. </para>

                    <para>. - -If the Minister will refresh his memory by looking up the report of the Western Australian Commission on Ocean Freights, of which I. was a member, he will find that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said is very much to the point. Evidence was taken by that Commission which proved conclusively that there was a combination which said to the shipper, &#34; If you continue to ship by our line, we will give you a certain rebate at the end of the year.&#34; There was also this condition imposed, that the rebate had to lie with the combination for twelve months after it had been earned.. If. for instance, a rebate were due on the 31st December, 1909, it would not be handed over to the shipper until 31st December, 1910. But the combination also said that if, between those dates, the customer shipped with any other line, the rebate would be forfeited. If the combination are ever put on their defence, then, under the wording of this amendment, it will be quite easy for them to get out of trouble. They can prove that it is not unfair competition in all the circumstances. Why ? Because they have completely shut out all competitors, and have a monopoly of the business. There is no better illustration of that position than is furnished by the report of the Royal Commission to which I referred. I suggest that if the Government are sincere in their desire to secure the repression of monopolies, which is the heading of proposed section  7A  in the Bill, and to wipe out this curse in shipping and other lines, they will reject the amendment from the other House, because, if it is accepted, it will extend the life of existing monopolies. </para>

A great doubt has been expressed on the subject, and it is of  the  utmost importance that it shall be  quieted,  because, if the proceedings  happen  to be of a civil character, a certain course has to be followed, and if they happen to  be  of a criminal character, other proceedings must be followed. The intention was that we should follow the procedure of the Customs Act, section  247  of which provides that the procedure shall be civil. This clause is intended to set at rest the doubt which exists, and put the Bill in this respect on all fours with the Customs Act. </para>

                <para>I take this opportunity of extending to honorable senators the cordial thanks of the Government, and my own personal thanks, for the very great assistance which has been rendered to us throughout the session, and especially within the last few days, when it has been necessary to ask the Senate to exercise special efforts in order to expedite the business of the country. With regard to the session that will shortly be terminated, I wish to say that it has been in many respects a strenuous one. There have been many matters which have invited, and which, indeed, have perhaps called for, sharp conflicts of opinion. But I am pleased to think, looking back over the work of the session - and I trust that I shall have the concurrence of all honorable senators in saying so - that we can terminate our labours with the satisfaction of knowing that a measure of good feeling prevails amongst the various sections. It is true, in a sense, that the Senate is not the fighting Chamber of the Federal Parliament ; but, nevertheless, we do have our conflicts here. It is therefore a source of great pleasure to all of us to know that we can part upon terms of good fellowship and personal friendship, and that we can cordially wish each other the compliments of the approaching season. </para>

I most heartily concur in the thanks given to them, because I have had perhaps more opportunities than other honorable senators have had of knowing how well they deserve these acknowledgments. </para>
