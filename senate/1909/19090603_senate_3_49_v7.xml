        <para class="block">I am submitting identically the same motion as that which was discussed at considerable length 'yesterday. An amendment was then submitted, and the debate was terminated by a count-out. I trust that, in view of the fact that the other House has adjourned until the 23rd inst., honorable senators will be content to allow the present motion to go without discussion. I would point out to them that, even if they should re-submit the amendment which was offered ' yesterday and' it should be carried, they would not in any way further the work of the Senate, whilst they might greatly inconvenience other honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- Under no possible circumstances will there be a Ministerial statement made on the 16th inst., and until that statement is made I take it that it will be incompetent for the Senate to seriously address itself to the business of the country. I have no desire to say anything that may lead any honorable senator to import into any debate which may take place to-day any of. that bitterness which, unfortunately, marked some of yesterday's proceedings. But I do feel that I am entitled to ask honorable senators to extend to the Government the ordinary courtesy which has been extended to every Government since the (Commonwealth was founded, and particularly do I again remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that it was on his motion that an adjournment of three weeks was granted when the Watson Government took office. </para>

We are asking for an adjournment of three weeks, and it is impossible for any one to say that that is a moment too long. Even honorable senators on the other side said they regarded the proposal as a. reasonable one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> said that he could not oppose my motion on the ground of unreasonableness. Some honorable senators said that, having a policy already formed, we ought to be able to meet Parliament in a day. Others said that we had no policy, and that, therefore, any time occupied in an attempt to formulate one would be time wasted. </para>

            <para>- That reminds me of the fact that the late Government had to depend on my help, and on the help of my honorable friends on this side, to get them into recess. We sat up here all night to save the late Government - from whom? From those redoubtable representatives of Queensland, Senators Turley, Givens, and Stewart. I say that but for the assistance of honorable senators on this side, the late Government would never have got their Estimates through. These are the gentlemen who object now to a fair and reasonable demand. The members and supporters of a Government who took six months in which to formulate their policy now deny to the present occupants of the Treasury Bench the very much shorter period of three weeks. I am not asking for any concession from honorable senators opposite. What I am asking for the Government' in this motion is what any fair and reasonable Parliament would grant to any new Administration.. If honorable senators on the other side are determined to refuse it, they can do so. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>(South Australia) [2.44].- I have no intention to move an amendment on the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council today. My reason is that in another place honorable members have decided to adjourn for three weeks. Most 'honorable senators will agree with me that honorable members in another place having adjourned for three weeks it would be rather absurd for us to adjourn for only a fortnight. It would be more reasonable to adjourn for a month here if in another place they adjourned for three weeks. But I should like to remind the Vice-President of the Executive Council that there has twice been failure to obtain a quorum of his supporters to discuss his motion, that it is only with the assistance of members of the Opposition  that it can be discussed, and that if it went to a vote to-day it is very questionable how the numbers would turn up. I am putting these facts before the honorable senator to show him that we are not following our present course from any factious spirit, but in order that the honorable senator and his colleagues may know that they will have to be here if they wish to do business in the future. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to refer to a remark which was made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. The honorable senator has rather a habit of trying to put upon one's words a construction that is not warranted, and of attempting to prejudice one by twisting words that have been used to mean something that was not intended. When the honorable senator just now was referring to public decency, I interjected that public decency required that we should get this Parliament to the people at the first opportunity. By inference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> tried to twist that into a reflection by me upon  His Excellency  the Governor-General.  His  words could only be regarded as an attempt to do that. I am sure that in his calmer moments the honorable senator would give me credit for knowing better than to endeavour to reflect upon the Governor-General, either here or outside. He knows very well, as do those who cheered his remarks, that no such inference was to be drawn from what I sa:id. </para>

            <para>- I was attending to mv correspondence. I was quite willing to allow the honorable .senator and his pious colleagues the privilege of listening to the reading of the prayer. I knew that he would be present, because he needs praying for very badly. The present situation would seem to indicate that honorable senators who have combined to form what is known as the Liberal-Tory party, or the Free- trade- Protectionist party, do not desire to proceed with the business of the country at all, notwithstanding that they have raised a continual clamour that Parliament should be called together earlier than usual this year. Why are not the Government prepared to proceed with the consideration of business? Surely a fortnight was a reasonable adjournment to allow them, especially in view of the fact that when the Fisher Government took office it was granted a- respite of only eight days. Seeing that honorable senators opposite have repeatedly declared that it was necessary that Parliament should be called together early this year, in order that it might demonstrate the loyalty of our people by pre.senting a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain,  I  ask - Why has that proposal now been dropped? Why have not the Government submitted a motion in favour of the course which they advocated so strenuously six or eight weeks ago? Why has this matter been permitted to sink into insignificance? Who has strangled it? Who wishes to thrust it into the background? Why, honorable senators opposite. They merely desired to use their professed loyalty as  a  lever with which to oust the Fisher Government. Directly their greed for office had been satisfied, they dropped the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> proposal as they would a hot potato. </para>

            <para>- I will not say that, because my honest opinion is that they never held any fixed principles. When some of them were telling the country that in a Free-Trade policy lay its only hope of salvation, they had merely persuaded themselves that they believed their own statement. In reality they did not believe, it at all. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> was telling the people that a Protectionist policy was the only one for Australia- </para>

            <para>- I am pointing out as a reason why- the Senate should not adjourn for three weeks, that the country is entitled to know whether my honorable friends opposite were really sincere in their professions of a short time ago. It is also entitled to learn at the earliest possible moment what are the intentions of the Government. I have always objected to lengthy adjournments of the Senate. An adjournment for three weeks will be useless to me, because it is not sufficiently long to enable me to return to my home and to remain there for more than two days. As a matter of fact, I could not leave Melbourne until Wednesday next, so that the proposed adjournment is absolutely useless from my stand-point. But seeing that the Ministry are determined that the Senate shall adjourn for three weeks, we have a right to enter our protest against the adoption of that course, so that upon a future occasion they may be a little more reasonable and treat the legitimate wishes of honorable senators with a little more respect. </para>
