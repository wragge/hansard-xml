                    <para>. - Last night the Vice-President of the Executive Council pointed out that it was not desirable to delete this clause, because certain employers might initiate very good schemes for the benefit of their employes. I understood that the very reason for the introduction of the Bill was that no reliance can be placed upon the benevolent intention of employers in that direction. Up to the present moment they have had a full opportunity to act, and it was because they neglected to do their duty that the Bill was brought in. The Minister cannot assign any other reason for its introduction than to insure that a satisfactory and equitable scheme shall be initiated to compensate seamen for injuries sustained in the course of their employment. So far every scheme of this kind which has been initiated within &#34;Australia has been an absolute failure. The Minister cannot point to a single instance where success has been obtained. Is it reasonable, then, to expect that a workable scheme such as is contained in this Bill is likely to be superseded by any scheme which employers might institute? The principle of contracting out is a most dangerous one to allow. If the clause is passed, the possibility is that the men would be compelled to join a scheme against their will. It is quite  true that at the time it was initiated a majority of the employes in any employment would father the scheme, . but it should be remembered that seamen sign on to a vessel for only a limited time, and are continually changing from vessel to vessel. What would be the position of the men who would take the place of the original members of a scheme of the kind contemplated by this clause? Suppose that an ocean steam-ship company desired to establish a scheme. Their employes at the time would have by a majority to consent to the formation of the scheme, and so put themselves outside the provisions of the law. But they would be continually changing from one vessel or company to another, and the result would be that their successors could have no say in the matter at all. Applicants would be faced with the alternative of joining a scheme in which they did not believe, or going without employment. We know that men, seamen as well as others, are driven to search for employment by stern necessity. They may have a wife or children, dearer to themselves than all else in the world, and suffering absolute want. In a case of that kind there would be compulsion upon the men to accept a scheme which otherwise would not be acceptable, in order that they might gain a livelihood. This Parliament should not subject any men to compulsion of that sort. The scheme contained in the Bill is a justifiable and satisfactory one, otherwise, I presume, it would not have been fathered by the Government. If it is a justifiable and satisfactory scheme, that is all that is required, and we need not compel the seamen on out coasts to be at the beck and call of any company. The real object which, I think, is behind the clause is to destroy unionism, to create dissension and bickering, to compel the men to look rather to their employers for the safeguarding of their interests than to the provisions of the law. The only reason for the introduction of the Bill is that hitherto employers have not satisfactorily safeguarded their men&#39;s interests. Undoubtedly, the Bill should be made to apply to every seaman trading on our coast. No loophole for escape should be left, and every employer should be made amenable to the law. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will concede the demand which has been made for the abolition of the clause, which is not only useless, but an ugly excrescence on an otherwise good measure. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. According to Ruegg&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Employers&#39; Liability and Workmen&#39;s Compensation</inline> under the Imperial Act, which contains a similar provision to that under consideration, in the event of any compensation scheme becoming financially unsound the claimant cannot recover from his employer any balance to which he may be entitled for injuries received. I understand that the Government have no objection to my proposal. But even if it be adopted I shall not be reconciled to the clause. At the same time if a majority of the Committee intend to provide for the initiation of compensation schemes we should at least insure that those schemes shall be kept financially sound or that otherwise the balance of any liability under the Bill shall fall upon the employer. </para>

I unhesitatingly say that up to the present moment employers have not exhibited any extreme generosity towards their employes, otherwise this Bill would have been absolutely unnecessary. It. has only been brought forward because employers have hitherto callously regarded the necessities of their workmen in the matter of being paid compensation for injuries received during the course of their employment. This clause, if agreed to, will practically nullify the remaining provisions of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- All the facts of history are against the honorable senator. I admit that I could cite several cases in which employers have treated their workmen very fairly for generations. But whilst that statement applies to a limited number of employers there are many hundreds who&#39; are entirely out of touch with their employes, and who have no sympathy with them, whatever. Let me point to the shipping combine as an illustration. A large number of the persons connected with that combine reside in the Old Country. In the very nature of things what sympathy can exist between those . persons and their employes ? I hope that the clause will not be retained for the reasons which I have advanced. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to extend complete freedom of action to men who are engaged in seafaring work. From time to time we have heard a good deal from honorable senators opposite in reference to freedom of contract, and I believe that they are stubborn believers in that principle. I make bold, therefore, to claim their assistance in granting freedom of action to our seafaring men. I am opposed to this clause root and branch. I regard it as an excrescence upon the measure. It appears to me that its object is to enable employers to compel their employes to subscribe to. compensation schemes in order that their opportunities to form trades unions may be destroyed. In introducing this Bill the Vice-President of the Executive Council declared that he would invite assistance from all quarters of the Senate with a view to making it as perfect as possible. </para>

Under the clause employers will have power to initiate compensation schemes for their workmen and to coerce the latter into joining them. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has affirmed that it would be very unfair not to permit small employers in struggling circumstances to band themselves together for the purpose of forming compensation schemes under this provision. But where are the steam-ship owners in Australia who are in struggling circumstances? </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. The maritime industry in Australia is conducted by large companies. .It is not correct to say that these companies are in struggling circumstances. The shipping industry is in the hands of powerful corporations, which are quite capable of looking after their own interests. I appeal in support of my amendment to those honorable senators who are eternally cackling about the preservation of freedom of action. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> who professes to be a believer in the liberty of the subject. Idle talk is of no use in connexion with this matter. We have had concrete illustrations of the action that has been taken by a powerful shipping company with reference to a scheme of insurance. The company to which I refer for a number of years made it a condition of employment that workmen should belong to a certain  society, even against their will. If they did not join, they could not secure employment. </para>

                        <para>- It is provided for in a very defective manner, and one which does not meet with my approval. What the Bill provides is that it shall not be expressly stated in a scheme that men shall be compelled to join. But we know the artfulness of some employers, and how easily they could get round such a provision. While it is quite true that if it is set forth in black and white that belonging to a scheme is a condition of employment, such a scheme will be declared void, there are, nevertheless, other ways by which a ship-owner can attain his object. My desire is to meet a contingency of that kind. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>. - Statements are being made here to the effect that the Union Company of New Zealand compel their men to join such a scheme as is contemplated under this clause. I have just communicated with the manager of the company, who informs me that the scheme referred to was started in New Zealand for the benefit of the employes. It was simply a mutual benefit society, to provide for cases of accident. It was not, however, considered necessary to apply the scheme to Australia, except men who joined in New Zealand wished to continue under the scheme when they came to this country. But, as a matter of fact, I am informed, no compulsion was exercised in any form. Men were never compelled to join the scheme. It is against the law of New Zealand. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not the slightest objection to the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> ; on the contrary, I welcome it, and rather regret that the honorable senator proposed it in such terms as he did. He assumed that the action taken by me, and by those who support the clause, is due to lack of sympathy with the workmen. The debate on the clause throughout has turned on the point as to whether&#34; or not the inclusion of the clause might place in the hands of an employer an instrument of tyranny. But sub-clause 3 provides that no scheme shall be certified to by the Comptroller-General if it contains an obligation upon the workman to become a participant in the scheme. It further provides that there must be a provision to enable any workman to withdraw if he pleases. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> amendment goes a little further, and sets out that if the acceptance of a scheme is made a condition of employment, it shall be null and void. The amendment, therefore, deals with the man who seeks employment, not with a man already in employment. If the amendment is adopted, we shall. I think, have sufficiently safeguarded all present and future workmen from the evils upon which my honorable friend has dwelt. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall, of course, vote for an amendment which proposes to protect  workmen who may be induced to join a scheme of the kind contemplated. I know, however, how ineffectual the provision will be, because, as I stated yesterday, no man is discharged on the plain ground that he will not join a scheme. Take a company like the Union Company. A man was not discharged because he would not join the scheme which that company formerly had in operation. A man is not told what he is discharged for. He is merely told to take twenty-four hours&#39; notice. If he asks the reason for his discharge, his employer can tell him that he is not bound to give any reason. Seamen are being discharged daily in Melbourne, and in other ports of Australia, without any reasons being given them. </para>

In carrying out their scheme they perpetrate one of the worst acts of tyranny it is possible to imagine. Before a seaman is allowed to ship he is brought up for medical examination. He is compelled to strip for the purpose, and he is branded after the examination. </para>

                        <para>- No; the character given them by some irresponsible individual. In this connexion also, a most cowardly thing takes place. The person giving the seaman his character is not responsible for the character he gives. There are three grades recognised - &#34; Very good,&#34; &#34;Good,&#34; and &#34;Decline to report.&#34; The person giving the character &#34; decline to report,&#34; which is recognised throughout the world as a bad discharge, is not made in any way liable for the consequences of his action. My point is that it is impossible to safeguard this provision in any way, because the employer is not bound to give any reason for discharging a seaman. Men can be discharged, with twenty-four hours&#39; notice, at the place where they sign articles, and in other ports by merely laying the ship up for twelve hours. </para>

                        <para>- Why should honorable senators opposite now try to pass this Bill in such a way as to give preference to employers, when they denied preference to unionists in dealing with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill ? Why did we pass a provision in dealing with the Patents Bill only the other day, giving lawyers the right to recover costs they had been unable to collect in the past? On further looking into the point I raised yesterday. I am more convinced than ever that by taking advantage of this contracting-out clause a seaman will forfeit all his legal rights. If he does not contract himself out of the law under this clause, he will be able to choose whether he should try to recover damages under this Bill, under the Employers Liability Act, or at common law. I find that <inline font-style="italic">Ruegg</inline> makes the definite statement that a man who joins a scheme contracts himself out of his rights under the Employers Liability Act and at common law. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that if a man elects to bring his case under the Employers Liability Act, and fails, he cannot afterwards make the claim under the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act. But he does not lose his right to a civil action. A man may be employed as a boilermaker in a boiler shop on the Yarra bank. If he is sent to work on board a ship and an accident occurs to him there through no fault of his employer on the Yarra bank, he will still have an action against the ship-owner. I repeat that a seaman will be deprived of all his legal rights by contracting out of the law under this clause. There will be an inducement given to the employer to say, I will give you more by my scheme than the Act provides for,&#34; because he knows that if the seaman is a party to his scheme, he will be relieved absolutely of any liability through an action at law, the seaman having plainly said, &#34;I am going to accept these terms as against the terms in the Act.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I know that it will be difficult, but there have been instances where proof has been forthcoming. It is a monstrous thing that a number of men who are weak should be left in the position that they may be compelled, bv their necessity, to contract themselves out of benefits which ought to be secured to them. We ought to congratulate ourselves that the Minister in charge of the Bill has readily expressed his willingness, if the necessity can be shown, to render that impossible. </para>

I think it is quite possible to devise a scheme which is mutually beneficial,, and which may be more beneficial than any schemes provided in the Bill. What I want to achieve - and the Minister too, I believe - is that, however advantageous other agreements may be, unless they operate, a seaman shall have recourse to this measure as a remaining alternative. </para>

                    <para>. - At the present stage I do not care to discuss the merits or demerits of the clause. On the one side, it is urged that it cannot do harm and may do good, while on the other hand it is urged practically that it must do harm and cannot do good. I think it is agreed that if it is retained it may operate with a different effect in different instances. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that concession, for I ask for no more. Let us assume that the clause is not going to apply in precisely the same way in every case, that, if it is applied, there may be a variation in its effect. In the interests of peace I suggest that the words subject to regulations to be made by the Governor-General,&#34; be inserted after the word &#34; may,&#34; in line 47 of the clause. If that amendment is made then every agreement will have to be submitted to Parliament for its approval or disapproval. That will enable every member of Parliament to freely criticise the conditions of any voluntary scheme. And it will, I think, bring to light the truth or otherwise of many of the strong and somewhat harsh statements which have been made as to the possibilities under the clause. </para>

I maintain that this measure is nothing more nor less than a slavish copy of the Imperial Act, which has been operative for two or three years. The people of Australia certainly expect this Parliament to improve upon legislation which has to run the gauntlet of the House of Lords. I know the history of contracting out in the Old Country, and I am sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> were familiar with it he would not be <inline font-style="italic">anxious for us to repeat the</inline> blunders which have been made there. </para>

                        <para>- The experience of the honorable senator himself satisfies me that employers never assign a reason for refusing to employ a man or for discharging him. Was the honorable senator himself ever told that he was refused employment because he belonged to a trade union? I have been discharged upon various occasions, not because I could not do my work or because I was not sober, but simply because &#34;my services were not required.&#34; Whv ? No reason was assigned, but I know perfectly well that the real reason was that I happened to be a member of a trade union. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> himself has told me that he has walked the streets of Melbourne until he was almost barefooted, in a vain endeavour to secure employment, simply because he was a unionist who had taken an active part in organizing unionism. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie reminds me that only this morning a report is published in the newspapers to the effect that a man who has taken a prominent part in organizing the Bread Carters Union, and who, in his official capacity, has been called as a witness in. several cases in which employers have been convicted of breaking the law, is today unable to secure employment. As a result, he is compelled to appeal to his mates to assist him to live until he can obtain work in some other avenue of industry. That is the sort of thing which will occur under the operation of this clause. As I pointed out last night, there is a great difference between the position of men who are employed in the Australian mercantile marine and that of men who are engaged in occupations ashore. A seaman may be employed by one steam-ship company to-day and by another company a month hence. He is constantly changing his ships. Very few seamen continue in the employment of one company for more than six months. Under this clause, if a seaman refused to join a compensation scheme which had been initiated by the company by which he was temporarily employed, he would, undoubtedly, be discharged. Very few such schemes would not demand some contribution from the seamen. He goes up for his first month&#39;s money. He says, &#34; My wages ought to be so and so,&#34; but he receives less. He- is told, &#34; We thought you were going to belong to the scheme.&#34; If he says, &#34; I don&#39;t care to belong to the scheme,&#34; they pay him his full wages, but the next day the mate or the engineer says to him, &#34; I think you had better take twenty-four hours&#39; notice.&#34; No reason is given. </para>

                        <para>- He was a very peculiar employer, if he gave as a reason for sacking a man that he was a unionist. No such case has come under my personal notice. But there are certain places, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> knows, where it is useless for a man who belongs to a union to apply for employment. Perhaps he may be taken  on if he is not known to belong to a union. But if, two or three days afterwards, he is discovered to be a unionist, he is told that the firm are about to reduce hands, and his services are no longer required. Perhaps some scab gives him away. He knows very well why he is sacked and has to walk the streets. &#39; He is sacked, and his wife and children have to suffer, because he has dared to be a man. </para>

                        <para>- There is no difference between 1890 and 1909 j except that to-day the organizations are much stronger and more powerful. Prior to the 1890 strike what were we told ? I remember the visit of a big ship-owner from the Old Country, a member of the firm of Gray, Dawes, and  Company,  who were largely interested in the Australian United Steam Navigation Company. He visited the seamen&#39;s organizations, complimented the men on their physique, and on the conditions of employment they obtained, and complimented the ship-owners upon the class of men they were able to obtain in Australia. He said he only wished that ship-owners were able to obtain similar men in the Old  Country.  But six months afterwards we were in the throes of that big fight in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> took so worthy a part. The ship-owners were then cutting down the wages of seamen and firemen by one-fifth.&#39; and were endeavouring to make worse the conditions of employment of every man in their service. </para>

                        <para>- Not only did they do that, but they endeavoured to prevent the men from joining organizations which had been built up after years and years of hard work. Only lately have the seafaring population been able to get back to the conditions that existed before that time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has referred to the weakness of some men in relation to (heir fellows. But there may be conditions that make a man seem weak. He may have a wife and children at home who are suffering the pangs of hunger unless he is prepared to work under conditions of which he disapproves. That is the sort of thing that makes a man weak, who would be quite as good a man as any others if he could follow his own course. I know what it is to be without employment for weeks together. A man in that position, when he goes out in the morning, does not follow the main streets and walk along with his head erect. He goes down side streets because he is ashamed of his - condition, and low in spirit from being without work for so long. I shall vote for the amendment ; but at the same time I say frankly that it does not matter one bit whether it is put in the Bill or not. I know the object that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has *ri view. He wants to protect the interests of the men. But he knows quite well that a man who is&#39; dismissed because he will not join a scheme will never be told that that is the reason. I recollect an instance where I tried to ascertain how it was that I could not secure employment under a certain office. I had taken a fairly prominent part in unionism, and had spoken in public about matters which .were of interest to my fellow workmen. I was puzzled as to why employment was refused to me, because I knew that I could do the work and as well as any who were engaged. There was a man who was a boss at the time, but with whom I had worked years before. He had got on a little. I said to myself, &#34; He is a friend of mine, and will probably tell me whether any instructions have been issued that employment is not to be given to me.&#34; I said to him, &#34; Look here now ; have you received any instructions from the office that you are not to give employment to me?&#34; He assured me definitely that no such  thing had been mentioned to him. I thought, nevertheless,  that it was strange that, though I went there every day, the same thing occurred. As I continued to get nothing to do, I said to a man whom I knew in the office, &#39;&#34;It is very funny that I have been trying to get work here for a considerable time but have not been successful. So-and-so informs me that no instructions have been given from the office so far as I am concerned. Will you find out whether that is the case?&#34; He said, &#34; I can get to know, and will tell you.&#34; I said, &#34;You may depend upon it that I shall not mention the matter to any one.&#34; Two days afterwards he came to me and said, &#34;Look, Harry, it is of no use for you to go down to the place. Instructions have been definitely given from the office that you are not to receive employment.&#34; That is an example of the way men are treated when they are known to be prominently connected with unionism. It is because we know of these things that we feel so strongly. As I said last night, it is the poverty of men. which compels them&#39; to accept conditions of which often they do not approve. </para>

                        <para>- No, conditions which are not less favorable than those secured by the Bill. I remember the Vice-President of the Executive Council saying that we are not the only people who have been in the condition which I have described. I know that perfectly well. I believe that nearly every senator on this side of the chamber has been treated as I have been for his connexion with unionism. Several honorable senators opposite have found themselves in the same position. Because we are in better circumstances now we ought not to forget the experience which we have gone through. That is the consideration which weighs with me when I say that, while I have no objection to the amendment being inserted, it will be absolutely ineffective. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators opposite are really in danger of proving that the Labour party as a body have neither soul nor brains, although they claim a monopoly of both. If honorable senators were wise they would see that this clause offers some scope for the exercise of broad human sympathies which, in spite of all they say, do exist. The clause also offers some opportunity for the adoption of more skilful financial arrangements which seamen should be given a chance to take advantage of. Honorable senators opposite would deprive seamen of the possibility of being advantaged by a desire on&#39; the &#34;part of their employers to make friendly arrangements with them and by the skilled financial knowledge of their employers. I repeat that the action of our honorable friends opposite is calculated to prove that the Labour party as a body is without either soul or brains, though claiming a monopoly of both. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been waiting, patiently to hear some amendment proposed which would improve this clause. So far I have waited in vain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has admitted that the amendment he proposed would only patch up a very bad job. The only amendment suggested which I think would be of any value is that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to give Parliament an opportunity to review the conditions of any scheme or agreement, entered into between a seaman and his employer. The admission that such a review might be necessary is also an admission that unfair treatment might be meted out to seamen. The best thing we can do with the clause is to strike it out. I agree with the Minister that we should be progressive in our legislation. I have admitted that the Bill will supply a long-felt want in providing some measure cf compensation for a class of workmen who have so far been neglected. Employes in other trades and callings can take advantage of Workmen&#39;s Compensation and Workshop Acts. This is the first attempt made to consider the interests in this respect of the men who go down to the sea in ships. But if this contracting-out clause is retained I am very much afraid that this measure will be retrogressive rather than progressive. The Vice-President of the Executive Council last night told the Committee that this is not a contracting-out clause. But he will find that it is so described in the marginal note, and if it is retained the utility of the Bill will be destroyed. If employers&#39; schemes offered seamen more favorable terms than are provided for under this Bill, there would be no necessity for the measure. I do not wish to repeat statements which other honorable senators have made, but I may say that I have had some personal experience in connexion with the operation of the English Act of 1896 of the dangers to which workmen are exposed  from contracting-out clauses. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> put the position very forcibly when he spoke of the poverty of the employe. A seaman desirous of obtaining a berth on a ship has two options. He can agree to the employer&#39;s scheme or starve. He may have some one dependent upon him, and even though he should be a provident man, saving as much as he cam from his wages, he will have little margin left to enable him to tide over a long period of unemployment. If he is not a provident man the chances are that after a few hours ashore he will have dissipated the few shillings he may have accumulated during a previous voyage. In either case if this clause is agreed to, the seaman will be compelled to accept the conditions of an employer&#39;s scheme if he desires to secure employment. I have no desire to reflect upon the employers of Australia. I know that there are many good employers in the Commonwealth, but there are a few who are unscrupulous. We know that it is the practice to hand over these compensation cases to the insurance companies. There is no reason why a small employer should not insure his workmen as well as a large employer can. One of the advantages of a workmen&#39;s compensation law is the cheapening of litigation. Under the Employers&#39; Liability Act, and in defending a claim at common law, an employer is allowed to plead contributory negligence. But under a workmen&#39;s compensation law he cannot enter that plea unless there is glaring evidence that the injury to the workman was caused by his own wilful misconduct. </para>

The honorable senator quoted a recognised authority to the effect that a seaman who is a party to an employer&#39;s scheme practically signs away his rights of citizenship. I do not &#34;think that the Minister has rebutted that contention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has just described this clause as offering scope for the exercise of very skilful financial arrangements. I think the honorable senator might more appropriately have said that it offers scope for wily -financial arrangements. Honorable senators on this side have had cause to dread the skilful financial arrangements of employers. </para>

If the clause should become law in its present form all our time and energy in connexion with this Bill will have been wasted. </para>

                        <para>- T have quoted the facts, but, no matter how strong a case may be, the honorable senator will not admit that boycotting is taking place. I suppose that I would have to produce Mottram before the honorable, senator would give any credence to my statements. No matter how glaring a case may be cited, he refuses to recognise that boycotting is proceeding. He is so dead politically that upon a man of his calibre the citation of facts has no effect. It is very much like throwing water upon a duck&#39;s back. No matter what proof in support of our contention is submitted, the honorable senator adheres to his erroneous view. -The case I cited is sufficient to prove that boycotting is carried on, and if this measure is passed in its present form, it will give an incentive to further boycotting. It will afford to employers an opportunity to escape from the responsibility of compensating their injured workmen-. By simply initiating a scheme, a scheming employer will be able to get level with any man who objects to do what he wants. </para>

                        <para>- I prefer &#39;that it should be stated, in black and white, what advantages men may expect to obtain under the Act. I want to secure a tangible system. We do not need to tax our memory very much to recall a recent case in which boycotting was resorted to by the Melbourne Tramway Company. In connexion with that company there is a sick fund, to which every employe contributes. The employes were told that if they connected themselves with any trade union they would lose their employment, and their contributions to the sick fund. Some men did lose their employment, while others were reinstated on the understanding that they would have no connexion with trade unionism. Yet, in the face of these facts, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> wants honorable senators on this side to say where boycotting or blacklisting is practised. </para>

                    <para>. - When the amendment was moved, I had the temerity to object to the clause, or any amendment of it, as I felt that the provision, if enacted, would be quite useless. At that time I was not in possession of the exact terms of the amendment. But now that I have seen it, I am not surprised at the action of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in accepting it. I credit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> with being sincerely desirous of improving the position occupied by our seamen; but in submitting this proposal, he has fallen into the grievous error of adopting the identical language which employers themselves have frequently adopted, and which has proved a source of contention in thousands of cases throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I am so used to the intolerable twaddle that is talked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that I have become utterly indifferent to anything which he may say. It would be almost impossible to prove that a condition governing the employment of a seaman was the acceptance of any compensation scheme which might be put forward by their employers. About seven years ago a plan was incubated, at the works upon which I was employed, for the purpose of getting rid of some obnoxious trade unionists, myself included. In order to accomplish this object a ballot was taken, under the pretext that out of the  150  men employed there it was necessary to dispense with the services of ninety. But, unfortunately for the employers, it transpired, after the ballot had been taken, that I was amongst the sixty whose services were to be retained. Consequently it was discovered, a few days later, that it was necessary to dispense with the services of fifteen others. A second ballot was accordingly taken, and, of course, I was numbered with the victims. Almost immediately the proprietors of the works began to re-engage the men who had been discharged, taking particular care to exclude only those whom they had really intended to get rid of when this happy expedient was first resorted to. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me to be hopeless to induce honorable senators opposite to alter their intentions with regard to this clause. But it is reasonable to answer one or two statements that have been made during the discussion. It has keen said that cases which have been cited happened long ago, and were not likely to occur again. May I, by way of illustration, cite a case such as might occur on the very day after- this measure became operative? Every one will remember the McKay Harvester case. Representatives of the manufacturing firms came up to this building and lobbied members of Parliament for the express purpose of assuring us that certain things would be done for the wage earners if certain things were also done for the manufacturers. The things which they wanted done for themselves we agreed to. Parliament acquiesced in their desire. But the moment after the manufacturers turned round and repudiated every promise they had made in respect to the workers. They tried, through the instrumentality of the law - and successfully - to prevent the worker from getting his just due. As those things have happened quite recently, is it not possible and probable that they would happen again if a. measure such as this afforded an opportunity ? Our idea -in opposing the clause is not simply to object to a provision that the Government have brought forward. I unhesitatingly say that that consideration is not what inspires my opposition. I have cited a case to some honorable senators in which I myself was made a- victim. A place was absolutely kept open for me for months, with the idea that when I had finished a certain term, which was known to be coming to an end, the new situation might be offered to me. It was expected that I should be willing to work under conditions of which I did not approve. But I had made up my mind that I would walk my legs off up to my knees before I would accept the conditions that were offered. What has happened to many of us personally might happen to us under the provisions of this Bill. It is therefore easy to understand why. we offer such strong opposition to the clause. The Vice-President of the Executive &#39;Council told us that he intended to propose something that would prevent the possibility of objectionable practices creeping in. If he can succeed in that direction, he certainly will be expert in drawing up fast binding conditions. But I am of opinion that the only safe method will be that of wiping out the entire clause, with the object of making the Bill work as I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> intends it to do, namely, to provide simply that compensation should be granted for disabled seamen. If we do that we shall be on safe ground. But if we trifle with the question by agreeing to provisions which will nullify the principle of the Bill, the whole measure will become inoperative and our labours will be useless. </para>

                    <para>. - The party to which I belong advocate the striking out of the clause under discussion. The Minister, on the other hand, . says that amendments can be made in it to meet the objections which have been raised. If the Minister can suggest how it is possible to amend the clause so as to provide effectively that an employer shall not discharge a man because he will not contribute to a scheme that has been approved by the Comptroller-General, our opposition will be to a large extent disarmed. But I am as certain as I stand here that such an amendment cannot be made. An employer will not give a reason for discharging a man who refuses to contribute to a scheme. I believe that the Minister is doing his very best to make this a workable measure. We are trying to help him. But we have had experience, and we say plainly that there is no possible way of amending the clause so as to prevent ari employer from discharging a man if he will not join a scheme. If the Minister has any suggestion to make we shall be prepared to give consideration to it. This subject has occupied the attention of the Imperial legislature. An Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1902, entitled &#34; an Act to prevent  compulsory membership of unregistered shop clubs and thrift funds and to regulate such as are duly registered.&#34; The governing section of the Act provides that - </para>

                        <para>- We can easily do so much, but we can not thereby get over the real difficulty. Whether the English Act has been effective I do not know. I&#39; am simply pointing, out that the Imperial Parliament thought it necessary to impose  penalties on employers who interfered with their workmen in this respect. Another provision of the Act penalized an employer who insisted that any workman should not become a member of any friendly society other than the shop club or thrift club. The difficulty is to draft a provision to meet a case where an employer really discharged a workman for not contributing to a scheme, although giving no reason for so doing. I hope that the Minister will make some suggestion if he cannot see his way to withdraw the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - This is the third day on which we have addressed ourselves to the problems surrounding this clause. I take no exception to the length to which the discussion has extended, because I acknowledge that the clause contains a principle, on which honorable senators hold strong conflicting views. But we are all naturally anxious that there should be no unnecessary delay in the passing of a Bill of this character. I have taken advantage of an opportunity to have a few words with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and in order that we might learn the sense of the Committee on the clause, I have undertaken that pairs will be found for honorable senators belonging to the other side who, because of illness which we all regret, are unable to be present to-day. I am not at all oblivious of the force of the arguments directed against this clause. I ask the Committee to accept my assurance that in the attitude I have adopted in discussing it my sole object has been to make the Bill as perfect as possible for the purpose for which it is designed. If the Committee do not agree to the clause, I need not bother further about it, but if it is agreed to I give honorable senators opposite my assurance that I will place myself in communication with the Parliamentary Draftsman, and see whether it is not possible, as I think it is, to devise some machinery which would prevent the untoward results which they anticipate might arise from the inclusion of such a provision in the Bill. I shall not only consider the objections which have already been urged, but if others should be brought forward later on I shall be only too glad to treat them in the same spirit as I have treated those which have already been advanced. After that explanation of what I am prepared to do, I trust that the Committee will consent to go to a division on the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - There is force in the contention that we should consider whether the scale of compensation proposed represents a sufficient increase upon the British scale to cover the difference in wages in Australia as compared to those paid in European countries. I submit, however, that the way to overcome the difficulty is not that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> which I can show would open up a very profitable field for litigation, but to alter, the figures as they appear in the schedule in whatever way we think necessary. Unquestionably, one of the principal objects of this Bill is to avoid litigation, but if we leave the amount of compensation .an open question, we shall encourage litigation. Naturally, just as happens now with railway accidents, there is a percentage of cases settled out of court, -but in every case the injured person or the representative of a person who has been killed asks for a very large sum, in most cases larger &#34;than that which would be obtained from a jury, but the result is litigation. </para>

A person to whom a claim is presented will always be under the temptation to pay more than he ought legitimately be called upon to pay in order to avoid litigation. If we introduce a &#39;minimum and provide no maximum we shall introduce all the trouble which has marked previous legislation of this kind. Whatever the amount of the maximum may be, certainly let an amount be fixed, so that it will be possible for the representatives of a deceased person to make an exact claim. </para>

I do not pretend to suggest that any amount which may be paid in compensation for the death of a seaman is ample consolation to his family for the loss which they have sustained. It can never be regarded in that light. </para>

I suggest that the provision be allowed to stand as it is with the amount fixed at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500,</inline> instead of ^400.

I recognise that in a Compensation Act this is an innovation, but I would remind honorable senators that in the case of friendly societies a distinction&#39; is made between members who have a family depending upon them and other members. So far as the contribution is concerned, all the members of a friendly society are placed on the same plane, but in the case of medical attendance a married man enjoys the advantage of getting such attendance free. </para>

                        <para>- I think it will be admitted generally that when a person with four or five helpless youngsters depending upon him is stricken down he should receive larger compensation than a man who has no such responsibility to bear. I hold the view that those who are taking an earnest step in the direction of providing population and incurring the responsibility of raising a family should be treated quite differently from those, who for reasons of their own refuse to render such valuable service to their country. In the practice of friendly societies, a distinction such as I propose to make in this schedule, is drawn between a married man and a single man. If a married man happens to lose his wife the society comes to his rescue and contributes a certain amount towards her burial expenses, but for obvious reasons a single man does not get a like benefit, if that term may be used. In regard to the burial of a wife and the provision of medical assistance and medicine for his children, a married man is specially treated. </para>

                        <para>- In this part of the schedule it is laid down that in the case of a single man with any dependents the employer is only called upon to pay his expenses within certain limits. A direct inducement is there offered to ship-owners to employ single men, because in that case they would be called upon to pay burial expenses to the amount of only&#163;30, whereas in the case of a married man they might be called upon to pay any amount up to &#163;400. Surely it must come home to the minds of honorable members, in view of his greater responsibilities, that a married man is entitled to receive greater consideration than a single man. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend wants to multiply that inducement. It appears to me that in industrial matters there is a great danger run in differentiating between single men and married men. The compensation for accidents should be based&#34; on quite other considerations. In Victoria a little while ago a decision was given on an appeal from the determination of a Wages Board. An attempt was made there- to differentiate between the wages to be paid to a single man and those to be paid to a married man. It appeared to me to be fundamentally unsound. If this amendment were made it would give a sort of legislative sanction to the idea that the compensation is to be paid, not according to the work which men did, or the injury which they sustained, but according to the number and state of their dependents. </para>

                        <para>- Then every time that an employer wished to take an open policy it would be necessary for him to ascertain the average number of children claimed by the members of his crew. I would also point out that there is now less necessity for this proposal than there was previously, because of the amendment which we have just adopted, the effect of which has been to increase the amount of compensation that is payable. That amendment makes the Bill a little more liberal than it was. I propose to remove the limit regarding the period over which the payment of compensation should extend, and, under all the circumstances, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> might very well withdraw his amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite admit that there is something of a rather experimental character embodied in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> amendment. At the same time it embodies a very proper principle. I have long considered that the single men in the community escape obligations which ought properly to attach to them. We frequently penalize married men by taxation and in other ways. </para>

                        <para>- If the principle for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> contends be introduced here it cannot do much harm. The same principle underlies the schedule in its present form. Under the Bill as it stands, seamen who have the largest number of dependents will most certainly stand the least chance of securing employment. I grant that that trouble will be rather intensified by the adoption of the amendment. But I think that  it  is high time we recognised in our legislation the principle for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is fighting, and any opportunity of doing so I cordially welcome. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> chooses to propose a tax upon bachelors he will find me supporting him. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that it is not quite correct to say that the Bill recognises the principle for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is contending. It really asks this question, &#34; Has a seaman any dependents, or has he none?&#34; That is the broad distinction which it draws. If a man has no dependents upon him no claim for compensation can arise under this Bill. The measure is quite silent upon the question of whether he has only one dependant or twenty dependants. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> wishes to grade the compensation that will be payable to an injured seaman according to the number of dependants he may have. If he is going to do that, ought his proposal to be limited to the number of children that a man may have? </para>

                    <para>. - Let me put a case to the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Let us suppose that a seaman is partially or totally injured during the course of his employment. We all know that the wages paid to seamen upon the Australian  coast  average about  &#163;7  per month, or 32s. weekly. Now, in the second portion of this schedule it is proposed that the amount of compensation payable to a seaman who is partially or totally injured shall represent 50 per cent, of his average weekly earnings. In other words, he would be entitled to about 16s. a week, no matter what encumbrances or responsibilities he might have. </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council in urging the rejection of my proposal used an argument which to my mind is not very sound. He urged the withdrawal of my amendment on the ground that we have already increased the maximum amount of compensation payable to .&#163;500. But in my judgment that sum will very rarely be paid, for the reason that the maximum will be seldom reached. I submit my proposal in the interests of those who have to face a much more severe struggle than have the single men of the community. I urge it in the interests of equity, and with a desire to encourage population by making the conditions of life easier for those who have a number of children dependent upon them. It has been urged that the adoption of my proposal would intensify the difficulty of accurately assessing the amount which would be payable in case of injury to a married man as against injury to a single man. But I would point out that that difficulty is already embodied in the Bill. It is true that my amendment would make it more difficult to determine what the average rate of insurance would be in the case of a man who has a large number of dependants. But I think that we can alford to do that. In the interests of public policy, I believe that we should do it. I have no desire to embarrass the Government ; but I maintain that we ought to provide for those who are taking on life burdens as against those who are not. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has argued that my proposal would open up a large field of controversy by requiring the value of the labour that is performed by a married man to be assessed as against the value of the labour that is performed by a single man. But that is not the question. We are now dealing, not with the value of the labour performed by a married man, but with the necessity which exists for providing for the dependants of married men who happen to be called from this &#34; vale of tears.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - It appears to me that the principle underlying this proposal is an unsound one. In assessing the services rendered by any man, the principle which we should lay down ought to be based upon the assumption that he has a large family to maintain. I think it is a*i unsound principle to differentiate as to whether men are married or single. Marriage should not be looked upon as a luxury, as some person is said to have declared it to be. I think it is a natural and proper condition of humanity, and. all our calculations should be based upon its fulfilment. To insert in a humane and just legislation of this character the principle proposed would be extremely unwise from that point of view. </para>

                    <para>. - The principle involved in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch1</inline> s amendment is a sound one. The whole point is that the money due on account of a fatal accident has to be left to the dependents of the deceased.&#34; If those dependents are under fourteen years of age, in all probability they will be unable to do anything for themselves. Those over fourteen years of age would to. some extent be able to help themselves. A woman with a family under fourteen years of age is a more deserving subject for assistance than a woman with a grown-up family, because the latter would be only partly dependent upon the husband&#39;s earnings. </para>

I express the opinion that what a man earns is not merely limited to the sum paid to him in cash. I find that the word &#34;earnings&#34; has been the subject of more than one decision in Great Britain. I take this passage from Ruegg&#39;s  book on Workmen&#39;s Compensation, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has often quoted - </para>

                    <para>In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Pomphrey</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Southwark Press</inline> certain <inline font-style="italic">dicta</inline> of the Judges in the Court of Appeal appear, showing that the value of tuition given by an employer to an apprentice is of too vague a character to be taken into account as earnings under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act. In the same case the opinion is expressed that &#34;earnings&#34; are not necessarily confined to money. By the rules of a colliery company sixpence a week was deducted from the wages of each miner for lamp oil supplied by the employer. The lamp oil was a necessary expense incurred by the workman to enable him to earn the wages he actually received. In a claim under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act 1897, the arbitrator refused to make any deduction on account of the sixpence a week retained by the employers for the lamp oil. The Court of Appeal held that the arbitrator was right. </para>

                    will see thai each of these cases goes to show that not only is a man credited with earning the amount paid to him in cash, but that all that he receives is part of his earnings. In one case it was held that the uniform supplied to a guard was part of his earnings.

In view of the cases which I have mentioned, there is no room for doubt that the practice followed will be to determine not only the wages paid, but the total earnings the person affected had to his credit. </para>

                        <para>- But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> must recognise that an employer, or an insurance company to whom the employer offers a risk, will take into consideration, in determining the value of the risk, the number of married employes in the industry. 1 have a fear that if this amendment is inserted, it may lead to a differentiation being made against married men. I can give an instance as to what I mean, which will show that I am not speaking without cause. We have a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act in Western Australia. It applies to British subjects only. There is a well defined feeling amongst the miners&#39; unions that one of the reasons leading to the employment of aliens is the belief of the mine-owners that they thereby escape the risks of the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act. I have heard that urged by members of our party in Western Australia as one of the reasons inducing employers to substitute aliens for white miners, and there is consequently a movement to make the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act cover other than British subjects. My reason for quoting that instance is this : If we insert the amendment, the effect will be to lead to an added liability where a married man is employed. There will be an inducement to ship-owners not to employ a married man, because of the greater risk thereby incurred. </para>

                        <para>- But there is a rough and ready way of differentiation in the one case, and not in the other. The employer can say, &#34;I know that if I employ none but unmarried men I shall not incur this liability.&#34; But in the other case he would have to make individual inquiries to find out whether  employes  had people dependent on them or not. In the  one case he would have to ear-mark merely a class, and to say that he would employ no married men. In the other case, he would have to investigate every individual employe&#39;s circumstances, and find out whether he had dependents. It would be much more difficult to do that than to say. &#34; When we engage crews we will not employ any married men.&#34; I feel that a married man is entitled to more compensation than a single man, but I have a fear that if we agree to the amendment we shall make it more difficult for a married man to get employment. </para>

                <para>This provision deals with the compensation to be paid in case of total incapacity for work as the result of an injury. Suppose a seaman&#39;s wages are <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> per month. That would be about  35s.  per week, and half that amount would scarcely be sufficient to pay his doctor&#39;s expenses. I might inform the Committee that in this respect the German law is more liberal than is this Bill.. It provides for 662/3 per cent. of the average weekly earnings, and it has been reported that the provision works well. My amendment would certainly be a departure from the Imperial Act, but it would be a departure which, I think, is justified in the circumstances. Later on, it will be found that in the schedule a boy under twenty-one years of age might receive &#163;100, although the limit under this part of the schedule is fixed at&#163;1 per week. I think honorable senators will agree that  50  per cent. of  35s.  would not be sufficient. </para>

                    <para>. - It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to appeal to me for sympathy with his request that two-thirds of the average weekly earnings should be allowed, but a little later some other honorable senator may rise and propose an increase of the limit of the weekly payment. That would also have to be taken in conjunction with the amendment I have circulated to strike out the limit as to time. Individually considered, each of these proposals might represent but a small concession, but, taken together, it will be seen that they would represent a considerable advance on what was originally proposed in the Bill. Before we decide to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> amendment, I should like to know what the honorable senator proposes to do when we come to fix the limit of the weekly payment. </para>

If we take a seaman&#39;s wages at &#163;7 per month, and add the value of board and lodging, 50 per cent. of his weekly earnings would run to more than the limit of the weekly payment of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> provided for in a later part of the paragraph. </para>

                    <para>- At the point where the last amendment was made, I have given notice of a proposal to introduce the following provision : - and if at any time the seaman is entitled to an old-age pension from the Commonwealth, not to exceed during that time an amount which together with the weekly rate of the pension will make up Thirty shillings...... </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The object I had in view in circulating the amendment was that inasmuch as the Commonwealth has taken upon itself the responsibility of paying an old-age pension, it ought not to throw upon an individual industry that obligation. Take the case of a seaman who is entitled to an old-age pension at the age of sixty-five years. If he is not injured at that age he has a claim against the Commonwealth, and the mere fact that he is injured ought not to relieve the Commonwealth of that claim. We ought not, merely because a man is injured, to thrust him as a pensioner on the industry, when in regard to his uninjured brother the Commonwealth accepts the responsibility. If a man is entitled to receive a weekly allowance of 30s. from the shipping industry, and to draw an old-age pension of 10s. a week, to the extent of the old-age pension he should relieve the claim against the shipping industry. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but in view of the hour at which we have arrived, I do not propose to submit it to-day. I merely ask honorable members to consider it during the adjournment. My proposal could make no difference to the injured seaman, because he will get the same compensation. The only point is as to whether he ought not to be fined to the extent of his old-age pension - whether, when he arrives at the age of sixty-five years, the sum of 10s. ought not to be derived from the Commonwealth. </para>

In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I may state that the Electoral Bill will be distributed to-morrow, and those honorable senators who are going away from Melbourne to-day might leave a direction for copies to be forwarded to their address. On Wednesday next, it is intended to move the second reading of the Bill. Perhaps it will assist honorable senators if I mention that it is merely a machinery Bill, which is found to be necessary by the experience of the electoral officers. </para>
