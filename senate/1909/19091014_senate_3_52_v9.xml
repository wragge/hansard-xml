                    <para>. -  Before the Sena.ce loses control over this Bill, I should like to emphasize one or two points, which I mentioned during ' my speech on the second reading. Before the Government consider the appointment of a High Commissioner, as they will have power to do when this Bill becomes law, I think they would be doing good service :to the Commonwealth, if they would communicate with the Premiers of the States in order to ascertain to what extent the States are prepared to transfer some of the functions now exercised by their. Agents-General to the High Commissioner ; and also when they are prepared to take steps in that direction. Unless some of these functions are transferred at a very early date, I shall maintain my .opinion that there wm be nothing for the High Commissioner to do commensurate with the expense to which the Commonwealth will be put. I am borne out in that opinion by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir -Philip</inline> Fysh, who spent years in London as Agent-General for Tasmania. I also hope that Ministers will take an early opportunity to see whether they cannot house the High Commissioner and all the Agents-General -or commercial agents of the States in -one building. That, to my mind, is a most important matter, and it is the most hopeful feature in connexion with the proposed appointment. I was very disappointed indeed when negotiations for acquiring a site in London Tell through, and Victoria built an office for herself. Other States have also made their own arrangements for permanently housing their London representatives; I hope the time will come shortly when we shall have one office and one set of officers representative of the whole of Australia. I venture also to make some criticism of the argument .of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, .when he pointed out how neil the High- .Commissioner -would be able to deal with the question of immigration. I hold in my hand a copy o.f the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> newspaper of the 7th August last, containing :a .letter from- which J shall quote. It is . signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Pittock, of Newcastle, New South Wales,' who takes care to let the world know that he is a magistrate, ' and a member pf' the Labour party. The letter, so far as it refers to Australia, is one of the most damaging publications I ever read. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock</inline> writes with the express purpose of justifying the policy of the Labour party in objecting to immigration under present circumstances, and in. carrying out that idea he has made some most mischievous statements. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Pittock, a magistrate, of Newcastle, and a member of the Labour party. I made inquiries on the subject, and was assured that a reply to the letter was published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GuIIett,</inline> a son of the gentleman who was for many years the able editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> The probability is that Captain Collins, to whose efficiency as our representative in Great Britain I have already testified, induced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> to answer the letter. That is probably the reason why the Agents-General refrained from publishing any answer to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett's</inline> letter is an admirable one, and he makes some good points against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock..</inline> He pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock,</inline> having done remarkably well for himself in coming to Australia, is now anxious that nobody else should follow in his footsteps, and so come into competition with him in any way. But, in my opinion,  there  is a grave omission from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett's</inline> letter, and it contains one serious mistake. In the first place, he does not attempt to deny that there is no land available in Australia, and in the second place he assumes that the statement that there is no land available is correct, and goes on to say that we are turning over a new leaf, that we have seen the error of our ways, and that in all the States the Governments are now in favour of some land settlement policy. I think that it would have been much better, and would have been a crushing answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock,</inline> if each of the Agents-General had, in a short letter which the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> would have been bound to publish in reply to the incorrect statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock,</inline> pointed out that there is land available in every State in Australia, and had plainly stated the terms and conditions on which it could be occupied. It is argued that we must have in London one, and only one, representative of the Commonwealth to answer such statements as these. Some honorable senators contend that the statements appearing in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock's</inline> letter are correct, and in answer to them I would ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to say whether it is not a fact that land is available for immigrants in every State of the Commonwealth. If it be a fact, let it be known. I think the Government should ask the Premiers of the various States to- cable to their Agents-General with a view to the mischievous and inaccurate statements appearing in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock's</inline> letter being contradicted. I cannot understand why any one should say that these things should wait until we have a high-salaried officer in London representing the Commonwealth, nor can I understand why it should be supposed that such an officer could do the work required to be done there in such respects better than the six officers representing the States, who, it should be remembered, are citizens of the Commonwealth. I shall not labour the matter further. I have only to say that I shall be intensely disappointed if the office of High Commissioner is filled before the Government have satisfied themselves as to whether, before the State debts are transferred to the Commonwealth, a High Commissioner will have any work to do. </para>

I am afraid that the position is likely to be filled by a man who has had. such a political past in Australia as I have indicated, and who will feel himself called upon to justify that past. </para>

                        <para>- If they are unfitted for settlement on the land, it is only because of their ignorance of the requirements of successful land settlement, and that could easily be remedied. No one can deny the fact that although there is in Australia a great deal of land .unutilized, it is not available for the people. If we send to London a man who has been identified with the locking up of the lands of Australia, and with the putting of Australia into pawn in order to run up a monstrous debt, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that all our efforts in passing this Bill will be in vain. I hope that the Government will make a selection for the office of High Commissioner of a gentleman who will do justice to the Commonwealth, and will truly represent the ideas of the people of this country. </para>

                    <para>.- I opposed this Bill at an earlier stage. I should not have risen on the present occasion were it not for some statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> The honorable senator quoted a letter published in the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> by a gentleman whose name is not familiar to me, but who, according to the honorable senator, is a magistrate and a resident of Newcastle, New South Wales. Before reading the letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> said that the statements it contained were mischievous, and slandered the Commonwealth. I ask any fair-minded member of the Senate to say, after hearing the letter, whether every statement quoted from it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> was not absolutely correct? Members of the Opposition cheered the statements contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock' s</inline> letter as they were being read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline></para>

The harm which has been done to the Commonwealth has been done, not by the Labour party, but by interested persons, who have had large sums of money at their disposal, by means of which they have disseminated throughout Great Britain literature containing nothing but tissues of falsehood. As a result of the circulation of that literature, a large number of men and women have been lured here by means of false misrepresentations. </para>

                        <para>- Upon more than one occasion in the Senate I have quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Year Book of Australia</inline> for the purpose of showing that the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland have been compelled to resume large areas in their respective States for closer settlement purposes. Every sensible man realizes the difficulty which is experienced in settling persons in Australia to-day. Honorable senators opposite would have us believe that the latter have only to come to Australia to obtain land. Apparently the right man to fill the office of High Commissioner should, in the opinion of certain folk, be a gentleman who has been largely interested in land booming. If there is one thing which has inflicted damage upon Australia it is land booming. It has brought misery and premature death to thousands throughout the Commonwealth. I do not, however, wish to labour that question. But I am surprised that a gentleman sitting on the Ministerial side of the Senate should have exercised his influence with the Prime Minister for the purpose of getting the truthful statements contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock's</inline> letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> in regard lo the opportunities for land settlement and employment in Australia rebutted. If such conduct is to pass unchallenged we shall in the future find honorable senators exercising their influence with the Agents-General for the purpose of inducing them to contradict similar statements which appear in the London press. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has drawn attention to a very important matter, though I draw an entirely opposite conclusion from the facts presented to that which he has put forward. The circumstance that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock' s</inline> letter appeared in the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> is the strongest possible reason why its statements should be controverted, not by the Agents-General, but by the representative of Australia in the person of the High Commissioner. I do hope that after that office has been filled statements which are calculated to do injury to the Commonwealth will be promptly rebutted. I trust that the High Commissioner will let the public of the "United Kingdom understand exactly what is our position. In his letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittock</inline> states that there is no land in Australia available for settlement. Probably, because that statement was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> a great deal more importance would be attached to it than would otherwise have been the case. <inline font-style="italic">The Times,</inline> as well as other influential newspapers/ an England - possibly through a defective cable service - are intentionally or unintentionally doing us a grave injustice, inasmuch as when such statements have appeared in the press, facts with regard to the case for Australia have not been given like publicity. On two occasions a responsible official, charged with the most important work of supervising the agricultural development of Victoria, has stated that if his irrigation schemes are carried out by the State Government his difficulty will be, not to find land for people, but to find people for land. He says that with the irrigation schemes in the north-western district carried out on the lines which he has recommended he will require from 20,000 to 30,000 settlers to develop the land. </para>

                        <para>- That will not be the fault of Australia, but the fault pf the Victorian Government. If we have; a High Commissioner in London, probably when such statements as have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elwood</inline> Mead in - regard to the development of land in the comparatively closely settled State of Victoria are published, they will be cabled with the official sanction of the Government and placarded throughout the United Kingdom and, possibly, the United States. Here we have a population of only 4,000,000 persons, on  a continent comprising 3,000,000 square miles, a vast portion of which is very fertile and fit for other than agricultural purposes. It is probable that the . mischief, one might almost say the libel, that is contained in a letter of the kind which appeared in <inline font-style="italic">The Times</inline> would be nailed to the counter at once if we had a High Commissioner in London. The refutation would go forward through the press, and, possibly, through the cables, with a statement of the absolute facts. 1 do not know whether those who control the cable service on this side have telegraphed to the United Kingdom or elsewhere that in the small State of Victoria men with small means can, through the action of the State Government, take up land in an area which, under certain conditions and with certain State assistance, will in the course of five or six years carry from 20,000 to 30,000 settlers. Either the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. El</inline> wood Mead is true, or the -statements made by honorable senators on the other side are false. Both cannot stand together. I prefer to take the statement of Victoria's responsible official. It is not land that is wanted in Australia, but -the right kind of people for the land which is available. We desire that fact to be communicated, not merely to the United Kingdom, but throughout Europe, the United States, and Canada. We want that statement to go forth to the people, with the official indorsement of a man in the position of High Commissioner for Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - If the only purpose which our representative in London will serve is to misconstrue facts, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has done, it will be much better if we never send one. Time after time the honorable senator has trotted out his theory of percentages exactly in the same way as the old sailor did his average depth of the river, " From one side of the river to the other," said the old sailor, "the average depth is 4 feet," but at one point the depth was 8 feet, and we can imagine what happened to a man who, not being able to swim, proceeded to wade across. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger's percentage of the land which is alienated is exactly in the same category as the old sailor's average depth of the river. There may be only 6 per cent, of the land of Australia alienated ; but if you announce abroad that only 6 per cent. of our land is alienated with a view to leading people to believe that the balance of 94 per cent, is accessible and capable of being used by people if they will only come here, then you will do an incalculable injury to those whom you may bring here by such false pretences. Be honest, and tell the people when you are advertising the resources of Australia that all the good land close to markets - in fact, all the accessible land - is held up by men who are not using it. </para>

I had not the good fortune, to hear the whole of the letter read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> Apparently the writer was not only a truthful man, but one who had an exact knowledge of the conditions which prevail in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is smiling, but if there is any State in the Commonwealth which is suffering from the evils of land monopoly it is Tasmania. Young men and women are fleeing from that State as from a place smitten with the plague. There is absolutely no outlet for them in their native. State. Probably with the exception of Victoria there is no State in the Union which is suffering more from the evils of land monopoly "than is Tasmania. The young men and women are leaving in droves. Young men are going to New Zealand. A large number of young women are crossing to Melbourne to engage in domestic service. </para>

                        <para>- I will deal . with New Zealand by-and-by. I merely make this statement by the way : that if any honorable senators should "be impressed by  the tremendous evils which are being brought to Australia by land monopoly it is the representatives of Tasmania. If they have eyes to see, or ears to hear, or hearts to feel, or minds to understand, surely this great calamity which is befalling not only their State, but almost every State in the Union, ought to be apparent to each one of them.I am not going to quote figures compiled by an irresponsible Labour agitator.I shall quote some figures and facts which come straight from the capitalistic camp. They have been put together by one of the principal agents of capitalism in the State of Victoria - by a member of a Government which was placed in power by the land monopolists and the Employers' Federation. But so gross has the evil of land monopoly become, so flagrant in its effects, that even this man the Treasurer of a purely capitalistic Government, was compelled to bring in a measure for the express purpose of breaking it up in some small degree. I shall give a few figures which this gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> quoted. </para>

                        <para>- This witness comes from the camp in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> finds himself. He is, I am sure, a most unwilling witness. He has been compelled simply by stress of circumstances to leave his friends and come over to the Labour enemy. I believe that the gentleman who occupies the position of Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> pledged himself, before he obtained that office - before his party would rid themselves of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bent - that he and his colleagues in the Government would not impose a land values tax. But he became the victim of circumstances. He and his colleagues saw that they were lying in the track of a Juggernaut, and that unless they got out of that track, not only they themselves were bound to be crushed, but also the State which they presume to represent. So much for my few remarks. Now I will come to the facts and figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> which I have no doubt were founded on the best authority. They were given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> when he introduced his Land Value Tax Bill. Referring to the existing Victorian land tax, which I suppose is familiar lo most honorable senators, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> said - </para>

                    <para>The existing tax proposed to break up large estates by steadily decreasing their area. Only estates of 640 acres and upwards were subjected to its operations, but they had this noteworthy fact, that the area now taxed was 255,000 acres in excess of the area in 1888, two years after the tax was proposed. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will observe that this land values tax has been in operation for twenty-three years. It was passed with the express object of breaking up the big. estates. But the result has been that the area now taxed is 255,000 acres in excess of the area when the tax was first imposed. That means that it failed completely in its object. It not only did not break up the existing large estates, but under its operation the estates have become larger by 255,000 acres. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray's</inline> Government now come forward with a proposal to impose a tax which will be effective, and in support of his contention <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> gave a number of figures which 1 intend to quote.

                        <para>- I may here interpolate that when I was up in Queensland lately I heard that a number of Victorian farmers who had been hunted out of this State by land monopoly were telling the people that they had been driven forth by the Labour party. A large number were so ignorant of Victorian politics that they actually believed the statement. That will show the kind of people they are. After having been literally driven out of this State by land monopoly, they go up to Queensland and try to perpetuate the evil. </para>

Assuming that the selections were all of the maximum size, this alienation would have provided for 16,334 holdings, so that, by the process of alienation alone, if there had been no subdivision of large estates during the past 30 years, they should have had 16,334 holdings more, instead of which they only had 9,015, or 7,319 less. In 1878-1879, estates above 10,000 acres numbered 205 ; in 1907-1908 they had been reduced to 183. In a space of 30 years, during which it would have been thought that agricultural holdings would have Become smaller, the average holding had been increased from 338 acres to 436 acres, and the percentage of holders to the general population fell from 5.68 per cent, to 4.59 per cent. </para><para class="block">So that the proportion of small landholders to the general population actually fell instead of increasing during the last thirty years. </para><para>Victoria had alienated, or had in process of alienation, 49 per cent, of its territory; Tasmania, 32^ per cent. ; New South Wales, 25 per cent. ; Queensland, 4^ ner cent. ; South Australia, 2 per cent., and Western Australia, 2 per cent.

                    went on to deal with the movement of population in Victoria. In  1881  the population of this State numbered  862,646.  Last year it was  1,287,000,  an increase of  424,521,  or approximately  50  per cent. But the increase of the births over the deaths was for that period  436,606,  showing that the State had really lost by excessive emigration over immigration  12,085  souls. During the twenty-seven years the increase was roughly  425,000.  Of this number  261,000  settled in metropolitan districts, and  164,000  in all the other counties combined. So that it will be seen that the rush of 'population has been from the country districts into Melbourne, and suburbs.

                        <para>- It is all very well, but the business of the Commonwealth must be conducted upon rational lines. The Treasurer of Victoria was permitted to give information with regard to New Zealand when moving his measure in the Victorian Assembly. I have myself spoken in the Senate dozens of times before on the question of land monopoly in Australia, and have given practically the same facts as those which were detailed by the Victorian Treasurer. I was never interrupted before. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that on the motion before the Chair for the adoption of the report on the High Commissioner Bill, a discussion on every matter which affects the progress of Australia is perfectly in order. That, sir, has been admitted by you in practice, since you allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> in the first place, to read a letter written upon Australian resources by some one residing in London. I was permitted to, for a certain time, deal with the same subject in so far as it affects Australia. But when I endeavoured to contrast the progress of New Zealand, under a particular policy, with the want of progress in Australia during a particular period,. I was called to order, and was not permitted to proceed on those lines. The present occasion seems to me to be somewhat similar to many other occasions on which I have thought it desirable to bring forward facts and arguments in connexion with land monopoly in Australia and our land tax proposals. The present occasion does not seem to me to differ from a number of other occasions when that line of argument was followed in the Senate without any objection from the Chair. I admit that the Senate is not bound by the Standing Orders of the Victorian Legislative Assembly; but I think that anything that makes for the progress of the community should not be looked upon as antagonistic to the Standing Orders governing the procedure in any Parliamentary institution. </para>

                        <para>- In order to buttress his argument with regard to land value taxation, the Victorian Treasurer produced a number of facts and figures showing how New Zealand has benefited by that kind of legislation. He was not interfered with by the  Speaker  of the Victorian Assembly. He was allowed to pursue that line of argument, it being recognised, I have no doubt, by honorable members present, that it was in the. interests of Victoria that the facts with regard to New Zealand should be made public. Those who were asked to adopt a particular line of policy here were interested to know what the effect had been of the adoption of a similar policy elsewhere. We have found, in connexion with almost every proposal made in this Parliament, and rightly so, that the results of similar proposals elsewhere have been brought forward in their support. It might be that an experiment had been tried and failed. Some honorable senator gets up and gives that as a reason why the experiment proposed- </para>

                        <para>- If it will not be the duty of the High Commissioner to tell the public of Great Britain what is the position in Australia, of course my remarks are out of order. But if he will perform that duty, I submit that they are quite in order. I was pointing out that honorable senators are continually citing instances of the success of experiments in other countries. It is their duty to ransack the globe in an effort to discover examples of failure or of success, with a view to giving the people the benefit of the knowledge thus obtained. If we are going to build a wall around this continent, and to take no thought of what occurs elsewhere, I venture to say that our progress will be exceedingly slow. That is the reason upon which I found my objection to your ruling. Upon the motion for the adoption of the report on the High Commissioner Bill, it ought to be quite open to me to say what has happened under a particular policy in New Zealand or elsewhere, so long as that knowledge, if properly applied, will be beneficial to the people of the Commonwealth. That is the sole reason on which I found my objection to your ruling. Under our Standing Orders, and under the practice which has hitherto obtained in this Chamber, it is quite permissible for me to debate what has happened in New Zealand, Russia, Denmark, or any other country. </para>

                        <para>- And the honorable senator now wishes to make a second speech upon the same subject. I think that he rather misunderstands the position in which we now find ourselves. The motion which has just been carried affirmed the necessity for immediately considering his motion of dissent to the President's ruling. In the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> motion, debate upon that motion would, under standing order  415,  have been automatically deferred until to-morrow. At the time it was submitted we were considering a motion for the adoption of the report on the High Commissioner Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> had quoted a letter which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> in which the writer made certain statements regarding the position of affairs in. Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in no way touched upon the matters which were dealt with by the writer. All that he did was to affirm the necessity which exists for having some authoritative answer given to such statements. </para>

                        <para>- Whether land monopoly exists in Australia or not is not t he question under discussion. The whole purpose of the letter brought forward by Senator Dobson was to show that six Agents-General could better answer statements affecting Australian interests than could one High Commissioner. But that does not, I submit, furnish any justification for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> going into the merits of land monopoly or any subject other than the appointment of a High Commissioner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> whole contention was that six Agents-General, by writing six letters to appear one after the other in <inline font-style="italic">The Times,</inline> could furnish a much more effective reply on behalf  of  Australia than would one letter, and he argued that a High Commissioner ought, therefore, not to be appointed. To my mind that was a logical argument to address  to  the Senate. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is now seeking to show that, because there is or is not land monopoly in New Zealand, a High Commissioner ought or ought not to be appointed. I submit that there is no relevancy between the alleged existence of land monopoly in another country and the question whether or not the Senate should adopt the report on a Bill authorizing the appointment of a High Commissioner. </para>

                    <para>. - I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to be discussing the kind  of  High Commissioner who should be appointed, in order that the state  of  affairs which he was indicating existed in New Zealand should be correctly placed before the people of the Old Country. I hold that in arguing from that stand-point he was in order, because some previous speakers had proceeded  on  somewhat similar lines. He was not discussing the merits or the demerits of the land question in Australia or New Zealand, but simply showing that land monopoly existed in New Zealand, and that inasmuch as it also existed in Australia we required a High Commissioner who would be fully imbued with the evils which resulted from that state of affairs. If we cannot show that evils exist in Australia which require to be righted with the assistance of a High Commissioner, I hold that an appointment is not needed. </para>

                    <para>.- Having listened to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and one or two other speakers relative to this Bill, I am disposed to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was quite within his rights in discussing New Zealand from the view point of land settlement. One of the most important duties which the High Commissioner will be called upon to perform will be to give the most up-to-date information respecting the land and taxation policies of the various States. It ought to be one of his duties to supply such information as- will satisfy an intending immigrant that he can, if he so desires, obtain land in Victoria, New South Wales. Queensland, Tasmania, or South Australia. An inquirer should be able to go to the office of the High Commissioner and ascertain the area of alienated land in any State in the Union, and the area available for alienation. An inquirer should also be able to ascertain the States in which land value taxation is operative, and those which have no such form of taxation. If it would be in order to discuss the High Commissionership from that view point, ought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to have been ruled out of order when he endeavoured to draw a contrast between the States of the Union and the Dominion of New Zealand, which has a scientific form of land value taxation, and which has demonstrated that by the imposition of such taxation it has advanced very considerably ? </para>

                        <para>- I was endeavouring to show as fairly as I could that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was quite in order in making a comparison between the States of the Commonwealth and New Zealand in respect to land settlement and land value taxation, demonstrating the manifold advantages of the taxation system which has been operative in the Dominion, and showing that to that system was due to a large extent the measure of prosperity which it has enjoyed for a considerable period. In connexion with this Bill for the appointment of a High Commissioner we have been permitted to discuss the land question, which is all important to the High Commissionership, to Australia, and to those who desire to establish homes here. If we are not to be allowed to discuss the land question, and if the High Commissioner will not have to deal with that important subject, I cannot see why he should be appointed, because if a knowledge of that question is eliminated from his duties he will be merely a social butterfly. I submit, sir, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was quite in order in making a passing reference to land taxation and land settlement in New Zealand, and in demonstrating that a similar policy would be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth should urge the laggard States to bring about such a system of land settlement as would give the High Commissioner greater opportunities to serve the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - A motion to dissent from a ruling is always an important one, because the method of conducting our business has a great tendency to conduce to expedition or waste of time. It is a clear rule in every Parliament that only the subject under discussion shall be dealt with, that anything which is irrelevant, however important in itself, shall not be discussed. The question of whether or not New Zealand has adopted a better land policy than any State in Australia, while extremely important if it were under discussion, is not relevant to a Bill authorizing the appointment of a High Commissioner. The question before the Senate is just as wide apart from the question of proper land legislation as it is from the question of vaccination or quarantine or legal practice. ' We can only intelligently discuss the wisdom or unwisdom of appointing a High Commissioner by confining ourselves to that issue. Any reference to New Zealand by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> would not have been out of order if it had related to the fact that its High Commissioner had produced baneful or beneficial results to the Dominion. That would have been a pertinent reference to the matter at issue, because, although it would have dealt with New Zealand, it would have illustrated the experience of that Dominion in reference to the question before the Chair. The question whether Australia pursues a good or a bad land policy cannot come under the notice of the High Commissioner, except in so far as he is called upon to answer questions from inquirers concerning it. He simply has to give information in that case just as he will have to give information on other matters. If it be contended that because the High Commissioner will have to give information regarding land, therefore we ought to discuss the whole land problem on this Bill, it might just as well be contended that because the High Commissioner will have to give information on one hundred and other things we should also discuss those various questions in connexion with the Bill. For instance, the High Commissioner may be asked by a legal practitioner in England whether the Commonwealth law permits legal practitioners from the United Kingdom to practice in our Courts. He will answer to the best of his ability. But that does not justify us in discussing at length the wisdom or unwisdom of restricting practice in our Courts to persons who have become qualified in the Commonwealth. Again, the question of vaccination is one concerning which there is a strong feeling all over the world. The High Commissioner may be asked by an intending immigrant whether persons in Australia are compelled to have their children vaccinated. He will answer the question. But see where we should be landed if it were admitted that because the High Commissioner might have to answer such questions they are therefore matters which can be discussed in connexion with this Bill. If that were allowed we might traverse every branch of legislation. I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that in ruling that an argument - not a passing reference - to the wisdom or unwisdom of certain forms of land taxation was outside of the scope of the question you, sir, acted quite rightly. </para>

                    <para>- I said at the beginning of my speech that the High Commissioner would be an individual whose duty would be to represent truly to the people of Great Britain the exact state of affairs with regard to land settlement and other matters in Australia. I have already given a few facts, guaranteed by the authority of the Treasurer of Victoria, regarding this State. I trust that the High Commissioner will make public in Great Britain such facts as I have quoted. There are a few more matters to which I wish to allude relating to the same subject. The Treasurer of Victoria went on to say that this State still had large estates on every hand in the hands of private individuals, who would only sell at high prices. That fact ought not to be withheld from the people of Great Britain. The High Commissioner ought to be instructed by the Government to make it as public as possible, because there is no profit in inducing people to come here under false pretences. If they are told that there is plenty of land available, and they find that there is the greatest difficulty in getting any to suit them, they will immediately give the Commonwealth a bad name. They will write Home to their friends that they have been misled, and that they would have been better off if they had remained in the Old Country. We ought not, on any account, to cast upon Australia the stigma, of a reputation for telling untruths. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> went on to detail the struggle which had taken place during the last fifty years between the large land-holders and the people of Victoria. He pointed out that in 1856 the squatting interest controlled 42,000,000 acres out of 55,000,000 in this State. He added that, although the proportion of squatters was now altered, the same problem still faced the people. He observed that railways had been pushed through large estates, and that the country had reaped very little revenue from them. Although Victoria had inaugurated a policy of closer settlement, he did not think that it had been satisfactory. Some persons, he said, blamed the Closer Settlement Board, but he did not. He blamed the system under which the Board operated. Every refusal to sell drove the Board to negotiate for some other estate, and sent up prices against the Board. That is a most important point. Unless something were done, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> said, Victoria could never thrive as it ought to do. To show how the price of country lands had been enhanced by State improvements, he said - </para>

            </quote><para>That is to say, in five years the value of this particular piece of land had increased from ¬£530 to  ¬£2,687.  The Victorian Treasurer gave a number of other instances, which I shall not weary the Senate by quoting. The lesson which this ought to convey is that prices of land in Victoria have been unduly inflated by the condition of land monopoly. That having been proved definitely, information in regard to it ought to be conveyed to people in Great Britain and elsewhere who desire to emigrate to Australia. All I desire is that tht truth about Australia shall be told to people who desire to come here. They should not be led away by vague general statements, such, for instance, as that in Queensland only 4¬Ω per cent, of the land has been alienated. That statement is quite true, but although 95¬Ω per cent, of the lands of that State are still in the hands of the Crown, new arrivals in Queensland find it exceedingly difficult to get decent land on which to settle. A short time ago I heard of the case of a man who had been engaged in the dairying industry in England and who came out to Queensland. He sold his land and stock in the Old Country and came to Queensland with his mother, intending to engage in the same occupation in that State. The Queensland Government sent him here and there all over the State, and showed him the land that was open for settlement in different districts, but he ultimately decided that there was not a single one of the holdings to which he had been sent that was suitable for his purpose. </para><interjection>

                    <para>-  I do not think so. I have been up and down Queensland a good deal, and I can assure the honorable senator that there is very little country open in that State now which a new-comer could take up at what I call settlers' prices. </para>
                </talk.start>
            </continue><para class="block">The earlier settlers in Queensland got their land at from 2s. 6d. to ¬£1 per acre. No land can be obtained there now in such a situation that it might be profitably worked at less than from ¬£2 up to ¬£12 and ¬£14 per acre. That is information which should be given to the people of Great Britain. The man to whom I have referred had been told in England that there were millions of acres of land in Queensland awaiting immigrants to take them up. He travelled in many districts and did not find a single holding within reach of his purse that it was worth his while to take up for the purpose for which he came to the State. He was ultimately forced to take a job in Brisbane. I think it is exceedingly undesirable that people should be induced to come to Australia under an impression which is not warranted by the circumstances. There is any quantity of land in Queensland, millions and millions of acres, empires of it, if honorable senators please, in every way suitable for settlement, but the great bulk of it is held by people who will sell only at a ransom, or will not sell at all. So that, so far as settlement is concerned, the land is practically nonexistent. The position indeed is worse than if the land did not exist, because the fact that it is monopolised by those who will not use it, drives would-be : settlers to a distance from the railways and markets, and compels them to take up inferior land which in many cases is heavily timbered and expensive to clear. I think that all these circumstances should, in the interests of truth, be made public by the High Commissioner of the Commonwealth when he goes to London. I am sure that it will be said that I belong to the " Stinking Fish Party." I do not belong to any party of that kind. I belong to a party which desires to see the opportunities for land settlement very largely multiplied in Australia. That is the reason why I insist upon the truth with regard to our lands being told to the people of Great Britain and Europe. When the land monopolists of Australia, and their press and Parliamentary advocates, find out that the people of Great Britain and of Europe will not come here under existing conditions, they may be persuaded to alter their present policy and agree to proposals which I, at any rate, believe would result in creating hundreds of thousands of opportunities for good settlers from the other end of the earth. That is my sole purpose in speaking this afternoon upon this subject. I trust that the High Commissioner will be a man who will tell the exact truth about Australia, who will not allow his utterances to be distorted by party bias, who will be wholly independent of whatever Government may be in power, who will conceal nothing, concerning either our resources, which are great, no doubt, or our land system, which is one of the most foolish and wicked under the sun. I hope he will tell the people' at the other end of the world what the true conditions are here. I desire that those conditions should be altered, but that is another question which has nothing to do with the present discussion. I have stated my ideas with regard to the kind of man I think the High Commissioner should be. 1 hope he will be a man of that character. I should like to see such a man appointed. But I must say that my expectation that my wish will be realized is very, very faint indeed. </para><para>Original question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Report adopted. </para></speech>

                    <para class="block">In submitting this Bill, I recognise at once that it is not a measure the consideration of which need occupy very much time. 1 do not wish to infer by that that I do not regard it as one of very considerable importance to the great producing interests of Australia. At the same time, I recognise that the matters within its scope must be so fully within the knowledge of honorable senators, and that in the earlier stages, at any rate, the objects to be accomplished by this Bill will be so limited in number, though important in range, that it will not be necessary for me to do more than make an incidental reference to the more important of them. The first thing I wish to emphasize with regard to the Bill is that it is not at all the intention to superimpose a Federal Department upon the already existing State Agricultural Departments. What is sought is the creation of a central staff, limited in number, the duties of which will be to co-ordinate State work, and to establish connecting links between the work being carried on in one State and that carried on in the others. As to the advisability of some more general action than that which has been, or can be, taken by the authorities in any single State, I should instance what has recently been done in the United States of America. Some little time since,  President  Roosevelt constituted a conference of experts, and I believe also of Governors from each of the different States of the Union, with a view to considering the conservation of natural resources. That Conference had not long been in session before it was discovered that its work would be incomplete if the scope of its inquiry and representation were not extended to embrace Canada on one side and Mexico on the other. The enlarged Conference addressed itself to its work, and was again met with the difficulty that natural resources were matters which were of more than local concern, that there was, as it were, -a kind of world-wide interest in world-wide resources. As a result, a recommendation was made that the Conference should be made International. That recommendation was approved, and an International Conference has now been arranged for, to be held at The Hague within the next few months. I mention that only to show, in connexion with this great question of agriculture - and I use the term in its widest sense - how important it is that discoveries and scientific achievements in one part of the world shall be made available to other parts, and similarly how desirable it is that discoveries, investigations and experiments in one State of the Commonwealth shall be made available to the people of the whole of Australia. I would remind the Senate that it has been the practice in past years for conferences of State officers connected with the Agricultural Departments of the several States to be frequently held. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is possible that they do not understand, or that they only partially understand, what is intended. I content myself with that remark. I express very grave doubts whether State officials are the most competent judges of the advisability of creating a Federal Agricultural Department. In addition to these State conferences, which point to the necessity of some Australian action, we have had many State disagreements arising from conflicts of opinion and of effort, which, I venture to say, a Federal determination would have avoided. Looking back to the history of many of them, one is unable to resist the conclusion that very frequently, though perhaps unconsciously, State interest has to some extent determined the conclusions arrived at bv the representatives of the several States. I' mention these facts as showing that in my opinion there is important work, to be done which extends beyond the limits of any one State, and which is of interest to the agriculturists of Australia as a whole. I do not think it will be disputed that there is important and valuable work awaiting workmen. </para>

                            <para>- It certainly will not conflict with that Act. Rather will it be an aid to giving effect to its provisions. For instance, at any time a question may arise as to whether a given area or a given class of plants or animals should be quarantined. Under such circumstances, to whom do we apply for assistance to-day ? To State officers. Now it is quite possible that there may be a conflict of opinion between the experts in the various States, just as there is to-day in connexion with the presence of Irish blight in potatoes. Only to-day the newspapers contained some very strong statements which evidence a want of unanimity upon that question on the part of the departmental experts in different States. In such circumstances it is possible that some central authority, owing allegiance only to the Federation, and freed largely from local prejudices, would enable the Commonwealth Government to speak with definiteness and fairness to all the States concerned. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend must see that it will help to solve it. At any rate I shall endeavour at a later stage to show him that it will do so. Whilst in this Parliament we have not been unmindful of agricultural interests, our minds have hitherto been more particularly directed to the manufacturing interests of Australia. This result - a very natural one - is largely due. to the necessity which confronted us in the early days of Federation, of framing a uniform Tariff for Australia. But we must not lose sight of the fact that in Australia agriculture is by' far the most important industry that we have to consider. In this connexion I would remind honorable senators that out of a total wealth production of ¬£167,000,000 in 1907, agriculture must be credited with ¬£101,000,000. Roughly speaking, therefore, two thirds of the wealth of the Commonwealth in that year was derived from industries which are classed as agricultural. Another way of determining the great importance of this industry is to ascertain the number of persons who are engaged in it. In 1907, I find that no less than 405.000 persons - I am ignoring all odd figures - were directly engaged in agricultural pursuits. That is the number of persons who were included in the census returns as being directly employed in agriculture. From the Federal Statistician I have ascertained that, allowing for the usual percentage which marks families, these figures mean that approximately 1,000,000 persons - or 25 per cent, of our population - are either engaged in or are dependent upon those who are engaged in agriculture. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot do so offhand. I have already given the Senate the value of the product from agricultural industries. To the 25 per cent, of our population who are either engaged in or are dependent upon those who are engaged in agricultural pursuits, must be added those who are engaged in businesses or trades which are associated with agriculture. There is an enormous number of persons who are indirectly dependent upon agriculture for their livelihood, but who are not so represented in our census returns. For instance, the teamster who carts wool from the sheep station is not represented as being dependent upon agriculture, nor. is the teamster who is engaged in the carrying of wheat. </para>

                            <para>- May I express the hope that for the few brief minutes during which I shall speak, King Charles' head may be kept out of this chamber? I would suggest to my honorable friends opposite that at the close of the present session they should hold a special session of their own, at which they will lie at liberty to talk land taxation, to their heart's content. I ask the Senate to consider for a moment what a tremendous gain to the agricultural industry in pounds, shillings and pence would be represented even by a slight percentage of improvement in the methods of cultivation - an improvement which might be effected by a single scientific discovery. If we effected a saving of a quarter or a half, per cent, in any line of production, the value to Australia would run into enormous figures which would far outweigh the cost to the Commonwealth of a staff of experts - presuming that their work was successful. </para>

In New South Wales until quite recently the Agricultural and Mines Departments were worked as one, and I know that in other directions there is overlapping in some of the other States to-day. I have said that the slightest improvement effected even in the breed of wheat or in a type of cattle would in the aggregate represent a very large profit to the agricultural industry.

                        <para>The body of available truth in regard to these matters is extremely small compared to what is imperfectly known or entirely unknown. The demand for food and clothing throughout the world is increasing faster than the ability to produce and distribute it. We must learn how to increase the production per unit of area and per unit of energy expended. We must make production more certain and decrease the cost. This involves introduction of new crops, their acclimatization, improvement of crops by breeding, control of diseases, improved culture methods, improved machinery, improved methods of marketing and utilization, &amp;c. It is to the interest of all the States and all the nations of the world that progress in all these directions be as rapid as possible. The development of sciences, arts, and education knows no political boundary, and no one was ever pauperized or injured by being assisted in these fields. </para>
                        <para class="block">That. I venture to suggest, is a proposition to which, at any rate in the abstract, everybody will assent. The necessity which modern conditions impose upon the farmer --and indeed upon everybody else - is to ask the most from science and to make the most of it. The object of the Bureau which it is intended to create under this Bill will be to lend the farmer all the aid which the results of patient investigation and experiment can place at his command. The old conception of farming is rapidly giving place to an entirely new one. Even now it is the practice to speak of the English farmer as " Hodge," a man of dull intellect and of very little capacity beyond that of looking after his agricultural pursuits. We all know that till quite recently in Great. Britain the terms " Hodge " and . " Clodhopper " were largely interchangeable. Going even further back there is that old quotation from' the <inline font-style="italic">Apocrypha</inline> which comes "to my mind in this connexion-" How can you expect wisdom from him whose talk is of bullocks?" </para>

                            <para>- That is another King Charles' head. One can quite understand the reasons underlying this conception of the farmer. Hitherto the mental power of the world appears to have been largely attracted to more sensational, if less useful, fields of labour than those of agriculture. One can easily understand a man who is possessed of brilliant mental powers being attracted by the possibilities of electricity rather than by the more prosaic task of making two blades of grass grow where only one grew formerly. One can readily understand such men being attracted by the problems of human life, by the explorations of human surgery, rather than the less attractive but nevertheless useful problems of soil culture. But despite these other attractions; agriculture has still much for which to thank science. Quietly, steadily, if unostentatiously, science has solved many problems to the immense advantage of agriculture to-day. adding much to the aggregate wealth of the world, and contributing not a little to the peace and happiness of those who are engaged in agriculture. What a vast difference there is between the thought that has been bestowed upon agriculture and that which has been bestowed upon other subjects. Every school boy is familiar with the names of those who are famous as scientific discoverers, explorers, or generals, but how few can recall the names of those who have done so much to solve the problems of agricultural chemistry? Still there are a few names with which we are all familiar in that connexion, and I am happy to think that Australia has already produced one whose name will have to be added to the list. I refer to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrer,</inline> a wheat-breeder of New South Wales, who by unostentatious but enthusiastic work developed new breeds which are entirely suitable for certain districts in that State. All these matters, I think, demonstrate that farming, in order to be successful, must make as big demands upon science, as great claims upon research, as does any other occupation. It is no longer the time when the mere capacity to handle a plough is sufficient. It is requisite that the farmer shall know the reason for the thing which he is doing, and that whenever a better method is discovered the knowledge shall be brought to him in order that, by its application, he may add to the product of his farm. Apart from the natural desire, there is a necessity upon us to render the labour of our farmers more productive, and that arises from the pressure of foreign competition, not on our own soil, but elsewhere in products as to which Tariffs cannot be of any assistance. Our wheat farmers have to face the competition of the cheapest labour in the world. The only way in which they can do that is by their efforts being so. directed that they will take from the soil the most of which it is capable, and as a result of the least possible effort. </para>

                            <para>- It would be equally competent for rae to add to my honorable friend's words " and cheap everything else," but I do not propose to do so, because that would open up a field of discussion which I do not desire to enter , at present. We have made magnificent strides in farming pure and simple. I venture to think for many years to come our wool will continue to take pride of place. It is interesting to note, however, that,  while the export of wool has increased by 70 per cent, in the last five years, the' increase being from 391,000,000 lbs. to 66,4,000,000 lbs., the export of wheat has increased by 250 per cent., the. increase being from 10,658,000 bushels to 36,956,000 bushels. These figures are the more remarkable from the fact that in 1897 Australia imported 3,641,000 bushels. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that it was. Certainly 1897 was not a year of abundance, but wheat was imported to that extent. Australia exported, in 1902, over 10,500,000 bushels, and in 1907 nearly 37.000,000 'bushels. Wheat production has increased magnificently. That is a result of which we may be justly proud, and which we hope is the forerunner of even greater expansion. </para>

                            <para>- The price of wheat did not rise because a larger volume was exported, but a larger volume was exported because the price had risen. In New South Wales a big stimulus was given to wheat production by the fact that simultaneously the price of wool fell and the price of wheat rose, with the result that men who had small holdings on which they had been able to make a living by wool-growing when the price of the article was high, suddenly found themselves unable to make a decent living. Therefore, they were under the necessity of more closely utilizing their ground, and at that very time it happened that the price of wheat rose. What occurred in New South Wales no doubt occurred in other States. To-day Australia produces only one-forty-second part of the world's crop of wheat, but it is producing two-elevenths of the world's clip of wool, so that we have a long way to go before our proportion of the world's wheat crop approaches our proportion of the world's wool clip. I hope that I am mistaken in interpreting the interjections of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as being hostile to the Bill, or as indicating that it is unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is not. I believe I am correct in stating that every Government of the Commonwealth has approved of the creation of a Bureau of Agriculture. The House of Representatives adopted, without division, a motion affirming the desirability of creating such a Department, Subsequent Governments indorsed that view, and even quite recently the Fisher Government, judging from the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> at Gympie, indicated an intention to create an Agricultural Bureau. In these circumstances, I hardly expect that any serious opposition will be offered to our proposition. The details of the Bill are, of course, matters for the consideration of honorable senators in Committee. I desire to point out what I regard as the most important work which will have to be intrusted to the Bureau when it is created. There should be no attempt to overlap or duplicate the work which is being carried on by the States. The most important work which the Federal Bureau will have to undertake will be that of original research. </para>

                            <para>- It can be avoided where that is desirable; but I am not at all certain that I would call it duplication. Queensland and New South Wales, for instance, are each carrying on some small experiments in dry farming.  I do not think that I would call that duplication. The work is of the same character ; but probably it is carried on under different conditions as to soil and climate. Let rae point out some of the problems which await solution. The sugar grub of Queensland is responsible for losses running, I believe, into many thousands of pounds every year. It may be asked at once, " Why should not the State Government turn its attention to the eradication of that pest?" All I can say is that it is not doing so; and the eradication of the grub is as serious a problem to-day as it ever has been, yet the problem is unsolved. Again, bitter pit in apples affects more than one State. It cannot be said that a single State has seriously addressed itself to the solving of the problems connected with that serious disease, which is involving our fruit-growers in annual losses running into enormous figures. </para>

                            <para>- The Bureau could not compel the growers to eradicate the disease ; but one of its first duties should be to carry out scientific investigations for the purpose of ascertaining how to prevent or cure it. That requires trained scientific men. It would mean field investigation and observation, and perhaps field experiments. </para>

I can think of no better term than that of "original research." It will be the business of these scientific men to investigate diseases, and ascertain the cause as well as the cure or prevention of them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that there will be any attempt, at any rate in the immediate future, to acquire land for that purpose, because a much more sensible course will be to carry on field experiments on State farms, and possibly by means of State officials, at any rate with the cooperation of the States. I cannot conceive for a moment that, in view of the existence of the splendid State farms, there will be any attempt to start a Federal farm. Irish blight is another disease which is troubling at least four States to-day : and I suppose that no spirit of prophecy is required to enable one to say that it will not be very long before it troubles Australia generally. </para>

                            <para>- What I am saying is not in any way a reflection upon the States and their officers. We must all recognise that the States have done excellent work within their limits. Some of the experts, as is well known to me, are men who are working from love of their science, and certainly not for the insignificant remuneration which, according to my estimate, they are receiving. But nevertheless it is true that many State officers are not  given those opportunities for original research which it is necessary that they should have if problems like this are to be solved. I know States where you will find highly scientific men in a Department  - pathologists or entomologists, for instance - but their time is taken up not with scientific study, but with office work. </para>

                            <para>- The resolution which I have quoted is at least as important as any of those to which the. honorable senator refers occasionally. 1 pass to other matters which, it seems to me, would invite the attention of an Agricultural Bureau. I have dealt with those affecting more particularly the cultivator. We have also- to contend with stock diseases. In spite of all that the States have done many of the problems associated with those diseases have not yet been solved. There are many diseases affecting stock which are still making a heavy toll upon stock-owners. They are subjects which ought to be investigated upon an Australian scale. I come now to two questions which, at first sight, appear to be rather at opposite poles', but which are, nevertheless, full of interest and really have something in common. I refer to the utilization of artesian water, and to the question of dry farming - the latter being a subject which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has made particularly his own. At the present moment there is the greatest conflict of evidence amongst those who venture to speak with authority as to when and how artesian water ought to be used for irrigation purposes. In my own State of New South Wales diametrically opposite opinions have been expressed, both by scientific experts and by those who have practical experience in the use of artesian waters. Here is a question which, it may be said, should be left to the States. But let me point out that the artesian water area does not stop at the boundary of any one State. In New South Wales we are supplied from the same underground basin as supplies the State of Queensland. Probably there is no one in Australia who can give an opinion worth having as to what extent these waters can be used - in other words, whether they should be regarded as exhaustible or inexhaustible. No State investigation would have any value in determining this problem. The Americans, recognising the great value of a thorough investigation of so great a source of national wealth, appointed, many years ago, an Underflow Commission, which was practically a permanent body. It was composed of scientific men and practical men, who might be supposed to know everything about the question, including surveyors, geologists, and those familiar with hydrography and various other kindred matters. </para>

                            <para>- I take the liberty of doubting that. The honorable senator will find that there is a wide difference of opinion on the subject. Those who have made the fullest investigation within the time at their disposal have been unable to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. There is at present the gravest doubt even as to where the intake area is situated. The American Commission carried out its investigations so fully that it was able to state with approximate accuracy what quantity of artesian water could be taken out of a given basin; and in certain cases, when bores have been sunk in a district, the Commission has been able to predict the quantity of water which would be obtained. They considered the extent of the outcropping rock through which the water is absorbed in the first instance ; then they determined the rainfall over the intake area; the quantity of water which the rock was capable of absorbing; the quantity which passed off by means of what may be called surface rivers; and so forth. Having obtained this information, they determined the rate at which the water would probably travel through the rock, and, having allowed for friction and ascertained the height, they were able to tell what quantity of water would come up when a bore was sunk at a lower level. So accurate have these observations been that in one particular district - I think it was the district of Denver - when the Commission's predictions were disregarded, the result noted was that, while the additional bores produced water they did so at the expense of the other bores at higher levels. That is to say the quantity of water yielded had not increased at all, but was simply distributed over a larger number of bores. This Commission determined the quantity of water in a given basin with such accuracy that it was able to say in certain instances that if additional bores were put down at lower levels the effect would simply be to rob those at higher levels ; and such proved to be the case. We in Australia have not the slightest information as to how far we can go on increasing the number of bores without risk. That is to say, we do not know how near <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> are to the margin of exhaustibility. I know that there has been a tendency in quite a number of cases in New South Wales for the flow of water to diminish, but whether that has been due to a fault in the sinking of the bores, or in some measure to the long period of drought which we had a few years ago, has not been determined. It may have been partly due to the multiplication of bores elsewhere. Certainly the matter is one of Australian importance, and the investigation which is necessary cannot be conducted by the authorities of any one State. </para>

But no person who has given even the most casual attention to the question can fail to know that dry farming is undoubtedly going to be of vast importance to us. It is a subject which so far the States have not done much to investigate. New South Wales has done a little; Queensland very little. Possibly other States are doing scarcely anything. We require methodical or systematic investigation. At present that which any of the States may be doing is not known to the rest. </para>

The State Departments can pursue their course as teachers within the States. But the Federal . Department could busy itself with the investigation of large scientific questions of Commonwealth concern. In a particular way, however, we might indicate, as the function of a Federal Department or Bureau of Agriculture, the higher and broader scientific work and the suggestions which the result of that work will make possible. </para>

                        <para>The number of subjects requiring investigation calls for a large number of specialists. It would be wasteful of public funds for each State to undertake independently to maintain such a staff of specialists as would be necessary to solve even all the important problems arising in farming. Many subjects can be investigated by a single man for the whole country. It is  therefore  in the interests of public economy for the National Department of Agriculture to carry on certain lines of investigation. </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth could with advantage confine its attention to research rather than administrative work. At present each of the States maintains a staff of experts to conduct research work. These experts included entomologists, vegetable pathologists, and veterinary officers, who were inquiring into many problems of vital importance to the producers of Australia. Among these problems were rust in wheat, bitter-pit in apples, and stock disease, for which no scientifically-based cure has yet been found. Were the Commonwealth to assume control of this work much good could be done. Instead of half-a-dozen States working for the same end along different lines with expensive staffs, the Commonwealth would be able to coordinate the work and secure for its advancement the very best scientific and practical experts that the world offered.

Pasteur's discoveries were said to have been worth to France alone 220 millions of money, and as a result of his investigations into disease of silkworms a waning industry had been re-established on a sound foundation. A vast saving would be effected in the Commonwealth if a remedy could be found for existing diseases, and he thought the field was one in which the energies of the Commonwealth might be given full scope. If the Commonwealth were not prepared to undertake the work, the question of co-ordinating research operations might well be taken into consideration by the States. </para>

                        <para>Since the disease is common in several of the States of the Commonwealth, and as it is not one that can be properly investigated by any single State, it would be the duty of a National Department of Agriculture to undertake it. But since there is no machinery at' present in existence for this purpose, I would strongly recommend that the different States particularly interested, viz. :-New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, should provide the necessary funds and appoint a skilled investigator who would devote his whole time to an experimental study of this serious disease both in the laboratory and in the orchard. Experiments could then be conducted in each State, and from the very nature of the disease, its investigation would require the co-operation of the leading growers in the respective States. Every possible factor which contributes to the growth of the tree and the formation of fruit would require to 'be dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- I have already apologized, thinking that I might have unduly occupied the time of the Senate. Perhaps I attach undue importance to the question, but I regard agriculture as being what it undoubtedly is, the main source of our national wealth. The slightest thing we can do to help it, though it may be poor and small so far as the individual is concerned, must in the aggregate be of very great advantage indeed. I approach the completion of my remarks, but I should like to remind honorable senators that whatever the various States of Australia may be doing, we are very far behind the efforts made in other countries to grapple scientifically with the problems confronting the ' agriculturist. I admit that the countries to which I refer have larger populations than we have in Australia. From the latest report I find that the United States appropriates, roughly, ¬£1,500,000 a year towards the up-keep of the Federal Agricultural Bureau. In addition, the several States have separate Departments, and one or more experimental stations. Canada appropriated in the last year for which figures are available the sum of ¬£181,500 for her Bureau. Great Britain is always slow to move in matters of this kind, but she has been taking action in this matter for some few years, and through the Royal Society and by other means is doing something to stimulate scientific investigation for the assistance of the farmer. Honorable senators may remember that an industrial Commission sat in the United States in 1902. I find that that Commission reported as follows : - </para>

                        <para class="block"> The production of raw material from the surface of the earth is the sphere in which the Department of Agriculture has hitherto achieved such noticeable results. Of all the Executive Departments, there is no other, not even the Post Office, which comes into more direct and beneficent contact with the daily life of the public than the Department of Agriculture, and none whose yield of practical benefits is greater in proportion to the public money expended. But great as its services have been in the past,1 the Department of Agriculture has a still larger field of usefulness ahead. It has been dealing with, growing crops. It must hereafter deal with living men. Hitherto agricultural research, instruction, and agitation,  have  been directed almost exclusively towards the production of wealth from the soil. It  is  time to adopt, in addition, a new point of view. Hereafter, another great class before the National Department of Agriculture, and the similar agencies of the various States, must be to foster agriculture for its social results,  or,  in other words, to assist in  bringing  about the best kind of life on the farm for the sake of producing the best kind of men. </para>

                    <para>That quotation opens up another train of thought. One of the most frequently heard lamentations is that the tendency of the people is towards the cities - that they desire to abandon country life and to crowd our thickly-populated centres. I do not regard that tendency as such a great evil as do many of my honorable friends. But the closing sentences of  President  Roosevelt's utterance point to the necessity - if we wish to attract people to country life- of offering them such facilities for carrying on farming operations as will relieve the farm of its former drudgery, and dispel all doubt as to its profitableness. </para>

I have endeavoured to point out - perhaps at excessive length - the great importance of agriculture to the wealth production of the country. I have attempted to show that there is a field of usefulness awaiting those who will be connected with the new Department which it is proposed to create. That field will be largely in the direction of scientific investigation of methods of cultivation, and of those diseases which levy such heavy toll on the various forms of agricultural production in Australia. With regard to the extent of the Bureau's operations, that must be left entirely to Parliament when it is asked to deal with the appropriation. </para>

                            <para>- No; because I can always appeal to my honorable friend. So far as I understand Socialism, it seeks to suppress private enterprise. If any proposed State action were intended to produce that result, my honorable friend would be justified in terming it Socialism. But State action which is undertaken for the purpose of fostering and of furthering private enterprise, cannot be called Socialism. </para>

                            <para>- It has experimental stations throughout the States, in addition to which the States themselves have experimental stations. It has been suggested that there is nothing in this Bill - that it is a mere placard. I do not know why it should be considered a placard, seeing that clause 2 affirms that there shall be a Bureau of Agriculture established. By that provision Parliament is asked to direct that such a Department shall be created. The clause then sets out what will foe the duties of the Department. Surely the measure cannot be considered a placard when Ministers seek Parliamentary authority for the creation of this Department ! That is the sole purpose of the Bill. If that authority be granted, it will be the duty of the Minister of Home Affairs to devise a scheme of organization and to submit it for Parliamentary approval. The proper time at which to discuss the cost of its establishment will be either when the main or supplementary estimates are under consideration. If honorable senators are at all apprehensive as to the cost that will be involved in the establishment of this Department, I would suggest to them that that is a matter for subsequent consideration. The one point which we now have to consider is, whether there will be, under the proposed Bureau, a useful field of work to be exploited by Federal officers for Australia - work which is not now being fully performed by State agencies. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is 'a small measure, the consideration of which ought not to occupy many minutes. Its purpose is to bring the Act which at present regulates the taking of a referendum into conformity with the Electoral Act as it was recently amended by this Chamber. The principal amendments made in the electoral law by the Senate were designed to simplify the procedure adopted in dealing with postal votes and with cer- ' tificates which are attached to them. Under the principal Act a separate certificate must be issued with each postal ballot-paper, both for the Senate and the House of Representatives. The new procedure provides that one certificate may be employed in both cases. It is now proposed to make that one certificate equally applicable, not only to elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate, but also to a referendum. The whole of these amendments are mere matters of form. They involve no principle. Indeed, they may be said to be consequential upon the amendments made in the principal Electoral Act. One class of them may be illustrated by the amendments coming under the heading of " Miscellaneous." There it will be seen that we have embodied in this Bill provision for the authentication of ballot-papers similar to that which has already been approved in our Electoral Act. In the Electoral Bill which was recently before this Chamber, we provided that the ballot-papers should be printed on specially water-marked paper, and this Bill provides for the use of similar paper in the taking of a referendum. All the amendments, I repeat, are* merely intended to bring the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act into conformity with the Electoral Bill which was passed by the Senate only a few weeks ago. </para>

                        <para>- -I regret that the Government have net taken into account the unnecessary expense which is involved in the enactment of this measure at the present time. It has been urged by various speakers that the main cause for the creation of an InterState Commission has entirely disappeared. In other words, there is no rivalry between the States in regard to railway freights, and therefore there is no longer any difficulty in that regard to be coped with. Only a few years ago some members of the present Ministry committed themselves to an entirely opposite course of action. At the Hobart Conference in  1905,  when the Reid-McLean Ministry was in office, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson submitted the following motion :  - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That it is desirable that the State Governments should themselves abandon all preferential or differential rates which would be abolished by an Inter-State Commission, and so save the expense of the appointment and maintenance of such a Commission. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That was a very sensible course to propose, piovided, of course, that the heads of the railway systems would come to a commonsense understanding to abolish the differential railway rates which had occasioned so much trouble. The State Premiers agreed to the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomson,</inline> and the result was that, with the exception of Queensland, the Railways Commissioners, in obedience to the decision of their respective Premiers, abandoned differential or preferential rates. In these circumstances, I feel that there is no justification for the introduction of this Bill in its present form. But if we take the case of Western Australia we find that there is very good reason for the institution of a tribunal of this kind. That State, which has no railway communication, is entirely dependent upon the InterState shipping companies for the carriage of goods to and from the eastern States. Possessing a complete monopoly of the carrying trade, those companies are improving the shining hour, and compelling the residents of Western Australia to pay higher fares and freight than they should do. Of course the companies are kept in reasonable check by the railway systems of the eastern States. Recently I had occasion to inquire whai rates were charged by the Shipping Combine, and the manager of the Austral Otis Company told me that the rates from Melbourne to Broken Hill were cheaper by railway than by water and railway. He obtained a contract from a Broken Hill mining company for the supply of fifty concentrating tables. But when he set about executing it he found that the Inter-State shipping companies charged exactly the same rate. He then proceeded to find out what it would cost to send the fifty concentrating tables by railway from Melbourne to Broken Hill, and he discovered that he would save at least¬£200 by using railway instead of water and land carriage. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly, and that is what accounts for the difference in cost. Western Australia is in an unenviable position owing to the fact that it is dependent upon the shipping companies for the carriage of passengers and goods to and from the eastern States. Since there is no railway to act as a corrective we are very much at their mercy. When the manager of the Austral Otis Company found that he could save¬£200 by sending fifty concentrating tables by railway to Broken Hill, that fact enabled him to carry out the contract. If, however, he had had to send the tables to Western Australia, he would have had either to submit to the rates of the Shipping Combine or not to fulfil the contract. What I have stated can be verified on application to him. From that incident alone it can be seen that the people of Western Australia are suffering a manifest injustice. In view of the fact that Western Australia is severely handicapped by the high rates which are levied by the InterState shipping companies, I had hoped that its people would obtain some relief from a measure of this kind. But, although I find that it embodies a method for adjusting unfair competition between the several States, I am forced to the conclusion that I must forfeit that possible advantage to my State in order to prevent the creation of a tribunal which, as regards the removal of unfair competition, will prove abortive. -I refer to Part V. of the Bill, which is supposed to settle unfair competition among the several States, and which, in my opinion, can only lead to disaster. This can in no sense be a workable measure. It can only lead people to entertain false hopes regarding its workableness, and the good effects which should flow from its enactment. I regret that on this occasion, as on others, the Prime Minister has fallen so far from grace as to turn his back upon professions which he made quite recently on this important subject. In other circumstances, he proclaimed his firm belief in an entirely different method for putting an end to unfair competition among the States.. But he is now differently circumstanced, and he comes along with a lame, halting, abortive measure, which will cause endless expense to the workers, and, perhaps, not suppl) the remedy which they are looking for. </para>

They are proposing to take this action, and are at the same time depending upon the States to give them the necessary authority. I ask any honorable senator, is it right that this Parliament, being in a position to legislate, should ask the States for leave to do so? I feel satisfied that if it is ever tested, this measure as it stands will be found to be inoperative. </para>

                    <para>-- I move - That, in view of the ineffective means employed for disseminating the forecasts of the Meteorological Department throughout the Commonwealth and the imperative need for' reaching the isolated seamen, fishermen, orchardists, farmers, and others engaged in the primary industries with immediate intelligence of changes in the weather, the Senate is of opinion that the Post and Telegraph Department should be modernized without delay, so as to destroy or minimize the disadvantage of distance, and place those persons distantly situated on the same footing in this regard as those more conveniently located. " </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">This motion simply means that, in my opinion, the Senate should consider the nature of the services performed by the Post and Telegraph Department in distributing the weather forecasts of the Meteorological Department. I have 110 fault to find with the way in which our meteorological forecasts are obtained, or with the organization of the Department. I think it is conducted in a most competent way, and gives full value for the ¬£15,000 or thereabouts that is annually spent upon it. Whilst I am prepared to acknowledge the value of the forecasts issued by "this  Department, I wish to direct attention to the way in which they are conveyed to the people. I presume that this Parliament would not have been eager to establish a Meteorological Department merely in order to advance the science of meteorology. If there had not been a general desire that the people of the Commonwealth should have the benefit of the latest and most accurate anticipations of weather changes, it is not likely that the Department would have been established. It will be admitted that there was not sufficient justification for the establishment  of  such a Department for purely scientific purposes. It is because I feel that, under existing conditions, it is not possible to make the fullest use of the work of the Department throughout the Commonwealth that I submit my motion. From Cape York, in North Queensland, to Wilson's Promontory, and round to Broome, in, Western Australia, the Meteorological Department collects data ; and in the circumstances, it is absurd that the distribution of the information so obtained should be as circumscribed as it is. Our weather reports are readily accessible to the residents of populous centres. They always get first hand information, whilst those engaged in the arduous work of earning a livelihood on the outer fringes of civilization are overlooked. Although it may not be possible for us to reach them with the very latest information published by the Meteorological Department, it is certainly our duty to do what we can to remove the obstacles which at the present time prevent them from getting information from which they might profit. The residents of populous centres have  only  to look at the weather charts published in the daily papers each morning to learn what kind of weather they may expect during the next twenty -four hours. The farmer, the orchardist, and the man engaged in raising stock can make his arrangements accordingly. Those engaged in the shipping and fishing industries can adjust their movements in the same way. But people engaged in similar occupations in remote districts beyond the range of the telegraph and telephone, are left to the mercy of chance, and do not share in the benefits derived by others from the work of the Meteorological Department. Let me say that the Department is not established for the benefit of persons who wish to take part in picnics, but in order that valuable information might be given to people engaged in the industries of the country, and in producing its wealth. </para>

                        <para>- I do not object to the picnicker making use of information published by the Meteorological Department. What I am saying is that the information is most readily accessible to those who are unable to turn such intelligence to the best account. Assuming that the Department has been established chiefly for the benefit of the people of this country who are engaged in pursuits in connexion with which the knowledge of weather conditions is most necessary, it is our duty to see that any obstacles which prevent them from acquiring that knowledge should be removed. Honorable senators will find, in my motion, a reference to sailors and fishermen, and some persons may be inclined to ask why we should be concerned about the needs of isolated seamen. I should like to say that, along our 8,000 miles of coast-line, there are many men engaged in the transport of produce from one port to another in small crafts of which they are themselves the owners, captains, and crews. The same thing applies to the fishing industry generally, and to the pearling industry of Torres Straits, and of the north-west coast of Western Australia. I can give honorable senators an example of the way in which weather forecasts are published at the present time. If the Meteorological Bureau anticipates a storm, for instance, in Torres Straits, information of the forecast is wired to the principal station, say, at Thursday Island, or to some less important telegraph station, and is posted outside the office. Fishermen out in their boats are not made aware of the notices posted outside the telegraph office, and have no knowledge of the forecasts. </para>

                        <para>- By semaphore, or some form of signal. On the coast of New South Wales there is a great number of inlets and bays in which fishermen are engaged for days together, and I am given to understand that so far as a knowledge of anticipated weather conditions is con'cerned they are left to the mercy of chance. They may be able to reach shelter before the approach of a storm or may have to endure its rigours. Whilst it is important that those engaged in seafaring occupations should be supplied with information as to the probable changes of weather during each twenty-four hours, the information is of equal importance to those engaged in industries on land.- Here again we find the Post and Telegraph Department very inefficient in the distribution of this very useful intelligence. There are many industries in this State, the persons engaged in which might be greatly benefited by an early knowledge of probable weather changes within the approaching twenty-four hours. I venture to say at the same time that there are persons resident in large districts of the Commonwealth who take no interest in the Meteorological Department. They derive no benefit from its forecasts, because they do not reach them in the newspapers until the periods which they cover have passed. It will be admitted that a knowledge of weather conditions is of the utmost importance to the farmer in carrying on his operations. If he is about to plough his land and is informed that  wet weather is approaching he can arrange his work so as to take full advantage of the information given him. </para>

                        <para>- I am informed that they are. I do not attach so much importance to the operation of ploughing as to the operations of seeding and harvesting. When seeding time arrives it is most necessary that the farmer should know what the weather conditions are likely to be, and he is seriously handicapped in his operations if he is left without this information. The same remarks apply to the operations of the orchardists. The successful planting and growing of the fruit trees and the picking of various varieties of fruit, such as peaches, apricots, oranges and lemons, depend very largely upon weather conditions, and it is qf the first importance to the orchardist to know what those conditions are likely to be. Those engaged in stock raising are equally concerned in securing this information. Early knowledge of approaching wet weather would enable the pastoralists to avoid the difficulty of shearing wet sheep, and the information might be availed of to avoid the loss of numbers of stock which might but for it be turned out in cold and wet weather. This information would be of corresponding value in connexion with every industry in the whole field of primary production. Knowledge of such forecasts would be especially valuable at harvesting time. Honorable senators will agree that it is of vital importance that men should be made aware of the probable weather conditions at such a time. The absence of such knowledge might render it. impossible for them to save the results of a whole year's labour. ' To show the extent to which this branch of science is availed of in the United States I may inform honorable senators that newspapers published in that country are full of eulogies of the benefits conferred by the Meteorological Department of the United States. I quote the following from an Orleans newspaper in connexion with a prediction by the United States Weather Bureau of cold weather - </para>

                    <para>While the temperature has been below freezing point in the sugar and trucking region of New Orleans several times this season, the freezing mark was registered at New Orleans yesterday morning. Timely warnings were scattered, broadcast by the weather bureau  stating  that planters and the public should be prepared for temperatures of 24 deg. to 28 deg. in the sugar region and 30 deg. at New Orleans. The prediction was fully verified. Farming interests consider the warnings of incalculable value, and they do not complain if a prediction sometimes falls short. So accurate and definite have the warnings become that no planting interest in the State has suffered from weather conditions if the warnings are believed and action taken to prevent loss and damage. </para>

                <para class="block">That quotation evidences that at least in the opinion of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> the Meteorological Department is greatly hampered in its operations, and that great obstacles are placed in the way of distributing very valuable news in regard to the weather to those who stand most in need of it. Regarding the necessity which exists for taking action, honorable senators will doubtless recollect that the Vice-President of the Executive 'Council to-day stated that the Meteorological Department has a means of disseminating the intelligence in its possession regarding the weather. I find that that news is limited to 314 stations throughout the Commonwealth. It is despatched to eighty-five centres in New South Wales, to twenty-eight in Victoria, to thirty-five in Queensland, to 150 in South Australia, to thirteen in Western Australia, and to three in Tasmania . From this list it would certainly seem; that there is something radically wrong with the management of our Postal Department in the different States. The fact that information as to the weather is transmitted <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> 150 points in South Australia, whereas it is forwarded to only thirteen centres in Western Australia calls for some explanation. Tasmania is in a very much worse position. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. At any rate, there is great room for improvement. Compare what is being done in Australia with what is being done in the United States, and how poor do our efforts in this direction seem. In the United States in 1905 the warnings issued at Government expense by the Meteorological Department were as follow : - Forecasts and special warnings, 2,158; special warnings, 973; emergency warnings, 6,152; or a total of 9,283.. But these figures do not represent all that is being done in this connexion. Another method adopted for distributing the intelligence gained by the Weather Bureau is that of voluntary effort. The messages disseminated by this means far outnumber those which are transmitted at the expense of the Government. I suggest that we might with advantage copy the example of the United States in this connexion by the Postal Department undertaking to disseminate information gained from the Meteorological Department over a far larger area than it has hitherto done. In America during 1905 no less than 77,774 messages relating to the weather were distributed by mail, 75,602 by rural delivery, 464,738 by telephone, 2,443 by railway telegraph, and 2,423 by train service. So that the total warnings issued by the Meteorological Department in the United States during that year numbered 9,283 at Government expense, as against 622,980 by voluntary effort. I recognise that a great improvement might be effected in existing conditions by the free use of the telephone. The reply given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council this afternoon shows that the regulations prevent the use of the telephone for the distribution of meteorological information, whereas in America that instrument was in one year . responsible for the distribution of  464,738  messages free of charge. Why cannot the same system be adopted here? Similarly our rural carriers of mails might well be called upon to distribute weather warnings throughout the districts embraced within their circuits. In the United States no less than  75,602  warnings were distributed by this means during  1905. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. They -do so free of cost. Seeing that the telephone and the mail-carriers are there used so largely to convey this vital intelligence to the people, I want to know why a similar system cannot be adopted here? I have no need to invite the sympathy of honorable senators for those who are resident in the outlying portions of Australia,- and whose entire savings may depend upon a knowledge of the weather conditions which are likely to prevail during the next twenty four hours. The States, too, might be asked to co-operate with the Commonwealth in this matter by making use of the railway telegraphs, and also by exhibiting flags upon the trains as they pass through the country. In America the trains carry flags to indicate the state of the weather, and thus settlers along the lines are placed in . possession of! information of great value to them. But before we can ask the States to assist us in this matter we must assist ourselves. ; My motion seeks to insure that those who are beyond the range of the telegraph shall have the advantage of the telephone and mail-carrier, and shall at least receive some of the benefit which is bestowed upon persons who are resident in large centres. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is mistaken. No one in the United States has claimed that as regards the conveyance of this information the Department has ever been able to place persons distantly situated on the same footing as those more conveniently located. If the honorable senator means by his motion that the Post and Telegraph Department might make better use of its opportunities than it does that would be one thing, but he is asking the Senate to say that the Department should go to the extreme extent of carrying this information to isolated seamen, and remote settlers, in fact that it should place those persons in the same position as persons more conveniently situated. It is absolutely impossible to do that for two reasons; first because the Telephone Department would break down with the strain of the work, and secondly because of the cost which would be involved to the people of the Commonwealth. If the honorable senator means by his motion that greater use should be made of the Department # for disseminating news that is one proposition, but it is entirely different from that which he has submitted, namely, that wherever there is an isolated settler, no matter at what cost or under what circumstances, he should be supplied with meteorological information. Are we prepared to do that? Let us take the telephones to which the honorable senator has referred. Does he mean that every morning the Telephone Department is to forward to every subscriber in Australia a weather forecast? </para>

The terms which my honorable friend has used are too comprehensive. If he had merely proposed that where there are no telegraph stations public telephone stations might for the purpose of weather forecasts be made use of, that would have been a proposition to which I would have felt inclined to assent. But to suggest that all telephone subscribers are to have forced upon them weather forecasts is to suggest something which is utterly impracticable. As it is our telephone system is pretty heavily charged. A great many persons allege that the Department is not able to grapple with the volume of business with which it is called upon to deal. I do not know what is going to happen if in addition every subscriber is to have sent along his wire a message telling him news about weather which does not concern him. </para>

There are many things which are desirable; there are many things which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would like ; there are many things which I would like ; but it is not possible or profitable to get them. What my honorable friend proposes is one of those things. Nothing which we can do can place a settler who is living out back, it may be 15 or 20 miles from a telephone or telegraph station, on an equality with a man who happens to be living within the precincts of a town possessing both those advantages. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> desires to spread this news over as wide a radius as is possible, I sympathize with him. I would suggest to him that after this discussion he might withdraw the motion, and allow me to bring under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs, who controls the Meteorological Department, and of the Postmaster-General, the question as to whether or not a simple scheme cannot be devised for adding to the facilities already afforded to the public in relation to this matter. </para>

My experience of the back-country mailman is that he travels at the rate of 5 or 5^ miles an hour. Now, any decent, self-respecting Australian storm will give that man a few hours' start, and beat him easily before sundown. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing is done without cost to some one. I gathered from my honorable friend's remarks that in America private railways undertake the transmission of this news. The mere fact that it is not charged for does not show that it involves no cost. We are not at the present moment in the position of America. My honorable friend must recognise that, on the whole, the people of Australia are a more scattered community than are the people of the United States. He shakes his head, but that fact is easily to be seen by comparing the acreage and population of the two countries. I have every sympathy, I repeat, with my honorable friend if his desire is simply to obtain an expression of opinion that we should, as far as possible, increase the facilities afforded by the Post Office for spreading this information. But when he asks me to subscribe to such a wide motion as this, he asks me to do more than I can do, even with the most sincere desire in the world to assist those in the interior districts, who certainly have some claim upon our sympathy in this regard. </para>

                    <para>. - I have always felt that the Post and Telegraph Department was a good deal lacking in that broad, human sympathy which it might have with the affairs of Australia. I have had some personal experience in this matter. When, some few years ago, a considerable part of New South Wales was devastated by bush fires, we were in daily dread of receiving news of some new district being devastated. I suggested to the Secretary of the Post and Telegraph Department that some system might be arranged for sending news to surrounding districts when a fire broke out, but his reply was very decisive ; it was to the effect that no messages could be sent unless they were first paid for. I thought, that was dealing in a very poor spirit with a big subject. No doubt honorable senators will remember that our meteorological service had to be fought for. Soon after the Post and Telegraph Department was transferred - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> was Postmaster-General at the time - it was proposed that no meteorological news should be sent anywhere except on payment, and quite a public agitation had to be got up in order to obtain even the service that exists to-day. I have great sympathy with the suggestions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> At the same time I think we must all recognise that his motion goes a little too far. I suggest that he should accept either the proposal of the Vice-President of the Executive Council or the following amendment, which I now move - </para>

                    (Western Australia) (8.43]. - I desire to correct the Minister's statement that the first part of my motion is a reflection upon the Meteorological Department. It is nothing of the kind. At the beginning of my speech I took care to say that I had every reason to be satisfied with the Department, but its work does not stop at the making of forecasts or the getting of news as to weather conditions in different places. Its work takes in the field of meteorology generally, but does not include the sending of messages throughout the "Commonwealth. It is with the inadequate dissemination of meteorological intelligence that I find fault.

                        <para>- The Meteorological Department cannot possibly be responsible, if the Post and Telegraph Department is so obstinate as to withhold the means for distributing the intelligence. If the Minister is right, it simply means that the Meteorological Department is in charge of the Post and Telegraph Department, but as a matter of fact the two Departments are administered quite separately. I do not expect that the motion, if carried, will be observed literally by the Government. The Minister made a lot of capital out of a few concluding words in my motion, but I was careful to point out that it was impossible to extend the same facilities to the distant settlers as to the persons close to centres of population. It was never 'suggested by me or contemplated by the motion, that special messages should be sent to every person, no matter where he happened to be. As regards the amendment, I think that it is altogether too mild. I believe that the Senate should express the opinion that the Post and Telegraph Department should exert itself in the matter of conveying meteorological intelligence, which is so necessary and vital to the prosperity of a large number of persons in the Commonwealth. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council referred to the United States this afternoon, and if he was justified in quoting what has been done in that country in support of the establishment of a Federal Agricultural Bureau, there should be no objection to my quoting what has been done in the United States in connexion with the means adopted for the distribution of weather forecasts. </para>

            </quote>
            <para>In asking the Senate to assent to the second reading of this measure, I point out, in the first instance, that if ever Australia is to contain a consolidated people, the administration of its criminal laws should have the same elements of agreement as has the administration of its civil laws. While the Constitution provides for equality of action in respect of appeals in civil cases, there is probably in the whole world no community in which there is such a. wide divergence in connexion with the higher administration of the criminal law as is to be found in Australia. It is for this reason I venture to ask' consideration of the question of amending, or rather extending the Constitution by the addition of a sub-section to section 73, which, as honorable senators are aware, regulates the question of all High Court appeals. Honorable senators will remember that, some two years ago, I introduced a measure seeking the adoption in the Commonwealth of the provisions of a Bill, providing for a Court of Criminal Appeal, which was at that time before the British Parliament. I may be challenged that I have done nothing in this matter for some length of time, and that I have apparently dropped the subject. Let me say that I became acquainted with the judgment of the High Court in the case <inline font-style="italic">Musgrove</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">McDonald.</inline> Not being a lawyer, I do not profess to be <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with all the cases that come on in the Law Courts, and I overlooked this judgment which, I believe, was given before I introduced the Bill two years ago. </para>

                    <para>- It is quite possible. As my honorable and learned friend's reply was devoted almost exclusively to a consideration of the law of Victoria, I may be excused if I did not remember the incident. When I introduced my Bill two years ago, I was not acquainted with that judgment. Had I been acquainted with it, I should not have introduced that measure. I do not, of course, for an instant suggest that there could be any possibility of misapprehension on the part of the High Court. Stilt reading the sections of the Constitution, and, I think, section 35 of the Judiciary Act, as a layman, I not unnaturally came to the conclusion that it was possible to amend the law without an alteration of the Constitution. Indeed, that  1  had some justification for thinking so, is shown by the judgment of the High Court itself in this particular matter. I shall read one paragraph from the judgment in <inline font-style="italic">Mnsgrove</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">McDonald,</inline> which will show very clearly that the matter is not without some element of doubt, or, at least, of disputation. This is a paragraph from the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, Chief Justice of the High Court- </para>

            <para>We think that the fair result of all these cases is, that it was the settled rule of the Judicial Committee, that an appeal did not lie to the Sovereign-in-Council, from the verdict of a jury, or from a judgment of the Court founded upon it unless there had been a previous application to the Supreme Court for a new trial, and we think that the provisions of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, conferring appellate jurisdiction upon the High Court should be read in the light of this rule, and that if they are so read, an application for a new trial after verdict, upon whatever ground, does not fall within the words " appeals from all judgments decrees orders and sentences" of Federal Courts or Supreme Courts. </para>

                    <para>- Honorable senators will, no doubt, recognise that the words "Appeals from all judgments decrees orders and. sentences " are taken from the Constitution. It is quite clear, from the phraseology of that judgment, that there had been considerable argument, and that many cases had been cited <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">con;</inline> and if lawyers differed over the matter, it is not unreasonable that a layman like myself, who had not read this judgment, should have been so much in doubt as to think it was possible to amend the law without amending the Constitution. However, in the light of that judgment, I have to ask the consideration of the Senate for this Bill. It proposes the addition of a sub-section which would enable the establishment of a Court of Criminal Appeal, and enable criminal verdicts and sentences in the Courts of the States to be considered on appeal direct from the Courts of trial; and not through the Supreme Courts of the States. It may be asked why we should attempt to provide for appeals from Courts of trial direct to the High Court, instead of permitting those appeals to go through the Supreme Courts of the States. This reason is very clear. The Commonwealth cannot pass laws to provide for the -administration of justiceper <inline font-style="italic">se</inline> in the States. But by an alteration of the Constitution, we could provide for appeals from sentences and verdicts in the Courts of trial. </para>

                    <para>- I have frequently found that learned gentlemen are very apt to presume upon their legal position to make statements in a gathering of laymen that they would probably not make in a gathering of lawyers. Before proceeding much further I shall. give the Senate the exact legal definition of the terms "indictment," " presentment," " information," and " inquisition," and I do not think that it will be found that they include appeals from the decisions of Justices. But the point which I now desire to make is that, as the laws of the different States are exceedingly diverse- </para>

                    <para>- There is so great a diversity of method between the laws governing appeals in criminal cases that it is not possible for the High Court to receive appeals from verdicts and sentences except through the Supreme Courts of the States, and, as the laws of the States with the exception of New South Wales do not provide for such appeals in criminal cases, it seems inevitable that we must first amend the Constitution, so that these appeals may be made. There has been placed upon the files of honorable senators to-day a statement connected with this Bill to which I would direct special attention. It is 0 memorandum explanatory of the content? and objects of the Bill. Annexure No. 1 is the Bill which it is desired to pass into law should the necessary amendment of the Constitution be adopted'.

                    <para>- I am not dealing with that question at the present time. In every State but one it will be found that every criminal appeal possible in Australia is subject to the discretion of the Judge presiding at the trial of the appellant. Before concluding my remarks on this subject I shall refer to some of the speeches delivered by the law lords of England, who have shown that the discretion of Judges - most worthily exercised - has been most unfortunately exercised. In one case a Royal Commission had to do justice where a Judge had exercised his discretion, most unfortunately. I wish to draw attention to this most transparent proposition ; that nobody believes in the infallibility of Judges and juries in civil cases. Therefore, there is no reason to suppose infallibility in the same functionaries in criminal cases. To assume infallibility in the administration of justice in civil cases would mean that there would be no new trials. </para>

It is one that has some strange applications, because, whilst it is not in order to refer to an honorable senator's profession, the fact of the legal member being customarily addressed as "learned" sufficiently indicates his profession. However, I shall obey your ruling and the rule of Parliament. Not only are the laws of the States in respect of criminal appeals extremely divergent, but some of them are extremely antiquated. They date back even to thirty-three years ago. Will it be believed that in these times of progress, of legal reform and efforts to benefit all classes by legislative enactment, there is in one State no law regulating any matter connected with criminal appeals which is not thirty-three years old? In New South Wales the Crimes Act of 1900, section 428, provides - </para>

                <para class="block">Now I would ask the attention of honorable senators to the' fact that under that section there is no right to a re-hearing. The matter rests with the Governor in the exercise of his discretion, and we all know that in criminal matters Australian Governors act only upon the advice of their responsible Ministers. Therefore, there is no possibility of a legal appeal - no right to a re-hearing. But the Government of the day may - not in open Court with all the world to hear, but in the Cabinet room with the door locked - authorize an inquiry into the conviction of any person. By whom? Not at the hands of the High Court Bench, or of the Supreme Court Bench, or of a Judge of the status of the individual who tried the case, but at the hands of a justice of the peace. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has stated that my Bill provides for the consideration of appeals from the convictions of magistrates. I shall discuss that question later on. . The only method provided by any State for doing justice in the case of a mistaken verdict is that which is provided by New South Wales, and there the inquiry is supposed to be conducted by an ordinary unpaid magistrate. I do not know that any such inquiry has been conducted in that State by a member of the unpaid magistracy. The plan which is usually adopted is to appoint a District Court Judge - whose position is analogous to that of a Judge of the County Court in Victoria - a magistrate to investigate the matter. He undertakes the task, not as a barrister, not as a Judge, but simply in the capacity of an unpaid magistrate. </para>

I have sought to provide that the Criminal Court of Appeal shall sit at the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth, or, as in the case of the British law, at any place which the Chief Justice may appoint. That would, of course, serve the convenience of the Judges in the discharge of their important duties. Coming to . Victoria, the Crimes Act of 1890 contains this provision. - </para>

I cannot conceive of the possibility of such a process being effective, except in very rare instances. Section 485 has this provision -   and the Full Court may make the same absolute or discharge it with or without costs as it may think proper; and the Judge upon being served with any such rule or order absolute shall reserve such question of law accordingly for the opinion of the Full Court; and . thereupon the procedure defined by the four preceding sections shall become applicable as if such Judge had consented to reserve such question of law on the trial. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, there is 1.0 appeal on questions of fact. Western Australia, like Queensland, is more liberal than most of the States in that an application for the consideration of any point of law may be made after judgment. If an application was refused by the Judge before the verdict was given an appeal may be made to the Full Court to set aside his refusal. ' In these circumstances the. Full Court would consider the case. The Act contains a provision with regard to the appellant remaining in gaol while his case is being heard, or being let out on a recognisance. In Tasmania the Criminal Law Procedure Act of 1881 - twenty-eight years ago ! - contains this provision - </para>

                <para class="block">I have not gone into these provisions very fully, because every honorable senator will find a copy of them on his file. That will save a good deal of trouble, because it is not an easy matter to get this information together. It will also, I hope, save a good deal of unnecessary statement regarding the laws of the different States. I know from past experience that some honorable senators, relying on their memories, have occupied the time of the Chamber in stating not quite accurately the provisions of State laws. But as every honorable senator has now a copy of the provisions of the State laws it will always be easy for him to turn up the details. The citation of the number of the sections of the Acts will enable him to see whether anything of importance has been omitted by me in the epitome. With regard to such phrases as indictment, presentment, information, or inquisition, I propose to quote some extracts from the highest legal authorities of the Empire as to the meaning of those phrases. That will perhaps be the means of saving time. </para>

I presume that the  Speaker  of the House of Commons would decline to count the House only when he believed that attention was being called to the want of a quorum for the purpose not so much of insuring the attendance of honorable members in the Chamber, as to cause obstruction, or, possibly to get rid of a measure under discussion at the time, if by any chance the full number of members required to form a quorum could not be induced to attend. It should, however, be noticed that in our Constitution we have a provision with regard to the number of senators who shall be present in order to form a quorum. </para>

                <para>On 5th January, 1640, " Forty maketh House of Commons." Gaudy's Notes of the Long Parliament. " Awhile we had a less number present (in the Grand Committee on subsidies) than forty, which we account by the orders of the House, to be the least number present at a Grand Committee." From an -entry 20th April, 1607, it would appear that sixty was not then a sufficient number. A motion was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pierrepoint,</inline> 18th March, 1801, being the first Parliament of the United Kingdom. " That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> do not take the chair until at least sixty members are present in the House," but negatived. In both Houses of Congress and the greater part of the State Legislatures of the United States a majority of the House forms a quorum. This rule, which dates from the year 1640, is only one of usage, and may be altered at pleasure. </para>

                <para>The rule was suspended by order of the House, 1st March, 1793, for the purpose of receiving messages from the Lords relating to  proceedings on the trial of Warren Hastings, and such messages were received when even one member only was present. </para>
                <para class="block">So that it would appear that the number required to form a quorum of the House of Commons is purely a matter of usage. It could be dealt with by a standing order, or by any order of the House. In our case, it is not possible for the Senate to alter the number required to form a quorum. That must be done, if done at all, by the Parliament. It will therefore be seen that our position with respect to the number required to form a quorum is much more clearly defined than is that of the House of Commons. Although I am not prepared to say that the  President  could not exercise his discretion in cer-tion very urgent circumstances, I do not at the present moment feel that I should be justified in declining to count the Senate when an honorable senator calls my attention to the fact that a quorum is not present. </para>

                <para class="block">From the many pages of authorities I have here I could show conclusively that the terms "indictment," "presentment," "information," and " inquisition," as used in this Bill, do not in a single instance refer to matters arising in police courts. But the question at issue is a much larger one than that of bandying words with reference to legal technicalities. It is possible that in some places in Australia these terms have received a broader meaning than those attached to them by the highest legal authorities of the United Kingdom. It is possible, therefore, that legal members of the Senate may discover ground for opposing the high legal authorities I have cited, but that will not make those honorable senators any more correct. It does not seem to me needful that I should go clause by clause through the measure which I desire should eventually be passed by the Federal Parliament, but it is necessary, I think, when I ask for an amendment of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, that I should offer a few words of explanation with reference to the subject itself. I propose to quote some of the opinions of England's foremost lawyers in reference to this great reform. We know that what is now the Criminal Appeals Act of the United Kingdom was originally introduced into the Imperial Parliament by a Conservative Government. It was passed through the House of Lords, and had a by no means unfavorable reception in the House of Commons. When that Government were displaced from office their successors took up the measure, and though I cannot recall the particular House into which it was reintroduced, I think that it was the House of Commons. At any rate, the Bill was passed through both Chambers almost without division, but with very full discussion. The divisions were few, but the discussion was ample. The Conservative, Liberal, and Radical members of the Imperial Parliament joined in placing on the statute-book of the United Kingdom a measure which affords the same amount of relief in connexion with life and liberty as is afforded by the Courts of the British Empire throughout its wide borders in respect of civil suits. I desire for a few  moments to occupy the time of honorable senators in reading some extracts from a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Lawson Walton, K.C., the present Attorney-General. In introducing the measure he said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I have to ask the leave of the House to introduce a Bill for the constitution of a Court of Criminal Appeal, and for extending the powers of our tribunals to review convictions on indictment for criminal offences. It is proposed to end a controversy which at recurrent intervals for sixty years has engaged the attention of Parliament. The settlement which I invite the House to adopt will create appellate rights against conviction of crime, similar to those which exist in relation to adverse verdicts in civil causes. Liberty will thus be put upon an equality with property - </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I call attention to these words "Liberty will thus be put upon an equality with property," and draw attention to the absence from the Chamber of the members of .the party which claims to represent the human interests of Australia - and the consequences of judicial miscarriage will receive in each case similar protection. The administration of our criminal law has attained its present "unsurpassed reputation in spite of defects of procedure which are irreconcilable with the acknowledged principles of all sound jurisprudence. Various mitigating causes have tended to obviate the defective operation of an imperfect system. The generous bias of our Courts towards the innocent until they have been shown to be guilty, the conscientious solicitude and high character of our Judges and the tempering jurisdiction of the Home Omeo have done much to accomplish this result. But justice has blundered. Innocent men have been convicted and the number of victims of judicial miscarriage during the last few years has not been inconsiderable. </para>
                <para>Surely these are pregnant words, and I prefer the clear-cut, emphatic statement of the highest legal, though not judicial, authority of the Empire to any presentment of the case that I could make. </para>
                <para>This question, owing to recent incidents and developments, has been forced to the front. The Royal Commission recently reported that the resources of the Home Office were neither adequate nor satisfactory. The admissibility of the evidence of an accused person in his own behalf, tainted as it often is by falsehood in regard to collateral matters, tending to prejudice a good case and to confuse the issues to be tried, makes the conduct of criminal trials more difficult. Public sympathy in recent striking instances has been aroused by the misfortunes of men who have been called upon to suffer that most terrible form of moral torture which confounds the innocent with the guilty, and condemns them to a common fate. An enterprising press has rushed in where jurists have feared to tread, and re-trial by newspaper threatens to take the place which ought to be occupied by the process of rehearing before a judicial tribunal. Last, but not least, the delicate and difficult duties of the Home Secretary have been discharged under the pressure of public agitation,  which has made calm and independent judgment well nigh impossible. These considerations have led the Government to the conclusion that the time for some change has arrived. </para>
                <para>Last year a Bill was introduced by the Lord Chancellor and passed through the House of Lords, which will, I trust, ever associate his name honorably with this great change in our jurisprudence. The present measure differs in material respects from that which then passed through the other House. In its present form, I trust it will not meet with those hostile motions which threatened the introduction of its predecessor. I have given careful consideration to the criticisms, many of them most able and cogent, which have reached me from many quarters, and I trust that I shall be able to count former opponents of the measure among - its present friends. The Court will be constituted of seven Judges of the King's Bench Division, selected and presided over by the Lord Chief Justice of England. They will be invited lo undertake the duties arising under this legislation in addition to the functions which they now discharge. The right of appeal in matters of law will be unqualified; in matters of fact it will take place with the leave of the Court of Appeal. This proposal revives an ancient procedure. </para>
                <para>It is attended by this great advantage, that the Court will be able to prevent the abuse of its process by the erasing of unfounded and frivolous contentions. There will be no new trial. The scandals to justice, which must very often occur on the re-trial of a criminal cause, will not happen in consequence of the provisions of this measure, and the accused person will be spared an ordeal which is consequent upon no misconduct on his own part. The Court will have ample powers to get at the truth. They will be able, if necessary, to summon fresh evidence. When they have satisfied themselves, so far as they can, of the true merits of the case before them, it will be their duty to determine whether the conviction should stand, should be set aside, or should be modified, and whether the sentence which is challenged should remain as it was pronounced, or should be brought into harmony with principles of general application, by which the duration of the punishment is made to correspond with the gravity of the crime. </para>
                <para>This is not a rich man's Bill. It was said that the last measure possessed that character. It will not be said of this Bill. An official is appointed whose duty it will be to obtain the materials which it is necessary to place before the Court for the consideration of the petition of every appellant; and if professional assistance be required a solicitor and counsel wi'l be appointed to argue his case. This Bill differs from the last in one respect which will be appreciated bv my legal friends who are members of this House. The machinery will not be left to be framed by <inline font-style="italic">ex</inline><inline font-style="italic">post</inline><inline font-style="italic">facto</inline> regulations. .It is substantially embodied in the Bill itself, and the whole history- of the litigation may be reviewed from beginning to end. </para>
                <para>The prerogative of the Crown will be unaffected, but the Secretary of State will have the inestimable advantage of being able to take the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal upon any question upon which his advice to the Sovereign may depend. This is' the measure  which I would like the House to consider.  It is a non-party Bill. I am sanguine enough to believe it will be non-contentious also. Notwithstanding, in my humble opinion, it yields to none in the order of its importance. It affects immediately and possibly for all time the administration of justice in that sphere of its operations in which it touches the defence of personal security, which is the absolute condition of individual happiness and welfare on the part of every member of the community throughout all classes of our population. </para>
                <para>That is a concise and sufficient explanation of the Bill, which - by effecting a small alteration in our Constitution - I hope that this Parliament will be afforded' an opportunity of considering and passing into law. In the speech which I have just quoted reference is made to the Secretary of State. In England all appeals for the exercise of the prerogative of mercy have to be addressed to the Minister of the Home Department, but as such appeals in Australia are addressed directly to the Governor-General, or to the Governors of States, the Bill before honorable senators contains provision for that necessary alteration. Lord Loreburn, G.C.M.G.,. K.C., and Lord Chancellor, when introducing the Criminal Appeals Bill in the House of Lords, said - </para>

                    <para>My Lords, this Bill deals with a subject which lias been a great deal canvassed for many years in this country, and which, I think, has partially divided the opinion of legal experts; but I do not think there is, or has been for a long time, any considerable section of opinion either at the bar or on the bench, that is not prepared for a measure going a considerable distance. Though I believe there is no country in the world where justice is more fearlessly and more effectively administered than it is in this country,, and while I yield to no one in my respect and admiration for the spirit in which the Criminal Courts are conducted, of which I have myself had some experience, yet it is beyond human nature to suppose that there is, or ever can be, without some opportunities for appeal, an entirely satisfactory condition of things. From time to time there have been, as, indeed, quite recently, instances of error, admittedly innocent error, on the part of the Courts, resulting in a great deal of hardship and suffering to individuals which have stirred the public mind. With that preface, for your Lordships are many of you familiar with the administration of criminal justice yourselves, I shall proceed to say a word or two on the subject of criminal appeals, and contrast them with the appeals allowed in Civil Courts. Let me take, in the first instance, the system of appeal which obtains in the Civil Courts of this country. In regard to civil procedure, the smallest cases tried, for example, in the County Courts, are subject to appeal upon matters of law, but they are not subject to appeal upon questions of fact ; and I must say that I have never seen any cause for complaining of the state of the law. It is to the interests of the public that litigation should be ended, and where the sum of money involved is small it does seem to me more desirable that" there should be some risk now and then of failure, than that there should be constant opportunity for appeal, and the waste of time and money which that would involve. </para>
                    <para>When you go from the smaller kind of civil case to the more important litigations, which are abundant in this country, you find that the facilities for appeal are enormous. </para>

                <para>I submit that if those words are applicable to any part of the world, they are absolutely applicable to Australia. </para>
                <para>A case may be tried by one of the greatest Judges of the day before a special jury. It may have lasted days, or indeed, as sometimes - but happily seldom - happens, it may have lasted even weeks; .but there is an appeal, not only as to law, but an appeal on every point of fact on which the jury have come to a determination - an appeal to the Court of Appeal, and then to your Lordships' House. There is an appeal also on the point of damages that may be assessed, assuming that the verdict and judgment may be right. Not only so ; there is an appeal on what may be called interlocutory proceedings. I would give an extreme illustration. Suppose that one side wishes to have a case, involving, say, ¬£100, tried at Bristol, and the other side wishes to have it tried at Glasgow. Such is the state of the law that an appeal can be taken to the Court of Appeal and then to the House of Lords upon the question of whether this case, involving merely <inline font-style="italic">¬£100,</inline> shall be tried at Bristol or at Glasgow. </para>
                <para>I am not making any complaint about the facilities for appeal that exist in regard to civil causes, but I think it is a very open question whether there is not too much facility for appeal in regard to civil causes. It is not a matter that is relevant to my proposals to-night, but I think it may well be that some restriction would be advisable, but nobody would ever dream of proposing that there should be no appeal at all. All that the most zealous reformer in that respect would suggest would be that there should be some limitation to the exuberance of appeal in civil causes. So much for civil causes. </para>
                <para>Now I come to the criminal law. Your Lordships will find that in the Criminal Courts the law is almost exactly the reverse of that which obtains in Civil Courts. In small, insignificant cases, tried before the magistrates, where three  months' imprisonment is a possible penalty, there is an appeal. In small cases, where a man may only be fined, or where he may be sentenced to only three or four days' imprisonment, there is an appeal to Quarter Sessions, and very properly too. but in grave criminal causes, in which a man may lose his life or his liberty for the whole of his life or for ten or five years, there is, with two exceptions, substantially no appeal at all. Let me give the two exceptions. I am not pretending to offer to your Lordships an exhaustive and detailed statement, but merely an outline, which I think will be found perfectly accurate, of the right of appeal in these cases. If the Judge who tries the case thinks fit to reserve a point of law for the Court of Crown Cases Reserved, he can do so. And then the point of law alone may be made the subject of appeal. </para>

                    <para>But it very often happens that the Judge, being himself satisfied of his own opinion, refuses to grant a case at all ; and there is no machinery of arty sort, kind, or description known to the law - I mean no machinery of the law apart from the prerogative of mercy - by which that Judge can be set right, though it mav be notorious that his law is wrong. there was the case quite recently of Adolf Beck, who, I believe, was perfectly innocent, and was so stated to have been by a Royal Commission. There was an undoubted misdirection in that case ; evidence was refused admission which was palpably proper evidence to have bees allowed. </para>
                    <para>The Judge was confident that he was right although he was transparently wrong; he refused to grant a case ; and no remedy against his refusal was possible. </para>
