                    <para>. - In the first place, I desire to congratulate the Vice-President of the Executive Council, upon his very lucid exposition of the provisions of this Bill. Every honorable senator is now in possession of a copy of his speech, which exhaustively dealt with the matter from an historical stand-point. The honorable gentleman clearly pointed out the successive steps which have led up to the position which obtains to-day. I must also congratulate the Government upon their evident desire to push this measure &#39;forward. Their action in that connexion is in strange contrast with the statement made by the Minister of Trade and Customs last session, when he occupied the position of Leader of the Senate. He then declared that it was only possible to deal with this Bill in conjunction with the Navigation Bill. Now, however, the consideration of the measure is being expedited quite apart from the Navigation Bill. I have to thank the fusion for that. Of course, I recognise that for years Australia has been labouring under a very great disability, as compared with other countries, from the stand-point of legislation providing for compensation to seamen injured in the course of their employment. It is true that the States have legislated in that direction, but of what use was that legislation in cases of accident to seamen in waters beyond their jurisdiction? The Commonwealth, however, possesses jurisdiction throughout Australian waters, so that this defect in our law is now about to be remedied.  1  realize that honorable senators opposite have always been identified with those who have fought most strenuously the principle that is embodied in this Bill. I recollect that a few years ago a majority of the South Australian Parliament was prepared to extend the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act to almost every class of labour other than that of seamen. It so happened that about that time a vacancy occurred in the Legislative. Council of that State, and upon that election depended the fate of the proposal to extend the provisions of the Act to seamen. Happily the late Charles Cameron Kingston was elected, and thus the triumph oF the. advocates of the rights of seamen was assured. Of course, I have been speaking of a Legislative Council which is elected on a property qualification. If adult suffrage has done anything for Australia it has compelled honorable senators opposite to support the measure that is before us to-day. In that Bill there is very little to cavil at, and I intend to do my best to assist in passing it with a few amendments. It follows closely upon the lines of the Imperial Act, and I do not think there is any prospect of inducing my honorable friends opposite to legislate much in advance of the Imperial law in this connexion. If I required a reason why the provisions of this measure should be extended to seamen - even in preference to other classes of labour - I could not do better than point to the diagram which I hold in my hand. </para>

                <para class="block">It shows the loss of life in different avocations. The longest line upon it represents the loss of the lives of seamen. The next longest refers to miners. Honorable senators can see at a glance the difference in the proportion. Next comes a line representing railway servants, and a fourth relates to factory operatives. I think that this diagram constitutes an argument sufficient to convince any one. It does not refer to injuries only, but absolutely to deaths. The diagram is drawn to scale, and, although the figures on which it was based are now somewhat old, the proportion remains about the same. The figures were taken from the statistical record of the Labour Department of the Board of Trade for  1893-4,  published in November,  1894.  In factories and work-shops the operatives employed numbered  5,270,835  ; the ten years&#39; loss of life amongst them from accident was  4,047;  the annual loss was  405.  Of railway servants there were employed  381,626 ;  the ten years&#39; loss of life was  4,717  ; the annual loss was  472.  Of seamen, the number employed was  188,391;  the ten years&#39; loss of life was  21,241;  the annual loss of life was  2,172.  An agitation was aroused in England upon this subject, and I am bound to admit that there has since been a considerable improvement in respect of the loss of life at sea. The agitation became so strong that the editor of the London <inline font-style="italic">Daily Chronicle,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> E. Fletcher, published throughout England a poem, which caused a perfect revulsion of feeling. The indignation aroused on account of the loss of life at sea can only be compared with that provoked during Plimsoll&#39;s time in his crusade against the coffin ships. I will quote only one verse of this poem, which created so much interest amongst English people - </para>

                <para class="block">The appeal thus made did a considerable amount of good, though the loss of life amongst seamen still maintains a regrettably high ratio. I have before me the Board of Trade <inline font-style="italic">Labour Gazette,</inline> for April,1909 - the latest number which I could obtain. The mean annual death rate from accident is shown from the following figures :  - Seamen,  50.4  per  10,000;  miners,  13.2  per  10,000  ; quarrymen,  10.6  per  10,000  ; railway servants,  7.5  per  10,000;  non-textile and factory and workshop operatives,  2.2  per  10,000;  textile factory operatives,  . 8  per  10,000.  For all the occupations enumerated the rate was  6.3  per  10,000.  Yet the loss of life from accident to seamen was as high as  50.4  per  10,000.  Are not those figures alone sufficient to induce honorable senators to pass this Bill? No doubt, some amendments will require to be made in Committee. I have said enough to show that, if any industry should receive the protection sought to be extended by this measure, it is that in which seamen are engaged. </para>

                    <para>. - One occasionally derives some little satisfaction, even from being a Labour man ; and this is one of the times when we can rejoice at seeing some good result from the work which we have been putting in during the last sixteen year&#39;s. During that time, Labour has been asking the Parliaments of Australia for protection in regard to accidents. Some sort of legislation has been passed, but it is legislation that was described in Queensland by the Chief Justice of the State as a delusion and a snare to the men whom it was supposed to benefit. Sixteen years ago I was a member of the Wharf Labourers&#39; Union. I think that that society was concerned in the first case under the Employers&#39; Liability Act, which was introduced in the Queensland Parliament by the present Chief Justice of the Hight Court. One of our members met with an accident not long after the Act was passed. He had the union behind him, but it cost us&#163;240 to get&#163;150 compensation for him. That is the sort of legislation that we used to get at that time. We were told that it was all right; that all that we had to do was to look to Parliament, which would do the correct thing towards the industrial workers. But Parliament did not do the correct thing. I was glad to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council read out the answer given before a Royal Commission in England, where it was pointed out that, even when legislation was in existence, the men who were best served were those who were members of powerful organizations. Those who were not members of unions, it was said, had to go round cap in hand to find some legal gentleman who would be prepared to take up their case, and who usually would only do so if he saw an opportunity of. making something out of it himself. If he saw no such opportunity the probabilities were that the lawyer would say, &#34;You have no case; the best thing you can do is to make the best terms you possibly can.&#34; The result was that men who had a case usually got nothing. The introduction of this Bill, is a tribute to the work of the organizations of Labour in Australia. I am glad to recognise that honorable senators opposite now perceive the futility of the enormous fight that their friends put up in 1.890 for freedom of contract. I was engaged in the great industrial conflict that took place at that time, and I believe that quite a number of men were fooled by the misrepresentations of the press into believing that there was something in the contention that was then urged upon the workers of Australia. We now know that- there was nothing in it. We know that freedom of contract, as it was termed, was simply a phrase used with the object of robbing and fleecing the people who were employed by the owners  of vessels engaged in the coastal trade of Australia. At that time the workers were almost goaded into open insurrection by treatment for which the authorities ought to have been ashamed of themselves. That was only a few years ago, and now, when legislation of this kind has been passed in the Old Country, in New Zealand, and in almost every State in the Commonwealth, it is admitted that even, with the advantage of that legislation the workers require the assistance of very strong unions. What has been our experience in connexion with this class of legislation ? It was asked for many years ago in the Old Country. After it had been demanded for years by the Labour organizations, it was taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain. He did a great deal to popularize such legislation in England after the Labour organizations had sustained an agitation for it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, he did so in 1893. This question was brought forward first in Australia by the members of Labour organizations whose fellows were the victims of the existing law. The members of the organizations had to contribute out of their own pockets week by week for the maintenance of the wives and children of those who had met with accidents. The employer at the time esca&#39;ped scot free unless, as I said before, the injured workman was able to get some lawyer to take up his case on the chance of making, something out of it. How were the Labour organizations met when they asked for legislation of this description? I can say that members of those organizations were characterized as thieves and rogues, and as men who proposed to rob the employers of Australia in the interests of the workers. I think such expressions of opinion can be found in almost every <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in Australia. At least, I can say that three members of the Senate to-day - Senators Stewart, Givens and myself - had that kind of language hurled against them not on one but on many occasions, and that, too, by a member of the present Federal Government. They were told that they were dishonest in endeavouring to obtain compensation for the worker who met with an accident. </para>

                        <para>- That is all very well. I raise no objection to honorable senators making any statement they please regarding anything I have said or done in my public capacity, whether I am present or not when the statement is made. It is my misfortune if I am not present, but there is always an opportunity afforded later to put myself right if I have been misrepresented. If an honorable senator chooses to walk out of the chamber, is that any reason why other members of the Senate should sit silent when they desire to criticise his action ? </para>

                        <para>- The New Zealand Act was the first to appear on a statute-book. We had been trying to carry such legislation in Queensland before that. The first person to introduce :t Workman&#39;s Compensation Bill in the Queensland Parliament was the present leader of the Labour party, Andrew Fisher. He introduced a Bill in  1898,  or  1899.  and it was at that time we were met with terms of opprobrium, because we dared to ask that there should be legislation which is now described by the Vice-President of the Executive Council as just and humane. If it is, those who fought against it in the past must have been unjust and inhumane. It seems to lie that now, as then, those who think they may. dare to vote against progressive legislation, do so. It was only when those engaged in the Labour movement popularized this class of legislation throughout Australia that those who had previously opposed it, were prepared to accept it, and to admit that it had come within the region of practical politics. Probably they would even say outside that they would support legislation of this kind. </para>

As a man said in another place the other day, they represent &#34; the well fed, the well housed, and the well clothed of this continent,&#34; and, until they are driven to act. those who are not in their position will receive very little consideration. That is why I said that there is a little satisfaction in even being a member of the despised Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- When our proposal to legislate in this direction was first introduced in Queensland, we were met with abuse and obstruction. The second reading of our first Bill was carried, and when the formal motion was proposed that the House should resolve itself into a Committee of the whole to consider the Bill in detail one of the members who were very strongly opposed to Labour moved that the order be discharged from the business-paper. The Government had a sufficient majority at their back to throw out the Bill in contempt. So long as they could avoid it, they would take no action to benefit any class of labour by providing for the payment of compensation in respect of accidents. In 1900, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> introduced his Bill again, and the second reading was passed. Of course, the same old arguments were advanced by our opponents. I want to read the opinion of a member of the Government who has since developed into a Liberal. At that time, he was totally opposed to any legislation of this description. He said - </para>

                <para class="block">In the same speech, the honorable gentleman told us that if workmen wanted to have a fund out of which to get some compensation when they were injured, whether it was through any fault of their own or not, we should be honest, and contribute to the fund ; that there was nothing but dishonesty in asking an employer to contribute to or build up a fund out of which an employe&#39; could get some relief when he was disabled in the interests of the employer. In 1901, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was elected to the Federal Parliament.  His  old colleague in the Queensland Assembly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Riland,  took up the question, and introduced the Bill. I think it was realized even by the most hard-cased Tory that the time had come when with safety they could no longer afford to oppose such legislation, and the Government said, &#34; We do not think that your Bill goes far enough now. We consider that it should include a considerable number of occupations which it does not cover.!&#39; They asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riland</inline> to withdraw his Bill with the object of allowing them to bring in one with a wider scope, which they would be prepared to pass. What was our experience? The Bill of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riland</inline> was withdrawn, and we had the spectacle of honorable gentlemen of .exactly the same colour on politics as honorable senators opposite bringing in one of the most infamous measures ever submitted to a Legislature. It was a Bill under which no man could have had an opportunity to get any relief. Virtually, it said to a man : &#34;If you are working on a building, and fall 21 feet, you will get compensation, but if you fall 19 ft. 6 in. you will not be entitled to any compensation. If you work in a quarry, the depth of which is 20 feet, and you get injured, you will be able to obtain compensation.&#34; </para>

We have had considerable experience of the opposition which such measures are usually confronted with. 1 shall not be surprised if this Bill is strongly opposed. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> for instance, does not believe in it.

                        <para>- Probably it is, but it has never yet been adopted in an English-speaking community, as the honorable senator knows. I wonder why honorable senators ask at times for that system to be introduced. They say that it will throw more onus on the employ^. That is a reason which has always been brought up against a Bill of this description. After a Bill of this kind is passed, I can understand some honorable senators mounting a platform and saying, &#34; There you are, that shows that we have been taking just as much interest in these matters as members of the Labour movement. We have been prepared to give you compensation of this kind.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I do not know anything of the sort. I have never heard the Minister utter one word in favour of such legislation. Consequently, I have been under the impression that be, like his colleagues, has always been prepared to oppose such a measure. I should not be surprised to hear of those honorable senators going out and telling the people that they have always been in favour of this kind of legislation. They remind me of the little boy who ran out and said to his mates, &#34; Now, I have taken castor oil.&#34; He forgot to bring out the essential fact, namely, that some person held him by the legs while another person had an arm round him, and probably had to pinch his nose pretty tightly to force him to open his mouth before the oil could be administered. That is very much the position in which honorable senators on the other side, or a number of them, find themselves so far as this kind of thing is concerned. I do not propose to deal with the Bill to any great extent, but it contains two or three provisions to which I am totally opposed. One point which strikes me in connexion with this Bill has reference to the &#39;definition of the word &#34; seaman.&#34;  &#34; Seaman &#34; includes master, officer, apprentice, or other person employed or engaged in any capacity on board a ship in connexion with the navigation or working of the ship. </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Under this definition a number of men might find themselves excluded from obtaining compensation for injuries received in the course of their employment. Take the case of men who are engaged upon salvage work. Let us assume that they have occasion to salvage a wreck outside the territorial limit of three miles. I recollect the case of a number of men who were sent from Sydney to undertake the salvaging of a wreck which had occurred some miles from the coast of the Northern Territory. They were not seamen, although they had been. They were not upon any ship&#39;s articles. The crew of the vessel by which they travelled to the wreck were upon its articles, but the men engaged to do the salvaging work were not. Is it not possible to extend the definition of the term &#34; seamen &#34; so as to make it include individuals employed on board ship, even though they may not be on the ship&#39;s articles? </para>

The men who would undertake that work would not be upon any ship&#39;s articles ; but it seems to me that it would only be a fair thing to allow them to take advantage of legislation of this description.

                <para>I do not believe in exempting from the operation of this Bill any man who is employed on board a vessel. Under this provision, however, the master of a ship trading on the Australian coast, simply because he receives more than  &#163;5  a week, will be excluded from the benefits conferred by it. In other words, the measure, so far as he is concerned, might just as well never be placed upon the statute-book. I do not think that the amount which a man receives in wages ought to determine whether or not he shall be at liberty to take advantage of legislation of this character. We must recollect that it is not being enacted entirely for the purpose of benefiting individuals who may be injured in the course of their employment. It is being enacted more in the interests of those who are dependent on them, namely, their wives and children. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has told us that a man earning more than&#163;5 per week is in a position to make better terms for himself than could be made for him under this Bill. But I would point out that he can make those terms for himself now. Consequently, I hold that it is a wrong principle to exclude from the benefits conferred by legislation of this kind men who are in receipt of more than&#163;5 weekly. I cannot understand why any individual employed upon a ship should not be able to take advantage of legislation which has been enacted in connexion with the occupation which he follows.

                <para>I cannot imagine why that provision has been inserted in the Bill, and I have had some experience of fishing vessels. Of course,I am aware that it has been copied from the English Act. But why should we sanction it, when we have no cases to which it can apply? </para>

                        <para>-- The sub-clause to which I have directed attention does not contemplate any partnership whatever. Take the conditions which obtain in connexion with the fishing industry in the Old Country. A company may own perhaps half-a-dozen trawlers or an individual may own a single vessel. Perhaps he does not go to sea himself. But other fishermen come along, and the conditions of their employment are that the owner supplies them with the vessel, all the fittings of which are supposed to be in good order. The men provide their own food and work the vessel. Usually the crew consists of the master, the second and third hands, and a boy. When they return from their fishing operations, their catch is placed upon the market and sold, and the owner pockets so much of the proceeds. </para>

                        <para>- It is, and it is not. As a matter of fact, the men provide everything, save the vessel and the gear. The cheapest method by which the owner can obtain reliable labour is to say to the men, &#34; Whatever may be earned by the vessel, you shall share in.&#34; He is afraid to engage labour on any other condition, because if the men were in receipt of regular wages he would be under the impression that they were doing their best to rob him. Do we not often hear it said that unless men are continually watched they will not do a fair day&#39;s work? If one of the fishermen employed upon such a vessel were injured owing to the neglect -of the owner to see that all the fittings were in good order, he would be unable to claim compensation under this Bill. It seems to rae that this is one of those cases where the man who is the owner of the vessel, and who obtains the cheapest labour he. can get, ought to be compelled to make her safe. </para>

There is another provision to which I am opposed. I do not believe in permitting any system of contracting out. I know very well what takes place under a system of that kind.

                        <para>- I am not saying that there would be anything wrong with the fund. I do not say that a sufficient amount of money would not be paid in to meet claims. But I say that a man who gets injured, and who goes to his employer, saying, &#34; I think I am entitled to so much,&#34; will not, in nine cases out of ten, get what he ought to receive if the matter is one simply of mutual arrangement. I remember a case where, not very long ago, two employers, accompanied by three workmen, asked a. State Minister not to institute a Wages Board in connexion with their trade. They said that they were perfectly satisfied with existing conditions. They did not want any increase of wages, and they did not consider that it was wise for the Minister to impose a Wages Board upon them, because they expected that they would not be so well off under it as they were at present. We have read in the newspapers of cases where men who were entitled to a wage of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per week received only 30s., but signed a pay-sheet for the larger amount. </para>

If the scheme to which the workmen agree is an addition to what is proposed to be secured to them under this measure, it will be all right, but whatever the merits of the scheme may be I should not be in favour of any system whereby workmen would be enabled to contract themselves out of the benefits of a piece of legislation of this kind. I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill. I am pleased to see that there is a prospect of unanimity upon a proposal of this description. That is the reason why, at the commencement of my speech, I said that even a despised Labour man sometimes gets a chance of witnessing good results from the work which he and those associated with him have been doing for years. </para>

Certainly, honorable senators opposite have a good conceit of themselves. Indeed, the virtues that they attribute to themselves are considerably greater than the circumstances warrant. I should like to draw attention to some remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in introducing the Bill last night. He said - 0 </para>

                <para>Great Britain as recently as 1906, extended her Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act to seamen. Certainly, continental countries had  preceeded  Great Britain in this desirable legislation. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Holland, and&#39; Denmark had all made some provision for seamen ; the most complete being made by Germany, whilst Holland and Denmark confined the benefits of their legislation to those engaged in the local fishing trade. </para>
                <para class="block">It seems, therefore, that the countries which have been first in legislating for compensation for seamen, have been those where the Government has been more or less of a despotic character, and not parts of the world like Australia and New Zealand, where Labour legislation has been at its height. In these countries, we have beer slow. The fact that to-day we are getting up to the European standard, does not entitle the Labour party to claim that they, of all people in Australia, are to be praised for legislation such as we are asked to pass. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> referred in deprecatory terms to the German system of compulsory assurance, but it is not very long since we were told in the cable messages that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George,</inline> the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had spent some time in Germany examining the system of compulsory assurance in vogue there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> is a man who is believed to entertain humanitarian sentiments. He expressed the highest admiration for the system, and wished that it were possible to adopt it in England. I can safely place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. LloydGeorge&#39;s</inline> opinion upon this subject against that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> I do not propose to enter into a discussion of the merits of this Bill. Most of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley&#39;s</inline> speech was devoted to the consideration of  certain legislation in Queensland, particularly with a view of hitting at  Colonel Foxton.  I think that we can rest content to allow honorable senators opposite to profess humanitarian principles, while we practise them. </para>

                    <para>- - The novelty of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> present position is such that I think it is desirable that some emphasis should be laid upon it. We have heard a good deal about the new Protection lately, although precious little has been done to make the policy of the Government in that respect materialize. On this occasion, we have got beyond the new Protection. We have readied what we might very well call the new unionism of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> - the unionism of the Tories of Australia, who, all through their political lives, have been opposed to every reform that the old trade unionists such as myself and others sitting near me have been fighting for during the last thirty or forty years. Unionism is now to be supplanted by a new unionism of the Pulsford variety. That is an eye-opener of which some notice should be taken. I can assure honorable senators opposite that they will receive every assistance from this side in carrying this class of legislation. I only hope that we shall not need to act as pace-makers for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has referred to the fact that certain Continental countries have been ahead of the United Kingdom in legislation of this kind; but if the honorable senator had been at all acquainted with the legislation of those countries, he would have known that they are ahead of the Old Country in many such matters. </para>

But apparently when it suits him, and he thinks that he can score against the Labour party, he is able to make comparisons in favour of the foreigner. This is also a new attitude assumed by honorable senators opposite. I hope that they will keep their eyes open for reforms, even if they have to go to the Continent of Europe to discover them. With respect to the Continental countries about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> would have us believe he knows so much, let me inform the honorable senator that in the Parliaments of every one of them there is a considerable number of active Socialists at work. There are Labour and Socialist parties in all of those Parliaments; but evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> knows nothing at all about the world-wide character of the Labour and Socialist movement. </para>

I hope that we shall have more of this&#39; kind of legislation submitted by honorable gentlemen opposite. But I see some honorable senators who will, I think, put a drag on the wheel if it goes much further.

                        <para>- They show that we have neglected the sailors too long. I have made a study of this matter, and nothing astonished me more than one or two little sneers at myself which I heard last night, and a direct statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> which was entirely inaccurate. My attention was first directed to this class of legislation at a time when I did not know our wonderful ex-Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and had not heard of our able and intelligent friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> I read in the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> that a Workman&#39;s Compensation Bill had been introduced and passed in the British House of Commons. I secured the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the debate, and it appeared to me to prove conclusively the correctness of the principle that the industry in which, as the result of accidents, men were killed or maimed, or prevented from earning their livelihood should bear the obligation of providing compensation. That principle appeared to me to be so just and righteous, and so in accord with what might be expected from a civilized and Christian nation, that I begin at once to consider whether it could not be embodied in a practical measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has told us that the New Zealand Government, under that great Democrat, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> introduced and passed a Workman&#39;s Compensation Bill in 1900, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> introduced such a Bill in the Queensland Parliament in 1898. I think that the honorable senator owes me an apology. I hope that honorable senators opposite will listen to the statement of fact that in that very year, 1898, I introduced and passed through the Tasmanian House of Assembly a Workman&#39;s Compensation Bill, based upon the English Act. That was twelve or thirteen years ago, when I had never heard of the Australian Labour party, because I dd not read the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> in those days. But I read the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> and the justice of this principle impressed me, although honorable senators opposite put me down as a hidebound Conservative. </para>

                        <para>- In answer to Senator W. Russell, let me say that if two men passed the same kind of legislation, and have the same ideas of justice, it is a piece of folly to placard one as a Conservative and the other as a. Liberal. I have not the slightest objection to be placarded as honorable senators please. If a man&#39;s thoughts are generous, just, and liberal, what does it matter if a few Labour members, &#39;who imagine that they are the only Democrats and Liberal statesmen who ever lived placard him as one who holds other opinions? I say that I introduced and passed a Workman&#39;s Compensation Bill twelve or thirteen years ago in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the honorable senator- would. He was then a Tory farmer. If he had heard of such a proposition at that time, he would probably* have said : &#34; Oh, the next dodge will be to apply the Act to. agricultural labourers, and we shall have to pay compensation to men who are injured by reaping machines.&#34; I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> is right in suggesting that the honorable senator would not, at that time, have voted for such a measure. I must point out that, although my Bill was carried triumphantly through the House of Assembly in Tasmania, it was thrown out by the Legislative Council. I was elected a member of the Federal Convention, and when I left the State Parliament to enter Federal politics, I asked the Attorney-General of my Government, now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliott</inline> Lewis, to be sure to introduce the Bill again in the next session. He did so, it was passed again bv the House of Assembly, and was again thrown out by the Legislative Council. I admit that the arguments of those who were opposed to it appeared to me to be too Conservative. They were afraid to give effect to the principle that each industry must bear the cost of accidents attaching to it. I was very much pleased with the argument Submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> and nothing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has said has detracted from its force. We find that when, in 1897, Great Britain moved in this matter, half-a-dozen of the leading Continental nations had already provided compensation for injured sailors. </para>

                        <para>- Twenty years ago, or a  generation before Great Britain provided for compensation to sailors, some of the Continental nations had done so. It is of no use for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to tell us that Socialism is more advanced on the Continent. It may be in Germany, but in the majority of the countries referred to by the Vice-President of the Executive Council and again by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> today, the government is autocratic and conservative. Yet the Parliaments of those countries, recognising the risks run by seamen, did justice to them long before we ever heard the Labour party talking on this subject. Why is it that the Labour party  have made so very little progress in the matter of compensation to sailors, and in connexion with this class of legislation generally, whilst they have achieved so much success in other departments of labour? At the Pan-Anglican Congress and in the Albert Hall, in London, I heard a man who is an economic authority, say that working men in Great Britain care more about a half-penny a day increase in wages than they do about the lives of their wives and children. It struck me that that was an unjust accusation to bring against them, but there is some foundation for it, because from what I can see of the work of the Labour party in Australia their great idea is, &#39;&#34; Can we increase wages j lessen the hours of employment ; improve the conditions of labour j deprive the capitalist, who is our enemy, of some of his gains, and put the money into our own pockets &#34; ? It would be unjust for me to say what I heard this gentleman say at the Albert Hall about the Labour party, but I&#39; do say that their great movement seems to me to be based and conducted on materialism, and that they are so busy trying to grab an increase of wages from their enemy the capitalist that they have no time to think of many other things which it would be better for then&#34;-&#39; to have in mind. If our Labour friends had not lost their sense of proportion and had agitated for workmen&#39;s compensation legislation, as they have clone for increases of wages, such legislation would have been on the statute-books of every State of the Commonwealth long ago. It is because they have been so much concerned with gross materialism in the effort to increase wages that they have overlooked the interests of our sailors, &#34;who carry their lives in their hands, and so this legislation has not previously been passed. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does me a gross wrong. He was not present just now when I explained that I introduced and carried a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Bill through the Tasmanian House of Assembly twelve years ago. The honorable senator does me a great wrong in making against me a statement which is absolutely devoid of accuracy. I should not like to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> shows his ignorance, because if there is any honorable senator on the other side who has impressed me with the idea that he knows a good deal, and to whom I listen with respect, it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> But the honorable senator evidently knows nothing about the German system of old-age pensions, which he condemns. I tried to prevail upon the Senate to adopt the German system, which includes an old-age pension, an invalid pension, a sick pay pension, and an accident pension. I pointed out that its adoption would do away with many objectionable features, that under it -we should not have such a condition of affairs that a man would be entitled to compensation if he fell from a platform 20 feet high, but not if the platform were six inches lower. I tried to persuade the Senate to adopt the German system side by side with the existing old-age pensions system which, to my mind, is nothing but a charity. At a luncheon table, only two hours ago, a man said to me that it is nothing but charity making the thrifty pay for the thriftless, and the sooner the German system is introduced - not instead of it, but side by side with it - the better it will be. Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> be surprised to hear that under the German system, which I have twice brought before the Senate, the whole of the compensation for an injury to a workman falls upon the employer? He knows nothing about the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I meant the German system of to-day, as well as five years ago. I want <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> to realize the gross impropriety of his . reference to that system. When I read the English Act, I could not understand why agricultural labourers, who sometimes lose their arms, and seamen had been left out of its provisions. I have been reading with surprise ever since cases of the kind which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> repeated to us, and which are all to be found in the law reports. He left out the most important case of all, and that is the cat case. A workman&#39;s hand was bitten by a cat, blood poisoning ensued, and he died. When the widow sued, she fortunately got compensation. Why ? Because her husband&#39;s hand was bitten by a cat on the premises. The Court said that if a cat had come in from the street and bitten the man, compensation would not have been allowed to his widow. I rejoice with my brother Democrats, or whatever they choose to call themselves, that we are now getting Compensation Bills which apply to all workmen and to all accidents, and which do not leave room for law cases to arise. </para>

                        <para>- If the members of the Labour party are too greedy, and open their mouths too widely, they will make a serious blunder. My honorable friend opposite has been guilty of a gross wrong to myself in misquoting my opinions and ideas on this subject. The maximum compensation provided for in the Bill is&#163;400, as compared with&#163;300 in Great Britain. The benefits provided for a person partly maimed, and partly deprived of the means of earning a living, are fairly good. </para>

                        <para>- If my honorable friends on the other side try to alter the Bill in that regard, they will only delay its passage, and do more harm than good. It will be time enough for them to propose to increase the benefits when they have placed upon labour the obligation of making a small contribution - I do not care how small - to a fund of this kind. It is all very fine for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> to laugh, but we all know what occurred last night in another place not many yards distant. If we have a Bill which has no finality, which is based on no principle, and in which the benefits will be increased until the Treasury is emptied, trade depressed, and progress prevented, that will never bring about the sound enduring prosperity that we want in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> also said that he did not believe in contracting out. No; because he believes most firmly, and I have heard him, or a brother senator, say, that capital is the enemy of labour. So long as my honorable friends base their industrialism on that fallacy, on that absolute inaccuracy, if I cannot call it something worse, they can never have sound and enduring progress here. Last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> pointed out that the fund is in every way to be safeguarded, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> wants to cut away from the employers those noble examples which the Old Country furnishes to them. Does he not know what is going on at Cadbury&#39;s factory and the Sunlight soap factory? Does he not know that co-operation and partnership are being extended largely ? Does he not know that that system alone can make for sound progress? What hideous nonsense it is for a gentleman named Thomas, from the Barrier, and a gentleman named Findley, to declare that labour and capital are enemies ! They are not. My honorable friends cannot build up an industrial Commonwealth on such a fallacy. When this Bill enables and encourages a great shipowner with his seamen to have a fund of their own, perhaps to give more benefits than we can bestow, a Labour senator gets up and says here that he will have no contracting out. </para>

Company*.,</inline> which absolutely upset the arguments he put forward. It is a case in which four or five men leased a mine on tribute for the purpose of working it in partnership. It was arranged that one of them should be foreman at a weekly wage, to 6e paid out of the profits of the mine. He was killed, and when his wife sued, the Judges held that he was a partner, that, therefore, the Act did not apply, and she could get no compensation. But all these points, I think, can be better discussed in Committee. I have spoken at this stage because when I am in the chair I may not have an opportunity to speak. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> will see that he has done me a gross injustice. </para>

                            He reminds me of an old saying in the Old Country, &#34; he damns all parties but his ane.&#34; Will it be believed that the honorable senator, who is always so pronounced in denouncing the Labour party here, and who challenged any member of the Labour party to debate the policy on a platform, backed down after his challenge had been accepted? It was very amusing to hear the honorable senator say this afternoon that he has been a reformer for thirteen years or more, while I was a Conservative farmer. I have known the honorable senator bv repute since the days of the Federal Convention in Adelaide. I remember reading a speech in which he said he was not afraid to give as many votes to an individual as his property entitled him to receive.

                        <para>- I anticipated, sir, that you would intervene. I might have quoted from the official report of the proceedings of the Federal Convention for the purpose of showing how unjustified was the egotism in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> indulged this afternoon. For him to take to himself credit &#39;for what he did in Tasmania in the interests of the working classes is sheer nonsense. It is significant that he failed to tell us the nature of the Bill which he introduced into the  Tasmanian Parliament. But I may add that he was on a very good wicket, seeing that he knew there was a Legislative Council behind him which would be sure to reject that Bill. </para>

                            has reflected upon the motives of the Labour party, and has also indulged in  Abuse.  I do not intend to follow his example in the latter direction; but when he is permitted to refer to me individually, and to the party to which I belong, in the way &#34;that he did, I think that I am speaking in quite a parliamentary fashion. Reference has been made to the introduction of a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Bill into the South Australian Parliament. At the time, I was a member of the Legislative Council of that State, and I well&#39; remember the difficulty which we experienced in getting that measure passed. I regret that my honorable colleague,

                            who is a most regular attendant here, is absent from the Chamber, because he would be able to correct me if I am wrong in stating that the Factories Bill was passed by the House of Assembly in South Australia for five years in succession before the Legislative Council was induced to agree to regulations which would enable it to be brought into operation.

                            has referred to the question of old-age pensions. The first occasion upon which that matter was brought under my notice was in 1894, prior to my becoming a candidate for the Legislative Council of South Australia. It was then one of the principal planks in the Labour platform. I read the platform of the National League and that of the Labour party side by side, and I d&#39;d not decide to support either. I adopted a medium course, my reason being that at the time the Labour party were in favour of an all-round increase of the land tax. At the last election for this Parliament I do not say that

                        <para>- I must ask the honorable senator how he is going to connect his remarks concerning old-age pensions with the Bill which is under consideration? Whilst I am willing to allow him every possible latitude, some limitation must be imposed upon debate. I cannot permit him to discuss all legislation of a cognate character to this Bill. I am quite ready to permit him to make an incidental refer.ence to such legislation, but the whole of his speech must not be foreign to the subject matter of the measure which is now under consideration. </para>

Surely he must see that he is getting a long way from the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill when he speaks about the fight for the franchise? The honorable senator has alluded to the fact that latitude has been extended to other honorable senators. I quite recognise that. But I have also allowed the honorable senator himself a great deal of latitude. He is now endeavouring to increase that latitude, and if I permit him to do so, another honorable senator will probably desire to increase it still further. He must recognise&#39; that some limitation must be imposed upon his remarks. </para>

                    <para>. - I think we may congratulate ourselves upon the fact that a Bill so far-reaching, so just, and democratic, has been presented for our consideration. In my judgment, we should do well not to discuss the question of who first introduced a measure of this sort, or whether those who are now supporting it were always in favour of it. The important consideration is that those who are in favour of it now have an opportunity of voting for it. The criticisms of those who have been opposed to us were just and proper at the time- </para>

                        <para>- I think so. I always believe that my own criticisms of a measure are just and proper at the time. When honorable senators who were formerly opposed to this Bill now favour it, surely it is a matter for congratulation rather than for condemnation. I see a possibility - not in this instance, I am glad to say - of hostile criticism alienating the support of persons who, for whatever reasons, are with us to-day. I think it is almost a mistake to attribute base motives to anybody. Whatever may be the reason for certain honorable senators supporting this Bill - even if their reason be a base one - it is wisdom on our part to take advantage of their co-operation, and to again resist them when they may oppose us. Consequently, I do not intend to discuss this measure. It is so much in accord with my own principles that its second reading; might be carried without debate. </para>

                    <para>. - I must congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> upon the lecture which he has given us upon etiquette and good manners. He is getting into the habit of addressing such lectures to honorable senators. He is such a master of deportment himself that we, who are so uncouth, rude, and barbarous, are indebted to him for his efforts to teach us how we ought to behave in the higher plane of politics. The little lecture to which we have just listened is only one of several that we have heard from the honorable senator recently. I suppose that he has adopted that <inline font-style="italic">r&#244;le -</inline></para>

                        <para>- Then I must suppose that his lectures in the past have been directed to my honorable friends opposite, and that we have missed them. I am very pleased that the Government have seen fit to make this Bill one of the first measures of the session. It was a Bill which the Fisher Government had decided to bring forward, and the fact that their successors have introduced it thus early is a pleasure to me. I shall not occupy the time of the Senate very long, and I shall not question the propriety of the action of the Government in pushing it to the front. No doubt their action will occasion several twinges of conscience on the part of honorable senators opposite, but that is a matter for themselves. I have no doubt that most of them are hardened enough politicians to accept the dose with a good grace. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to touch only on two points in the measure itself. I have first a word or two to say on the subject of contracting out. I judge from the interjections made by some honorable senators opposite, notably by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> that they have not read the provision dealing with this subject. The honorable senator whom I have mentioned said that the measure provided that the Comptroller of Customs must see that the scheme of contracting out was solvent. The Bill makes no such provision. What it provides is that when the scheme is submitted to the Comptroller, he has to satisfy himself that it will be. possible for the seamen under it to get compensation similar to that they could get under this Bill if there were no contracting out scheme. </para>

                        <para>- When the scheme is put before the Comptroller, he certifies that in his view it is one that would give the seamen the benefits which this legislation is designed to secure for them ; and upon the issue of that certificate by the Comptroller, this measure, so far as it relates to the scheme, becomes a dead letter, except that- it acts as a sort of governor in providing that some benefit shall be secured to the workmen. But there is this weakness, which attaches not only to this Bill, but to every measure of the kind which is founded upon the English Act. There is no provision to safe- guard the solvency of the scheme when it is in actual operation. The duty of the Comptroller, as. far as relates to the solvency of the scheme, is a theoretical one, After the scheme has been presented to him, and he has, to the best of his ability, and in the light of his knowledge, affirmed his opinion that it is actuarially sound, he issues his certificate. But suppose that the scheme put into operation is based upon the experience of a number of years. A scheme thus considered to be theoretically sound might be rendered unsound by a disaster occurring. Under those circumstances, the position could easily be created of workmen making a claim upon the scheme for compensation, and .the scheme being unable to provide them with compensation equivalent to that which would have been recoverable from the employer under the law. There is nothing in this Bill to provide that in that event the employer shall be responsible for the difference between what is paid to the workmen under the unsound scheme, and what they should receive under the law. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see the necessity for that. We know that a great fight has raged in England over this question of contracting out; -and this provision was practically a compromise accepted by those who were fighting against the contracting out principle. The compromise was accepted because it safeguarded the position of the employ^, and at the same time gave the employer the right to make any arrangement he liked in co-operation with his employes. I do not personally see any objection to contracting out in principle, provided we absolutely safeguard the Bill by the provision that if the scheme adopted is not solvent the employer shall be liable to the extent of the deficiency. The other point upon which I wish to make a few remarks relates to the amount of compensation. -I regret that the Government have not been a little more generous in this respect.

                <para class="block">One reason why I think we should raise the amount of payment in case of injury is this. We all know from actual experience that wages are largely based upon the cost of the means of subsistence. They tend always to sink to the margin of subsistence. There is no doubt that the heaviest demands upon a man&#39;s purse are made during a time of sickness or injury. Therefore, we can justify paying to an injured worker the same amount as he would receive in a condition of health, if not more; because his expenses are greater and his need for money is greater. But there is this further point to be borne in mind. It may be said that to increase the amount would be to impose too heavy a burden on the employers. I have been a workman under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act of Western Australia, which is similar to this Bill. I know, as a matter of fact, that in actual practice the premiums were paid by the employes. That applied to the building trade, at any rate. </para>

                        <para>- No. I think that if there is one industry in Australia which can well afford to carry the burden of accidents occurring in it, it is the shipping industry. When we find the Adelaide S.S. Company, for instance, paying 5 per cent, half-yearly dividends, a 5 per cent, bonus, arid building new ships out of profits, and other companies doing as well, while I wish them all success, I say that the industry in which they are engaged certainly cannot claim to be poverty-stricken. </para>

                        <para>- I fully appreciate the action of the Government. I heartily congratulate them on having brought forward a measure of this character. Its necessity has been so clearly shown bv the historical references to seamen and the dangers of their calling that I need not enlarge upon it. In. my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> touched upon the most important feature of the measure. It is one in connexion with which the Government have displayed a weakness which is to be noticed in every Compensation Act that I am acquainted with. They have failed entirely in this Bill to make provision for the case of the man who, as the result of an accident, has been rendered incapable of following his occupation. I have had considerable experience in these matters. I know something of the operation of Compensation Acts passed in Australia, and particularly in Western Australia. I know of cases where the regular earnings of workmen have been reduced by 50 per cent., when, through accident, they have become incapacitated. I know what has been the result following upon such a reduction of earnings. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, there is no time in a man&#39;s life when the need of money in hand is so pressing as when he is reduced in circumstances through sickness or accident. The weakness displayed by other Governments in dealing with such measures has been repeated by the Federal Government.  1  trust that the Senate will modify this Bill by raising the amount of compensation to be paid in cases of accident to seamen to an amount, considerably higher than 50 per cent, of the regular wages earned. </para>

I hope that before the Bill gets through Committee we shall be able to make such an amendment as I suggest. After all, we shall not be taking anything for injured seamen out of the pockets of their employers. Every employer in the State must agree with me that he does not pay a solitary cent in compensation to an injured worker. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> by interjection when the Vice-President of the Executive Council was speaking, said in effect that it would take employers all their time to get the money out of the seamen. Let me say that the money required for insurance of this kind  will be <inline font-style="italic">a*</inline> readily obtained from seamen as from those engaged in any other industry. My experience in connexion with Arbitration Acts and this class of legislation convinced me, if I had needed convincing, thai an industry must pay for its own insurance. If, for instance, we take a wages question before a Court, the Court at once takes into consideration the costs sheet of the employer. I venture to say that there is not one employer in Australia whose industry is affected by a Compensation Act who has gone into Court without including in his expenses so much for insurance money for the men he employs. </para>

                        <para>- It is exactly the same. I, therefore, say that if we raise the amount of compensation to the full amount of the regular wages earned, it will be incorrect  to  s,a&#62; that we shall be taking anything from the employer. In the end the workman earns all he will get. First of all, by his industry he assists to accumulate the fund from which he is paid. Whilst we may, in this measure, get a little in advance of the position so far reached, so long as we are without legislation which in any and all conditions provides for a reasonable wage, the employer will be able to get every penny of his insurance money out of the worker before the worker gets anything from him at all. </para>

                        <para>- We shall haw to go a long way before we get very much. We need to pass a measure which will insure to the man who is accidentally injured in the course of his employment such compensation as will enable him to continue to live under conditions that will be tolerable to him. If a man earns <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;p</inline> I OS. per week, and his wages are reduced by 50 per cent, because he happens to meet with a serious accident, the probabilities are that the whole of the reduced income will be required to meet extra expenditure arising from the accident, and no provision will toe left for ordinary living expenses. Whilst congratulating the Government on introducing this Bill, I hope they will not follow in the footsteps of the State Parliaments that have already passed Compensation Acts, but will rather strive to see that those who are injured are given fair and reasonable compensation. .1 think we shall injure no one if we provide for compensation equal to 0 the ordinary wages earned. In some instances, in the shipping industry, that would not amount to very much. We should seek to make the Bill as perfect as we can, and one which will relieve from penury and hardship the man who has the misfortune to meet with an accident, and also those who are dependent upon him. I shall do my best towards that end in Committee. In the meantime, I shall support the second reading of the Bill, and I again congratulate the Government on having introduced a measure in the consideration of which it will be possible for us to do something worthy of our efforts. </para>

                    <para>- - It has afforded me much pleasure to note the kindly tone of the various speeches on this Bill. &#39; I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> cannot be too highly praised for the tone of the speech in which he introduced it. I shall have much pleasure in supporting the measure. Most honorable senators have spoken as if the only provision in case of accident is afforded by a compensation measure. It seems to me extraordinary that nowadays sailors and others who follow occupations in which they are liable to accident do not make greater use than they do of accident insurance companies. Many employers of labour may not be able to do what they would like to do for those who have been injured in their employment. Surely men who are in receipt of a moderate income can afford to put aside a little to supplement what they get from their employer? One would imagine from some of the speeches made here that all the provision is to be obtained under the Act. I think that a .satisfactory arrangement could be made with an Accident Assurance Company. I hold that, apart from this measure, in their own interests, workmen ought to assure their lives against accident with companies.  I compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> upon his interesting speech, and I was in hopes that with the close of that excellent speech the second reading of the Bill would have been allowed to go without further remark. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the motion, and-  1  can honestly say that I welcome the Bill as a well-deserved return to a certain class of workmen, who have been too long kept out of provisions which ought to have been extended to them. It is unfortunate that on an occasion of this kind a recriminatory feeling should be displayed, and that some of the hostility with which similar measures have been confronted should be raked up. It is only fair that I should make a few remarks on the other side. I propose to quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to show the manner in which a measure of this kind was received the first time in the Queensland Parliament. After a fairly long discussion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the author of the Bill, used these words on the 16th November, 1899 - </para>

We had from our leader an able, clear, and humanitarian presentation of the subject. I regret that when he opened on a fine keynote and spoke clearly it did not entirely silence imputations, and what is worse than useless, recriminations? I have tried to modify some of the personal criticism which has fallen from the other side, and I hope that the Senate will see that seamen shall receive corresponding advantages to those which other workmen have already received. </para>

                <para class="block">Because* I said that it was the duty of the employers in an industry <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> see that the workman was compensated, he said that it was a dishonest way, and that any man who would make such a proposition must have a perverted and twisted conscience. That remark applies to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who introduced this Bill. According to his colleague,  Colonel Foxton,  he has a perverted and twisted conscience. I believe, and always have believed, that, while accidents are liable to occur in every employment, and while, perhaps, they are unavoidable in many cases, those accidents should be a charge on, the industry in which they occur, just the same as any other charge is made on the industry. The steam-ship? which trade on our coast pay for the coal they consume and the shafts they break. Why should they not also pay for the lives they consume, or the legs or arms they break? Is human life a mere nothing? Should it not be paid for by the industry in which it is lost? Nobody who uses a service would grudge the slight additional charge which should be necessary to enable that service to meet a liability of that kind to the worker. I desire to approach this subject without any heat, now that I have put on record the &#34;facts  with regard to a matter which was in dispute. I hold that by every law of equity or morality compensation for injuries is a legitimate charge on the industry in which they are sustained. Holding that belief, I welcome this Bill. It is somewhat late in the clay that we have arrived at this humanitarian conclusion. However, I do not propose to abuse honorable senators on the other side because, even at this late hour, they have become converted. I congratulate them on their conversion. I also congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> upon having presented the Bill in a very sympathetic and able speech. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to see the Minister converted. I also congratulate him upon being in the position of introducing a Bill of this character. I think it is an honour which ought to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> appreciated by any public man in the Commonwealth. I congratulate him upon having bad that opportunity. We have been fighting for such legislation for a long time, and have been violently abused for our pains. We have been told that we have perverted consciences. Whilst congratulating the Government upon the general tenor of the BilL I do not subscribe to every provision in it. With others, I believe that the compensation to be granted under it is altogether too small. If there is a time in a man&#39;s life when he requires the full income that he ordinarily earns, it is when he is ill. That is not the time to cut down his income j rather he requires a larger income. On the other hand, should he chance to be killed, his dependants, I think, should be granted generous compensation. I do not propose to discuss details in this connexion at . the present juncture. I shall content myself with remarking that the compensation proposed to be granted in cases of disablement and of fatal accident is quite insufficient. In Committee, I shall do my best to extend more generous treatment to persons injured1 in the seafaring industry. I think that we ought to make the provisions of this Bill so liberal that every man engaged in that industry will be glad to take advantage of/ it. For that reason there should be no contracting out. The provision which permits of that system is, in my opinion, an ugly excrescence on the Bill which ought to be eliminated. If we enable every seafaring man to come within the scope of the. measure, if we eliminate every provision! that is. calculated to enable it to be evaded, and if we increase the compensation to be granted under it, I am satisfied that it will emerge from Committee a measure of which we have every .right to be proud. </para>

Senator</inline> Turley,  as he raised his voice to denounce us for daring to do anything of a humanitarian nature, declared that when the Workmen&#39;s Compensation -Bill was introduced into the Queensland Parliament, he and Senators Stewart and Givens were called &#34; rogues and robbers.&#34; Those are the very words which he used. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, Givens</inline> then interjected, &#34; We will give him his own words out of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,&#34;</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> replied, &#34;Yes; the words are to be  found there.&#34; . Naturally, I turned to the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to ascertain what happened on the occasion in question, and the best evidence of the treatment which &#171;the measure in question received in the Queensland Parliament is to be found in the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> himself when he was finally replying on the Bill. I do <inline font-style="italic">&#60;not</inline> think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> will seriously attempt to prove that, as a party, those -who were opposed to him in the Queensland Parliament ever referred to himself and Senators Givens and Stewart as &#39; &#39; rogues and robbers.&#34; In the beginning the honorable senator made his charge against the party as a whole, but finally he levelled it against one member of the Ministry. I defy him, or any of his friends, to produce a copy of the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> containing the words which he has attributed to members of the party which was opposed to him in the Parliament of that State.

It appears to me that they are merely making a virtue of necessity- They are being pushed from behind. They have introduced the measure knowing perfectly well that if they did not do so, public opinion would be brought to bear upon them. I believe that if there were no Labour party in this Commonwealth, we should have no Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill to-day. </para>

                        <para>- We have been talking about Labour legislation ever since we entered this Parliament, and for years before. I have never heard that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has devoted any of his talents to advancing the cause of Labour. He may have done so; but, so far as I am concerned, his light has been effectively hidden beneath a bushel. He has never raised his voice in advocacy of the cause of the worker since he entered this Chamber. Neither has a single honorable senator sitting on the Government side of the chamber. But, recognising, like wise men, that public opinion upon these questions is advancing, they have seized occasion by the hand, and probably to forestall other people, they have brought forward this Bill. In other words, they are practical politicians. When a measure has been popularized by the Labour party, when the public has been brought to recognise the necessity for passing it into law, the Government make a virtue of necessity. I do not give them any credit for that, because I know perfectly well that the whole history of the party with which they are associated has been&#39; one of stubborn opposition to every Labour proposal that has been submitted to any Australian Parliament. They have fought those proposals inch by inch. They have contested them foot by foot, and they have given way only when public opinion became too strong for them. I was very much amused to hear the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> this afternoon, in which he claimed credit for having introduced a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Bill into the Tasmanian Parliament thirteen years ago. Well, in my experience, I have found that politicians have often voted for measures in which they did not believe, knowing perfectly that those measures had no chance of becoming law. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; I believe that honorable senators opposite do believe in something. They are prepared to abandon their principles at a moment&#39;s notice for the sake of that something. What that something is, they can conjecture. But let me get back to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> With all respect to him, I say that he knew perfectly well that behind him and the Legislative Assembly of Tasmania there was a Legislative Council which would not touch his Bill with a pitchfork. He knew that the Council would throw it out with contempt. Knowing that, he was perfectly safe in introducing the measure. I am very pleased that this Bill has been introduced. I hope that before it is passed its scope will be very much widened. But I would advise our industrial friends outside not to trust too much to the good-will of those who now form the Government and their supporters. </para>

To return to the measure before the Senate, I give honorable senators opposite no credit for it. They are merely doing this thing under compulsion. If there had been no watchdog such as the Labour party in existence, they would never have introduced such a Bill, and there would not have been the slightest hope of its being passed. But they know that there is a vew large battalion of Labour representatives in the other branch of the Legislature.&#34; and there is also a considerable number of the same part\, in the Senate. The Government bow to the weight of numbers. I have no more to say. I have no desire to obstruct business. I hope the Bill will be passed as speedily as possible. I also hope that in Committee its scope will be somewhat enlarged. </para>

                    <para>- - I congratulate the Government on having introduced this Bill, and on having brought it before the Senate so early in the session. It, therefore, has an excellent chance of being passed in both Houses, and. becoming law. I congratulate the Government also on not waiting for the passing of the Navigation Bill. Otherwise we might have had to wait for this measure for a considerable time, because I expect that it will be a good while before the Navigation Bill gets through. I cordially congratulate the Vice-President of the Executive Council upon the excellent speech he made last night. It was full of sound sense; it showed the honorable senator to be in entire sympathy with his measure, and it did him credit in every way._ I am not a sudden convert to the principle of Workmen&#39;s Compensation Acts. During the whole time I have been in public life I have advocated similar measures. I do not think that honorable senators opposite have any right to make such remarks as have been made with regard to the motives of Ministerial supporters. I take it that the members of the Labour party represent the people who sent them here. Honorable senators on this side of the Chamber equally reflect the opinions of those who voted for them. The measure is introduced by a Government which we support, because the electors who voted for. us demanded legislation of this kind, in justice to those whom it is designed to benefit. I know that it is quite a common practice to represent that honorable senators on this side of the chamber, and those who sent them to the Senate, are deficient in human sympathies, and do not favour humanitarian legislation or anything of .the kind. It is not unusual to hear it said that we have no sympathy with legislation designed to benefit the working classes. I protest, however, that the love of humanity is not the special possesion nf one party in this Chamber. Honorable senators on this side desire that justice and right shall be done just as keenly as do the members of the Labour party. Personally, I advocated Workmen&#39;s Compensation legislation in the Legislature nf Smith Australia. I voted for a measure nf the kind, and helped to pass it. I did that quite willingly, although I knew that the Act would lay upon me, as an employer, some burden in the matter of insurance. I consider now that as it was deemed right to provide compensation for men injured while at work on land, it is equally right that we should enact legislation to provide compensation for those who are injured in doing their business on the seas. Looking at it as a matter of simple justice, therefore, I am very glad, indeed, that the Government have introduced the measure. It may not go so far as some of us would like it to go. But, at any rate, it has this merit, that it goes as far as any legislation that has yet been enacted ; and I do not know that we can expect to go very far ahead of the legislation of other countries in this respect. It is, however, our duty to at least bring our legislation up to date, and to do as much for our own people as is done for those of other countries. As the Bill which has been introduced by the Vice-President of the Executive Council fulfils this purpose, I am glad to afford it my very hearty support. In so doing I believe that I am representing the views of those who sent me here. The measure provides, I think, for a fair amount of compensation. That compensation must be provided not at the expense of the seamen, but of the industry. I do not know personally how much is done by employers in the way of getting their employes to contribute towards an insurance, fund. I can only speak for myself. I know that no one who has ever been in my employ has paid a single farthing, although I have taken out an insurance policy against workmen&#39;s liens, workmen&#39;s compensation, employer&#39;s liability, and common law claims. I do not claim credit for doing that. I think it is a fair thing towards employes that their employer should make such provision. But I must remind the Senate that there are some honorable senators opposite who, although they profess liberal . views now, have not always been quite so generous in this respect. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to join with others in congratulating the Government on having brought this measure forward. I desire also to join in the congratulations to the Vice-President of the Executive Council on the very clear manner with which he explained it. I am inclined to agree with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that too much credit need not be accorded the Government for the introduction of the Bill. They are members of a fusion party, composed of antagonistic elements. They are aware that if questions are brought forward on which the various sections of their party hold strongly opposing views, they must lead to trouble. As a Government, they are anxious to show that they have passed som&#39;e legislation, and they are consequently forced to introduce a measure of this character, which they are absolutely sure will not be opposed by the Opposition, which is comprised almost entirely of Labour members. </para>

                        <para>- It should be regarded as a term of commendation, rather than of reproach, as it is surely an evidence of intelligence for a political party to call its members together to discuss important questions before they are discussed in . Parliament. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> is not a member of the caucus of the Ministerial party, I have not as much regard for him as I had when I believed that he was a member of the fusion caucus. I have said that I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that the Government introduced this measure because they knew it must meet with the approval of the Labour party. If they are to continue in office, they must be able to point to some legislative work done, and they hope to get credit for passing this measure, which has been fought for by the Labour party for a number of years. I was rather amused to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> make his little quotation from the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> with the object of showing that our good old Democratic friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, was at one time a Conservative. </para>

                        <para>- I did not at the time know very much about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, but I believe he was a little bit Conservative. At that time, the honorable senator was a farmer, and we know that the farmers are a Conservative class. It is only since the honorable senator has been associated with the Labour party that his views have become broadened, and he is now an absolute Democrat in politics. There is some justification for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell&#39;s change of views. We can understand a man taking the progressive side in politics as he grows older, and his intelligence is developed. But how can we justify the conduct of a man who, in his youth and prime is a Democrat, and who goes over to the Conservatives at a time when his intelligence should be more highly developed ? </para>

This is a very valuable measure, and when it is passed  it will confer very great benefits upon a very deserving class. At the same time, I do not believe that many honorable senators on the Ministerial side would approve of a measure of this kind unless it had been introduced by a Government whom they were supporting.&#39; </para>

                        <para>- I desire to refer to a few remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in introducing the measure. He pointed out that a Commission which investigated the subject in Great Britain had reported that it was highly desirable that both workmen and employers should be organized, in order to make the law effective. In reply to an interjection I wanted to point out that honorable senators on the other side were distinctly hostile to organization on the part of workmen, when another measure was before the Senate and the whole success of its operation depended upon the adoption of that principle. When they had an opportunity to vote for preference for union.ists, nearly every one of them was distinctly hostile. That is my reply to the interjection. I do not desire to occupy the time of the Senate much longer. I approve entirely of this Bill, which, in <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> opinion, ought to have been introduced, years ago. It is not the fault of the Labour party that it was not introduced earlier. I hope that it will have a quick passage through Committee, and that, with, possibly a few amendments, which will be improvements, it will speedily become the law of the country. </para>

                    <para>. - I also must congratulate the Government upon bringing in this measure. From <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> ,we have had a statement that honorable senators on the Ministerial side do not believe this thing, and that thing. We take the statement for what it is worth, considering the source from which it came&#171; But I remind honorable senators who hurl threats across the floor at us, that during the last eight years they had ample opportunity to take up this question. They sat behind a Government which, according to their own statements, they dominated and made use of. They could have induced that Ministry to bring forward any measure which they desired, but for some reason or other, unknown to honorable senators on this side, they never had this Bill brought in. </para>

                        <para>- I&#34; am speaking te the second reading of this Bill, sir. My honorable friend twitted honorable senators on this side with simply supporting this measure because it was brought forward by the present Government, and stated that otherwise it would have received our opposition. I do not think that he had any right to make such an assertion. For some years the members of the present Opposition sat behind a Government, and, therefore, had ample opportunity to bring about the introduction of a measure for this purpose. Had such  a  Bill been introduced at their instance and opposed by honorable senators now silting on this side, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> would have been quite justified in making the assertion which he did just now. </para>

                        <para>- We are pushing the Government, and getting on fairly well. I hope that we shall make more progress than we have done. If they bring down measures of this description they will always receive the hearty support of every one on this side. We will not try to talk out measures or to stone-wall them. We will do our best at all times, I hope, to help the Government to pass democratic and literal measures. We will try, perhaps with the help of some members of the Opposition, to improve their measures. I am very pleased indeed to have the opportunity of supporting this Bill. It would have received my hearty support, no matter what party had brought it forward. We have been reminded to-day of the great loss of life at sea about the seventies and the eighties. We all deplore those fatalities, but the mercantile marine is now principally composed of steamers. To a great extent, sailing vessels have been done away with. Progressive legislation such as limiting the load line was enacted before any honorable senators on the other side had anything to do with legislative work. Compared with the sixties, the conditions of seamen to-day exhibit a great improvement. </para>

                        <para>- Of a character which will benefit the whole of the people of Australia. I have always taken great interest in the seamen of Australia and other cities. During all my life, I have been a warm admirer of seamen. I have recognised the peculiarly hard conditions under which their lives are passed, and the deeds of heroism with which for hundreds of years they have illuminated the pages of history. Often and often I have wondered how it was that, whilst landsmen had had their conditions of life ameliorated by Acts of Parliament, seamen, as a rule, had been overlooked, especially in Australia. If there is one party in Australia which ought to feel impelled to endeavour to ameliorate the conditions of this class of men, surely it should be the Caucus party, with which they are identified and for which they have done so much. </para>

Almost before the honorable senator was born, some honorable senators on this side took part in doing our &#34; little best &#34; to ameliorate the conditions of the workers in the Old Country, and assisted in a small way to establish unionism under conditions which were far more legitimate and beneficial to the workers than the political unionism represented by the Caucus party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> who for many years has represented the Seamen&#39;s Union, and who, I believe, tried honestly and sincerely to ameliorate the conditions, made charges against honorable senators on this side, which, I feel sure, he will regret in his sober moments. </para>

                        <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> affirmed that we have no sympathy for sea- men, he made a statement which was absolutely unfair and inaccurate. Might I remind him that no less than fifty years ago I took an active part in assisting to ameliorate the conditions of the farm labourers of England who were then led by that noble man Joseph Arch. Whether the amount of compensation proposed to be granted under the Bill is sufficient, is a question which will doubtless receive due consideration at the hands of the Senate. Of course, it may be urged that it is all very well for us to be generous with other people&#39;s money. But we must recollect that the seafaring industry is one which assures to investors in it a big return. </para>

                <para class="block">If there be one question more than another of keen interest to the travellers and producers of Australia, it is that of overcoming, if possible, difficulties of transit connected with what is popularly known as the &#34; break of gauge &#34; which occurs between at least three of the States. There is a break of gauge on the Queensland-New South Wales border between the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge of Queensland and the 4 ft. 8&#189; in. gauge of New South Wales. Another break occurs at Albury between the 4 ft. 8&#189; in. gauge of New South Wales and the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge of Victoria, and there is a further break of gauge in the railway system of South Australia. Sooner or later the railways of eastern and southern Australia will doubtless be connected with the railways of Western. Australia, and if we are then to have a rapid service across the continent, a uniform gauge must be adopted, otherwise difficulty will necessarily be caused by the difference between the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge already existing in South Australia and Western Australia and the gauge of greater width which will be required to enable trains to be run at a greater speed than is possible on a 3 ft. 6 in. line. But the matter which I desire to bring before the Senate really affects only two States, namely, Victoria and New South Wales. It is quite easy in the space between a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge and a 4 ft. 8&#189; in. gauge - at least we are so informed by engineers - to work with an additional rail. But hitherto the difficulty has been in dealing with the little narrow strip between the 4 ft. 8&#189; in. gauge and the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge. The difficulty has been to overcome the mechanical obstructions which occur in points, at sidings, and about stations. Where we have so great a difference as that which obtains between a 4 ft. 8&#189; in. gauge and a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, there is no great difficulty to overcome, but there is the difficulty of which I speak between the railway gauges of New South Wales and Victoria, and it is to that matter that I pro pose specially to address myself. At the outset let me say that the appliance which is referred to in my motion is one which has the entire approval of the Engineer-in-Chief for railway surveys on behalf of the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Deane, who until recently was the Engineer-in-Chief for New South Wales, but who is now discharging similar duties for the Commonwealth, and under whose direction the survey of the proposed transcontinental railway between South Australia and Western Australia has been conducted. He is a gentleman of very high attainments, of lengthy experience, and one who possesses the entire confidence, I believe, not only of the Commonwealth Government, but of the members of both Houses of this Parliament. I do not think that in either Chamber a question has been raised as to his suitability and high qualifications for his present office. Nor has the press taken any exception to the appointment of this eminently qualified engineer who has conferred upon the Brennan switch apparatus unqualified praise. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, exactly. A great many people whose opinions as experts are of value have inspected the working model of Brennan&#39;s improvements in switches and crossings for compound gauge railways. That model which is on a pretty large scale was constructed at the Sydney railway workshops. I believe I am correct in saying that it was manufactured under the direct supervision of the interlocking engineer for New South Wales railways, who is well known throughout Australian railway bodies as a very talented and capable engineer. The latest inspection of this model took place only the other day, and if the newspaper reports are accurate, I believe that you, sir, had the advantage of seeing it and of hearing its working explained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> for the benefit of the Governor-General. </para>

                            <para>- The Committee would never terminate its labours. I am moving in reference to something positively definite. A model illustrating the appliance has been constructed, with a car of considerable size. If I remember rightly, the car is about  18  inches long. It is not a toy. It is very admirably constructed. In explaining the appliance to the Governor-General the other day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> said that there were no practical and mechanical difficulties in the way of its adoption. That is the positive statement of an expert. The newspaper reports show that on the occasion in question there were present not only the Governor-General, but Brigadier-General Gordon, commanding the troops in New South Wales ; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. McKellar,</inline> member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales ; the  President  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould, and other gentlemen interested in the important matter of easy transit over the respective railways of the States. </para>

                                <para>- And I was illustrating my honorable friend&#39;s attitude by referring to an. incident which took place in the New South Wales Parliament in 1889. An honorable member then took up exactly the same attitude in reference to a statement I made concerning the new rapid-fire guns. He asserted that it would be impossible for a gun to be fired so frequently, because it would get red-hot. Of course, every one now knows that rapid fire guns have become one of the most remarkable developments of modern gunnery. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that he may be equally wrong with reference to railway switches. </para>

To show the extreme expense occasioned with reference to this break of gauge at one spot only, namely, Albury, I may state that it costs between&#163;1,200 and&#163;1,500 a year to shift the mails from one railway train to another across a narrow platform. That great expense - because it is great for the amount of work accomplished - illustrates the difficulties that would be got over, and affords one instance of the convenience to the travelling public that would be entailed if this appliance could be successfully adopted. In that event a train could leave Sydney at 5 o&#39;clock in the evening, and deliver its passengers and mails in Melbourne at 10 o&#39;clock on the following morning, and <inline font-style="italic">vice vers&#226;.</inline></para>

                                <para>- That would be a great advantage. You can shift a number of infantrymen from one railway train to another very quickly ; but when it comes to handling thousands of horses and guns, with all the <inline font-style="italic">impedimenta</inline> that necessarily must accompany any military force, the difficulty is very much greater. Because, of course, a large military force entails the carrying of a great amount of material. Men cannot carry on their backs all the necessary ammunition. There must also be food for their sustenance. There must be fodder for their horses. You cannot transfer even a small brigade consisting, say, of a couple of regiments of infantry and a single regiment of cavalry, with all their guns and military train and so forth, without a considerable amount of delay ; and if this movement had to be carried out at any border station, it would seriously imperil the success of the military operations that were sought to be effected. In view of some of the statements that I have heard to-night, it may be well to make one or two brief quotations from the reports of Railways Commissioners. </para>

                        <para class="block">But, of course, a universal gauge throughout Australia would involve the expenditure of such huge sums of money that it is useless to discuss the question at the present stage. On that point, my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and I are in happy agreement. But things had advanced a little when, in 1897, the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, held a meeting in Melbourne, on the 23rd and 24th August, to consider the question of the unification of railway gauges, as desired by the honorable the Premiers of their respective Colonies, at a meeting at Adelaide, on the 8th April, 1897. I am aware that there is present at least one honorable senator who thinks that my proposal might give dissatisfaction in some possible or impossible way to State Governments; and. therefore, I beg attention to the fact that the honorables  the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, in conference at Adelaide., on the 8th April, 1897, requested the Railways Commissioners of their respective Colonies to report on the unification of railways. This the Commissioners did. To read the whole of their report would take up too much time. The Commissioners present were <inline font-weight="bold">.Mr. John</inline> Mathieson. Victoria; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Oliver, New South Wales; and M.r. Alan G. Pendleton, South Australia. The memorandum which they drew up was signed by the three Commissioners. I shall not read it; not only because it is too long, but also because the figures given in it as to the railway mileages of the different Colonies have since undergone considerable alteration. But perhaps it will be of interest if I give the totals for the different lines at the date in question. </para>
                        <para>There was a total of 3,334 miles of the standard/ 4 ft. 84in. gauge, and 4,509. miles of the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge. Queensland is not involved in this, and the narrow gauge lines of. South Australia are not included. </para>

I know that on the standard gauge lines of New South Wales heavier engines are run than on the railways of Victoria, where the gauge is 5 ft. 3 in&#39;, for the simple reason that the gradients are much more steep on New South Wales lines than they are on Victorian lines. </para>

                                <para>- Of course another rail would be required, and I intend to deal with that. If honorable senators would permit me to tell my story in my own way I should be able to do so very much more succinctly than I can hope to if I am continually hampered by interjections. Honorable senators will find that I shall not overlook anything. I shall  take it as a great kindness if when I come to an end I have not dealt with everything on which honorable senators would like to have information, they will ask me questions. They may put me in the position of a candidate. They know&#34; that when they are candidates they like to be allowed to get their addresses off their chests without interruption, and to answer questions afterwards. Let me get this off my chest, and I&#39; shall be prep&#39;ared to answer questions afterwards. It is shown in the report of these Railway Commissioners that, to convert the mileage existing in 1897, from 4 ft. 8^ in. gauge to a 5 ft. 3 in. gauge, would cost a total of &#163;4,260,000. Of course, since 1897 there has been a very material increase in the mileage of the standard gauge, I believe there have been some considerable additions in Victoria to the mileage of the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge, but the increase in the mileage of railway construction has not been so great in Victoria as in New South Wales, for the simple reason that before the date mentioned Victoria had carried out a very much larger service within her borders than New South Wales had done within hers. I have said that to convert the mileage of 4 ft. 8J- in. gauge to a gauge of 5 ft. 3 in. was estimated to cost &#163;4,260,000, while to convert the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge to the 4 ft. 8J in. gauge the estimated cost was a little more than half - &#163;2,360,000. </para>

                                <para>- Those estimates of cost cover alteration of permanent way and works, alteration of rolling stock, and provision for temporary workshops and machinery in each case. Those figures show that huge sums are involved in any attempt to unify even the railways of Victoria or New South Wales, whilst the proposal which is suggested in the motion I have the honour to submit to-night, is one which, as I shall show in a few minutes, would cost merely a nominal sum, as compared with the millions that would be involved in a unification of the gauges of the railways of the two States. I have referred to the extraordinary difficulties in the way of unification and the desirability, therefore, if possible, of discovering a method by which those difficulties may be overcome cheaply, expeditiously, and to the advantage of all concerned. Turning over a page of my papers I find that the meeting cf the Premiers in Adelaide in 1897 was really in connexion with the Federal Convention sitting there at the time. Let me remind honorable senators in this connexion that one of the great inducements held out to influence people to Note for Federation was the promise - I do not say it was an official promise, but certainly it was a promise from the lips of the high priests of the Federal movement - that with Federation there would be a unification of railway gauges, that railway travelling would be simplified and cheapened, the farmer and pastoralist would be able to get their produce and stock to market, and that all parties concerned in the production of the wealth of the soil and in the transit of goods throughout Australia would be largely benefited by a Federation which would bring about a simplification of railway gauges? Twelve years ago the high priests of the Federation movement were clamouring for a uniform railway gauge, but nothing has been done from then till &#39; now. This is the first attempt that has been made to solve the difficulty; the first actual effort beyond the propagation of ideas that have never fructified. I am proposing that a Select Committee shall be appointed, not to, interfere with railway matters in every or in any State, not to ask questions with reference to any railway matter, either of management or construction, but simply that they may be in a position to report for the information of the Federal Parliament, whether this appliance is of a character likely to bring about the achievement of that which has been hanging in the balance for a dozen years without anything having been done. Whether we own railway lines or not, the Commonwealth has large need of railway services, and has taken power to itself by the legislation of this Parliament to acquire the positive and sole use at certain times and in certain circumstances of all the railways. Our own legislation has been such as in certain contingencies to place the Commonwealth in the position of the sole user of the railways of Australia. But my motion is not submitted with any idea that we should demand anything from the States concerned in the ownership of the railways, but that we may assist them perhaps better than they can assist themselves in arriving at a conclusion upon a most important matter. For instance, there are two sets of Railways Commissioners, one in Melbourne and one in </para>

If, upon inquiry, we entertain the view that the appliance is one of great value to Australia, we might with all the courtesy possible, seek the cooperation of the Governments of the two States to bring the proposal to a successful issue or to give the appliance a full-sized trial. I think, therefore, that I&#39; am justified in bringing this matter before the Senate, even although at the present time the Commonwealth is (not the actual owner of a mile of railway. I have here a number of newspaper cuttings, showing that many other gentlemen besides the Governor-General have expressed a very strong interest, and have made full inquiry into * the working of this appliance. In December last, shortly before he left Australia, Governor Admiral Rawson took a keen interest in the appliance, and had the model fully explained to him. A newspaper report, referring to his inspection of the model, says - </para>

                                points out that it has always been recognised that if a third rail were laid down on the 5 ft. 3 in. tracks of Victoria and South Australia, to create with the 5 ft. 3 in., another track of 4 ft. 8^ in., using the distance rail in common for both gauges, it would be competent and practicable to run as well all the 5 ft. 3 in. trains, as all the 4 ft. 8i in. trains, on the same compound track. The difference in the gauges of New South Wales&#39; and Victoria is 6&#163; in., and while that space allows plenty of .room for running two trains on the one compound gauge track, the question of points and crossings to deal with rails only 6&#163; in. apart has hitherto been regarded as an insurmountable difficulty to the adoption of the mixed gauge lines of 4 ft. 8&#163; in., and 5 ft. 3 in., respectively, on the 5 ft. 3 in. track. That difficulty, the author states, has now been overcome by an invention called the &#34; Improvement in switches and crossings for compound gauge railways,&#34; which is specially designed to deal with the mixed gauges of 4 ft. 8i in., and 5 ft. 3 in., respectively.

S4 in. &#34; express,&#34; averaging thirty-three miles per hour, will be able to run the whole journey from the Queensland border through New South Wales, Albury, Victoria, and South Australia, to Terowie, a distance of 1,680 miles, with ordinary stoppages, in about fifty hours, as against 75! hours occupied at present.

                        <para class="block">All I seek is to bring together in concrete form the opinions of men of professional standing, who are competent to give authoritative information on the question. I have no idea that it would be necessary to take the evidence of more than, say, five or six witnesses; but so long as this important matter crystallizes no more than in fugitive paragraphs in the daily press-, one paragraph being forgotten before the next one appears, there is no opportunity for the formation of any useful public opinion, which, no doubt, would eventually impel the incurring of the necessary expense to give effect to a proposal which, if it is what it is said to be, is certainly worthy of a trial. Honorable senators will bear me out that I have quoted the opinion of no one but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Deane, because he is the highest authority in Australia, and his opinion does not require to be buttressed by that of any one else, and though I have mentioned the names of governors as taking an interest in, and expressing an approval of, the appliance, I hope I have not needlessly laboured my statement in any shape or way. I think I have shown how desirable it is to focus reliable knowledge on this point at a very small public expense. Public moneys have been spent lavishly on things with not a tithe of the consequence which is involved in my proposition. I undertake to say that there has been as much money spent in investigating voting machines as is involved in my. &#39;request. Two or three witnesses would have to be brought from Sydney, and the other witnesses could be examined here at probably no cost, because they would be mostly public servants who would not be entitled to fees for the information which they would give. At the cost of a little printer&#39;s ink and the necessary printing, the Commonwealth and the Parliaments of the States would be supplied with definite information on a proposal of great consequence. Honorable senators must admit that it is a proposal of the largest consequence. It does not seem to me possible that outside a few pounds for printing and travelling expenses, any expenditure would be required. I set my face absolutely against any inquiry of a roving character. I am not prepared to accept any amendment to enlarge the scope of the proposed inquiry. I do not wish to see a fishing committee appointed. I want the inquiry to be restricted to the one definite matter. I may say that, although I am not an engineer, I was so struck with the excellent manner in which the difficulties of break of gauge were overcome by the appliance, it was my own proposal that the Senate should be asked to appoint a Select Committee to gather into one focus valuable information that is available if the opportunity is offered for its collection and publication. That, sir, is briefly and solely the object I desire the appointment of a Select Committee to bring about. It will be seen from the terms of the motion that each State of the Commonwealth is to be represented on the Select Committee.  If it is thought desirable to appoint its members by ballot, that, of course, is in the will of the Chamber. I hope that the motion will be agreed to, as an inquiry cannot possibly do harm, offers probabilities of good, and of a success advantageous to each State of the Commonwealth, and of particular value to the producers and travellers therein. </para>

                            <para>- - I am very glad, indeed, to support the motion. At the Adelaide Convention, I brought forward a proposal for the federalizing of the railways, and I had a consultation with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy,</inline> Chief Commissioner of Railways for New South Wales. At that time, he was most anxious that there should be a unification of the gauges. He alleged, and was prepared to show, that although the expense would be very considerable, yet, in the course of a very short time, the saving in working expenses would much more than meet the interest on the outlay. He said it was a pity that any time should be lost &#39;in taking that step, because each State was continuing to construct railways on its own particular gauge. If any one looks up the debates at the Adelaide Convention, he will find that very interesting speeches on this subject were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> the present Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and, of course, I had something to say, as I brought forward the motion. In my opinion, there is no necessity for me to occupy much time on this occasion. I believe that the proposed Committee will be ample to get all the information required. Although it is true that the Commonwealth has no railways, yet it is proposed to take over the Northern Territory, and construct a railway there, and sooner or later to connect South Australia with Western Australia by railway. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is quite justified in bringing forward his proposal, although at the present time the States own all the railways. I hope that it will be carried, and that no time will be lost by the Select Committee in bringing up a report for our information. </para>

                            <para>. - No doubt this motion refers to a very important matter. My difficulty has been referred to not only by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> but also by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> and that is that the Commonwealth owns no railways, and that even if we were satisfied that the suggested method of overcoming the break of gauge difficulty is the best one, we would have no power to carry it into execution. As I have already said, the States are the sole owners of the railways. The Commonwealth cannot interfere with a single, length of rails; or with a sleeper, or with a dog. without the consent of one or other of the States. That being so, the appointment of the Select Committee proposed would involve an utterly useless expenditure... </para>

                        <para>Why should we duplicate expenditure in this connexion ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has told us that New South Wales is now inquiring into this very important matter. Consequently, if a Select Committee be appointed, we shall be able to obtain no more information from its investigations than is now available to the Mother State. I suppose that Victoria is also making inquiries in the same direction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has claimed that the expenditure that would be involved in the appointment of a Select Committee would be very small indeed. But I do not think that anybody can foretell what is likely to be the cost of an inquiry of this character. Probably there would be expense incurred in bringing witnesses from Sydney to Melbourne. If so, that would represent a considerable sum. I was a member of a Select Committee which had occasion to bring witnesses from Brisbane and Sydney to Melbourne, and I can assure honorable senators that I was . staggered at the cost which that step involved. # </para>

                                <para>- It was found that the Select Committee of which I speak could not visit Sydney, and, consequently, some witnesses had to be summoned to Melbourne, and at very great expense. If experts are to be brought from Sydney to make statements the gist of which is now in the possession of the New South Wales Government, it appears to me that the step will involve a useless expenditure of Commonwealth &#39; money. Why should we incur expenditure in collecting information which is now in the possession of the New South Wales Government, or which can be obtained by it at any moment? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has told us that inquiries have been in progress for a considerable time, &#34;and that the State Government in endeavouring to solve this very important and difficult .problem of introducing some substitute for a uniform gauge between Victoria and New South Wales, and ultimately throughout Australia. That being the case, why should the Commonwealth interfere? It has been urged that, although we possess no railways at present, we shall own some in the near future. That is extremely problematical. Nobody can say whether the Commonwealth will own a railway next year, or even in ten years hence. When it does own railways, there will be some justification for the expenditure of money in collecting information of the character desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> But long before that time arrives I believe that this question will have been satisfactorily solved by one or other of the State Governments. To appoint a Select Committee would involve an improper application of Commonwealth money. I need scarcely point out that our powers are limited by the Constitution. At present we have nothing whatever to do with railways. We cannot exercise control over a yard of them. Consequently the appointment of a Select Committee would involve the expenditure of money upon a subject in which the Commonwealth has no interest, and over which it can exercise no control. Why should we do that? Have we any money to spare? We know that our public Departments are starved for want of funds, that they are in a very inefficient condition, and! very inadequately equipped. Yet we are asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to do something which will undoubtedly cost money, which can be obtained only by still further starving those wretched Departments, which are in a very lean and unwholesome condition. </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has very moderate expectations in regard to the expense that would be incurred by the appointment of a Select Committee. My own experience is that the expenditure incurred by such bodies mounts in a way  that is entirely beyond the control of honorable senators. One move seems to necessitate another, and thus the Committee goes on from point to point, piling expense on expense, until in the end the total amount expended is out of all proportion to the importance of the subject which has been inquired into. I repeat that this is a matter that does not come within our purview. Our interest in the question of t he railway break of gauge is purely an academic one. </para>

                                <para>- If the fate of the transcontinental railway from South Australia to Western Australia depends on the support of the honorable senator, I am not sure that it will be constructed within five or ten years. If I am any judge, he is not too anxious that the Commonwealth should embark upon ventures of that description. In any case, it is admitted that at present our interest in the break of gauge question is purely a sentimental one. Then, again, if we take action in the direction suggested, we may be accused of interfering with State rights. If we initiate an inquiry into this matter, the Premier of New South Wales may come down on us like an avalanche. He may raise another storm of opposition to the Commonwealth Parliament, on the ground that it is invading the rights of the States. The same thing may happen in Victoria. I do not wish to arouse the opposition of the State Governments without very good reason. If we are to have a difference with them, it ought to be upon a question of some importance, and in which this Parliament may claim to have some interest. It has been urged that the Commonwealth has a right to take action in this matter, from the stand-point of defence. I admit that that is the strongest part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> contention. It would be a very great advantage in the transport of troops if we had some method by which one train might be run right through the settled portions of Australia. But even if the Commonwealth Government were to arrive at a decision in that connexion to-morrow, it has no power to enforce it upon the States. It is true that in the case of war, or a danger of war, it may assume control of the railways of the States. But it cannot do that until the Governor-General has issued a proclamation declaring that a condition of national danger exists which justifies the Commonwealth in taking that step. In the absence of such a proclamation the Commonwealth has no power to enforce its ideas upon the State Governments. I repeat that by appointing a Select Committee to investigate this matter we can gain no more information than is at present available to the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has informed us that the Governor-General and Governor Rawson recently inspected the working model of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brennan&#39;s</inline> appliance, but he did not tell us that the invention had been submitted to the railway experts of New South Wales and Victoria. If it has not been, I should like to know why not? If it has been, what has been the result? All this information can be obtained without imposing upon the Commonwealth the expense of a Select Committee. My frugal mind revolts at an unnecessary waste of public money. We have too little for our own legitimate Commonwealth purposes, and I object to any being wasted on fishing expeditions of this character. I have no doubt that the honorable senator is sincere in his desire to bring about the result sought to be achieved ; but let him bring his influence to bear upon the New South Wales Government. He can get all the information necessary from that source, and it can be supplied to us just as effectively as if we appointed a Select Committee, without the expenditure of a single farthing, of our money. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> like a true soldier, when he has hoisted his flag, never pulls it down until he is compelled ; and that- is very seldom. But if he will not withdraw the motion, I trust that the Senate will negative it. </para>

If the Senate intends to appoint this Committee - and I do not think it should -  it would be rather  singular if  an inquiry were made into one patent  only.  I have a letter from a New South Wales inventor, who claims that he has a patent to overcome the same  difficulty.  I do not know the  particulars  ; but he has asked me  to  see that he shall have the same opportunity of  explaining  his plans  as  any other inventor. That is a  perfectly  legitimate request. </para>

I feel sure that the South Australian Government would have been glad to adopt some such appliance at Hamley Bridge long ago. </para>

                            <para>. - I think the Senate would be well advised in rejecting both the amendment and the motion. I recognise, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that if there is to be any inquiry in regard to such matters as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has brought forward, it should extend to every invention that any inventor may choose to bring before the Committee. But that would undoubtedly mean a prolonged inquiry, and great expense to the  Commonwealth.  Probably the Committee would sit for five or six years before it was able to bring up a report in which it could say that it had exhausted its inquiries. Therefore I consider that we shall be doing our duty and saving unnecessary expenditure bv rejecting the motion. If the States which own the railways desire to do something in this direction, they can proceed without any question from the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                <para class="block">I am actuated in bringing forward this motion entirely by a desire to push on with urgent public business. I am satisfied that the same desire actuates every honorable senator. It has been the custom since I have been a member of the Senate, for this branch of the Legislature to sit only three days a week - on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays - with the exception that during the stormy period of the debates on the Tariff we sat much longer and more often than usual. We are now well into the present session. The other branch of the Legislature commences the week&#39;s operations on Tuesdays. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that fact, and probably the members elsewhere are more loquacious than we are. But that is not the point. I have before me a file, which, at this early period of the session, has upon it seven or eight important Bills, every one of which requires careful and deliberate consideration.- The first on the file is the Navigation Bill, which embraces 417 clauses, 400 of which have yet to be disposed of. It is a contentious Bill. I venture to say that if we had no other measure of first-class importance on the file the Navigation Bill could occupy us continuously almost to the end of the session. It Ls customary towards the end of the session to have an announcement made in connexion with the slaughter of the innocents. The Leader of the Senate brings forward a motion, with the object of discharging certain Bills from the notice-paper. We get through other measures in a great hurry, and without that deliberation which should be devoted to them. Hurry and want of due consideration would be obviated if we initiated a new departure at once, by sitting an extra day per week. Honorable senators would not be inconvenienced by so doing any more than are the members of the other branch of the Legislature. But, seeing that we are paid to transact the country&#39;s business, we ought to be here when required, whether to do so is convenient or- otherwise. I trust that the Government will recognise the advisable- ness of agreeing to the motion, and that the Senate will see the necessity of doing so. We are faced at present with a fairly large file of Bills. The number has yet to be increased by an Old-age Pensions Bill, and other measures which will demand our  closest attention. I do not think that these measures can receive the deliberate consideration which should be given them if we are content to sit only three days in the week. </para>

                    <para>. - I was particularly pleased to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that in submitting his motion he was animated solely by a desire to push on with business. I trust that during the course of the session the sincerity of that desire will be strongly manifested when honorable senators are called upon to deal with the business placed before them. That this motion would offer any guarantee that the Senate would proceed with business more expeditiously is a matter on which I entirely disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> When the honorable senator pointed out that the House of Representatives sits four days in the week, and the Senate only three, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> interjected, with a reply that seems to me to be complete, that the House of Representatives has a membership of seventy-five as against thirty-six in the Senate. Even assuming that every member of the Senate spoke at as great length as do honorable members in another place it is easy to discover by a simple process of arithmetic that we should be able to complete our business in half the time occupied by the House of .Representatives. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> testimony given only a few minutes ago that we do not talk at the same length as do our fellow members of Parliament in another place. That being so, on the honorable senator&#39;s own showing, his proposal should have been not that we should sit for an extra day in each week, but that we -should sit one day less in each week. , I do not propose to move an amendment in that direction ; but viewing the matter seriously, I would ask honorable senators to say whether at present there is any reason why we should place this additional burden upon ourselves. Looking through the business-paper, and recalling the experience of the past, I venture to ask honorable senators to support the contention that we can satisfactorily discharge the business with which we are likely to be confronted by sitting three days in each week. If, later on, as business begins to come to us from the other branch of the Legislature, we find that we require additional time in which to transact it, the Government will probably invite the Senate to meet earlier in the week than we do at present. </para>

But on this occasion I agree with almost everything that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said. I do not believe in members of the Senate talking just for talk&#39;s sake. We have only half the- number of members there are in another place; we are no more voluble than they are, and we should be able to do the same amount of business in two days that another place can do in four days. I wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that the sessional orders are always agreed to by the Senate with the proviso, &#34; unless otherwise ordered.&#34; The Senate can at any time order that we shall sit another day or another two days in each week. </para>

                        <para>- But what are we going to do if we meet an additional day in each week? Are we to sit here discussing abstract motions, trying to keep pace with another place where there are seventy-five great talkers, while we have only thirty-six ordinary talkers? I do not say &#34; small &#34; talkers, because, on this side, we deprecate small talk. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> could scarcely have been serious when he suggested that the Senate occupied more time in dealing with the Tariff than did another place. We did not occupy half the time occupied by another place in the discussion of the Tariff. For the last nine years the Senate has followed the same  practice in connexion with the days of sitting, and we have found that it works very well. In almost every session hitherto we have found it necessary to have two or three adjournments to allow another place to overtake us with work. If we were to increase the number of our sitting days we should make such adjournments even more necessary in this session than they have been in the past. I think it would be wise for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to become a little more Conservative, and to be more content to follow in this respect the practice of the past. I am sure that every member of the Senate will assist the honorable senator, and the representatives of the Government, to compel the Senate to sit on all days on which it would be necessary to carry on the business of the country expeditiously. I hope that the honorable senator will withdraw his motion. </para>

                    <para>. - For the consideration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and the Senate generally, I desire to offer a few reasons why I think the motion should be withdrawn. The Senate is asked to request the Standing Orders Committee to consider a subject which it is quite evident, from the terms of the motion, we are assumed not to have considered. If we did give such a direction to the Committee, I think it would be taken for granted that the Senate had approved of the preparation of a standing order for the limitation of speeches, but there is no indication that it has done so. As the motion stands, it does not ask the Senate to affirm a belief in the limitation of speeches or the contrary. It simply requests the Sessional Committee to consider the propriety of doing so. What is the good of asking that body to do that if the Senate is utterly opposed to the proposal ? I submit to my honorable friend that, if he wishes to test the opinion of the Senate, the first thing to do is to submit a clear and definite motion favouring the limitation of speeches, and, if that is carried, it will give to the Sessional Committee a clear indication of what is wanted. For that reason, I think that he is going rather the wrong way about the business. Mechanical devices for expediting business always seem to me to miss the real crux of the difficulty. In spite of the exceptional case which naturally occurs to one&#39;s mind of an individual speech of inordinate length, I venture to say that if there is any undue consumption of time in Parliament, it is not so much through the length of individual speeches as through the number of speeches made by individuals. </para>

                        <para>- That did occur to me, and the reference to the speech entirely confirms the opinion I am putting forward, and that is that speeches of that inordinate length are very few. Whatever time I may have consumed on that occasion in what I fear was a very vain effort to enlighten my honorable friend, the fact remains that I have consumed very much more time in  individual speeches of much shorter duration. It is not the few speeches of great length which seem to excite public indignation; it is the multiplicity of speeches and the number of times which individual senators speak which really account for the great consumption of time. </para>

                        <para>- There might be a time when the Senate would feel it to be desirable to suspend the Standing Orders in this respect, and allow any one who was specially qualified to deal with a subject to speak at length ; that, of course, goes without question. But, in connexion with the ordinary business of Parliament, honorable senators must recognise that we waste a great deal of time, and that it would be in the interests of the country, and also tend to promote the respectability of parliamentary institutions, if some reasonable limit were put to the length of speeches. I shall be glad if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will consent to his motion being amended to read in this way - </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator had adopted my motion as it stood, I would have been well satisfied. I think that a very good case can be established for limiting the duration of speeches. We have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> dwell on the subject, and I am sure that there is no more eminent authority in this Parliament than himself. I remember one occasion when he spoke for about seven hours on one day, and at the end of that period, to the relief of several honorable senators - I am sure that we were all glad to listen to him - he asked to be allowed to continue his speech on the next day of sitting, and he did so, for several hours. Taken altogether, his performance on the two occasions was a very respectable one. For that reason, I admit at once that he is an excellent authority as to how long speeches ought to be. Evidently he thinks that he overstepped the bounds of prudence on that occasion, and he is exceedingly anxious that no one else shall have an opportunity to follow his example. </para>

                        <para>- Evidently the honorable senator has repented, and is so conscious of the sin he committed as to be anxious to prevent any one else from doing the same thing. One object I had in submitting my motion last session was to insure to every honorable senator, if he desired to speak, the right to be heard on any public question. That right is taken away  by a standing order which I think is unconstitutional. I do not believe that the Senate has the power to deprive any duly elected representative of the people from being heard here. When it does a thing of that kind, it interferes with the very root and foundation of representative government. We have a standing order which empowers the majority to stop a  speaker  at any moment, and put an end to the debate. As matters stand now, the majority, if it likes, can prevent the minority from being heard on any subject by applying the closure. That power, I maintain, does not belong to the Senate, nor should it be exercised. While I hold that every honorable senator has the right to speak, I &#39;admit that the Senate has the power to say how often he should be heard, and at what duration, and it ought to exercise that power. If we had a time limit for speeches, both in the Committee and in the Senate, that would insure every honorable senator being heard if he desired to speak. I remember that on one occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> charmed the Senate with his eloquence for a period of five or six hours. When several senators consume so much of the public time, that very fact very often deprives other senators of an opportunity to speak. Several speakers who _ drag out a debate at- an unconscionable length may so tire the Senate or the Committee that it will do what in ordinary circumstances it would be very chary about doing; and that is, apply the closure. I have referred to long speeches delivered by Senators Pulsford and Millen. There are other speakers to whom I might refer. All that it is necessary for any honorable senator to say on . a question which crops up here can be comfortably said within an hour. This is not a place nowadays for discussion. If I talked here with the eloquence of Demosthenes or the force of Cicero- </para>

He merely attaches himself to a party and votes with it. No amount of argument from the opposite side of the Chamber can induce him to do otherwise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> occupies an exactly similar position. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> Ave  realized the enormity of our offence, and have not repeated it. It does not matter what an honorable senator may say in this Chamber, he cannot influence a single vote. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that speech here is a waste of breath and of energy which might well be conserved and used in other directions. The newspapers do not report our utterances, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - owing to the fact that it is so expensive, and that it is not carried through the post at anything like the same rate that is charged upon newspapers - is not circulated and read by our constituents as it ought to be. The <inline font-style="italic">Age, Argus,</inline> and other large newspapers circulate reports of, and comments upon, the proceedings in Parliament, and the Post and Telegraph Department charge them only a half-penny for ten ounces. But ten ounces of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> sent through the post&#39; costs twopence halfpenny. That is another reason why honorable senators should not talk very much here, and why a limit should be imposed on the duration of speeches. But I do think that it is unfair to the public that garbled accounts of the proceedings of Parliament should be circulated at the rate of ten ounces for one half-penny, whilst the real genuine reports which are taken down by the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff should be charged at the rate of twopence half-penny for the same weight. I support the spirit of this motion, and will do anything in reason to bring about the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has in view. But if speeches in the Senate and in Committee are limited in duration, I shall insist - so far as I am concerned - upon the entire abolition of what is known as the &#34; gag.&#34; . </para>

I believe that there are places in America where a similar rule has been adopted ; and I understand that it has worked very well. I quite agree that if an honorable senator has some particular matter which he desires to bring under the notice of the Senate, he should be allowed a fair time in which  to do it. Nevertheless, I believe it would be an advantage to the Senate, and that it would save a good deal of expense in the matter of printing <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> if a limit were imposed upon the speeches which are delivered here. I sympathize a good deal with the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that if the plan suggested were adopted there would be no diced for the application of the closure.

                        <para>- At the present time, the Senate sits only two and a-half days per week. Surely we could not render the people less service than we do, in view of the remuneration which we receive. Our time is not so precious as to justify the adoption of this motion. Indeed, I think that the Government have been granted a_ little&#39; too much time, judging by their unpreparedness to transact business. I maintain that neither the state of public business nor experience points to any necessity for such a motion. I am certainly not amongst the long-winded members of the Chamber, and, consequently, I am not speaking from a party or personal stand-point. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> had in view his own colleagues from New South Wales, when he submitted this proposition. Undoubtedly, they have been the greatest sinners in this Chamber . from the standpoint of making long speeches. We all know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is capable of in that direction, although he has recently lost the championship. All the long-winded speakers in this Parliament come from New South Wales; and, therefore, it was not a friendly action on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to submit a motion which will hit his colleagues so hard. The honorable senator must be aiming his boomerang at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> or at the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

                        <para>- I would place more faith in the opinion entertained by previous Governments in that connexion than I would in the opinion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I repeat  that there has never been any urgent necessity for the application of the &#34;gag&#34; in this Chamber, and! I hope that there never will be. &#39;But the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> seems to me to tend in that direction, notwithstanding that there is net the slightest justification for it. As- 1 have already pointed out  the days upon which the Senate meets are so few that if the state of public business warrants us in sit-, ting more frequently than we do, the number of our sittings even then will only equal those of other Parliaments in Australia. The Senate is the last place in which a motion of this kind should be submitted. There is another factor to be considered in connexion with this motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has evidently given scant attention to the matter. He has not advanced a single reason for his proposition. He simply moved it. Apparently, having put it on the business-paper, he. had forgotten all about it until some one drew his attention to it this evening. Then, apparently thinking that we had so little business to do, he came to the conclusion that the time would be well occupied by debating his motion. If he had given more attention to it he would probably have recognised the ridiculousness of bringing it forward under existing circumstances. The adoption of the motion would involve an interference with freedom of speech. </para>

                    <para>. - 1 understand that the motion has been amended with the object of submitting the whole question to the Standing Orders Committee. But in the form in which the proposition now stands it would be an instruction to the Committee to bring up a draft standing order for the limitation of the time of speaking. The motion would practically assert that the Senate is desirous of adopting such a standing order. I am not inclined to go so far as&#39; that. We do not wish to give an imperative instruction to the Standing Orders Committee ; and, consequently, I shall not vote for the, motion in its amended form. </para>

                        <para>- I am happy to say that there is not the slightest chance of such a public calamity occurring. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> offered no historical example .in favour of his proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline> hilarity on the present occasion must be due to the prospect that lies before him. Perhaps he thinks that if the motion be carried, he will not be under the necessity of making the lengthy speeches that he has felt himself obliged to make in the past. That might be a matter of relief to him personally ; but I must appeal to the honorable senator to consider the interests of others, whose facility of expression is perhaps occasionally greater than his own, and who may feel that the interests of public duty prevail with them on occasions to make speeches slightly longer than those that honorable senators of less experience feel under an obligation to make. We read the other day that the members of one of the French Chambers of Legislature have now to sign an attendance sheet, and the press has likened them to a parcel of schoolboys. If the Senate of Australia were deliberately to pass a motion* in favour of limiting not the number of words spoken, but the time occupied, we should be placed in an equally ridiculous position. It is well known that some honorable senators, when speaking under great pressure, work off their eloquence at the rate of about fifty-three words per minute. There are others whose speed runs up to about 360 words a minute. Why limit the senator who laboriously ploughs through his verbal furrow to the same length of time as is occupied by a senator who can speak five or six times as rapidly? </para>

                    <para>. - If this motion be carried, it is possible that honorable senators may never again have the opportunity and pleasure of addressing you, sir, at length upon any subject. Therefore, I propose to take advantage of this, the last opportunity ; especially as I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is extremely anxious to proceed with other business before half-past 10 o&#39;clock. I admit that there is much to be said on both sides of the question. I propose to say a little on each side. We are asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to submit to a time limit on speeches. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> said, in supporting the motion, that he would be quite willing to agree to the proposition, provided the standing order relating to the &#34; gag &#34; were removed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> very cogently argued that the &#34;gag&#34; was unconstitutional, inasmuch as its application would prevent the representatives of the people from voicing their opinions in this, which is the representative Chamber of the States. But I submit that the &#34;gag&#34; and the limitation of speeches are within the same category. If an honorable senator has a large question to discuss, and is unable to conclude his arguments within a quarter of an hour, half an hour, or an hour, as the case may be, and if it be unconstitutional to stop him from speaking at all, it is equally unconstitutional to prevent him from speaking at such length as will enable him to submit his arguments sufficiently, why should he be compelled to stop before he has exhausted his arguments? </para>

                        <para>- What is the use of having Standing Orders if they can be suspended at any time? I am willing to admit, on the other side of the argument, that if senators are allowed to speak at length, liberty may degenerate into license ; and that by granting unlimited license in that respect to certain honorable senators we may deprive others of the opportunity to speak at all.. That is a cogent argument, and it is the principal argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> in support of the limitation of speeches. </para>

I know that he was then the avowed champion of the Free Traders of Australia, and, as such, was entitled to the fullest possible liberty to voice the opinions of the people he represented. I was not here at the time, but I understand that he did so fully ; and I suppose he did so in his usual effective style. But, having enjoyed the liberty to speak fully on behalf of the people he represented, the honorable senator now seconds a motion to deprive any one else of the right to do the same. </para>

I have referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> speech on the Tariff. On such a question, affecting the interests of every commercial and producing industry in Australia, it was scarcely possible for an honorable senator having the supreme knowledge of the subject possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> to do justice to it in any. shorter time than he occupied. I have no quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> because he occupied a long time on that occasion. I am trying to justify the liberty he enjoyed. I have not suggested that in his hands it degenerated into license; but, having enjoyed that liberty himself, he now desires to deny every other member of the Senate, and every other body of thought in the Commonwealth, the same opportunity to find expression in the Senate. </para>
