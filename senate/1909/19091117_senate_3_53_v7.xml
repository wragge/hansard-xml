                <para class="block">The matter which I wish to bring before the Senate has attracted great attention in Western Australia. Although it has been, perhaps, a little more prominent recently than formerly, still it is rather an old standing public grievance, which is being aggravated by the fact that the unemployed evil is spreading in the State. I do not know whether that evil exists in all the States, but when men come to be thrown out of employment by strangers to the country they feel that "they have a genuine grievance which they naturally look to Parliament to remedy in some way. I have to complain that Australian workmen are being denied work in the timber-cutting industry of Western Australia, and that foreigners have practically obtained a monopoly of that work. Timber cutting in the State, more particularly on the goldfields, is in the hands of foreigners who, to a great extent, do not intend to become naturalized, or even citizens. That has been shown in more ways than one. A constant stream of new chums is employed, and when they have made a few -pounds the bulk of them return to their own country, only a very small percentage remaining in Australia. I do not mean to say that there are not a number of foreigners who come to Western Australia and are naturalized. </para>
                <para class="block">But the timber-cutting industry is notorious for the number of new chums which it employs, and who for the most part clear out when they have saved a few pounds, and leave the country very little the richer for their presence. When  we consider how the Australian has been displaced in the industry, and has to travel in search of work, and new chums can go straight from the boats, so to speak, and get employment apparently without difficulty or delay, it is time, I think, that we looked into the working of our Immigration Acts, with a view to seeing whether advantage ' is not taken of our own people. The Government came into office to deal with the unemployment question, but it is of very little use for us to allow the employment -we have to be taken away from our people by those who are practically aliens, and consider ways and means to find employment  in some other direction. We should endeavour to see that our own people get as much of the work available as we can possibly secure to them. At all events, we should try to prevent a preference from being given to foreigners. I hold in my hand1 some figures which will prove the accuracy of my statement. I assure the Senate that they have been supplied by a man who is in- a position to give reliable information concerning the labour engaged in this industry. Having carefully' investigated the matter, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have every faith in the figures which he has compiled. </para>

If these aliens were coming in under open contract, our complaint, perhaps, would take a different form from that we are now making. So far as I know, they are not coming in under written contract, but in another way. That they are coming in in a manner which is not satisfactory to the workmen of Western Australia is beyond any doubt. </para>

A great deal of investigation would hi&gt;ve to be undertaken before any definite proof could be obtained. All that I propose to do is to show that a very large percentage of the workmen who are engaged in timber cutting on the gold-fields are foreigners, and that, being foreigners, they apparently get a preference. I propose to give the names of the various companies by which they are employed. </para>

                        <para>- I am very sorry to have to interrupt the honorable senator and take up a part of his time. But under our practice he can only discuss the matter which is set out in his notice. He has moved the adjournment of the Senate for one distinct object, and that is to discuss " the administration of the Contract Immigrants Act in Western Australia." The debate must be connected with the administration of the Act. The fact that foreigners have come in and got work would be properly discussed on another motion for the adjournment -of the.. Senate. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I desire to discuss. I want to show that a very low- percentage of the men who are employed in the timber cutting industry are what may be called our own workmen. For instance, the timber concession, which is generally known as the  Kurrawang  Company, the managing director of which is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> N. Hedges, M.P., employs only 20 Britishers as against 316 foreigners. It will be seen therefore that there is an overwhelming preponderance of foreigners employed as against Britishers. At Kur.ramia 29 Britishers are engaged and 166 foreigners; at Lakeside 19 Britishers and 170 foreigners; and at Lancefield 15 Britishers . and 37 foreigners. At the Lancefield Gold Mine 70 foreigners are employed; at the Orion Gold Mine there are no Britishers, but 40 foreigners, making a total in the places which I have mentioned of 83 Britishers and 767 foreigners. These figures, so far as they relate" to Kurrawang and the Orion Gold Mine, were compiled on the 1 st June of the present year, those relating to Lakeside and Kurramia  were compiled on the 25th June, and those relating to Lancefield on the 1st July. It will be seen that the existing state of affairs is far from satisfactory to our own people. I believe that if the Department of External Affairs conducted an inquiry into this question, sworn evidence would be obtainable, and absolute proof forthcoming, as to the accuracy of the figures which I have quoted. Of course, I can only submit circumstantial evidence in this connexion. But that evidence is so strongly in favour of my contention that the Contract Immigrants Act is not being properly administered, that I think it will be generally recognised that it is time we took some steps to prevent a continuance of present conditions. That the Statute is being loosely administered is best evidenced by the circumstance that immediately upon their arrival in Western Australia foreigners, are able to obtain employment in the timber industry, notwithstanding that native-born Australians who may be upon the ground are being' refused employment. A very pointed illustration of the policy which is being pursued by the timber companies occurred quite recently, when an </para>

                <para class="block">Australian workman of very dark complexion, who bears a close resemblance to an Italian, was approached by the " boss " of one of the companies, and informed that if he had any friends in Italy, he might send for them, and they would be sure to secure work the moment that they arrived. When the " boss " discovered that he was talking to an Australian, his chagrin may well be imagined. Surely it is possible for the officers of the Department of External Affairs to ascertain whether or not a preference is being granted to foreigners. </para>

If one goes to the railway station after the arrival of a steamer he will find these men making straight for the goldfields, and if they are asked where they are going, they reply, "  choppa  de wood." If one says, "Good morning" to them, they reply, " choppa de wood." If on the gold-fields they are asked what they are doing, they reply, " shovel de mullock." Wherever they go they are found work, and our own workmen may often be seen carrying their swags looking for work. The member for Fremantle in the Federal Parliament is responsible, in a large degree, and more than any other individual in the State, for the importation of these men and finding them employment. </para>

                            may think it is a very good thing for his own countrymen to be carrying swags whilst new chums are usurping the employment which they should get- If we arP: going  to.  insist that even' Australian citizen shall defend his country, it is our bounden duty to see that he gets a fair deal in the matter of obtaining employment. To provide a foreigner with work which is denied to an Australian, and to insist that the latter shall defend his country, is obviously so unfair a proposition that it will never be countenanced by the people, as those who advocate granting a preference to foreigners will discover at the forthcoming general elections. Considerations of greed alone underlie the granting of this unpatriotic preference. The timber industry in Western Australia is worked by contract, and the men are paid for the timber which they cut at the rate ot  4s. 3d.  per ton. The timber is weighed in trucks which belong to a private company, which company has had false weights painted upon them. This company does not sell its timber to the gold mines from the waggons in which it purchases it. The timber is purchased in its private waggons and is sold in the Government waggons.

Members of the Labour party entertain no objection whatever to the introduction into Australia of Italians, but we do protest against granting them a preference  in  the matter of securing employment over our own people. I would object to such at preference being extended even to immigrants from the Old Country. As a matter of fact, I protested against Scotchmen' being allowed to be brought out here, under contract, to work at Korumburra whilst a strike was in progress there a few years ago. We do not object to the introduction of Italians upon the ground that they areforeigners. </para>

                        <para>- I do not lay emphasis upon that fact. What I do say is that they should not be granted a preference over our own workmen. Do  we  not all recollect the heroism exhibited by a trade unionist in Western Australia who risked his own life to rescue an Italian workman ? Do we forget the exploit of Diver Hughes at Bonnie Vale? He performed one of the most heroic acts recorded in Australian history, and I mention <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> exploit merely for the purpose of showing that the men who are complaining are not animated by any petty spite towards Italians. As a matter of fact, many good citizens on? our gold-fields belong to that nationality. My complaint is that they are being taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers. Those employers, I am pleased to say, are few in Western Australia. We have  as  fine employers in that State as are to be found in any part of the Commonwealth, but a few of them are prepared to make use of new-chum Italians for the purposes I have described, and that is what I  want  to prevent by the proper administration of the Act, which should be applied  in  such a way as to discontinue a practice that is unfair, unpatriotic, and ought to be ended at the earliest opportunity. </para>

                        <para>- I will show quite clearly why this practice is being pursued. The question has been asked why preference is given to these workmen? The answer is easy. Those who administer the Contract Immigrants Act, if they take the trouble to find out the reasons, will soon discover that a close administration is necessary to protect Australian workmen, and in many cases to protect workmen who are being brought to Australia probably by the method of contracting. The task of discovering the devices used may be difficult, owing to the insidious methods of those interested. They ask Antonio to send for his brother, his cousin, or his uncle, and guarantee that Antonio's relatives shall find employment immediately they arrive, regardless of whether the employment of the new arrivals means the displacement of an equal number of Britishers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it is done in connexion with farming, but, if so, it ought not to be. It ought not to be done, in connexion with any industry where men are supposed to be equal. These Italians are not employed because of their superior skill. The contrary is the fact. We have evidence which shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> N. Hedges and others engaged in the limber industry are content to employ Italians to cut their firewood, but nevertheless pay Australian carters 13s. 4d. per day. I will stake my existence on the fact that not a solitary Italian is to be found driving for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges.</inline> The drivers are all Britishers, but when it comes to cutting firewood at so much per ton it is to the advantage of the employers holding timber concessions to employ a thousand men in preference to five hundred, especially if they get the thousand for somewhat less than they would have to pay five hundred Britishers. Many of the men who employ Italians to cut their firewood also run stores, and naturally they desire to have the largest possible number of consumers on their books. They take all sorts of care to supply their workers, at the highest prices they can get,. with the necessaries of life. Any one can see that they can make far more from the consumption of one thousand men than from that of five hundred. Therefore, it is to the advantage of these people to attract numbers of men into their employment. Not long ago the Kurrawang Company had in its employment a man who was confronted by it with a book debt of some . £12. The company actually produced against him bills dated November and December of last year, just two months before he came to Western Australia. They kept the poor fellow working for four solid months, and then cheered him up by telling him that he was in the glorious position of owing a balance of about£3 to the company for stores. He was a new chum, of whom they thought they could take advantage. But the secretary of the Trade Union stepped in, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges'</inline> company, as usual, paid up the £12 that they had retained. As soon as they found that the business was getting into the hands of men who knew what they were doing they abandoned their tactics. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has been "hedging" ever since he began to live, and I suppose he will continue to " hedge " until the end of his time. I am showing the disgraceful position of affairs that is existent to-day in spite of the fact that we have a Contract Immigrants Act upon our statute-book. We have evidence of so strongly circumstantial a character that the Act is being evaded that very close investigation is needed, and if it can be shown that improper methods are being employed to induce Italian immigration, the Department should take action. If the Act is inadequate to meet the situation, I have not the slightest doubt that. Parliament would readily review the position, and pass such legislation as would prevent employers from using unfair means of taking advantage, either of men who are already in the country, or of those whom Italians now here are desirous of bringing to Australia. </para>

                    (Western Australia [3.14]. - The figures quotes by Senator de Largie are such as should make us pause, and they certainly furnish a case for inquiry. That foreigners are coming into Western Australia [3.14]. - The figures quotes by Senatorlia and displacing British workers there is not the shadow of a doubt. The number of foreigners employed on the wood lines in Western Australia is very much in excess of the number pf British workmen. I am not in a position to say whether they are brought in under contract. I cannot for a moment say that the Act is being broken, but that there has been evasions of the Act I am perfectly sure. It has come under my own personal observation in Western Australia that numbers of these men, on arriving at the Fremantle wharf, are met by one or two of their fellow countrymen.

                    <para>- These immigrants are immediately transported f from the wharf to the wood lines controlled by the Kurrawang syndicate and other employers. They have no trouble about looking for work. But there 'are Australians who are roaming about the streets unable to obtain employment. I would ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether that is not an outrage? There is another phase of the question which ought to be seriously considered. Under a Bill which is now before the Senate for consideration, it is proposed to ask the citizens of Australia to equip themselves for the defence of this country. But if we can give them no assurance of employment, and if, on the contrary, preference in employment is given to foreigners, how can we ask them to defend not only their own hearths and homes, but also the interests of employers? I have no antipathy to Europeans. I realize that they make very admirable citizens. We have passed a Tariff law giving preference to British goods, but Australian employers are giving preference to foreign workmen. </para>

We know that in the country from which most of these foreigners come conscription laws are in force, and men are obliged to go through a certain period of military training. After these foreigners have been in continuous employment in Western Australia for some time, and have displaced our own countrymen, they respond to the call of their country, and go back to serve their time as conscripts. Our own Australian workmen are denied a means of earning a livelihood in order that employment may be found for these people. </para>

                        <para>- He is a direct employer of men engaged on these wood lines. He is absolutely responsible for the employment of these men. The position is a very serious one, and demands close inquiry by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has put the case in  a  nutshell. He has not condemned the employers of labour generally in Western Australia, nor has he shown any hostility to European immigrants. The object is to direct the attention of the Department responsible for the administration of the Contract Immigrants Act to the fact that its provisions are being evaded.. When these foreigners land at Fremantle they are met by some of their fellow countrymen, probably under instructions from their employers, are taken direct to the Kalgoorlie express, and transported to the" wood lines. The disproportion in the numbers of Britishers and foreigners employed on the wood lines justifies a strict inquiry by the Government. I support the motion, and I trust that the Minister of External Affairs will see that an inquiry is made to discover in what way the Act is being evaded, and whether some arrangement cannot be made whereby Australian workmen will be given a preference over foreign workmen. If, after Australian workmen have been found employment there is room for others there can be no objection to the employment of foreigners by these companies. At present it is with the companies a question of employing cheap labour in order that they may work their wood lines as economically as possible. I hope that a full inquiry will be at once entered upon by the Department concerned. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has made out a strong case for an inquiry by the Minister of External Affairs into the operation of the Contract Immigrants Act. The fact that at one place in Western Australia 316 foreigners are employed as against twenty Britishers should be sufficient, even, though there be no positive evidence that these foreigners are being introduced under contract, to induce the Government to make inquiries as to how they are being brought here. In these times we hear a great deal of talk about preference to the Old Country. Some honorable senators who have interjected during this debate were ardent supporters of the principle of preference to British goods when the Tariff was under discussion. But when it is a question of giving preference to British labour they are loud in their protests against it. I wish to be clearly understood, that I have no objection to the introduction of Europeans. I am prepared to welcome immigrants from any part of Europe, but I object to their introduction under contract or under any kind of understanding that they will be given preference in employment over people who are already in Australia, and sadly in need of work. No one who is acquainted with Western Australia will deny that that State has suffered in the past and is suffering to-day more from the evil now complained of than any other State in the group. As soon as these foreigners land at Fremantle they are carried away at once to the busy centres of population, and somehow manage to obtain work whilst the men who have opened up the country for them are vainly looking for it. There is' something more than a coincidence in this. Although these foreigners are not usually regarded as being very keen, it is evident that they are following the example of some of our commercial friends in Australia and are acting in accordance with an " honorable understanding." It is easy, to believe that if they do not come here under contract they come under an understanding that they will be given preference in employment when they land here. Evidence in support of this contention can be secured from every district in Western Australia in which the mining and wood-cutting industries are carried on. </para>

                        <para>- It has been considerably reduced since the industry first started. Honorable senators on this side have been charged with bringing forward this matter as an electioneering cry. The charge is so despicable that it is not worthy replying to. I need only mention that the Western Australian Government", the members of which are inveterate opponents of labour, have actually proposed to limit the number of foreigners who shall be employed to every Britisher in the mines. They have brought forward a measure which provides that no person shall be employed below ground unless he possesses a know ledge of the English language. We know that whilst men who do not understand English may be prevented from working underground, there is plenty of work on the surface of a mine in which foreigners may be employed. I flatly contradict the suggestion that the submission of this motion is an electioneering dodge by pointing out thai the political party in Western Australia, which is opposed to the La ba* party, is alive to the necessity of regulating this traffic in European labour which has so far proved to be such an evil. </para>

                        <para>- It is not my business to suggest a remedy for the evil, further than to say that the officers of the Department concerned should make a strict inquiry into the methods by which these people are introduced into Australia and given preference in employment at the mines. If honorable senators opposite who interject were in the position of their countrymen in the West, who have "blazed the track," they would take a very different view of this question, and they would not cavil at the efforts now being made to secure a reasonable preference in employment for the men who have made work possible in Western Australia. Some honorable senators . may not be aware that white people in Western Australia are sometimes obliged to work for Afghans and Hindoos in order to get a living. I do not know whether this is due to an eva'sion of the Contract Immi-grants Act or not. </para>

                        <para>- I refer to the matter only in passing. Some persons believe that these Afghans and Hindoos have been introduced under a lax administration of our immigration laws. Some of them may have come to Australia before Federation, but since the passing of our immigration laws there is reason to believe that there has not been a sufficiently close scrutiny of the persons introduced under them. In my opinion, the fact that white people have to work for Afghans and Hindoos is, in itself, sufficient to justify an inquiry into this matter. It is said that we are "hedging" but, as a matter of fact, we are striving to put down " hedging " as much as we can. Quite, a considerable time ago  60  per cent, of the persons engaged in the wood-cutting industry were foreigners. I was engaged in an arbitration case in connexion with the industry and  60  per. cent, of the names of the persons employed in it ended in "i" or in "o." It was common knowledge that the pay-roll of the company, controlled at that time by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> was made up almost entirely of foreign names. Since that time things have been going from bad to worse, and when foreigners are being introduced, as they are at present in Western Australia, the closest inquiry should be made into the terms on which they are brought here? </para>

                        <para>- I can only say that contracting has been universally condemned by the Labour unions in the western State, because it has been recognised that that system has been resorted to for the purpose of cutting down wages and trading on the ignorance of the foreigners. That has been shown to be the case over and over again. We have no positive evidence to submit that the Act has been violated.  We" can only point to the effects of what we believe to be a lax administration of the law, whereby our countrymen are obliged occasionally to work for coloured people, because they have been elbowed out of the only employment there is, by foreigners. I hope that the Minister will take immediate action to see that a remedy is applied. </para>

                    <para>. - The adjournment of the Senate was moved, I understood, as I assume that you did, sir, for the purpose of drawing attention to a lax administration of the Contract Immigrants Act; but I listened in vain for any evidence that there is a lax administration of the Act in any particular. We have heard some statements of facts which have absolutely no relation to that question. It should be remembered that that Act is only effective at the port of entry. Whether an employer shall give preference to a man who has come from abroad or to one who was born in the country, is a matter quite beyond the ken of our legislation. Listening to the demands of honorable senators for preference to Australian, workmen, one would assume that that question was involved in the administration of the Contract Immigrants Act ; but that is not so. One half of the matters which apparently are troubling honorable senators to-day, are matters which are not under Federal jurisdiction. Take, for instance, the question of whether owners are allowed to defraud their workmen by false weights painted on their waggons. What has that to do with the administration of a Federal Act? It says very little indeed for the efforts of State politicians if they have not been able to take steps to punish a flagrant fraud like that, assuming, of course, that it has been committed. I remind honorable senators who ask that an inquiry shall be made into the administration of the Contract Immigrants Act, that an investigation has been, proceeding almost ever since it was brought: into force. This matter has been under close official supervision during the <inline font-style="italic">regimeof</inline> every Government. According to the papers which have been placed in my possession, the first Minister who appears to&gt; have taken action on complaints which apparently rested on no sounder foundation than the complaints made here to-day, was. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> Apparently impressed by the complaints, he selected, not an official, but some person known to himself, to make an inquiry and to' report. This gentleman made it his business to go on board the ships, move amongst the men, and conduct an inquiry. He reported that he could find' no evidence of any contracting having taken place; but he indicated what appears to me to be a natural solution of the difficulty. He said it appeared to him that a. number of these men, finding that they were able to earn good wages in the industry, were naturally tempted to write to friends and relatives, and point out to them that they would better their condition by coming to Australia. That men who came out on such an invitation should be met at the wharf - an act which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> seemed to regard as most outrageous - by their countrymen is natural. </para>

                    <para>We are of opinion that it is very unlikely that any aliens are imported under any actual contract or agreement, but we think it very probable that some of them have been induced to come by letters from friends already here who are in a position to get them work on their arrival. Many, however, seem to have come out quite on the chance of getting employment, and have had to go from place to place a good deal before finding any. It is quite possible, nevertheless, that some secret understanding may have existed at times between persons here and in Europe whereby men were sent out to work for contractors in this State, but we do not think that this has gone on to any considerable ex&lt; rent, if at all. </para>

                <para class="block">That is probable, even with the qualifying words " if at all," which throw a doubt on the preceding sentences- the nearest approach which I think my honorable friends will find to any official countenance of the statements which they have made here this afternoon. Some time afterwards, ex-Senator Playford, who was then a. Minister of the Crown., visited Western Australia, and a deputation asked him to take steps to stop the influx of Italians and other foreigners. He pointed out that it was not the policy of the Immigration Acts, or the policy of Australia, to exclude Europeans and that that had never been the practice. He referred to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now Sir Edmund,</inline> Barton, in the other House, that in the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act it was not intended to apply the education test to reputable persons who might seek to enter our ports. </para>

                        <para>- Sometimes I doubt whether my honorable friend is. It is worth while to look into the official figures. The Senate has been supplied with some figures, which, without wishing to impugn them, I would point out are not official. They have been put together - probably with the best intention - by some one who obviously felt interested, but they have not been subjected to any official check. They must be taken with that reservation. Listening to these figures, one would assume that there was a very large and increasing influx of foreigners into Western Australia, but that is not so, because the official figures show that more foreigners have gone out than have come in. From the 1st January, 1906, to the 30th September, 1909, 1,787 Italians arrived, and 1,888 departed. What appears to me to be going on is not that more are entering but that there is a tendency on the part of members of this nationality to concentrate in the industries. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the Italians are in a large majority. A number of these persons having obtained employment in the industry for which, presumably, their previous life qualified them, have naturally, as persons of various races will do, for national reasons, invited friends to join them. There has been a tendency to concentrate which, I assume, will become more pronounced as time goes on. That applies to other industries throughout Australia. It is noticeable in our large cities with regard to the fish and fruit trades. It seems to me so natural as almost not to require comment, or excite surprise. I do not propose to weary honorable senators with the mass of papers which I hold in my hand, but they show that the Department has been keeping a very close watch as to any violation of the law. As late as February last, a report was obtained from the Inspector, in response to inquiries from the head office in Melbourne. Dealing with statements which had been made to the effect that the Act had been violated, he said - </para>

                    <para>I beg to report that no such information has ever reached this Department bearing on the question. On arrival of oversea vessels  passengers  are closely examined under the Immigration Restriction Act 1901-1908, all foreigners, viz., Austrians, Greeks, Italians, Swedes, Russians, &amp;c, are separated from all other passengers and are personally questioned as whether under contract to perform manual labour. . . . I am unable to cite one instance of suspicion of any person attempting to enter the Commonwealth under contract. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a fair example of the type of reports which have been received, and which prove. I think, conclusively, that whether absolutely successful or not, the Department is alive to its responsibility, and is exercising reasonable vigilance in seeing that the Act is not violated. Within the last month, the Minister of External Affairs sent out another minute in which he asked that special vigilance be exercised, not merely to detect any absolute breaches of the Act, but to ascertain whether there is reason to suppose that there is any leakage. Unless honorable senators can produce some more definite evidence than they have done, I think it is a little unreasonable for them to imply that the Act is not being honestly and faithfully administered. If they have any information which points to a breach of the Act obviously it is their duty to communicate with the Department. But all that they have done to-day has been to argue that because there are certain concentration s_ of foreigners engaged in certain industries, therefore the Act has been evaded. I submit that that evidence is not sufficient. I mv that the efforts which the Department has made in administering that Act, vigorously, faithfully, and, I believe, successfully, are not being relaxed and are not likely to be.. I feel satisfied that the Minister of External Affairs would appreciate any assistance which might be extended to him by those who are possessed of local knowledge and which would enable him to detect and stop any leakage, if such exists. At the same time, honorable senators have scarcely brought forward sufficient evidence to justify the statement that the Act is being evaded, and the imputation that the Minister charged with its administration is lax in the discharge of his duty. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a somewhat singular circumstance that whilst under similar legislation in the United States, hundreds of persons under contract are annually stopped at the port of entry and returned to the country from which they came, since the commencement of the Contract Immigrants Act I do not think that a dozen persons have been prevented from entering the Commonwealth. If more contract immigrants come to Australia than go to the United States, it must be because the inducements offered in the former case are very much greater. In the case of America an immigrant has to undertake only a few days' voyage, whilst in that of Australia he has to face a voyage of some weeks, and there is a great difference in the cost of transit between the two countries. Yet, while hundreds of persons are annually stopped at the Customs House in the United States- </para>

                        <para>- Because they are not under contract. The legislation of the United States is effective in stopping those who attempt to enter it under contract. Is it not strange that in Australia not a single case of the kind has yet been sheeted .home to the offender by the Department of External Affairs? I can say without fear of contradiction; from documentary evidence which I have seen, that there has been at least one case of contract 'immigrants being brought to Western Australia. </para>

In reply to the figures quoted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I wish to say that from the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics Bulletin, No. 30, I find that for the six months ended June of the present year there was an excess of Austrian arrivals over departures of 230, and an excess of Italian arrivals over departures of 100; whilst for a similar period during 1908 the excess of Austrian arrivals over departures was 60, and of Italian arrivals over departures of 115. There was thus a gain of 175 foreign immigrants during a period of six months in 1908, and of 230 during a corresponding period of the present year. The monthly statistical abstract for September, 1909, shows that for the previous seven months the Austrian arrivals in Western Australia exceeded the departures by 99, whilst the </para>

                        <para>- I cannot prove that they do, but all the circumstantial evidence points in that direction. In the first place, there is a motive which would prompt the introduction of these men. That motive is supplied by the fact that in the timber industry the work is done under contract. The contractor is also the supplier of stores to his employes. Consequently the more men whom, he can get upon a job the greater is the possibility of his being able to reduce the rates for timber cutting and the more customers will he obtain for his store. Further, owing to foreign immigrants being ignorant of local conditions, it is possible to exact from them higher charges for their provisions than could be exacted from Australians. Surely it is a significant fact that in certain districts in Western Australia there are hundreds of capable Australians - it must be borne in mind that loafers are not to be found in the back country - who are imbued with a sincere desire to obtain employment at the recognised rates payable in those districts, but who are unable to secure it, whilst batches of Austrians and Italians find employment immediately upon their arrival. Is not that strong presumptive evidence that the latter come to Australia under some agreement or understanding? As a rule, they do not understand a word of English, and can only pronounce the name of their place of destination, whether it be Kalgoorlie, or Day Dawn, or Leonora. </para>

                        <para>- I think that they are compelled to do so by necessity. They are the places to which they have been engaged to go. I recognise that it is most difficult to establish the fact that these immigrants are being introduced under contract. Hitherto the Department has taken up the stand that, if when the men land no evidence to that effect is forthcoming, it has discharged its duty. It seems to me  (hat there is a lack of co-operation between the Commonwealth immigration officers and the police in the matter of following these men, with a view to ascertaining whether or not they have been brought out under contract. In the case of the United States, whilst a thorough investigation is made at the port of entry, it does not cease there. If subsequent events suggest that mcn have been improperly admitted under contract, the case is at once investigated. I do not object to immigrants coming to Australia who are prepared lo compete on fair terms with our own people. As a matter of fact, many of these immigrants prove most excellent citizens. But it is altogether opposed to the spirit oF the Contract Immigrants Act that they should "be brought here in large numbers and dumped down in a spot where they practically establish a Little Italy or a Little Austria. Yet that is precisely what is happening. The figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, although very startling, are absolutely correct. When the strike occurred in the timber industry in Western Australia a couple of years ago, members of the Labour party visited the gold-fields for the purpose of inducing the men to come to an amicable arrangement with their employers. The Premier of Western Australia undertook a similar mission. The chief difficulty which was experienced on that occasion was that none of the foreign immigrants could speak English, and even after an agreement between the contending parties had been signed, it was impossible to get them to understand that they must resume work. I will undertake to say that if the Premier of Western Australia were asked what was the most difficult feature connected with that industrial trouble he would reply that it was the large number of foreigners with whom it was impossible to deal. That was the most serious strike which has ever taken place in Western Australia. I would suggest that the Department of External Affairs should go a little further than it does in the matter of checking these immigrants upon their arrival, and that it should make investigations as to what is being done in the United States in this connexion. If the legislation of that country be effective in preventing the admission of contract immigrants - and undoubtedly it is - I fail to see why our legislation cannot be effective. If this discussion should result in stimulating inquiry into this matter, it will have served a useful purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - It appears to me that our friends from Western Australia are not .quite conversant with the difficulties which exist in some parts of the Empire where racial differences to a real and serious extent prevail. In South Africa, for instance, the mixture of races is very great indeed, and causes immense trouble, owing to differences in language, and in many other respects. But in Australia the differences are so slight and so seldom seen that! whenever any little difficulty does occur, such as has been mentioned to-day, an immense amount is made of it. I think there was no necessity to occupy the time of the Senate - I do not say waste our time - with this matter. The discussion goes to show that our friends from Western Australia have really no complaint against the administration of the Act; and that, speaking generally, we may all desire that the persons who are referred to as foreigners, but who may now be regarded as Aus-! tra hans, shall come to this country in much larger numbers than they have done hitherto. </para>

                    <para>. - Most of the remarks that have been made concerning the subject which I have introduced to the notice of the Senate have been directed towards the timber industry of Western Australia. But I can assure the Senate that it is not only in connexion with the timber industry that the evil exists. It exists in a very aggravated form on several of the mines, and particularly on those which are under the control of Bewick, Moreing and Company, a firm which acts as agent for several large mining propositions,' and the management of which seems to have .a strong <inline font-style="italic">-penchant</inline> for the employment of cheap and nasty labour. </para>

                        <para>- I mean cheap labour. Those who perform it can be " diddled " out of their wages, and those who come here with the intention of leaving in a few years' time. I call such labour both cheap and nasty. We have no room for it in Australia. If Italians or Austrians come to Australia to be citizens of this country they are in our eyes equal to any one else; but if they come with the ideal of bleeding Australia of a few pounds and  then going back to their native land, they are of no value to us. Notwithstanding the remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I say here and now that I am prepared to go upon any public platform in Australia and repeat what I have said - that there must be a limit to the practice of giving preference to foreign workmen, and that stage is reached when the foreign element practically monopolizes an industry. It is time then tor Parliament to step in and say that, such a state of affairs shall not continue. I care not whether the language test or any other test is applied ; we must do something to prevent the evils of which I have been complaining. I am sure that the sentiment of the people of Australia will support me when I so express myself. It may be admitted that sworn evidence has not been put before the Senate. We could only adduce circumstantial evidence. But  1  think we have brought forward evidence of a very strong presumptive kind to prove beyond the shadow of a. doubt that the evil exists. When we find that 90 per cent. of the employes in a certain industry are aliens, and that only 10 per cent. are natives of the country or Britishers, it will not be denied - that a genuine grievance exists, and that there is presumptive evidence of a strong character that something is wrong requiring a remedy. We should certainly see to it that the necessary attention is given to the Contract Immigrants Act so as to prevent the continuance of what is complained of. If the Act does not give the Department sufficient powers, a new measure will have to be introduced for the purpose. The subject has been before the Western Australian Parliament, and the Government of that State has thrown the responsibility on to the Federal Parliament. The Western Australian Premier has said from his place in Parliament that the blame rests with the Commonwealth. I mention this to show that we cannot shirk the difficulty, but that we must face it in the near future. As for the good wages argument, advanced by the Vice-President, of the Executive Council, it will be admitted that good wages are sufficient to entice Italians or any other immigrants into this country. But Australian workmen would also appreciate good wages; and surely men who belong to this country have a better right to such wages than have foreign immigrants. These Italians are not employed on the ground that they are superior workmen. They certainly are not superior to Australians. Sufficient figures have been quoted to show that these people do not, for the most part, come to Australia to stay. That, indeed, is one of the most regrettable aspects of the question. They are mere comers and goers. They stay for a few years and then clear out. The statistics prove so much. I know that many of those who do come to stay make very good citizens, and are' of value to the country. But the men who come for a few years, who keep Australian workmen out of employment, and then return to their own country, occasion an evil which we should put an end to. I have felt it to be my duty to the people who sent me here to bring this subject forward; and I am convinced that in doing so I am in accordance with public sentiment in Western Australia. It is for the Government to take such steps, as the responsibility devolving upon it demands, to put an end to the evil at the first opportunity. I now beg leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

                    <para>Last week, in introducing a measure which reached the Senate from another place, I intimated that I felt no inclination to deal with the subject at length, or in detail, inasmuch as I was convinced that honorable senators had made themselves fairly familiar with the larger principles involved in the Bill. Well, sir, that view is stronger with me to-day, when I have to move the second reading of the Bill now before the Senate. It has been so much in the public eye, so much, I venture to say, in the minds of honorable senators, that I may be pardoned for introducing it with a speech which, under ordinary circumstances, might be regarded as unduly brief. It is hardly necessary for me to refer to the importance of the subject-matter covered by this Bill. ~ It is important upon at least four grounds. It is in the first place well known that finance plays a large, and, indeed, a vital part in modern government. The Bill must be regarded as important upon that ground. It is important in the second place because of the large amount of attention which it has occupied in Parliamentary circles. It is important because of the attention which it has received outside. More than all, it is important because the subject will have to go before the electors in some form or other at the ensuing general election. </para>

                            <para>- It is probably important from that point of view, and not less important on account of the way in which the minority on that occasion witnessed the registration of their defeat. Finance, from the preFederal days, has been recognised as one of the essential difficulties of our position. The earlier Convention had hardly met, and got to close grips with the question before it was frankly recognised that finance was one of the " lions in the path " leading to the accomplishment of Federation. Inevitably that was so, having regard to the varying financial conditions and circumstances of the several States. The States were asked to surrender their chief revenue-raising instruments, whilst at the same time they had to continue to carry responsibilities for their great spending and non-revenue producing Departments. It was, therefore, almost inevitable that they should look for some guarantee from the Commonwealth that their solvency would not be unduly attacked. Many expedients were suggested, and finally the Convention adopted what was known as the Braddon clause. May I remind honorable senators of the terms of that clause as originally adopted. It contained a proviso that, in a modified form, was adopter! later as part of the Constitution, to the effect that three-fourths of the revenue raised by the Common wealth from Customs and Excise should be returned to the States. But in the clause in its original form there was no time limit. </para>

                            <para>- We are not dealing with the Capital site question. When the Constitution containing the Braddon clause in its original form was adopted by a majority of the people in four of the States, it was not described as sacrificing the birthright of the people, and in other extravagant terms such as have since been used. But that provision, as I have said, provided for all time for the payment to the States of 75 .per cent, of the Customs and. Excise revenue. We all know that the movement which brought about a modification of that clause was instigated by New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I am willing to admit that I was to some extent responsible. I was one of those who were not in favour of the acceptance of the Constitution Bill; and although at the first vote, we were in a minority, still ' that minority was sufficiently strong to cause a reconsideration of certain of the provisions of the Constitution. The result was the holding of the well-known Premiers' Conference. It was at that Conference that the amendment was proposed limiting the operation of the Braddon clause to ten years. It is curious that whilst that amendment was accepted for some time afterwards as an important stop-gap, and was so known and recognised, it was not very lung before there was a demand for a more satisfactory and more permanent arrangement. It is worthy of note that the first move in that direction came, not from the States, but, in the early days, from the Federation itself. The Federal Treasurers made the initial move in that direction, and I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was the first of them to take action. The reason why that action was take" was, I think, obviously because it was recognised that the position was eminently unsatisfactory ; that the Braddon section, expiring as it would, in the course of a few years, would leave the Federation in a position of too much doubt and uncertainty to make the continuance of the section, for a moment longer than was necessary, desirable from the point of view of a Federal Treasurer. As time went on, the State Governments began to feel the inconvenience caused by this provision. No State Treasurer was in a position to definitely submit his Estimates for the financial year until the Federal Treasurer had spoken. So, by degrees, in the States and in the Commonwealth, Treasurers and other public men were moving towards the one point - the reconsideration of the terms of the Braddon section - and were striving after some arrangement to take its place. As a result of that general frame of mind several Conferences on the subject took place. They were, however, all abortive in the sense that they did not achieve an agreement. Various schemes and plans were put forward as solutions of the difficulty, but none of them proved acceptable to all who met at those Conferences. </para>

                            <para>- The only thing I shall be called upon to defend directly will be the disorderly conduct of honorable senators. The agreement arrived at by the August Conference provides for these several matters, which are set out in the various clauses of the Bill : First of all, there is a rebate or payment by the States in the present financial year of £600,000 to the Federal Treasury. I have said a payment, but, as a matter of fact, this provision will be given effect to by the Commonwealth Treasurer withholding that amount from the State Treasurers. </para>

                            <para>- It is one of the proposals of the Bill. I wish briefly to discharge what I regard to be my duty by explaining the provisions of the Bill before I get on to more debatable ground. The next provision is contained in the clause which abolishes the bookkeeping system. The third proposal is one which terminates the operation of the  87  th section of the Constitution, that is the Braddon section, on the  30th  June of next year, or six months earlier than it would terminate if the Constitution were allowed to remain unaltered. The fourth provision is for the payment as from the  1  st July of next year from the Federal Treasury to each of the State Treasurers of an amount equal to  25s.  per head of the population of each State. That provision is to take the place of the  87th  section of the Constitution, under which, hitherto three-fourths of the revenue from" Customs and Excise has been handed back to the States. </para>

                            <para>- This special payment is to be contributed half bv the Commonwealth and half by the States, including Western Australia. The sixth provision is merely a consequential one, dealing with State debts. It is consequent upon the proposal to substitute the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution for the contribution under the Braddon section. The Conference agreement further provided, as the Bill does, for these proposed alterations being submitted to the people by means of a constitutional referendum. That briefly outlines the terms of the agreement arrived at between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the State Premiers, which is now embodied in the Bill. Before I come to what I take to be the main subject of controversy between us, I invite honorable senators to consider the very, great advantages of the first three proposals in this Bill. First of all there is that which provides for the payment by the States to the Commonwealth this year of the sum of  £600,000. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may regard it in that way, but if he can for a moment lift himself out of the ordinary environment of his political surroundings he will admit that the Commonwealth Parliament in its desire - a desire shared in by all parties and people, and bv every member of every party - to hasten the payment of old-age pensions as much as possible, did undoubtedly outrun the constable before we had arrived at the period of financial freedom, the expiration of the  8-rth  section of the Constitution. The result was that the estimates of expenditure for the present financial year disclosed an estimated deficit of  £1,200,000.  Although I do riot say that this should be regarded as out-weighing all possible disadvantages under the agreement, it is, regarded by itself, a great advantage that the Commonwealth, having entered into debt, should know that within the next twelve months before freedom from its financial embarrassment would come under the Constitution, the State Governments should be prepared to make this contribution to meet the deficit with which the Commonwealth is now faced. Now, as to the abolition of the bookkeeping system, I venture to say that there is no Federalist in Australia who will not hail with intense pleasure the fact that we have arrived at a stage when this last mark of State separation mav be obliterated from the Constitution. The provision for the bookkeeping system always appeared to me a distinct travesty upon the principle of Federation I have always so regarded the maintenance of this accountancy barrier, even after we had abolished the Customs barriers- between the States. Tt h.-vs seemed to me that there has been something manifestly unfair in the way in which the iw"1'keeping system .has operated. Without going into the matter deeply, I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion. which I believe is shared in bv a number of honorable senators, that, although the system was designed to secure to each State the revenue which properly belonged to it. it is impossible to resist the conviction that the State of Tasmania has lost very heavily because of the leakages which have occurred. By abolishing the bookkeeping system, we shall at any rate have prepared the way for the adoption of a system which will enable us to avoid that positive <inline font-style="italic">\o?s</inline> to which Tasmania was subjected, and to which possibly other States also were subjected. </para>

                            <para>- I think so, teo. But I think that possibly in proportion to the resources of the States the loss wa*s greater to Tasmania than to the great northern State which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> represents. I have mentioned the advantages attaching to the three first propositions. I wish now, to suggest another advantage connected with this agreement. It seems to me that it is a tremendous advantage that it is an agreement. I lay great emphasis upon that. Unless we are prepared to say that it is undesirable that the States and the Commonwealth should work in unison, I impress upon honorable senators the great advantage arising from the simple fact that in this matter the States and the Federation appear at last to have arrived upon a common ground. </para>

                            <para>- If there are State interests involved in it surely the Premier of each State is beyond challenge entitled to endeavour to conserve them. I am assuming that there, is a practical acceptance of and, at any rate, no very strong dissent from that portion of the agreement which deals with the <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> amount to be paid to the States. So far as I have) been able to gauge the criticism of the measure, and the trend of public and' Parliamentary discussion, there is no serious objection taken to the payment of 25s. per head of the population to' the various States. I, therefore, do not propose to weary the Senate with any figures which are obtainable, and which might be advanced in justification of the contribution agreed upon at the Conference. But I do think that it is very desirable that T should place before the Senate what this payment really means, both to the States and to the Commonwealth, lt is desirable that we should recognise the effect of the proposal to substitute a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of 25s. of the population of each of the States for a payment to the States of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth. I first propose to show how much the States have given up and will give up, and when I use the term "give up," I refer to revenue surrendered to the control of the Federal authority. Prior to Federation, the States received from Customs and Excise duties certain revenues. In 1900, New South Wales received <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 6s. 4d. per head of population ; Victoria, <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 19s. 3d. j Queensland, ^3 ?s. 8d ; South Australia. £1 15s. 8d. ; Western Australia, ^5 6s. 2d. ; and Tasmania, <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 16s. 6d. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> speaks of a total revenue of £6,000,000, he is, I think, using figures which were frequently referred to in the Convention. It will be remembered that that body proceeded on the assumption of a £6,000,000 Tariff ; but the figures were taken a few years earlier, and were admittedly on an extremely low basis, excluding Queensland, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> reminds me. </para>

                            <para>- In 1900, the average revenue for the States from Customs and Excise duties was £2 1s. 5d. per head. Compared with the amounts which were then received by the States, 25s. per head would represent to New South Wales, 94 per cent. ; to Victoria, 63 per cent. ; to Queensland, 39 per cent. ; to South Australia, 70 per cent. ; to Western Australia, 23 per cent. ; and to Tasmania, 44 per cent. So that, taking the States as a whole, they will, if they obtain 25s. per head, receive only 60 per cent. of the Customs and Excise revenue which they collected for themselves prior to Federation. I now propose to give the percentage which the 25s. per head will represent to the amount paid under the Braddon section for the last financial year. To New South Wales, it will represent 62 per cent. ; to Victoria, 78 per cent. ; to Queensland, 68 per cent. ; to South Australia, 79 per cent. ; to Western Australia, 55 per cent. ; and to Tasmania, practically 100 per cent. ; the average being 69 per cent. It will probably assist honorable senators to get a more concrete grip of the position if I state the aggregate amounts which will be surrendered by the States by the substitution of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system for section 87. New South Wales will lose £1,321,000 ; Victoria, £488,000 ; Queensland, £346,000; South Australia, £148,000; Western. Australia, £65,000; and Tasmania, £3,800; making a total of £2,400,000. </para>

                            <para>- It includes the special payment to Western Australia, and her portion of the contribution deducted from the several States. I now invite honorable senators to look at the position from the Commonwealth stand-point.It is estimated that for the present year the Commonwealth will receive from Customs and Excise duties, £10,500,000. The States' share of that will be £7,888,000, leaving £2,629,000 available for Commonwealth purposes. Assuming that the Customs and Excise receipts for next year are in the same ratio per head of the population as those for this year, the Commonwealth will receive, roughly, £10,750,000. The States' share, at 25s. per head, will be £5,668,000, leaving available for the Commonwealth a little over £5,000,000, an increase of £2,400,000, as compared with the figures for the present year. In other words, the revenue of the Commonwealth will jump from £2,600,000 to £5,000,000, an increase which will leave a very considerable amount of financial sea room. </para>

I refer to the attitude of those who seem to regard the States and the Commonwealth as two bodies seeking the one to plunder the other. I resent altogether the idea that this is Commonwealth money being given to the States or State money being retained by the Commonwealth. It is money which belongs to the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">Labour party is responsible. Let me explain why I used the term " surrender of revenue to the States." It is in accordance with a principle of the Constitution, and with, I believe, public sentiment, that we should recognise that the interests of the States require that we should secure to them a further share in the Customs and Excise revenue. The alternative to that seems to be something which is nothing short of an absolute violation of the Constitution and that is unification. It is impossible to conceive of the States going on if they are reduced to a state of  insolvency.  In order to secure their solvency it appears to be absolutely imperative at the present juncture that the interest which the Constitution gave them- in the Customs and Excise revenue shall be continued, at any rate, until other circumstances arise. The alternative to that is the crippling of the States financially thus making- them impotent to carry out the large responsibilities which devolve upon them, with the result that, from sheer force of circumstances, they would have ultimately to be transferred to the Commonwealth. That would be securing unification not by a direct appeal to the people, but by the simple process of starvation. Passing from that aspect of the case I assume, and I think, that honorable senators will say that I am entitled to assume that, -generally speaking, the agreement is acceptable, but for the one fact that no time limit is set to its operation. I want to examine that argument as far as I am able. It is alleged that as it now stands the agreement is too far reaching, that it lacks that flexibility which is necessary in a country like Australia with a Constitution like ours - in a country where it is impossible to determine with any accuracy what conditions are likely to prevail a few years ahead. Would it affect the flexibility of the agreement whether it was inserted in the Constitution or not ? I should like to get an answer to that question. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will, perhaps, bear with me for a moment when I say that it probably would to this extent, that it would secure a reasonable element of permanency without going to the point of being irrevocably fixed. There is no way in which that permanency can be obtained other than that which is proposed in the Bill. Those who may favour the insertion of a time limit in the Constitution can, I think,  hardly resist this contention, that there would be more of the element of fixity if the time were set' out than there is in the Bill as it stands. If there were inserted a provision limiting the operation of the agreement to twenty or twenty-five years, I venture to say that that would be accepted as a definite and binding bargain for that time, and that no public man in State or Federal politics would dare to propose to disturb it or tear it out. </para>

                            <para>- I do not doubt the capacity of my honorable friend to argue anything. But 1 would point out that if we embody, the proposed agreement in the Constitution without a time limit - as was originally proposed in regard to the Braddon section - we shall leave it in exactly the same position as that occupied by every other section of the Constitution, with the exception of two. In other words, it will be subject to review when the people think that the time for reviewing it is opportune. That circumstance seems to me to affirm that greater flexibility will be obtained if the agreement be inserted in the Constitution without a time limit, than would be secured if it were subject to a time limit. Another argument used by our opponents is that as time goes on our Customs and Excise revenue will become a diminishing quantity, and will be unable to bear the strain of the payment of the <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> grant of  25s.  I do not know upon what assumption that argument is based. Those who use it take a pessimistic view of Australia if they assume that this country is goings to stand still. </para>

                            <para>- We assume that a country like Australia which is just commencing, if I may be pardoned for using the expression, to " feel itself," which has all its development ahead of it, which will increase its production and its population, I hope, from this time onward, will have a similar experience to that of other countries. From  1887  to  1906  - the period for which the latest figures are available - the United States increased its population by  44  per cent. , and its Customs revenue by  63  per cent. Let me anticipate the objection that Tariff alterations were made during that period/ That is quite true. Within the period mentioned the Tariff of the United States was raised, lowered, and raised again. But throughout the whole of it the Customs receipts of that country increased in a greater ratio than did its population. Nobody will dispute the ability of the Commonwealth to-day to return to the States out of its Customs revenue a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution of  25s.  If that revenue should increase more rapidly than our population it is obvious that in time to come we shall be able to bear that contribution with greater ease than we can bear it to-day. During the period that I have already quoted, namely, from  1887  to  1906,  Canada increased her population by  36  per cent., but her Customs revenue increased by  109  per cent. Again, between  1887  and  1904,  whilst the population of Germany increased by only  25  per cent., her Customs revenue increased by  114  per cent. </para>

To-day the Commonwealth can afford to return to the States out of its Customs revenue  25s.  per head annually. If our population should increase as that of Canada increased, namely, by  36  per cent., whilst we shall be required to return  36  per cent, more to the States, we shall, according to the experience of that country, have gained an increase in our Customs and Excise revenue of  109  per cent. </para>

All sorts of dire predictions are wont to be made, all sorts of bogies and ghosts are prone to be raised, as to what will happen in the future. But in the course of a few years we discover that what was expected has not come to pass, whilst that which was not expected, has. </para>

                            <para>- In the case of the United States, the Tariff was raised, lowered, and raised again. But throughout the whole of the period to which I alluded, it is obvious that the Customs receipts increased more rapidly than did the population. I repeat that for many years Australia is bound to collect a large Customs revenue for the simple reason that it is sure to be a big exporting country. In view of our enormous natural possibilities it seems inevitable that no matter what losses may occur, Australia must continue for many years to export per head of its population a measure of wealth which will probably be equalled by no nation in the world. Given that large export of products it necessarily follows that we must importheavily. </para>

                            <para>- Nor do I think that Australia is going to set itself to-morrow to pay off its national debt. On the other hand I shall be very much surprised if that debt does not display the tendency of all national debts - the tendency to grow. I repeat that, vary our Tariff as we may, we shall, for many years, derive a large revenue from our Customs duties. I wish now to summarize the three arguments with which I have dealt. The first has reference to the supposed rigidity of this agreement, and the second to . the inability of our Customs and Excise revenue to pay the proposed annual contribution to the States of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> If I admitted the soundness of those arguments, which I do not, what do they mean? They amount simply to the third argument that when once this agreement has been inserted in the Constitution, it cannot be altered. I regard that as the crux of the whole debate which I anticipate will follow in this chamber. It is from the stand-point of its ultimate effect that I assume honorable senators will he inclined to criticise it. Now, is there anything which will justify the assertion that when once the agreement has been embodied in the Constitution', it will be impossible, should it prove objectionable, to secure its amendment' or removal ? I can see nothing in the history of Federation which will justify that assumption; on the contrary, I can see everything to refute it. In the first place, the contention that when once the agreement has been embodied in the Constitution, it cannot be altered, no matter how unworkable it may prove to be, is based upon the utterly fallacious notion that all patriotism and public spirit, all loyalty to the Federation, rests with the big States, and that nothing but a mean and sordid selfishness characterizes the smaller States. . I wish to show how little there is in the history of Federation to justify the division of the Commonwealth into two camps of that kind. </para>

                            <para>- The theory that when once the agreement has been placed in the Constitution it will not be possible to alter it is based upon the assumption that having obtained their bond of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> the smaller States will never consent to relinquish it. Let us see whether there is anything in the history of Federation to justify the fear that if a public emergency arose, there would be hesitation oh the part of the States to recognise and to meet it. Take the case of the  .Braddon  section as an, illustration. In the first place, that provision  was  inserted in the draft Constitution without any limitation as to the period of its operation. Was any serious demur raised by the States when it was pointed out that its limitation would open the way to the admission of another State? No. The smaller States without demur conceded what was asked. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I look in vain for evidence of selfishness on the part either of the great or small States of the Commonwealth. I return now to the table which I have already mentioned in connexion with the adjustment of the future financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth. Does that table disclose any evidence of a determination on the part of any State to be niggardly in its treatment of other States? Take the case of the smallest State - that of Tasmania, as an example. She has agreed, not merely to forego a portion of her Customs revenue, but to make a special contribution to the needs of Western Australia. Wherever  1  look, I find an increasing disposition on the part of the States not merely to work strenuously - as they are entitled to do - in their own interests, but to take an enlarged view of the difficulties and responsibilities of each other. All this points to the fact that just as the States have falsified the predictions which were made when we entered into Federation as to the attitude which they would take up, they will exhibit similar public spirit in the future. </para>

                    <para class="block">If we assume that when once this agreement has been embodied in the Constitution, the smaller States will prevent its removal - and the whole argument ot our opponents is based upon that assumption - we might reasonably anticipate that the smaller States would be unanimous in advocating its adoption to-day. But what is the position? Are the smaller States through their representatives in this Chamber, asking, for the adoption of the proposed agreement? Where are its most strenuous opponents to be found? Chiefly among the representatives of the small States. </para>

                            <para>- The argument has been used that once this provision was inserted in the Constitution a minority of the people would be enabled to prevent an alteration of it, and could thus frustrate the will of the majority. That argument can only proceed from the assumption that the smaller States attach very great importance to the provision. But where is the evidence of that? If the smaller. States would not be prepared to give this provision up when they got it, that would suggest that they valued it. But are the smaller States fighting for it now, or are we to assume that they are misrepresented in this Chamber? If those who are here to-day - and I prefer to take this view - are the accurate reflex of the wishes of their electors- </para>

                            <para>- I have never said anything of the kind. One of the difficulties which honorable senators opposite experience is to confine themselves to an argument without  running  off into side tracks. The position is this. Let us assume - as I do without reserve - that my honorable friends opposite absolutely and completely reflect the views of their constituents. What does that indicate? It indicates that those who argue that the smaller States would not give up this provision once we gave it to them, are fighting now to resist the larger States in thrusting down their throats this 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to which the smaller States are going to hang so tenaciously, which they will never surrender, and for the sake of which they would shake the very foundations of the Commonwealth itself ! </para>

                            <para>- Some of my honorable friends opposite will be facing the electors of the smaller States within a few months. Some of them seem to think that they can ignore the States. Others of them, I fancy, are afraid that the State electors will ignore them. There is, it seems to me, ample evidence to justify the assertion that we have no right to assume that the people of the smaller States are going to view this matter any differently from the people of the larger States. They are just as capable of taking a broad, public-spirited view of the situation as are their neighbours. There is no tendency on the part of the smaller States to-day to secure an unfair advantage for themselves. I am therefore justified in saying that there will be no tendency later on, when the proposed amendment of the Constitution is adopted, for them to fight to retain it, if to do so is against the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; and is there any one who can tell which of the States of Australia are going to be the smaller States, and which the larger ones in the next thirty or forty years? Even now, the telegraph wires may be bringing us news of some discovery which will convert a district now unoccupied into a sound and thriving mining centre. We can point to plenty of like instances in the past. The romance of Australia is not all over. We are hardly on the fringe of it yet. If those who live in this country fifty years hence turn up our debates, and read the gloomy predictions of some people regarding the future, they will come to the conclusion that we did not even appreciate the fact that we were hardly on the fringe of our possibilities. It is rather curious that the objection to the adoption of this agreement comes especially from a number of public men, and some public journals, which, in the first instance, fought strenuously for the acceptance of the original Braddon clause. I have no wish to refer to individuals by name; but I do invite attention to the fact that the criticism from which this Bill has recently emerged has emanated very largely from one ot two gentlemen who were equally prominent - one, at any rate, in mv own State  - in advocating the adoption of the original Braddon clause, and in urging that it ought in no way to impede the future of Federation. They then assured the country that it could safely, in this matter, trust the people in the future. Yet we find these gentlemen now turning round and implying that the inclusion in the Constitution of a provision similar to the original Braddon clause, in respect of permanency, is going to have to-day effects which they said it could not have ten years ago. I say at once that I am unable to understand this change of views. I can conceive that in the early days of Federation, there might have been some justification for fear and anxiety. But there is none now. We have had ten years' experience of the practical working of Federation, and that ten years has amply served &lt;.o dispel all those fears, to .push on one side all those anxieties, to dismiss all doubts, and to satisfy us that, whatever shortcomings have to be registered against the Federation, it has, at all events, shown itself to be competent to work out the future of Australia satisfactorily. I have referred to the position of some public men. May I now give a quotation from a public journal - one which I believe has for the present taken my honorable friends opposite under its special care. It is not yet, as far as I know, their official organ, but it is working in unison with them. Writing on-29th August, 1898, prior to Federation, and when the Constitution was still under discussion, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said - </para>

                        <para>Victoria is not wedded to the Braddon clause, and New South Wales is practically unanimous for its abolition ; but then the question will arise with imperative force, what is to be put in its place? Without it, or without some equivalent, no State has any guarantee for its solvency. The Convention Bill of this year was a great advance, but it ignores some of the most useful lessons taught in Canada, which in the place of the Braddon blot secured the solvency of each State by giving a specified sum per head of the population to each. </para>

                        <para>The provision was about as clumsy as can be imagined, but the guarantee contained in it, such as it is, must be maintained in some better shape, or else the Federal Constitution would leave the colonies as mere helpless hangers-on in the Federation, dependent on the National Parliament, month by month, for their solvency. Such a Constitution would be a blow at State rights more staggering than anything suggested in any other quarter. </para>

                    <para>I say that the point of view taken then is not to be reconciled with the point of view of to-day by referring to the mere lapse of time. The contention put forward then, that it was essential to secure the welfare of the States, is a contention which stands for all time. The alternative to that I have already dealt with. It means that the revenues of the States would be absolutely crippled, and that, even if no amendment of the Constitution took place in a direct" way, it would involve the compulsory passing from the States to the Federation of functions which the present Constitution secures to the States themselves. In other words, it would mean unification. There is another point which I should like to emphasize. Honorable senators, in dealing with the possible working out of our Federal destiny, and with the influence which may be asserted through States having more than an equal share of voting power in the Federal Parliament in proportion to population, ignore altogether the effect that responsible government is going to have in the working out of the Federal Constitution. Your distinguished predecessor in the chair, sir, was responsible for the phrase that either responsible government would wreck Federation, or Federation would wreck responsible government. He did not mean that responsible government was going to wreck the Union. What he meant was that it would wreck that form of Federation which had been adopted, and which has its basis in what is known as the dual consent - that is, that every legislative proposition has to be assented to by a majority of the States and a majority of the people. </para>

                            <para>- Every law; because a majority of the people, as represented in the House of Representatives, and a majority of the States, as represented in the Senate, have to consent to every law. That is the underlying theory of our Constitution. That theory would work unsatisfactorily if it were not that we have superimposed upon it a doctrine quite foreign to it in its original form - the doctrine of responsible government. I am unable to shut my eyes to the fact that, even in the short experience of ten years which we have had, the fact that responsible government is superimposed upon our Federal structure is having an effect upon this Chamber. In the United States, where there is no responsible government, the same theory of Federation is working out in quite a different manner. I invite attention to the fact that, this country having adopted responsible government, there can never arise here any position in which a minority can dominate a majority. Apart from the constitutional safeguards, there is no reason to fear that selfishness on the part of the smaller States will ever thrust Australia into a position of jeopardy, or that the majority of the people will ever be placed under the domination ot a minority. I have referred to the many gloomy predictions that we hear as to what is going to happen if this proposal is inserted in the  Constitution.  May I remind honorable senators of  the  predictions that were made in regard to the adoption of our Constitution? The air  was  thick with predictions of woe. </para>

                            <para>- I offer the best apology for the wrongness of others when I admit that I was wrong myself. I desire now to deal with some of the predictions which were made, and which go to show, in my opinion, how unnecessary it is to throw ourselves into a fever of anxiety about the future, when judging it from the stand-point of the present. Turning to Quick and Garran's work on the Federal Constitution, I find this brief and fairly accurate description of the state of affairs which existed on the eve of the adoption of the Federal Constitution - </para>

                        <para>Criticism of the political aspects of the Constitution was concentrated chiefly on the principle of equal representation in the Senate, and the powers wielded by the Senate - provisions which, it was argued, would stifle the will of the majority, and enable the small States to rule the large. In a less degree, the provision for amending the Constitution was attacked, as making amendment practically impossible, and imposing a " cast-iron " Constitution for all time. A further objection, which consolidated the greater part of the Parliamentary Labour party against the Bill, was the rejection of the referendum - their favorite political institution - as a means for settling deadlocks. The financial objections were that the Bill necessitated the raising of an enormous Customs revenue, and, consequently, an immense increase of taxation in New South Wales ; that under the Federal Tariff New South Wales would contribute an undue proportion of the revenue, and that after the expiration of the bookkeeping period there was every probability that her share of the surplus would be " scrambled for " bv the other colonies, to meet their pressing needs. </para>

That fear, like the interjection we have just heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> proceeded from an assumption that the States were going to group themselves according to whether they were large or small. Nothing of the kind has happened. I represent a State which may be regarded as a large State, and I find that I am able to work most harmoniously with my honorable friends from Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> represents a small State from the point of view of population, but he finds no difficulty at all in working, with the representatives of a big State, from the point of view of population, like Victoria. There has not been that intriguing and log-rolling between the States that was anticipated at that time. There is no evidence that the States are going to group themselves according to their size. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The point was not that the Constitution could not be easily amended, but that it could not be amended at all. It was not made to be tinkered with and amended every day, but provision has been wisely made in it for machinery by which, on sufficient cause being shown, it can be altered. </para>

                            <para>- That does not seem to me to affect the question Honorable senators will not contend that it will be easy to amend the Constitution if there is a party conflict over it, but we have shown that it can be amended when a sufficient justification for its amendment is put forward. No one now would venture to get up and predict, as those who opposed the Commonwealth Bill did predict, that the Constitution is so absolutely cast-iron that it cannot be altered. </para>

With all due deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and without wishing to touch the honorable senator's proper pride in his State, it may be said that at the time the Labour party were objecting to the Constitution Bill because it did not provide for the adoption of the referendum. I pass that by for the moment, but I have directed attention to the matter, because it has some bearing upon the Bill- now before the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I would ask any honorable senator to say when the other States have engaged in such a scramble. It is true that New South Wales is called upon in ratifying this agreement to surrender the largest individual amount. I take some pride in the fact that my State is financially in a position to do that, and that so far as I' can judge the people of that State are prepared to make the sacrifice in the interests of the Federation without the slightest suspicion <inline font-style="italic">ox</inline> a grumble from any one. Whilst New South Wales happens to surrender the largest individual amount under the agreement, it is a fact that the other States, though perhaps in a lesser degree, are called upon under this agreement, which their representatives have entered into willingly, to make sacrifices which may be to them as serious as the sacrifice which New South Wales is called upon to make. But this does not point to any desire to join in a scramble - each for himself and the devil take the hindmost. On the contrary, it shows that when an emergency, arises, and the people or public men of Australia are brought face to face with a matter of magnitude, they are capable of looking beyond narrow provincial interests, and of viewing the matter from a broad Australian stand-point. Just as they have emerged from this difficulty successfully with an agreement, so I venture to say that should a similar difficulty arise, as it undoubtedly will, in the years to come, our successors will be found equal to its successful solution. </para>

                            <para>- I was leaving that for my last point, but my honorable friend has anticipated me. Such terms as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has used may be useful on a public platform for the purpose of swaying a few votes, but they axe out of place here when addressed to those who are fairly familiar with the Constitution and with our political history. The term " shackle" is utterly ridiculous as applied to this agreement. Every legislative provision shackles some one. Our Standing Orders fortunately, I think sometimes, occasionally shackle the honorable senator, and no one is the worse for it. Even the honorable senator himself is the better for a little salutary discipline. </para>

To summarize what appear to me to be the advantages of the proposals embodied in this Bill, I say, first of all, that the agreement arrived at by the Conference and now submitted to the Senate for consideration, will insure security and definiteness. To these advantages I do not think too much' value can be attached. It must be of very great value to the State Treasurers to be in a position to accurately estimate their revenue. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that, if we can do so under an equitable and just agreement, it is our duty to place them in that position. There is this further advantage, that the agreement will leave the State and Federal Governments absolutely free to work out their own destiny, without being hampered by considerations of the necessities of each other. It leaves the Commonwealth absolutely free as to any powers of taxation it may choose to exercise. Apart from the one obligation upon the Commonwealth to find an amount which, under existing conditions, would be somewhere about £5,000,000 per year, the Commonwealth Parliament will be absolutely free to impose or remit taxation in' whatever form it pleases. It is idle, therefore, to suggest that the adoption of this proposal will in any way shackle or hamper the future working of the great Federal Constitution. The final matter to which I invite the attention of honorable senators is that to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> referred just now when he said that we could not shackle the people unless they were willing. What is proposed by this Bill is to invite the people to say whether or not they will approve and adopt the. agreement provisionally accepted. </para>

                            <para>- That is a curious argument to use. The honorable senator says that we are telling the people of Australia that we are not lit to discharge these responsibilities. We are doing nothing of the kind. We are proposing to say to our masters. " Here is a matter which affects you, involving the distribution of your money. lt is for you to determine what amount you will allot to each of your two agents for the discharge of the duties intrusted to them." It is a novelty to hear from men who call themselves Democrats, that it is an abandonment of dignity on the part of a servant that he should consult his master. Surely my honorable friends opposite are not right in the position they assume that, even a seat in this chamber places them above the electors ? I say that to talk as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> interjection suggests, as if this Parliament were abandoning any dignity merely because it places before the electors, who are primarily concerned, a vital question of finance, appears to me to be seeking to obscure the real issue. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend might just have reasonably asked why we should include in the Constitution any provision for amending anything. Why not have left everything to the Federal Parliament? The reason we did not was obvious. There are certain great questions upon which the people have a right to be consulted, and I class this one amongst them. If there is a matter which directly, intimately, and permanently affects the electors," it is the manner in which the money they contribute is to be distributed. Roughly speaking, it is the same constituency which elects both State and Federal Parliaments. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is now bordering on the humorous. We propose to place before the people a proposition which, whatever its faults may be, is, at any rate, the only one on which an agreement has yet been arrived at, and it will be for them, if they take the view which the honorable senator does, and which he says they take, to veto it. On the other hand, if they regard the agreement as one providing for a fair apportionment of the revenue, and think that it is desirable to give it some measure of permanency by including it in the Constitution, they will vote "Yes." </para>

                            <para>- Let my honorable friend say what he likes about the proposition, it will give the people a chance of saying whether or not they agree to 25s. per head being paid to the States. But he will not give them a chance to say anything. My honorable friends on the other side have been making some very bold statements to the effect that the people are against our proposal. Surely they do not believe that ? Surely they do not think for a moment that the people are against the Constitution? If they do, they ought not to have the slightest hesitation in allowing the Bill to pass. Assuming as I do that the people can be trusted to amend the Constitution if it is found to be unworkable, there is only one contingency which can arise to prevent it from being altered. </para>

This proposal has been too long before the public for me to suppose that there is any man in public life who has not definitely made up his mind about it.

                            <para>- My honorable friend knows that I could not prevent a discussion if I would, and I certainly have no desire to do so. The session is drawing to a close, and there is yet some important business to be transacted - business in which honorable senators, irrespective of where they sit, are interested, and which, I believe, they are keenly desirous of transacting. I ask honorable senators, so far as they can, to assist in arriving at an early determination on this Bill. In other words, without suggesting that there should be any unnecessary curtailment of debate, I ask them to assist so far as they can in the expeditious settlement of this vexed question. I am quite unable, I repeat, to understand the fears which have been expressed so frequently as to what future generations may do. Let honorable senators ask themselves whether there is any reason to suppose for a moment that the practical genius of our race, which* has always solved problems whenever they have arisen, is going to peter out with us. Time after time, whenever a difficulty has arisen, especially in matters connected with government, that practical genius has asserted itself and triumphed. It has triumphed over stupendous difficulties. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The moment a pronounced public evil, dominance by a minority, was recognised, the genius of the people asserted itself, and provided a remedy. So in this particular matter,  1  brush on one side as unworthy of serious consideration all those dreads, and fears of what is going to happen at some future time. I believe that just as the people in the past, like the people in the present, were competent to take hold of and shape their political destiny, so will those who have to come after us, whether in the immediate or ultimate future. Whatever financial difficulties may arise, I have sufficient faith in the great unlimited future of Australia to believe that it will rise superior to them. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment for the reason that the Bill, as it is, will make for ineffectiveness. I can quite understand that in the case of the Military Forces there is still some necessity for retaining the word "Volunteer." Such bodies as the automobile corps and others we require to retain as volunteer corps. 'But in the case of the Naval Forces this is practically an innovation. It was only instituted while <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing was Minister in order to meet the desire of a small section, principally yachtsmen, who use Hobson's Bay, who wanted to have the right to wear a naval uniform. They had, and still have, the opportunity to render real service to the Naval Forces by becoming Naval Militia. The drills which they are required to perform are not exceedingly onerous, but represent the minimum of what naval officers think necessary to make a man in some sense efficient. On Friday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> pointed out that naval militiamen are required to put in twenty-one days a year on continuous service. The naval authorities say that if a man will not go through that term of service it is absolutely useless to have his name on the books. A man who goes1 into the Naval Forces to-day requires to be a skilled artisan. Now, the men who want to enrol as naval volunteer forces are not mechanicians, but clerks. The Naval Militia, I am pleased to say, is largely recruited from landsmen, who follow a mechanical occupation, such as, for instance, engineers and blacksmiths, who form a most useful class. They know a great deal before they enlist, and all that is needed is to give them the necessary sea training to make them efficient. It is proposed, however, to give clerks only five days' training a year. What will be the use of that? The Naval Volunteer Forces, which this proposed new section takes power to establish, will simply be an ornamental appendage to our Defence </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Force. The men are not to be called upon to do the same number of drills as others, although from the very nature of their occupation they ought to do more in order to become efficient. Are we justified in spending public money on a force of this kind unless it is to be efficient and useful for the purpose of defence? Can anybody claim that on a modern ship of war a man who follows a clerical occupation ashore can by five days' training a year make himself efficient or of any value? According to a regulation issued by the Department to naval volunteers, and read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> on Friday, that is the term of training which is proposed for these men. On the last Estimates a sum of £250 was set apart for naval volunteers. The Fisher Government took office towards the end of the session, and we had to consider whether we should amend the Estimates or take them as they were. It was found utterly impossible to amend them. I had marked this item of .£250 as one to be struck out, because I recognised its uselessness. I was also advised that it was useless to retain the item, but the Government decided that they would not revise the Estimates. I took good care, however, not to spend a penny of the- item, because I recognised that to do so would be to simply throw away the money. The Defence Act makes no provision for naval volunteers, and Parliament is now asked for the first time to legalize their existence. I trust that the 'Committee will carry the amendment in order to show its determination that our Defence Force shall be a real force, not a piece of ornamental business or child's play, and that men shall give such service as will render them effective when called upon to defend the country. </para>

To say that a man who is willing to render voluntary naval service to the country shall not be allowed to do so unless he undergoes a longer period of training is absurd. The chief offence in the eyes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> seems to be that certain individuals are members of a yacht club. </para>

                        <para>- Only two speeches have been delivered by my honorable friends opposite, and in each instance that circumstance was given undue prominence. The question of whether we ought not to encourage naval volunteers was not touched upon by them. It is conceivable that circumstances may arise under which it may be eminently desirable to call a naval volunteer force into existence. This proposed new section merely provides the "machinery necessary for that purpose. I ask the Committee to retain the provision. If it be abused at any time, it will be open to Parliament to review the regulations. But to strike out the words " Volunteer Forces," and thus to declare that under no circumstances shall we avail ourselves of volunteer assistance in the naval defence of the country, would be going too far. </para>

However, the Vice-President of the Executive Council has chosen to put- the matter in that way, with a view to creating the impression that we object to the proposed new section because of unreasoning class prejudice. But can he point to any naval volunteers in connexion with the Imperial Naval Forces? </para>

                        <para>- They are composed of persons who are employed practically all the time on shore. I am aware that there are permanent men in the Imperial Navy, and that there is also a Naval Reserve. But all those who are employed at sea are members either of the permanent body or of the Naval Reserve. They have to undergo a regular course of training, and no exception is taken to yachtsmen becoming members of the Naval Reserve. As a matter of fact, a large number of yachtsmen are members of that reserve, as are also a considerable number of men who are engaged in the fishing industry. They receive their retainer of <inline font-style="italic">£fi</inline> per annum, and a fee of £1 weekly during their period of service. I object to this provision on the ground that it is undesirable that we should have in our Naval Forces men who are not required to undergo the necessary drill to make them efficient. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but what is the use of calling upon them if they are not efficient? Yachtsmen can gain admission to our Naval Forces upon the same terms as can other persons. But the Vice-President of the Executive Council wishes to establish a sort of class superiority, simply because certain individuals own a number of yachts which cruise round Hobson's Bay. Nothing of that sort should be encouraged. Because men choose to invest a few pounds in a yacht, ought they to be recognised as superior individuals, who should not undergo the same training as the common garden variety of mortal ? According to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, it would be an indignity to ask these high fliers, who go pleasuring round the Bay, to submit to the same training as the man in the street. </para>

                        <para>- I am nearer to speaking the truth than was the' Vice-President of the Executive Council when he declared that I objected to this proposed new section on the ground that some yachtsmen were anxious to volunteer for naval service. Apparently he thinks that a man who possesses a few pounds can be made efficient with two or three days' training as against twenty-one days in the case of other mortals. What has happened in connexion with our Naval Forces in the past? Have we been able to secure a large number of officers from among men who earn their livelihood at sea? No. Some of them have told me that they declined to have anything to do with our Naval Forces because a few persons on shore were able to secure all the positions connected with those forces. As a result, men who joined them some time ago have dropped out. There should be no class distinctions created in a matter of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council favours a provision under which one man is to be . made efficient with five days' training as against twenty-one days on the part of ordinary individuals. I hope that the Committee will agree to my amendment. The only object which I have in view is that of securing efficiency. I have been informed that it was only on the application of a few yachtsmen in Hobson's Bay that the word "Volunteer" was inserted in this proposed new section, and that is why I propose its excision. </para>

                    is quite inaccurate in his statement regarding naval volunteers in the Old Country. They do exist, or at any rate they did exist, in fairly large numbers, a very few months ago. If he will allow his memory to wander back to the pages of periodicals, he will doubtless recollect pictorial representations of naval volunteers at sea undergoing a variety of hardships with more or less comical results. Of course, he was perfectly right in his statement regarding the Imperial Naval Reserve, officers of which are to be found on many of our coastal steamers, and on nearly all our mail steamers. I sympathize with his remarks in reference to the regulation to Which he alluded, which seems to be paltry in the extreme, and utterly unfitted to a serious defence proposition. To say that certain men shall undergo only five days' training out of 365 days, is to say that the} shall not perform any effective work. But the regulation in question has nothing whatever to do with this provision. It is a separate matter with which my honorable friend could deal, under ordinary circumstances, by submitting a motion.

                    <para>. - It appears to me that the amendment would effect an improvement. An amendment was made in another place aiming at the same object. It was accepted by the Minister, but was afterwards found not to accomplish the purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> amendment rectifies that error, and carries out what was in the mind of the other branch of the Legislature and of the Minister. The proviso to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has alluded, provides that where a man has enlisted, and has served his full period of three years, he shall not incur a monetary penalty if, having re-engaged, he resigns before the second period of three years expires. The reason for that is obvious. If a man leaves before the completion of the three years of his first term, the Government loses what has been spent upon his training. But that is not so if he resigns after re-engaging. There is no object in insisting upon a. penalty if the man does not complete his second term. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no fault to find with the first portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> amendment, except that it seems very prolix. But the second portion is not necessary. The original Act does not, I think, impose any penalty. It is the regulations made under the Act which do that. The practice has been that a man engages for. three years, and, if he retires before the end of that term, is subject to a penalty. Rightly so, because he has had to be clothed and trained, and the Government is put to a certain amount of expense. It is necessary that he should complete his three years' service in order to justify that expenditure. But if he re-engages, and does not complete his second term, there need be no penalty. The matter was brought before me when I was Minister of Defence, and the regulation which provided for the imposition of a penalty regarding the second term was, I think, repealed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> says that he has taken this provision from the English Act ; but the latter portion of it is not applicable to our circumstances, because there is nothing in our Act which imposes a penalty on a man who re-engages. </para>

                    <para>. - I see no object in allowing a man to reenlist if he is to be at liberty to leave the service again next day. It is very undesirable that a man who has re-enlisted should be allowed to leave again without the permission of the Minister. I could cite a number of instances in which great difficulty might arise, even though no state of war existed. We know that, at various times in Australia, gold rushes have occurred which have attracted people from every form of employment. If gold were discovered in New Guinea, and a rush to the place set in, members of the Garrison Battery stationed at Thursday Island, although they might be men who had only recently been re-enlisted, might rush away to the newly discovered gold-field without incurring any penalty whatever if the proposed provisos were inserted. </para>

The objection would apply equally to the men forming a garrison battery at Fremantle, at Sydney Heads, or anywhere else. If a man is not prepared to carry out the terms of his engagement upon re-enlistment, and there is no means to compel him to do so, we might just as well have no provision for re-enlistment at all. </para>

I have not the slightest doubt that if the penalty is continued it will, in  a number of cases, act as a deterrent to reenlistment. There is no doubt some force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said. But we should do what we can to encourage men to re-enlist. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to say that if members of the Defence Force are found to be physically fit, their re-engagement after the short term of three years should not depend upon the whim of the commanding officer. A non-commissioned officer might come into conflict with his commanding officer, and, as the clause stands at present, he might consequently be unable to secure re-engagement. Many of these men are professional soldiers, and we should not leave the permanency of a man's living dependent upon the whim of a commanding officer. Men may be sent up for medical examination at any time, and if they are physically unfit may be discharged. That is a sufficient power to hold over the non-commissioned officers and men of the Permanent Forces. I am prepared to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> amendment, because I think it would give these men something like security in their positions. I hope the amendment will be accepted by the Committee. </para>

It has since been discovered that there are two other sections in which the word " Militia " appears, and in which it is necessary there should be a similar alteration.

A reference is made to a proclamation under the last preceding section, that is section 59, but there is no reference to a proclamation in that section. Later, the clause refers to "a district or sub-district." But there is no definition of a sub-district in the Act. </para>

Otherwise he might have to come to Parliament with an amending Bill. On the other hand, if further investigation should indicate that it is not desirable there will be no compulsion upon him to introduce a uniform. </para>

                        <para>- I mean that a uniform shall be prescribed. I cannot submit an amendment at present, but I .feel inclined to speak against so much of the Minister's amendment as would leave the matter of uniforms entirely open. I regard the amendment as an unsatisfactory way of dealing with a fairly large question, even if it does include small boys. I do not know what has been the rule in the Commonwealth, but in New South Wales' I understand that the uniform of a junior cadet costs about 22s. 6d., and lasts for about three years. I believe that the parents willingly pay portion of the cost and the State the balance. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the cost of the uniform ought to be paid by the parents. Whilst the Senior Cadets of Victoria have been a body remarkable for their ability, appearance, and enthusiasm, the Junior Cadets of New South Wales have not been behind-hand so far as their age and powers have permitted. They have been 'and are numerous and reasonably effective. One of the worst features of this measure was the proposal to do away with the uniform for that which is to constitute the entire basis of the future Defence Force. I cannot understand how it can be expected that small boys will evince an enthusiasm for a service when from them is taken away a mark which gave  them an element of distinction in the community as young soldiers. It would destroy <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps</inline> if we turned the boys back into knickerbockers and ordinary garments. I am in favour of an amendment which would make the wearing of a uniform compulsory. . I care not how simple or inexpensive it is. It must be paid for by the Commonwealth, and the matter should not be left to the whim of the Minister of the day, because one day we might have a Minister who would want to prescribe an extravagant uniform, and another day the whirligig of fate might bring along a Minister who would not have a uniform at all. So long as the question is to be left absolutely unsettled, as the Minister proposes, I regret my inability to see eye to eye with him. Last week, he objected to an amendment on the ground that it was indefinite.  His  amendment to this proposed new section is admittedly indefinite, inasmuch as he desires to leave the matter practically to the sweet will of the Minister of the day. We should have some finality in our legislation. We should approve- or disapprove of the wearing of a uniform. I want to vote for an amendment to be moved by my honorable friend which will remove the element of uncertainty, and I beg that he will submit his proposal in a form which will enable me to vote with him. </para>

                <para class="block">I am very sorry that the Government have changed their mind on this question. I am satisfied that this proposed new section was not put into the Bill without consideration, and on pretty good advice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> represents a mistaken view as to what the Junior Cadets are for, and what their training is to be. The Bill does not propose that they shall be part of the Defence Force. The honorable senator referred in most contemptuous terms to a similar Bill as one to provide for the training of legal infants for the defence of Australia. He scoffed at the very idea of a cadet system. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister knows that the Junior Cadets are in no sense to receive a military training, and are not to be part of the Defence Force. If we are to have a uniform, it must be worn by every junior cadet. Is it to be paid for by the Commonwealth? When I urged that the lads who are to receive military training should receive an additional year's- instruction, it was contended that it would load the scheme too much. What will it cost to provide uniforms for the Junior Cadets? I venture to say that there will be at least 50,000 Junior Cadets, so that at £1 per uniform the cost would come to £50,000. The lads are passing out every year, and therefore new uniforms would be required. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the Minister of Defence announced that the junior cadet system was to apply to all schools, State and private, and not merely to schools in districts where there was a population of 3,000 within a radius of 5 miles, as was the intention of the Fisher Government. If that is so, I am making a conservative estimate when I state that £50,000 will have to be found to provide uniforms. Surely it would be better and more sensible to use that money in giving another year's training to lads between twenty and twenty-one years of age? </para>

                <para class="block">Cadet Force will serve him only for two years. Therefore, we shall have to face an initial expenditure of £50,000 upon cadet uniforms, and a subsequent expenditure of £25,000 annually. Now it would be far better to spend that money in lengthening the period of training in camps by a single day, or, indeed, in any other direction. Here, it is proposed, that it shall be spent merely upon idle show.  It is nonsense to suggest that a uniform is necessary in connexion with a compulsory system of physical drill. It is not necessary to supply uniforms to induce boys to join the Junior Cadets. They have to join. Will anybody tell me that the boys attending our public schools do not march properly because they are not supplied with uniforms? The physical drill which they will have to undergo will form a part of the school curriculum. Where then is the necessity for providing them with a uniform? They are not required to take part in field movements until they become Senior Cadets. Under these circumstances I appeal to the Committee not to waste money in the way that is proposed. It was necessary to attract lads to the old voluntary cadet system by providing them with a uniform, but under the compulsory system which is outlined .in this Bill, no such step is needed. Further, <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> the clause does not declare that the Department shall supply the uniforms; we may revert to the old system under which class distinctions were created on account of the inability of some parents to provide their sons with uniforms. </para>

The Vice-  President  of the Executive Council professes to be opposed to any unnecessary expenditure under this Bill, and yet he coolly moves for an extension of it which will involve the Commonwealth in a considerable outlay. I say that if once this clause be passed, the Minister is not born who will be able to resist the pressure which will be brought to bear upon him by fond parents who wish to sec their lads in uniforms. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the amendment by the Vice-President of the Executive Council will commend itself as a desirable, <inline font-style="italic">via media.</inline> I quite agree with a great dea'l that has been said in reference to the wearing of expensive uniforms by officers. We can have far too much in the way of uniforms. But  1  strongly disagree with the idea that our Citizen Forces generally ought to have no uniforms. If there were any boy between the age of twelve and fourteen years, who would be prevented from joining the Cadet Force, owing to the inability of his parents to provide him with a uniform, I should sympathize with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> But I do not know of any case in Queensland in which the sons of the poorest parents have been prevented from joining the Cadets for that reason. I admit that it may not be necessary to provide lads who are between twelve and fourteen years of age with a uniform which will cost 10s. or 12s. What the Vice-President of the Executive Council asks is that the Minister of Defence shall be vested with discretion to prescribe some sort of uniform for our Junior Cadets. Should experience prove that a uniform wild assist in consolidating the Cadet Force, no doubt it will be provided. In that case I am sure that the Minister will take care to cut down its price as far as possible so that it is the veriest hypocrisy' for anybody to urge that the children of any workmen will be unable to obtain it. </para>

                        <para>- I fail to see how trace can be kept of boys from twelve to fourteen years of age who are exempt from attending school. Some of them, are the sons of widowed mothers, and the latter are very glad for them to go out into the world and earn a little. Who will provide them with the necessary apparatus for their physical training? I venture to say that there are more lads between twelve and fourteen years of age outside of our public schools than are to be found in them. Then, I would ask whether every boy. is to be subjected to exactly the same drill? I recognise that by putting a weak chested lad through certain physical exercises it is possible to absolutely ruin him. I think that some medical inspection ought to be provided which will insure that every lad shaM be put through that physical exercise which is best suited to him - that which will develop him and make him a strong and robust lad. If we are not going to do that,, we shall do more harm than good. I do not see that such instruction is provided for in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has said that the supplying of the uniforms would be left to the discretion of the Minister of Defence. That means that if we had a Minister who was inclined to cut down his vote, he would probably expect the parents to supply uniforms for their boys. That would lead to an element of discrimination. Imagine the position of a boy whose parents could not afford to pay for his uniform. He would be constantly reminded by his class fellows of the fact that he was in a different position from them. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied on that point, if I am given to understand that under no circumstances would the parents have to pay for uniforms. The Minister, when he spoke, did not seem to be clear in his own mind as to how they would be supplied. There is another objection which should be borne in mind, namely, the positive cruelty of expecting lads to wear uniforms of military pattern under a hot sun in the tropical parts of Australia. Military authorities in Western Australia have assured me that no purpose is to be served by compelling youngsters to wear uniforms, and that it would be cruelty to expect them to wear tunics while going through exercises in a broiling sun. There would be no objection to letting boys wear badges of . distinction ; but to clothe them in tight-fitting uniforms which they would burst through in a year or two, would be positive foolishness. I shall vote against the amendment, in the belief that "it is unnecessary, and that the money proposed to be devoted to the purchase of uniforms might be better applied to improving our defences in other directions. </para>

                    <para>. - 1  am sorry that the Government propose to depart from a sound and sensible proposition contained in the' Bill, to the effect that the younger boys who are trained shall not wear uniforms. Whatever arguments may be used for giving uniforms to the Senior Cadets,  1  cannot appreciate any argument for supplying uniforms to the little fellows whom it is proposed to train. This is one of the least defensible ways of adding to the cost of our military system. lt may lead to killing the whole scheme. Later on, we shall have quite enough to do to provide for essentials, and should be careful at this stage not to throw money away on uniforms for growing boys. No boy. at school at the age of twelve could wear a suit of clothes for two years. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. A boy is much more comfortable in an ordinary suit of clothes. It would be folly to expect boys in the warmer portions of Australia to do their exercises in uniform. Clothing that might be suitable in Tasmania or Victoria, would be quite out of place in Western Australia. Apparently, the decorative military school desire to carry their ideas to such lengths as even to put our boys in uniforms. This is a very grave mistake for the Minister to make. He is taking a short cut to bringing the whole scheme into ridicule and disrepute. We already have, in connexion with our regiments, too many elements of distinction. We see some regiments parading in kilts. I have seen more kilts in Australia than I saw in Scotland. What with the St. George's Rifles and their box spurs, and the Scottish Regiment with their kilts, we are in danger of bringing our whole defence system- into ridicule. The sooner we wipe out these distinctive features the better. At any rate, I hope that the Committee will r.ot agree to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I should be inclined to vote for the adoption of a distinctive badge to be worn by a boy as an indication that he had commenced his training as a defender of his country. Probably,  that would lead to the development of a feeling of patriotism and <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps-,</inline> which would be good for the boys. But I regard with some alarm the idea of spending £20,000 or £30,000 a year on uniforms for boys. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> estimate of £50,000 is beyond the mark. I can conceive of a uniform that would not cost more than 10s., or 15s. at the outside. </para>

To put them into uniform while undergoing physical training would be both unduly costly and inconvenient. I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- That will represent about half  an  hour's drill every school day. I should like to know what this uniform means. I attend a physical culture school, and I enjoy the exercises I go through in a uniform which consists of a. sweater, a pair of knickers, and a pair of shoes., better ' than I should do if T attempted to go through them in mv ordinary clothes. ' I am sure that the boys would rather go through their exercises in such a uniform than in their ordinary clothes. If it is made clear that the uniform is not to be of a character which would inculcate in the boys a military spirit I shall not object. If it is to be such as would be prescribed by an instructor in physical culture, I shall be prepared to support it. The uniform should not be such as would inculcate the military spirit, but such as would make it easy for the boys to go through their exercises. , </para>

                    <para>.- I think it would be a pity if the extreme views of either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> were adopted. We must assume that the persons who will have charge of this matter will be possessed of some common sense. They will not put the boys into strait- jackets, but will have some regard for the exercises which must be gone through, and for the conditions of the climate. I think that the Minster has endeavoured to hit the happy medium between the extreme proposals made, but unfortunately we are not quite clear as to what the uniform proposed is likely to be. If it is to be distinctive and at the same time suitable for the exercises no objection can be taken to it. We must give these lads some uniform which will distinguish them from the lads who will not be going through these exercises, to show that they have been honored by being entered in the ranks of  His  Majesty's soldiers. I think it would lie an improvement upon the amendment to insert after the word "uniform" the words " in whole or in part." I believe that honorable senators are agreed as to the kind of uniform desired if we could hit upon the exact terms in which  £0  describe it. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the Vice-President of the Executive Council replies to the various questions which have been put to him. we should consider whether the uniform suggested in the amendment is to be one in which the boys will go to school, wear while they are at school, and wear on their way home again. There would be something in such a proposal, but I do not think that that is what is intended. If that is not what is intended I am afraid that the parents of the children will not be assisted as some honorable senators think, they should be. If the uniform were to be a pair of knickers, a sweater, and a. cap, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> the boys would not be able to wear it going to school. They would have to go in their ordinary clothes to school, and when the hour for their physical exercises arrived, they would have to change their ordinary clothes for the uniform, and at the close of the exercises change again into their ordinary clothes. If that is the idea, then there is nothing in it. That would be of no assistance to the parents, but it would" involve a serious charge upon them with very little advantage to the boys. At present lads at school discard some of their ordinary clothing when going through physical drill. As a rule they go through physical exercises in a shirt and trousers. If it is proposed that the uniform should consist merely of a distinctive cap or belt to show that the boys are junior cadets, I think no honorable senator would object to that. The Vice-President of the Executive Council would do well to explain to the Committee just what the amendment really means. </para>

                    (New South Wales)  [8.41].  - I think I can throw a, little light upon this discussion. I have taken the trouble to go to the Library and have brought back a few figures which will be of interest to honorable senators who take an interest in this question. I intend to direct the attention of the Committee to the uniform worn by the Boy Scouts. In New South Wales at the present time there are between  6,000  and  10,000  Boy Scouts, who wear a uniform which after* all means merely a distinctive dress. The Boy Scouts form a voluntary body, and in view of the fact that they were associated in England with the Army manoeuvres there, the work of the organization is not to be set on one side as merely child's play.

We have thousands of these boy scouts at present wearing a distinctive dress or uniform, and it would be upending things altogether to provide that the State school' soldier should wear no uniform whilst these members of a voluntary organization are all clothed in uniform. Quoting from the official organ of the Boy Scouts, I find that the' prices of the various articles of their uniform are as follow : There isa khaki shirt, which is a garment open at the neck after the style of the jumper of a sailor suit. It is merely a shirt which is tucked into whatever dark coloured pants the Boy Scouts wear. It costs 2s. 6d. Then there is a leather belt, a pouch, straps for carrying a great coat, a knife and sheath, together costing 2s. id. The hat, of the Baden-Powell pattern, costs 3s. There is a haversack for carrying rations required during the day which costs is.  sd.,  and a muffler to protect the boys' throats in cold weather costing is. </para>

                        <para>- The Boy Scouts provide the broom handles themselves. The whole outfit costs about 10s., including a knife, a sheath, a belt, and straps for carrying an overcoat. I think that we have in some such scheme as that a solution which will commend itself to the majority as supplying a useful garb, fulfilling all the propositions which have been made about lightness and ease, and meeting all the objections about the tightly buttoned, and altogether too thick, clothing which I see small boys wearing about Melbourne streets. I think that the grey olive shade of cloth which is worn here is a great deal too heavy for active work. For dumb-bell exercise it is out of place, except possibly in the winter months. </para>

I dare say that within a few months there will be from 10,000 to 15,000 boys in the Commonwealth garbed in this free, easy, and inexpensive manner. </para>

                    <para>. - I wonder, whether the Minister recognises the danger underlying his amendment. I have listened to arguments from both sides of the chamber, and it is only fair to say that the position put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has not yet been attempted to be answered. I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger credit for having put forward, as usual, a fanciful idea, which, though possibly embellished with his own views, points to a very great danger underlying the amendment. He has pointed out that if the question is left entirely to the Minister, he will keep the cost of the uniform at the lowest possible point. Whilst one Minister might approve of a brass button being worn on the lappel of the coat, another Minister might desire a ,.ap to be worn, and still another Minister might direct the use of other articles. After having listened here for six years to very many speeches on the question of defence, and quite a number with reference to the decoration of our defenders, I am convinced that some day we shall have a Minister who will run the country almost to ruin in his desire to look at a nicely decorated person in arms. </para>

                            Ledger was perfectly right when he stated that the Minister of Defence would have full control, and would be able to weigh his wants by his means. There are many persons who have very little regard for the use to which a soldier should .be put, and there are some who have a great desire to see a soldier decorated like a peacock. Surely it is not necessary that the boys should have uniforms when being drilled in club swinging? In some parts of Australia, a man who swung clubs in a sweater would be regarded as a new chum.

                        <para>- I fully recognise that difficulty. Surely every one will admit that there are schools which now give all the physical training which will be. required of the lads by the Bill ? Perhaps, not all of them, but certainly a large number of the boys, and the girls too', are to-day receiving a physical training which will not be eclipsed by that which is laid down in this measure. At present, no uniform is worn. The boys carry their clubs and broomsticks to school, and are taught physical exercise day after day. What we are aiming at is to compel all boys who go to school to perform this drill, if physically fit, according to the provisions of the law. As the drill will be given within the precincts of the schools, there is no necessity to provide for uniforms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> pointed out a serious difficulty when he suggested that a large number of boys between twelve and fourteen years of age would not be trained. Clever lads, whose parents are oppressed by the conditions of life, are forced to seek employment as soon as they succeed in getting a permit. Unquestionably there is a large number of such boys. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, there is. I would rather that every boy should remain at school until he was fourteen years of age; in fact, I wish we could compel every boy to go to school until he was sixteen years of age, and that we could make the conditions such as would enable parents to do without assistance from their sons until that age was reached. We are confronted with a difficulty which the Bill does not seek to overcome. It is certainly one which ought to be carefully considered by the Minister. I know a school in a country town where, every year, a very large percentage of the boys receive a permit to work at the age of twelve years, or very little over that age- </para>

                        <para>- Some do. In most cases, the lads are drafted out to whatever employment can be found for them. Unless better provision is made in the Bill, the physical training of such boys will be neglected. 1 Tecognise, of course, that when the age of fourteen years is reached, every lad who is physically fit will become a senior cadet. I trust that the Committee will not empower the Minister to order even a button to be worn on a cadet's coat. The lads ought to be trained in the clothes which they ordinarily wear at school. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has reminded me of a circumstance which must necessarily come under review when this matter is considered. It is that a large number of our cadets already possess uniforms, and entertain a strong objection to parting with them. It would astonish honorable senators to learn the attachment which exists between these lads and their uniforms. We should require to call out the Citizen Forces to take those uniforms from them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has made a suggestion which has a great deal to recommend it from a practical stand-point, and assuming that the amendment is approved by the Committee, I shall certainly bring it under the notice of my colleague the Minister of Defence. This provision has designedly been left open, because of the difficulty that has been experienced in determining what course we ought to take. At present we cannot lay down the exact nature of the uniform which will be supplied, or say the expenditure which will be incurred upon it. These matters must be left to regulation. </para>

                        <para>- I can hardly conceive of any Minister of Defence doing that. In this provision, it is not proposed to do anything more than to leave the matter open. If the Committee agree to it in its present form, and the Minister upon inquiry finds that it will be advantageous to prescribe by regulation a simple and inexpensive uniform, it will be competent for him to do so. That regulation will be subject to review by both branches of the Legislature. If, on the contrary, he does not prescribe a uniform the position will remain just as it is to-day. Under all the circumstances I ask the Committee to agree to the amendment as it stands. </para>

                <para class="block">The original Act gives power to the Government to acquire, or build, and arm vessels, and to construct and maintain forts, ammunition factories, artillery and rifle ranges, and other defence works. The Bill before us also proposes to give power to the Government to establish and maintain factories for the manufacture of military clothing. My amendment proposes to give power to establish farms for the breeding of horses for defence purposes. Honorable senators who have at different times watched military manoeuvres and reviews must have been struck by the unsuitableness of the horses used by the Field Artillery. It has been the custom of the Department to hire, and naturally many of the horses so obtained were not very suitable for the work. Manoeuvres have sometimes been spoilt for that reason. The expense of hiring has been considerable, and the system has been condemned by the best military authorities. On a recent occasion, the Minister of Defence admitted that   £5,000  per annum was being spent on hiring unsuitable horses. During the present year, a Committee was appointed to consider this question. It consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James.</inline> Hutchison, M.P., representing the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Grimwade,</inline> of the Field Artillery, and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Dangar,</inline> Director of Artillery. They reported that the present method is. altogether unsuitable, and made certain recommendations, giving their reasons for advocating that the Government should own artillery horses. They urged that untrained horses hamper training, and have in many cases proved a positive danger. Further, that they bring ridicule on the troops. The Committee urged that the hiring system was very much more expensive in proportion to the efficiency obtained than would be a system of breeding and training. Another reason is that the hiring system only gives four horses per gun during military manoeuvres, whereas the proper number is six per gun. In consequence of having only four to a gun, heavier horses are used, and this further militates against the success of manoeuvres. The Committee furnished a comprehensive table of figures showing the number of horses required under the proposed system. </para>

                        <para>- No; the report relates only to the Artillery. Apparently no consideration was given to mounted infantry. During, the South African war, mounted infantry was the most useful arm in the field, and probably in the event of hostilities would be found to be the most useful branch of the Australian defence system. We must have a suitable supply of horses in order that our troops may be mounted, and re-mounted, in case their services are required for the defence of the country. The Committee pointed out that the saving in money would be £21,552 per annum; and they summed up as follows - </para>

                        <para>- I was about to do so. On the line between Adelaide and Port Darwin, 342 horses are used. The whole of them have been bred at the various stations along the line. In a report furnished to the Military Committee, it is pointed out that when the construction of the overland telegraph line was completed, a number of mares which had been used in connexion with the work, instead of being sold, were divided amongst the various stations along the line. A stallion was procured, and sent from station to station. The result has been that not only have enough horses been bred to do all the work on the overland line, but the Department has been able to supply other stations at Streaky Bay, and down the West Coast with horses bred by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the police do not breed their own horses. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> Fysh was Postmaster-General, a number of surplus horses bred at the overland telegraph line stations were sold. Speaking from memory, I think the sales realized something like £7°°- The Military Committee estimate that three men and two or three blackfellows would be sufficient for each of the different stations established for horse-breeding purposes. Sure.'y it would be quite easy to proceed immediately to increase the number of horses bred at the telegraph stations, and to utilize them for military purposes. If the horses that are being bred for the work of the Post and Telegraph Department are not of the kind required, it would be an easy matter to procure mares and stallions for the breeding of horses useful for military purposes. Of course, the horses used by artillery would require to be heavier than those used by mounted infantry ; but all kinds of horses might be bred in unlimited numbers in Central Australia, and at a very low cost indeed. In one of the reports, it is mentioned that the whole cost of horses bred there for the Post and Telegraph Department is 30s. per head. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The Federal Government is proposing to take over that part of Australia, and it would be possible to breed an unlimited number of horses there. We shall require, in -the near future, thousands of horses for military purposes ; and it seems to me that as we have extended the scope of our defence law by enabling the Governor-General in Council to establish clothing factories and ammunition factories, we might go further and permit the establishment of farms for the breeding of horses for military purposes, and of depots in which to keep them. What  1  propose is to include in the Bill a permissive power which, if it were not used, would entail no expense. Such a provision might  easily and simply be inserted in the Bill now, whereas, if in the course of a year or two it was found necessary that the Government should have this power, special legislation would be required for the purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> seems to have fallen into the same error as the members of the Committee who prepared the report from which he has quoted. The honorable senator has referred to the disadvantages and cost of the hiring system. In that I agree with him entirely. But, like the members of the Commit :ee, the honorable senator assumes that the only remedy is breeding. He has overlooked the fact that there is an alternative, and that is the owning of horses by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that I am with the honorable senator as to the inconveniences and cost of the hiring system. What is more, the disabilities under which the Department has laboured in the past on this account will, no doubt, be increased in the future, because we are proposing the adoption of a compulsory system under which we shall have practically continuous periods of training. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The hiring system is absolutely condemned, and has been justified in the past, only because of the limited periods for which horses were required. Some other system must be adopted ; but I hope that the Committee will hesitate before it approves of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story's</inline> proposal at this juncture. The alternative to which I think the Department should have recourse is one which they have ample power at present to adopt, and that is to buy their horses. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> has been talking about the breeding of horses in the centre of Australia. The honorable senator went into an elaborate calculation, the results of which I am glad he did not give the Committee, to show that one dam would in a few years have a numerous progeny. If such enormous profits might be derived from the breeding of horses as the honorable senator suggested, men would have gone in for breeding them long ago, and would have made fortunes. As a matter of fact, there is no class of stock breeding in which the risks are so great, and the results so precarious as they are in horsebreeding. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know Oodnadatta, but I do know an enormous stretch of country of somewhat similar character in- the western portion of my own State, where horse-breeding has been carried on. I do not wish to decry the country in the neighbourhood of Oodnadatta in any way, but it is admitted that it has a very light rainfall. It necessarily follows that in such country there are periods of years in which the rainfall is so small that the fatalities to stock are very great. That is the great drawback to horse-breeding in any district such as the western division of my own State. The land is cheap enough, but it has been invariably found that the class of stock, the breeding of which involves the greatest elements of risk owing to precarious seasons, is large stock, and of large stock the risks in the case of horses are greatest. In the report to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> referred, the Committee pointed out that a saving of £20,000 per annum might be made bv the breeding of horses. </para>

                        <para>-The Committee proposed that horses bred by the Government should be trained for military work and then used to carry butchers' baskets, or for other useful purposes. The financial proposals of the report have only to be considered to be condemned. They are based on the assumption that horses purchased for about £30 per head should be used by the Department for purposes of training, and then hired out to various individuals under most restrictive conditions, and the Committee anticipated that the Department would receive a rental for them of about £20 per head per year. No man in Australia would pay £20 a year for the hire of a Government horse which might be called in for Government purposes at a moment's notice, and at a time when it would be most inconvenient for the person hiring the horse to lose its services, especially when he would be under all sorts of restrictions as to the use . to which he should put it. The Committee propose, for instance, that persons hiring these horses should not be allowed to use them for ploughing, or for anything that could be described as heavy draught. They assume that the person hiring one of these horses would keep it as a sort of fancy animal for light jobs about the place, subject to conditions of shoeing and veterinary attendance which the average horse in Australia never gets, and that for less thana year's use of the animal he would pay two-thirds of its market value. The average Australian who uses horses is not quite such a fool as to do that. I would advise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> not to press his amendment now. He might submit an amendment substituting the ownership of horses by the Department for the hiring system, but that would be unnecessary because the Department and the Minister of Defence favour the ownership of horses. I suggest to the Committee that we have not yet sufficient information on the subject, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> has not" made out a sufficiently good case to induce us to launch out into this new experiment. </para>

                    <para>. -I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> will not withdraw the amendment. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has exhibited a great deal of unnecessary alarm. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> pointed out, under the original Act, the Government are given the power, if they think it desirable or necessary, to establish clothing factories, ammunition factories, and so on. But not one of those things is compulsory upon the Government. Nor would the establishment of horse-breeding farms be compulsory if the amendment were carried. But a time might come when the Government of the day would find that it was opportune to do so, and then they would have the necessary power to 'act. I am sure that no one need be alarmed at the prospect of awakening one morning and finding that the Government had established horse-breeding farms, or anything else of the kind, throughout Australia. Any action of that description would be only taken after a good deal of investigation and consideration, and I am sure that it would be undertaken bv a Government which could count upon the support of Parliament. The establishment of horse-breeding farms would be dealt with in exactly the same way as the establishment of clothing and ammunition factories. I hope that the Committee will see the wisdom of inserting a permissive provision, which may be availed of whenever an opportune time arrives. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to support the amendment for a reason which I think has not yet been mentioned. If we are to get the best service from our mounted infantry, our artillery, and other branches of the military service which require horses, we shall need to have the best class of horses for that purpose which can be procured. In the circumstances in which horse-breeding is now carried on in Australia, it is not possible to secure the best class of horses for that work. I have dabbled a little in horse-breeding, and I know that throughout Australia it is carried on in the most promiscuous fashion, and without any thought or care for breeding any particular stamp of animal, except in a very few cases. A good deal of attention is bestowed on the breeding of first-class racehorses and a first-class stamp of heavy draught horse. But those are not the classes of horses which we require, although they may be good material to draw upon in order to build up a suitable stock. Outside those two classes, the breeding of horses is carried on in the most haphazard and promiscuous fashion. Every little farmer who has one or two horses has an old mare of a nondescript character, which he puts to the nearest stallion, without thought as to what the progeny may be. </para>

                        <para>- Probably. I think that the honorable gentleman will agree that my general statement as to the kind of horse-breeding which is carried on is fairly accurate. In order to obtain the best class of horses for military purposes, we want to establish a better system, with a definite purpose in view. We cannot rely upon the promiscuous efforts of the little men who are breeding one or two horses a year. There must be a consistent and systematized effort by some one who will have a definite object to attain, and plenty of money to back it up with. The only body which I can think of as having the necessary enterprise, the proper object in view, and the necessary funds is the body which will need the horses. The Commonwealth would be in exceptionally favorable circumstances for carrying on the project. It would be able to procure the best stock, and to set aside in the Northern Territory a suitable area for the purpose at practically no cost. In addition to the advantage which it would be from the military point of view to always have a large reserve of horses suitable for any military emergency which might arise, \ve should be able to largely improve the breed of horses in Australia, and they need improving very badly. The Government would probably import some suitable stallions, and, after they had had the use of them for a certain number of years they would be able to sell or rent them to other persons, and by-and-by we should gradually build up a breed of stock at the Commonwealth farms whose improved qualities would be stamped on other horses throughout Australia. From that point of view, the amendment is a most advantageous one. I think that the Government ought to take the power to enter into this enterprise whenever they think it desirable to do so. </para>
