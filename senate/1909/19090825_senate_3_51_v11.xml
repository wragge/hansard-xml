An agreement has been arrived at and I expect during the afternoon to be in a position to supply honorable senators with a copy of the agreement, together with some figures, which have been prepared by. the Treasury, and which it is thought may assist them in their consideration of the document. I might, perhaps, be permitted to add that as these papers will be available when the consideration of the Budget is resumed, there will then be a favorable opportunity for honorable senators to discuss the agreement. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of this measure is, I think, well understood by honorable senators. It is intended to legalize the minting and issue of silver coinage for Australia, the object being to secure to the Commonwealth authorities the profit therefrom. There are several countries under the British Crown which have their own coinage, among them being India, Canada, Ceylon, British East Africa, and the Straits Settlement. I mention this, not because we need any justification for what we propose now to do, but in order to show that Australia has not been precipitate in approaching this question. Under the present arrangements regarding coinage, Great Britain enjoys the profit from the issue of silver coinage, but has also been faced with the responsibility of the cost of the upkeep of gold coinage. Some time since the proposition was made that Australia, on receiving the profits of silver coinage, might reasonably be asked to shoulder the upkeep of the gold coinage, which, of course, entails a loss. That might not be regarded as an unfair arrangement, but, as a result, I believe, of what transpired at the Imperial Conference, Great Britain has undertaken to keep the gold coinage up to the standard at the expense of the Imperial Treasury, leaving Australia free to coin her own silver coinage with one stipulation, and that is that the present Imperial silver coinage should not be withdrawn at a rate greater than it is possible for other portions of the Empire using that coinage to absorb it. The Imperial authorities have intimated, in accordance with the arrangement, that they are willing to withdraw  £100,000  worth of silver coinage each year. I need hardly say that the proposition to which the Imperial authorities have assented may be regarded as extremely liberal, because, whilst we are to have the profits derived from the coinage of silver, they will bear the loss incidental to the upkeep of gold coinage. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that later, and I think I shall be able to show that for the present, at any rate, there is a very good reason why we should not commence minting operations in silver in Australia. The withdrawal of the  £100,000  worth of silver coinage, which is the key of the whole position, will take place by the presentation at the Mint in Perth, Sydney, or Melbourne, of that amount of silver currency, the Imperial authorities paying for it at its face value, so that the loss of its redemption will fall upon those who issued it. There is some little difficulty in arriving at a correct estimate of the quantity of silver coin current in Australia. I have given some little time to the consideration of the matter, and I must say that it appears to be almost impossible to arrive at a satisfactory estimate. The total quantity of silver coin sent to Australia in the last thirty-five years amounted in value to something in excess' of £3,000,000. The highest estimate, that of the Imperial Mint authorities, puts the quantity now current in Australia at  £2,000,000,  whilst other estimates put it down as low as  , £1,250,000.  It is known that something like  , £584,000  worth of old and worn coins have been withdrawn. On the figures given, that would still leave, roughly,  £2,500,000  of silver coinage current in Australia. As the highest estimate places the amount current ' at only.  £2,000,000,  it is quite clear that some of the coinage disappears. The amount, according to various estimates, ranges from £500,000 to nearly  £1,250,000.  This is generally accounted for by silver arriving originally in Australia being subsequently sent to New Zealand, Fiji, and the islands of the Pacific, and some, carried by travellers, back to Great Britain. For the reasons I have shown, it is almost impossible to arrive at an estimate of the quantity current in Australia with the degree of satisfaction which we should have in dealing with approximately safe figures. Whatever the quantity of silver coinage current in Australia may be, the Imperial authorities undertake to withdraw  £100,000  per annum. It is estimated that the quantity of new coinage required for Australia will also be in the neighbourhood of  £100,000  per annum. During the last ten years the silver imported into Australia has been at the rate of about  £111,859  per annum, so that if our requirements continue up to that level for the next few years, there should be, roughly, a little over  £100,000  worth of new coins  required, and another £100,000 of coins required to take the place of those which the Imperial authorities propose to withdraw. That means that £200,000 worth of the new coinage of silver will be necessary to meet the requirements of Australia every year. </para>

                            <para>- I hope so. The £200,000 is subject to the deduction due to the drainage away to which I have referred. It is impossible to estimate how much of the £100,000 worth of silver coinage coming to Australia each year, for the last ten years, has remained here for Australian use, and how much has been taken away to various places in the Pacific and to New Zealand, and to Great Britain, by travellers. It is certain that some of the coinage is taken out of Australia in that way, and £200.000 worth would probably not be required to meet our annual requirements in the immediate future. What our actual annual requirements are must be left to time to reveal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has interjected that we should make a profit of £100,000 on the coinage of £200,000 worth of silver. The Treasury estimate of the profit on the coinage of silver is 60 per cent., and if we issue £200,000 worth the profit would of course be more than £100,000. I have stated the Treasurer's estimate of profit, but I accept it with a great deal of reserve. I think it is probable that there will be an amount of profit in the first years when we are issuing the new coin, but the new coins issued to-day must be redeemed later on at their face value, and we must meet the loss in the transaction of recoining them, making up the deficiencies in weight, and again issuing them to the public. Whilst I have given the Treasury estimate, which should be the most reliable, I say again that <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> personally accept it with some measure of reserve. </para>

                            <para>- There are two ways in which coins are redeemed. When they fall under the statutory weight they may be presented at the Mint, and the other means is the calling in of coins by proclamation. In practice the banks deal with the matter, as when coins! are below a certain weight they are sent by the banks to the Mint. It is proposed to coin in the first year's operation of this authority £200.000 worth of silver coin. That, it is thought, will be sufficient to meet the maximum demand. If there should be any surplus in the first year, it will be merely so much in hand when we commence operations for the year next following. The present proposal is to have these coins minted at the Imperial Mint in London. I anticipate two objections to that course. One is that we ought, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> interjected, to have them minted in Australia. I shall not dispute whether or not ultimately that might not be the best thing to do, but at present we are confronted with this difficulty - the existing Mints in Australia have not machinery strong enough to mint silver. Apparently the machinery required for the minting of silver must be stronger and heavier than that required for the minting of gold. To mint silver coinage in Australia we should have to purchase additional machinery. It would be Commonwealth machinery, and would have to be placed in Mints which are Imperial institutions. For that reason, and because time is an element in the matter, in order that the profit may the sooner flow into the Commonwealth Treasury, it is thought inexpedient to adopt that course, and that we should allow the coins to be minted at the Imperial Mint in London. The Imperial authorities have undertaken to do the work at cost price, which runs out at something like 3 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Apart from the existing Mints, it is estimated that it would cost £20,000 to lay down the necessary plant, and that plant would turn out in two months, and probably in a shorter period, the amount of coinage required for Australia in twelve months. So that we should have our staff and machinery idle for ten months during the year. I may be permitted to anticipate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - whose interest in a dual proposition is well known - by saying that another alternative is open to us - that of setting up an establishment, which, in addition to minting coins, might turn out almost everything ' that is required by our Military Forces. </para>

If this Bill be passed, it will only remain for us to despatch a cable authorizing the work of coinage to proceed immediately. I would further point out that the arrangement which has been made with the Imperial authorities is terminable to-morrow, if the Government thought fit so .to act. In no way is the Commonwealth bound bv this Bill in regard to future minting, or in regard to the establishment of a factory for the manufacture of cartridge cups. This measure, it will be observed, prescribes a gold currency. It will be seen that, whilst it lays down what is to be the local gold currency, no power is taken under it to issue gold coins in Australia. So long as the Imperial authorities are generous enough to keep our gold coin in good order, and to bear the loss that is involved in that connexion, I apprehend that no objection will be urged to this omission from the Bill. In regard to silver coinage, it will be noted that under this Bill, power is taken to issue only the coins which are enumerated in the schedule. From that schedule' the half-crown is missing. The reason is that, by omitting to coin half-crowns, the road will be left open to us to adopt the system of decimal coinage later on. It may be urged that in the meantime some inconvenience might be occasioned bv the absence of the half-crown from our currency. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is dispensing alms in the future, no doubt he will prefer to part with half-a-crown rather than with a florin. But the inconvenience which some persons anticipate from- the non-coinage of half-crowns is not likely to be present for some years, inasmuch as British half-crowns will still be current in Australia until they are withdrawn. </para>

                            <para>- Let me point out to the honorable senator that even if we did coin half-crowns, no more profit would be available to us. The measure of our profit will be limited by the amount which is withdrawn each year. It will make no difference to our profit whether that amount is withdrawn in shillings or in half-crowns. But if there is a demand for the half-crown, that coin will not be amongst those which are handed in at the Mint for withdrawal purposes. If the Banks find that their customers desire them, they will retain the half-crowns and return to the Mint only coins of other denominations. It will thus be open to Parliament, at a later period, to determine whether the inconvenience which may arise from the absence of half-crowns is greater or less than is the advantage of keeping the question open until we have decided whether we  shall adopt the decimal system. In the schedule of the Bill is set. out the quantity of silver which must be included in the various coins. Those quantities conform to the standard which has been adopted by Great Britain and Canada. In the case of silver, the quantity prescribed is  37/40ths,  and in the case of other metals it is set clown at 3/4ths. That is equivalent in decimals to 92.5 silver, and 7.5 per cent, of baser metal. I repeat that these represent the standard which obtains in Great Britain and Canada. All other British Dominions adopt as their standard 80 per cent, of silver and 20 per cent, of other metals. It has been thought better, however, that we should adhere to the Imperial standard, notwithstanding that by so doing we shall sacrifice a slight measure of profit. In connexion with a local coinage, it is necessary to have a distinctive design, in order that when the time comes for the redemption of the various coins we may know the Mint to which each should be returned to be rehabilitated. The design which has been submitted is that of the King's head upon one side of the coins, and the map of Australia, including Tasmania, upon the other. Concerning the inscription upon them, there has been some little discussion as to what would be appropriate and acceptable to Australia. The original proposal, .1 believe, was that upon one side should appear the Latin equivalent of the words King and Emperor, namely, <inline font-style="italic">Rex et</inline><inline font-style="italic">lmperator.</inline> Some exception was taken to that elsewhere. </para>

It was pointed out that the King's title, so far as we in Australia are concerned, is not national, but territorial, and that it was necessary on that account to ignore the proposal to insert " King of all the Britains," which would be a national and not a territorial title.

                            <para>- Exactly; and yet the title Emperor appears on the currency of Great Britain. I have endeavoured to outline the Bill ; but there is one other thing which I wish to say with regard to a local currency. That is, that travellers going Home from Australia may possibly find themselves under a disability from having to lose on the exchange of Australian silver coins. Of course, that is a difficulty. </para>

                            <para>- If any one goes on board ship taking Australian silver with him, he will find, when he arrives in England, that that silver is not current, except at a discount. The difficulty, however, is not so serious as it looks. For some years to come it will be theoretical rather than practical, owing to the fact that British coins will be circulating in Australia until the time of their final withdrawal. That means that it will be possible for any one in Australia who is going to England to exchange his Australian silver for British coinage before leaving this country. Consequently no difficulty is likely to be experienced by any traveller who exercises sufficient forethought to exchange his Australian silver for the currency of Great </para>

                    <para class="block">This is really a drafting amendment, and will, of course, entail certain consequential amendments. The word " nickel " was inserted by way of amendment elsewhere, and it has been found that the words do not fit into the clause, inasmuch as no nickel coins were provided for in the schedule. I propose, therefore, to strike out the words "or nickel," where they appear in subclause 1, and to introduce a subsequent amendment authorizing the issue of nickel coins. . . </para>

Originally power was taken under this Bill for the Treasurer to coin other silver coins than those set out in the schedule. That was done because it was thought that it might be desirable later on to. coin, say, half-crowns, or, if we adopted a decimal system, to coin decimal coins. But it was afterwards provided that the silver coins issued should be limited to the coins set out in the schedule. </para>

One coin was called "currency," and the other "British coin," and sometimes the difference in the value of a shilling was twopence.. We shall have a complicated position in Australia if there is to be a variation in the value of British and Australian coins ; - it will perplex people very much. Most of us have had some experience of the East, and we know how the value of certain coin varies there from day to day. </para>

Will the Australian coinage be of absolutely the same value as the British currency which is circulating?

The proper weight and standard fineness of the Australian coins are set out in the schedule, and this clause simply provides that in the making of silver and bronze coins -  a remedy (or variation from the standard weight and fineness specified in the schedule) shall be allowed of an amount not exceeding the amount specified in the schedule. </para>

                    <para class="block">What constitutes a silver coin is set out in the schedule. It is found that even with our fairly accurate machinery it is not possible to stamp a number of coins and guarantee that each one is of exactly the same weight as every other one. Therefore, a very slight allowance is made for the variation caused in the cutting out and stamping of the coins. All that this clause does is to provide that no coins shall issue from the Mint which have a greater variation that that set out in the schedule. The provision is really designed for the protection of the public. Otherwise the Mint might send out coins which were light. </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate the two members of the Government upon having achieved and instituted a very desirable practice. This is the first time in the history of the Senate that it has been afforded an opportunity to discuss the Budget while the issues raised therein are under consideration elsewhere. Having regard to the position which the Senate occupies in the Constitution, it is a good thing that the Ministers have been able to induce their colleagues to provide this opportunity. It may be only blank ammunition that we may be able to fire, seeing that the Estimates are not under consideration, but at the same time I think it is desirable that the members of the Senate, which occupies a far more important position than do the second Chambers in the State Parliaments, should be able to express their opinions on the financial questions raised in the Budget. I venture to say that the time occupied in the discussion will not be lost. As an instance of the value of this practice, we need only look at the agreement recently arrived at between the present Government and the Government of the States. It raises questions of vital importance, which might well be discussed in connexion with the Budget. If that were not done, we should have no opportunity to express an opinion upon the agreement unless the Government adopted some formal method of bringing it before the Senate. Having said so much, I ' regret that the first Budget submitted for discussion in the Senate should be so hopeless and depressing as that now before us. It seems to me to be remarkable for three things. It is the first Federal Budget to announce a deficit; it is the first to propose the use of borrowed money for the ordinary current expenditure of the Commonwealth </para>

                        <para>- r shall show that the ^£1, 200,000 is not to be borrowed for old-age pensions. The Budget announces a deficit, and the borrowing of money for the payment of ordinary current expenditure, but does not propose any new taxation or other new source of revenue to avoid the necessity of loans either in the present year or in the future. For these three reasons this Budget is distinguished from any previous Budget submitted to the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it would. It would only relieve the Commonwealth this year to the extent of £600,000, and would still leave Parliament and the Government responsible for financing the other ,£600,000 required. Next year our position would certainly be better, but it must be remembered that, unless the Government have been flying kites, whilst we should have an increased revenue if the agreement arrived at with the Premiers were adopted, we should also have to face very largely increased expenditure. We should have an increased share of the revenue from Customs and Excise, but I venture to say, looking at the way in which the Tariff is operating, that the gross revenue will decrease. It is easy tq see that the Tariff is doing its work as a protective Tariff, and that it is already decreasing the revenue. I admit, of course, that under the proposed agreement we should next year have a larger share of the revenue than we have this year. I think I shall be able to show before I sit down that, should the revenue be similar to that anticipated this year, even accepting the agreement with the Premiers, we shall not have sufficient for Federal requirements. </para>

                        <para>- We have had increased prosperity this year. We had a bumper harvest last year, and received the benefit of it this year. We have an increased population, but we have received less revenue than we received the year before. I point out that, whilst in the Budget the deficit is stated at ,£1,200,000, it really amounts to ,£1,850,000, because £650,000 of last year's revenue has been taken to the credit of this year. I am aware that the present Government are not to be blamed for the deficit, but they must accept responsibility for the method by which they propose to meet it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> suggested just now that the proposal to borrow ^£1,200,000 is due to the necessity of paying old-age pensions. </para>

                        <para>- I have pointed out that the deficit is really ,£1,850,000, arid as old-age pensions are estimated to cost only £I 500,000, they cannot be said to be the cause of the whole of the deficit. I know that the argument is used that this Budget discloses the intention on the part of the Government to adequately provide for the defence of the country. It is said that this has necessitated a largely increased expenditure, and that these considerations justify their position. The vote for special appropriations shows an increase of £416,660 over last year. </para>

                        <para>- No, for all purposes. The departmental votes show an increase of £645,779, of which defence is responsible for £289,395, and the Post Office for £221,885. The vote for additions, new works, and special defence material shows an increase of £385,818, of which the Post Office is credited with £181,139, and Defence with £151,165. These are the chief items of increase over the expenditure for last year. The total increase of expenditure is, therefore, £1,448,257. Seeing that £650,000 was saved towards old-age pensions last year out of a smaller revenue than the Government anticipate this year, it is obvious that if our expenditure is to continue to increase at this rate the Commonwealth will soon need three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, to exercise the power to avail itself of new sources of revenue, or to borrow. I know that it is said that we can justify Commonwealth borrowing for public works. There are honorable senators opposite who say that that is the proper policy to adopt. </para>

                        <para>- The only reproductive public works which the Commonwealth has to undertake are those connected with the Post and Telegraph Department. It could not be suggested, for instance, that providing ammunition or building a fort are reproductive works. I have analyzed the Budget to find out what works proposed in it come within the category of reproductive public works. The new works proposed involve an expenditure of £1,054,124. Of this amount £328,485 are required for defence material and works, and only. £725,639 can be said to be required for works of a reproductive character. It is very doubtful whether by any stretch of imagination some of the services to which this amount is to be applied could be considered works of a reproductive character. For instance, I doubt very much whether it is right to say that the £5,000 put down in connexion with the Federal Capital, and the amount proposed in connexion with the establishment of the Commonwealth Offices in London, can fairly be called amounts proposed for works of a re productive character. I have gone very carefully through the Budget, and I can discover only- £725.639 which can be suggested as proposed in any way for services which would justify a borrowing policy. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but I say that if the Government believe that a borrowing policy is justifiable for works of a reproductive character, they should have had the courage of their opinions, and should have come down with a proper borrowing policy, and have announced the works they intended to go on with. They have done neither the one thing nor the other. They have announced a number of works, many of which can hardly be called reproductive, and at the same time have brought down a borrowing policy which contains all the evils and none of the virtues of such a system. With a Customs revenue of £10.800,000 anticipated this year, the Government expect to give back to the States £7,891,000 by borrowing £1,200,000 and through the existence of a Trust Fund of £650,000. I am coming now to the proposed agreement with the Premiers. If these two latter amounts were deducted, as they should be, in order to find out what the Commonwealth will really have available, from the amount to be given to the States, it will be found that just over £6,000,000 is left to Commonwealth expenditure. With a declining revenue, and committed as we are to a military and naval policy which involves an increase in expenditure of at least £500,000 a year beyond the ordinary expenditure for these services, the Commonwealth is deliberately entering into an agreement which commits it for all time to a contribution at a certain rate to the States. I have shown that if we deduct the amount proposed to be raised under a borrowing policy and the amount to the credit of the Trust Fund, with which we started the year, we shall not have £6, 000,000 for Commonwealth expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> desires to induce me to get out of my depth. I take it that recourse to Exchequer bills is a form of borrowing. The present Government announced that they intended to propose a vigorous and forward policy of defence. The year just passed, roo8-q, was a bad year for the Defence Department, because in that year it was one of the Departments that suffered from the pruning knife. Its ordinary Estimates were cut down, and its Works Estimates were reduced to the extent of ,£156,000 on the vote for the previous year. But the present Government, in order to prove their case, institute a. comparison between the expenditure proposed this year and the expenditure incurred last year, and then say, in effect, " We are spending £500,000 more upon defence this year than was expended last year." I intend briefly to analyze their proposals in this connexion. The Estimates for the present year show an increase in the defence vote of ^524,629. Of that amount ,£227,314 is to be expended upon works and material, and .£297,315 upon services - that is in keeping up the establishment, including the new cadet scheme. </para>

                        <para>- I will deal with Chat question presently. But the vote for works and material in 1908-9 represented a decrease of ,£161,327 upon the vote for 1907-8. Honorable senators will recollect that in 1906 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> as leader of the Government in this Chamber, proposed - in order to put the existing forces upon an efficient basis - an expenditure of approximately ,£200,000 per annum, which was to extend over three years, and intimated that if Parliament sanctioned the payment of the first instalment its action would be interpreted as an indication of its willingness to vote that expenditure for three consecutive years. In 1906 the amount in question was voted by Parliament, and it was voted again in 1907-8. But in 1908-9, the then Government, having ear-marked a certain portion of the revenue for the purpose of providing for coastal defence and old-age pensions, and finding themselves within measurable distance of exceeding the one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue to which the 'Commonwealth was entitled, cut down the vote on defence works and material by ,£156,000. Con"sequently the sum voted in that connexion in 1908-9 was only sufficient to provide for the carrying out of the contracts which had been entered into in 1907-8. Therefore, if we wish to analyze what the Government now propose in the matter of making our defence forces effective, we ought to compare the expenditure in this connexion with that incurred in 1007-8, 2nd not with the expenditure of 1908-9. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Government could have expended the amount which was sanctioned by Parliament during the previous year. In  1907-8  the expenditure upon defence works and material was  £288,207,  and the amount proposed to be voted during the current year is  £328,485,  or an increase of only about  £^40,000.  In other words, the vote for new works and material represents only a very small increase over the expenditure in  1907-8,  which was a normal year. Yet there is a. reason why the Estimates for the current year should represent a substantial advance upon tha expenditure for  1907-8.  The reason is that owing to the policy which was pursued in  1908-9,  not only did we not maintain the progress which should have been made by our defence forces, but those forces actually dropped back. In order to compensate for this, our expenditure for the current year should have been doubled. Honorable senators will recollect that it was proposed to re-arm our fixed defences, and to spread the expenditure under this heading over three years. The Colonial Defence Committee, sitting in Great Britain, recommended that certain forts .should be re-armed with a certain type of gun and certain armaments. For two years effect was given to those recommendations, but last year they were entirely ignored, with the result that even if the necessary money were voted to-day it is very doubtful whether the rearmament of these forts could be completed before the expiration of the financial year. Six months of that year will probably have elapsed before trie Appropriation Bill has been passed by Parliament, so that even were the money then available, it is very problematical whether we could provide the requisite guns before the close of  1909- 10.  Seeing that the scheme to which I have alluded ought to be completed, sufficient funds should have been made available for the purpose. As a result of the policy adopted. last year, the important coaling port of Newcastle was omitted from the scheme. Yet in speaking of that port, the Colonial Defence Committee said, in effect, " Here is a port which ought to be re-armed with modern guns," and had effect been given to its recommendation that port would now be so armed. I understand that in this Budget provision is made for the re-armament of Newcastle, but as I have already pointed out, the financial year will have ended before the work can even be commenced, whilst there are other ports which cannot be properly armed for another year. I repeat that the Government, in order to make up arrears, should have increased the vote upon works and material for the current year. Instead, they merely propose to increase the vote upon services by  £289,000,  including an increase of the vote for cadets by  ,£163,103.  These increases practically represent the new defence policy of the Government. I am aware that portion of the vote for defence material is intended for the equipment of the cadets. But that is the vote for the establishment, and it leaves  ,£126,292  to represent the increased expenditure upon our fighting forces. When we recollect that the Government are saying that their defence proposal, so far as universal service is concerned, amounts merely to a cadet system extending towards manhood, we are justified in declaring that the whole provision which they have made towards the more effective defence of the Commonwealth represents an increased expenditure of  £126,292  upon existing establishments.. So far as I can gather they make no provision for any expansion of the militia forces or the volunteer forces, or of the permanent or the field artillery, and they provide for only a slight increase on the vote for training purposes. I understand that the field artillery are to be given an additional term of training, but no proposal is forthcoming to increase the period of training in the case of the militia. Now, in several of the States, notably in Queensland, the militia forces, by reason of the enthusiasm of their officers and men, and of the co-operation of employers, had reached a stage when they were able to obtain eight days' annual training. But in some of the other States - in South Australia and Victoria, for example - the annual period of training extends over only four days. If honorable senators visited these' encampments they would realize that a training of four days yearly is practically worthless. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> will agree with me that the time occupied in getting the men settled in camp, and in returning them to their homes, absorbs a good portion of four days. In New South Wales it had been the custom for officers and men to go into camp annually for eight days. Last year, however, the period was shortened to six days. I had hoped that in this Budget the Government - seeing that they had announced their intention to make the defence of </para>

We proposed that our scheme should take effect from 1910-11-, and that during the current year we should make provision for purchasing material, increasing the number of instructional classes, and also the number of instructional officers. Our estimate of the expenditure in that connexion, during the present year, was ^400,000. That is to say, apart from the existing forces, we proposed to expend ,£400,000 upon the new cadet force which we intended to establish. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. My short experience of administering the Defence Department has taught me thai if our forces are to be of any value in time of war, there exists a great need for a larger expenditure in various directions. For instance, there is no more effective arm of the service than is the Field Artillery. It plays a very important part in all modern battles. In some of the battles which occurred during the Russo-Japanese war this arm of the service practically turned the tide. Our method of dealing with the Field Artillery is this : We start a corps in a town, and then we call for tenders for the supply of horses. Perhaps the man who secures the contract for the supply of horses for the Artillery on Saturday afternoons is also a contractor for the carting of rubbish in the town, or he may be a delivery-van man. Probably he sends along a .horse which has had rather an easy time during the week, or it may be a horse that has been out to grass. The horse may never have been attached to a field gun before. With horses supplied in this way the men of the Field Artillery take their guns out to the drill ground. The horses are generally new to the work, which, I need hardly say, is likely to be entirely different from any work to which horses so supplied have been accustomed. Consequently, nearly the whole of the time of the men, instead of being devoted to instructional purposes, is taken up in training the horses. Perhaps on the next Saturday afternoon, when another drill parade is called, the men do not get the horses which they had on the previous Saturday. In that case, they have to spend that afternoon also in training horses instead of being trained themselves. </para>

                        <para>- The Government of which I was a member suggested a means by which an alteration could be made. I think it is possible to have, under the militia system, a better method of supplying the Field Artillery with horses, which would not cost much more than the present system does. The existing system is not only a bad, but a costly, one. The Commonwealth has been paying up to ,£1 per day for such services as I have described, and, as I have indicated, the result of it is that the Field Artillery, although, in any case, they get very little time in the year  for training, have to devote a very large part of that time to training horses instead of being themselves trained. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the honorable senator must recollect that there are very few men, even in a big city like Melbourne, who can tender for the supply of horses to the Field Artillery. There are few men who have sufficient spare horses. The contracts which are signed compel the contractors to supply horses to the Field Artillery whenever they are wanted. At Easter time they may be wanted for five or six days. There are few owners who can afford to be without their horses for such a period. Any Field Artilleryman in the Commonwealth, whether he be a militiaman or a permanent man, can tell you that the present system practically prevents us from having an efficient Field Artillery. They say, also, that it is a wasteful, as well as an unsatisfactory, system. </para>

                        <para>- They have done so. While I was Minister of Defence, a Departmental Committee was formed to consider this subject. As I was very busy with other matters, the Committee was presided over by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchison,</inline> M.P., and the other members were <inline font-weight="bold">Major Dangar</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Grimwade,</inline> the former a permanent officer and the latter a militia officer. They went into the whole question as to how our Field Artillery corps might be better served, and what would be the cost. They proposed a system which is actually being adopted to-day in Great Britain in connexion with the Territorial Force, and is also in operation in Germany. It is this : That the Department should buy its own horses, and then farm out a certain proportion of them to carriers, on condition that they should be available for artillery purposes whenever called upon. The Committee also proposed that in each of the big centres of the Commonwealth - Melbourne, Sydney, . Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth - there should be a depot farm owned by the Department, at which there should be a number of horses trained for artillery work. The spare horses could, from time to time, be exchanged for the horses which had been farmed out to carriers and others. The horses at the farms could be trained during the week, and could be at the service of the Field Artillery Corps on Saturday afternoons. The result of the system would be that when the men assembled for training, the whole of their time could be devoted to that work instead of a great part of it having to be spent on the training of horses. </para>

                        <para>- The cost of the system recommended by the Departmental Committee would actually be less than that of the present system. I recommend the honorable senator to look at the report, which he will see is backed up by substantial evidence. It was not a report supplied by men who were converted before they considered the subject. They had a free hand to bring in any recommendation they liked. They took evidence from men engaged in business, and who were in a position to express an opinion; and they had no hesitation in saying that the scheme, if adopted, would work more economically than the present system does. </para>

                        <para>- Carriers generally look after their horses well. Furthermore, the Department would have matters under its own control, and if it found that a certain carrier did not use the horses properly, it could refuse to let him have them. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Grimwade</inline> is a man who, in this matter, thoroughly understands what he is talking about, and is a member of a very large firm in this city. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Dangar</inline> is one of the best officers in the service of the Commonwealth, and is known as a thoroughly good Field Artillery officer. Both of these officers have appended their signatures to the report, and both of them condemn the system at present in vogue. It has to be remembered that the eighteen -pounder field gun is a most complicated machine. The men need all the time they can spare to understand the weapon which they are expected to use. Yet, under our present absurd system, we have our Field Artillerymen devoting their time to the training of horses which they may never see again, instead of to drill and mastering the guns. Officers have told me that at the Easter Encampment, which generally lasts eight days, the first few days have to be devoted by the Field Artillery to training the horses, instead of to being trained; and when that task is completed the horses may never be used for artillery purposes again. I hope that honorable senators will agree with me that the capital expenditure that would be involved in carrying out the recommendation of the Committee to which I have referred, w'ould be money well spent. Our Field Artillery in Australia will never be valuable as a fighting unit until some such scheme is brought into operation. </para>

                        <para>- The whole of the horses owned by the Department would have to be trained at the Training Depot farms. Some such system as this was in existence in Queensland prior to Federation. The only difference was that in Queensland the custom was not to hire out horses to carriers and others. The Field Artillery horses were used for ordinary Government work. They had a permanent horse depot farm at Brisbane; and the Queensland Field Artillery became one of the most efficient forces in the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The facilities in Queensland were not, so far as I am aware, superior to those available elsewhere. I think it is to be regretted that provision was not made in the Budget for giving effect to the scheme to which I have referred. What is the use of our spending money on our Military Forces unless the\ are made efficient ? If, by the expenditure of some money, we can secure an efficient Field Artillery Force, we shall do well. At present,  Ave  are wasting 'money on a system that does not give satisfactory  results. Furthermore, the present system is most discouraging and disheartening to the men themselves. The men we have in the Field Artillery are as fine a body, physically and intellectually, as one could meet with anywhere. It must be discouraging and disheartening to them to have to deal with stupid horses that have never been trained in the work they are expected to do. Honorable senators have only to go down to Albert Park arid see the Field Artillery going through evolutions to know that what I have been saying is quite true. There may be seen men trying to adapt clumsy old dray horses to artillery work. It would be most amusing if there were not a serious side to the question. Many of the men to whom I talked have told me that they have become disgusted with the whole thing. Another omission from this Budget is that of any proposal to deal with the manufacture of uniforms. The present system, I venture to say, is costing the Commonwealth an unnecessary amount of money. At present, in each State, the commanding officers of the various units are responsible for the clothing of their regiments. Tenders are called for, and accepted in due course. It is the business of the commanding officers to inspect the uniforms and to look after the contracts generally. But everything de- pends upon the vigilance of individual officers. If a commanding officer happens to be a man who is easy going, and does not worry about things, there is a splendid opportunity fora contractor to dodge the specifications and regulations, both as regards the cloth and the quality of the manufacturing. While I was at the Defence Department, I had brought under my notice numberless complaints from all parts of the Commonwealth with regard to the uniforms supplied. No doubt can be left in the mind of any one who has looked over the bills that have come in that a very big sum of money is being paid for the clothing of our forces over and above what should be paid for securing satisfactory results. Our Postal service also uses a large number of uniforms. It seems to me, therefore, to be simply a business proposition that the Commonwealth should make its own uniforms. I went into the question with a Committee consisting of the Secretary to the Department, the Quartermaster-General, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott,</inline> of the Postal Department. In Sydney, they inspected the State Clothing Factory and a number of private clothing factories. They visited most of the clothing factories in Melbourne, and went into the whole question exhaustively. They had before them a report on the Pimlico Clothing Factory in England, which is a Government factory for the manufacture of military uniforms ; and they unanimously reported in favour of the establishment of a Government factory for the manufacture of these uniforms. But, so far as the Budget is concerned, that also appears to have been too Socialistic a project for the Minister of Defence to take up, and no proposal on that head is mentioned. From the defence point of view, the Budget is distinctly a disappointing one. On the naval side, we are told to hope. We are told that whilst the Budget outlines an increase of £9,000, in the sweet by-and-by, after we have received the report of the Imperial Conference, something of a more drastic character will be proposed. I hope that it may be so. If the Budget on the military side is an indication of what is going to be done on the naval side, I am afraid that we shall be doomed to disappointment. There is no <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> offer mentioned now. That is finally abandoned, I understand. If we can believe the press reports' of the Imperial Conference, it has practically indorsed the Fisher programme of naval defence. </para>

                        <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> published the same statement. I think that the Minister now realizes that the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> offer was a joke. At any rate, its authors seem rather ashamed of the offer. If there is one subject we can depend upon Ministers never mentioning now, it is the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> offer. This morning, I refreshed my memory by reading the magnificent oration which the Minister of Trade and Customs delivered in the Town Hall on the subject of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and in which he told his audience that they must not hesitate ; that an offer must be made at once. </para>

The honorable senator did not wax eloquent about an alternative when he spoke in the Town Hall. Nothing less than a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> was spoken of at that time. No mention was then made of an alternative, but the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> idea has now been consigned to oblivion. Naturally we expected to find in the Budget an indication of the policy of the Government regarding the construction of the railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, but it contains no mention of that project, although the Treasurer has practically lived on it for the last eight years. </para>

                        <para>- He has been a political passenger on that question. As regards the Northern Territory, apparently the Bill before the other House is mere political flapdoodle, because the Budget makes no provision for the expenditure of any money in that direction. If the Government are in earnest, and intend to put that Bill through, it will be necessary to make provision for meeting the necessary expenditure. A paltry provision of ,£5,000 is proposed by the' Government for the inauguration of the Federal Capital. The amount is worthy of the Budget. That only shows how much in- earnest the Government are on the question. In my opinion this is a confused Budget, worthy of a confused Government. It discloses no policy. It evinces no constructive capacity or statesmanship. It gives no proof that the Government are going to justify' the high-sounding phrases of which they have delivered themselves to various public gatherings. It proposes a mean .and miserable method of financing an existing difficulty. It fails to grasp any of the financial problems that confront us.  In  my opinion, the Budget of this Government has yet to be delivered. I think that it will not be delivered until after the next election. The proposed temporary loan is merely a loan to tide Ministers over the next election, and then we shall get the real Budget, which will propose to place the burden of the increased expenditure, not -as the Fisher Government intended, upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it, but upon the shoulders of the poorer classes of the community, by means of duties on tea and kerosene. It would not have been politic to mention that intention in the present Budget. It would not have been healthy just before a general election to tell the people how the additional taxation is intended to be raised. Hence the proposal to issue short-dated Treasury bills. I trust that the people will not be deluded by the method which has been adopted in this Budget, but that at the next election they will take the necessary steps to prevent this Government from carrying out their concealed intention as regards the finances of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- - I also congratulate the Senate upon the opportunity given to it for the first time of taking its due part in the consideration of the many affairs which are involved in the Budget. Since it was decided a fortnight ago that we should discuss these matters, the mere question of the estimates of expenditure for 1909- ro has been completely overshadowed by the proposed agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. I propose to devote a little attention to this, which really is now the most important matter before Australia. I do not at all overlook the importance of some of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> criticisms with regard to defence and other expenditure. He found something to ridicule in the terms of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> offer, which was sent to England ; and the fact that we had not rigidly adhered to the mere name <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> suggested to his mind ai wish on our part to depart from the original offer. He must be very much, at a loss for argument to suggest anything of the sort. The only thing which can be suggested to an ordinary mind is that we left it to the British Government to decide whether the expenditure on a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> or on some other means of defence, would be best for the welfare of the Empire, which alone occupied the thoughts of Australia when the offer was made. For eight or nine years we have been federated, but up to the present time we have not had complete Federation. We have not had Federation, as required by the Constitution, with regard to trade between the States. The section in the Constitution which, above all others, is strongly worded, is that with regard to Inter-State trade, which declares that such trade shall be absolutely free. Up to the present time trade between the States has not been absolutely free. It is to-day subject to a great many handicaps, or difficulties, which all traders experience. I' am delighted that there is some prospect of the bookkeeping system and other trammels being swept away, and that we may at last begin to feel that Australia is a Federation. With regard to the agreement which has been tentatively arrived at, I see an end to the interdependence of the States and the Commonwealth with regard to the matter of finance. Year after year, for eight or nine years now, we have seen the Premiers of the States at a loss to know what amount they were likely to be credited with during any given year, and the delivery of their financial statements has been postponed until the Federal Budget has been announced. This is to be terminated, and the disassociation of Federal and State finance will most decidedly tend to the simplification of government. I notice that this agreement will secure to the States in perpetuity that which the originators of  the Federation intended that they should have - that is, a continuous payment from the Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

                        <para>- That would be the same thing. If the debts were, taken over, one payment would balance the other. Some arrangement may yet be made by which the interest may be paid, or paid so far as it can be met, out of the 25s. per head. But when the agreement is finally completed, the States will for all time secure a right to what, I think. is a fair and reasonable proportion of the income derived from Customs and Excise. To the States this is very important, because none of us can shut his eyes to the importance of the work which falls to their lot. Each State represents undeveloped country, which must, in the future, require a great deal of very generous expenditure as population increases. Therefore, I congratulate the States upon an arrangement which will insure for them something like a permanent payment out of this revenue, and which, to some extent, will enable them to forecast their expenditure and to make those plans which are essential to the development, not only of each State, but of the Commonwealth as a whole. We can also congratulate the Commonwealth upon having obtained some elasticity in its own finances, and upon the fact that when the arrangement is completed it will have ceased to rely upon a form of taxation which required it, in order to obtain a single pound, to inflict upon the people taxation to the extent of £4 That is one of the most important and satisfactory features of the whole business. Then we come to the amount of the proposed <inline font-style="italic">fer caf iia</inline> payment - 25s. per head. What are we to say of it ; is it too much or too little? In the first place, I would ask critics of this agreement to remember that during several years we have had proposals made by one Treasurer after another. Every one is aware that during the past twelve months the financial position of every part of the Empire has been affected by the necessity for providing for an expenditure on Defence such as was never before dreamed of. In Great Britain, great as was the taxation for and expenditure upon Defence in bygone years, it has been increased by a very large amount. In other parts of the Empire the necessity for increased de fence has been recognised, and it has been recognised also in Australia. The necessity for providing for adequate defence completely removes the ground on which previous proposals were made. We are told that the basis of the agreement was taken from the proceedings of a Conference of the Labour Party held at Brisbane, and that the agreement represents something similar to what was there proposed. But honorable senators will bear in mind that the necessity for increased expenditure on Defence has arisen since then, and that the Commonwealth Government, who are now proposing to give the States more than the Labour Party were willing to give them, are also taking upon their shoulders very largely increased expenditure in connexion with Defence. With regard to the future, I am inclined to think that the proposed contribution errs on the side of liberality. I very much doubt whether, when our population becomes three or four times the population now existing in Australia, it will be found convenient or easy for the Commonwealth to pay the State Governments the full sum of 25s. per head of population. But let us hope that in the course of a few years the extreme necessity for heavy expenditure upon Defence which weighs upon us to-day will have passed away, that we shall be able to devote more money to the arts of peace and less to those of war, and that it will be found not beyond the compass of our ability to carry out in perpetuity the proposed payment of 25s. per head of population. There is one view of the matter, however, in connexion with which I think it is wise that we should make a proviso. We should not overlook the possibility of some widespread trouble or some world-wide war so affecting our income that a contribution of 25s. per "head would be an impossible payment for us to make. I think that there ought to be in the agreement some proviso that in the event of certain circumstances arising in which a payment of 25s. per head of population would represent more than a certain proportion of the total, the payment to the States should be correspondingly reduced. As regards Western Australia, I think that the payment proposed to be specially made to that State is a very libera] one. The revenue which the great western State has been contributing to the Commonwealth has been falling, and there has not been that extremely great difference of Customs revenue per head of population as compared with the ' other States which formerly existed. The amount per head in Western Australia of Customs revenue is coming down pretty rapidly to the average in the other States. 1 feel sure that it will have reached about the same level in a period of considerably less than twenty-five years. But in an agreement such as this it is well in dealing with a State like Western Australia, where so much is new and there is so much developmental work to be done, that we should err, if at all, on the side of generosity. In the circumstances, I think that no objection will be raised by the representatives of the other States to the liberal treatment proposed to be given to Western Australia. Honorable senators will be aware that the agreement which has been proposed carries with it the federalization of the postal service. To-day, in Victoria, there is an internal postage rate, of one penny. Of necessity, should the agreement be completed, there must be a federalization of postal rates, because, except under the bookkeeping system, charges must be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. The question, therefore, will arise whether the Victorian internal postage rate of one penny is to be adopted by the other States, or the Victorian rate is to be increased to the twopenny rate, at present existing in the other States. If I may be allowed to express an opinion on the point, it is that Victoria would very strongly object to have her internal postage rate raised, and it would be more in consonance with the trend of postal legislation throughout the Empire that the Victorian rate should be extended to the other States. There is another point, which I raised by a question to-day, with regard to guarantees which are given by certain States. I may say that I was a little surprised and disappointed at the reply I received from the Vice-President of the Executive Council. A number of guarantees have been given in the past by certain States. For instance, in connexion with the Pacific Cable a guarantee is given by Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. This year these three States are debited in the account for the prospective expenditure of ^7,000. I certainly expected that, under this general settlement, the Commonwealth would take over. all these liabilities under guarantees. I do not think that I can accept as final the reply given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the question, that I put this afternoon. In view of the very large amount which New South </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Wales must sacrifice under the agreement, that State cannot reasonably be asked to continue to pay these guaranteed amounts: I believe that Queensland, which also pays one-third of the guarantee in connexion with the Pacific Cable, has given a guarantee in connexion with the cable to New Caledonia, and pays a few thousand pounds a year for that service. I think that Queensland has a right to expect that that liability also shall be taken over by the Commonwealth. We have already assumed responsibility for a good deal of expenditure in postal and cable matters in the case of Tasmania, and there should, under the agreement, be a complete settlement of these guarantees and special arrangements throughout Australia. I suggest for consideration that the arrangement for a per head payment must accentuate the necessity for taking a quinquennial census. Honorable senators are aware that already there is a great deal of difficulty and uncertainty with regard to the numbers of the population affecting the right of representation in the House of Representatives. This difficulty will grow in intensity when every year the question will arise as to the number of people in the different States. In the first five years, after our present census is taken, the figures will undoubtedly be open to a great deal of dispute. We shall have the Federal and State statisticians differing in their views, very often probably to the extent of thousands as to the number of persons resident in a particular State. It would be well for honorable senators to think this matter out. If they do I think they will come to the conclusion at which I have arrived, that a system of a five years census which I understand has existed in New Zealand for some time must be adopted in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that the ground of the opposition of the two newspapers differs. The Sydney newspaper objects to the agreement because the Commonwealth is getting too much ; the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> objects to it on the ground that the Commonwealth is getting too little. I have observed also that some eminent Protectionists have agreed that there is in the proposal possibilities of injury to Protection, and on the other hand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith, in a communication appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of yesterday, expressed himself very strongly in regard to it as dangerous to the possibility of a return to Free Trade conditions. I find that the agreement is opposed in various directions for conflicting reasons, but the Federal reason that it works towards union is the one which is deserving of most consideration. I would like to draw attention to the position occupied by the different States. In New South Wales a very strong feeling exists in regard to the amount which that State must sacrifice under the agreement which has been arrived at. I think, therefore, that we are warranted in looking to the Commonwealth to do everything that it possibly can to ease the burden which will fall upon New South Wales, having regard to the carrying out of the main feature of that agreement. When I say "ease" the position, I have in mind the little matter of guarantees. It would be highly unjust if a matter of that sort were left in abeyance. But I wish to direct special attention to the fact that the position is not quite so extreme as would appear from certain figures. During the past few days I have been surprised to find that New South Wales has been, paying less per head for its defence than, has any other State. If its people were debited with the cost of defence upon the basis which exists in Queensland, they would contribute considerably more than an additional £100,000 this year. </para>

                        <para>- Because the States are debited upon the basis of transferred expenditure, except in regard to new services. It will thus be seen that, to-day, they are not paying strictly on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. Many of the discrepancies which appear in their accounts are more or less capable of explanation, and with the wide differences which obtain, cannot in their very nature be of a permanent character. There are certain States which for two or three years have been enjoying a special measure of prosperity. Naturally their revenue during those years has been particularly large, and consequently an agreement to pool the Customs and Excise receipts and for the Commonwealth to return to the States a fixed <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> sum appears to hit them specially hard. It, therefore, behoves us to bear in mind that the large revenue which is now being collected in. certain States cannot be regarded as of a permanent character. From the <inline font-style="italic">Year Book</inline> of Australia, I find that between 1901 and 1907 the aggregate value of the products of the industries in New South Wales increased from £39,000,000 to £61,000,000,. an increase of something like 60 per cent., which is an enormous increase. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is a trifle premature. During the same period, the value of the product of the industries of Victoria - which has had' the longest experience of a protective policy - increased from 30.8 to 40.2 million pounds, an increase of about 30 per cent., or half the percentage of that in New South Wales. In  Queensland during the same years the increase was from 16.9 to 26.6 millions - which is equivalent to that in New South Wales. Honorable senators are aware that the two States which I have just mentioned have recently enjoyed great prosperity, and, as a result, the increase in their revenue during the past two or three years has been specially observable. In South Australia the increase in the value of the products of industry, was from 10.3 to 16. 1 millions, or 57 per cent. ; in Western Australia it advanced from 12.5 to 15.5 millions, or about 25 per cent, and in Tasmania from 5.0 to 7.6 millions, an increase, roughly, of 50 per cent. These figures, which show the relative increase of production throughout the various States, agree very completely with the increased revenue which has been collected in them. Honorable senators are aware that New South Wales and Queensland are the States which have prospered most. </para>

                        <para>- I say that, roughly speaking, the two things go together. Where prosperity, is least - as in Western Australia and Victoria - the revenue has lagged behind; but where prosperity has been most marked - as in New South Wales and Queensland - the revenue has largely increased. Thus, there exists <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> strong reason for ignoring the differences which exist between the various States. lt is evident that their prosperity must vary. We must recognise that Australia is united, and that whilst one portion of it may be most depressed to-day, in a year or two that portion may be the most prosperous. Consequently, we ought to be prepared to unite our fortunes, and to accept a uniform arrangement. There is one item in respect of which the revenue is continually fluctuating. I refer to sugar. As honorable senators are aware, the Customs duty upon this article is <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per ton, and the Excise duty ,£4 per ton. From the official figures it would almost seem that one State uses all imported sugar during one year, and all Excise sugar during the next year. As a result, there is a very marked discrepancy in the revenue which is collected under this heading year by year. Then on page 36 of the Budget papers I find a singular position revealed in regard to the Excise duty upon starch. For instance, the amount which has hitherto been collected in Victoria upon this article has ranged between ,£9,000 and £10,000 annually. But this year it is estimated at only .£500 ; whilst in New South Wales the Treasurer anticipates that he will receive ,£5,000 from this source. Out of a total estimated revenue of ,£12,000 from starch during the current year, it is expected that Victoria will contribute only £500. In other words, New South Wales will pay ten times as much as will this State. That circumstance in itself indicates the necessity for guarding against drawing too hasty conclusions from mere figures. Upon page 42 of the Budget papers will be found some interesting statistics in regard to the receipts per head of our population. I may, perhaps, be pardoned for quoting some of these for the purpose of illustrating the changes which take place. In 1904-5 the Customs and Excise contribution per head of New South Wales was is. rod. under the Australian average, in the following year it was 8£d. under, the next year it was Jd. over, the fourth year it was 2s. 0¾d. over, and last year it was 2s. 10¼d. over. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In 1904-5 the contribution of New South Wales to Customs and Excise revenue was just 6d. per head more than that of Victoria. In the next year it rose fo is. 8Jd. more; in the third year to 2s. 8d. ; in the fourth' year to 6s. ojd. ; and last year to 8s. 6fd. That is a very remarkable* thing, and it shows, as I have said, that the prosperity of an individual State is shown in its revenue returns', and that we ought not, therefore, to say that we have contributed so much revenue, and, that, therefore, we want so much in the future. We ought to recognise that one State in one year must of necessity be more prosperous than another; and that a State which, today, is the most prosperous in Australia may at some future time be much less prosperous. </para>

                        <para>- In the course of time matters will average themselves. On page in of the Budget papers honorable senators will find that during the year 1904-5 the proportion of the population of the whole Commonwealth living in New South Wales was 36.57. Last year the proportion rose to 37.23 - an increase of 0.66. On referring to the receipts from Customs and Excise, I find that in 1904 5 the proportion paid in New South Wales, out of the entire Commonwealth revenue, from this source was 35.4 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> whilst last year the proportion was 39.32- an increase of 4.28 j which is between five and six times the increase in the proportion of population. As every 1 per cent, represents about £150,000 honorable senators will see that, as the increase of population was only about one-fifth or one-sixth in proportion, New South Wales was paid an extraordinary amount in excess last year. A representative of New South Wales 'may honestly point this out, and say that we want nothing except what is fair and right ; and on behalf of the Mother State I am prepared to accept those figures as representing a special state of prosperity which does not warrant us in asking from the Commonwealth a return much above that which is given to the average of the other States - or, in fact, anything above that average at all. I may also point out that during the six years since Federation the State of Queensland has not received the whole of her three-fourths Customs and Excise revenue. During several years Queensland was paid an aggregate of, I think, ,£158,000 short of her three-fourths. In. two or three years she received,  1  believe, something over the three-fourths ; but she has been out of pocket on the whole to the extent of something like £100,000. For a State like Queensland, which has certainly gone through some bad times, this was rather a galling position. That, again, is another reason why I think we should be prepared to feel that we are all sinking or swimming in the one boat, and should be content to accept an agreement which is on one basis, which is fair and reasonable, and which covers all sorts of variations of payments. It also, I may point out, covers not only variations in Customs and Excise receipts, but also variations in the methods of bookkeeping; because balances are brought forward from year to year which disturb the accounts. </para>

                <para class="block">Therefore, for my part, I am prepared to recommend to New South Wales the adoption of this agreement, and believe that it is in the interests of Australia that it. should be accepted. There is one other point to which I may refer, and that is the effect of our Tariff. We have in operation a protective Tariff which is antagonistic to the interests of the smaller States, and which promotes the interests of the larger States. As we have allowed this policy - I think a regrettable policy - to become the law in Australia, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that it strengthens the profits of the manufacturing industries in the two larger States of Victoria and New South Wales, whilst it lessens the output of the manufacturing industries in the smaller States. This fact is another reason for expecting the larger States to meet the smaller ones in a generous spirit. </para>

                    <para>- - I desire to accord credit to the Government for affording the Senate an opportunity of discussing the Budget at this stage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> laid emphasis, from his point of view, on the proposal of the Treasurer to issue Treasury bills to the extent of ,£1,200,000. I am one of those benighted individuals who consider that the finances of the Commonwealth have been largely disturbed by debiting to current revenue the cost of permanent works. I consider that if we had a proper system of financing, we should make provision for permanent works out of loan money, and should pay the interest and contribute annually to a sinking fund out of revenue. In Great Britain, there are occasionally issued what are called Exchequer bills, which are not looked upon as funded stock, but ar.e temporary loans, to be paid out of revenue in the future. After the 1st July next, if the agreement made by the Government with the State Premiers is ratified - as I hope that it will be - the Commonwealth will have a much larger income. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I may do so. I am in hopes that we shall be able to redeem the suggested Treasury bills out of surplus income during the next three or four years. To start with, in all probability the Treasurer will not need to issue Treasury bills for so large an amount as £1,200,000. If the States carry out the intention of foregoing revenue to the extent of £600,000 for the purposes of old-age  pensions, that will reduce the ^1,200,000 by one-half. I trust that the Government will have the courage, during the next session, to bring forward a policy with regard to public works. Permanent public works, I say again, ought to be paid for cut of loans, and the interest thereon, together with a contribution towards a sinking fund, should be paid annually. Why should we, the present generation, have to pay for works that will, we hope, be permanent, and will be to the advantage of future generations, in whose time there will be a larger population to pay for them? </para>

                        <para>- Exactly so. With regard to the Defence Forces, I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made a very good point in his reference to horses for the field artillery. I like his idea very much, and trust that it will be carried out by the present Minister of Defence. I do not see why the Commonwealth should not train horses for artillery purposes, and let out those which are not required to persons who can use them. No doubt such a scheme would cost money at the outset, but 1 quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that efficiency is of the first importance in the matter of defence. The defence question is not a party matter. We must try and avoid making a party issue of it. I have said in the Senate before, and I say it again, that my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> was a very good Minister of Defence. I have never heard any one dispute that statement. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to mention that, at the Convention of 1897-8, the representatives of Tasmania advocated from the start a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> division. They argued that, inasmuch as the expenditure would be apportioned on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, income should be treated in the same way. When the ten-years' system of distribution was introduced, it was also hoped that at the end of the period we should be able to institute a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> division of Customs and Excise revenue. I myself - though I say it - must take some share of the blame, if there be any blame, for having, I believe, instituted the bookkeeping system. It seemed to me unfair that Western Australia should contribute about <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 10s. per head whilst Tasmania contributed about 30s. per head. It was in consequence of such disparities that the bookkeeping system was adopted. There was an obligation to treat Western Australia exceptionally, with regard to her Tariff, for a term of years, though it must also be remembered that her special Tariff was reduced by proportional amounts during five years. That would account to some extent for the discrepancy between one year's receipts and the others. I am sorry that in the Conference no allusion was made to the consolidation of the State debts. .1 have always thought it very desirable that they should be consolidated. We have made a mistake in postponing the settlement of that question for so long a period. I should have liked to see that  transaction  completed, and the Federal Government paying the interest on the debts out of the States' proportion of Customs and Excise revenue, supplemented, if need be, by further State contributions. I hope that the Government will instruct some person in their employ to look into the expenditure on public works from the start of the Commonwealth, to distinguish between works of an ephemeral character, and works of a permanent character, and to see how much has been paid out of income which might legitimately have been  defra\ed,  out of loan.

                        <para>- Well, how do my honorable friends propose to take over the debt of South Australia in respect of the Northern Territory ? Will not that be done by means of a loan ? I have often heard that my honorable friends on the other side do not believe in loans. We have authorized the payment of many bounties for a great many years. When those terms have expired, surely the amount now paid in that direction will cease, and that will be another item to improve the revenue. I, for one, think that the last Conference has justified itself, and justified the Government in asking each House to adjourn for a few days. The Senate adjourned for only three days, and the other House for five days. I am very pleased with the result of the Conference, although, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> remarks, in New South Wales we have friends who think that that State, as usual, is to carry the baby. Apparently, she is better able to do it than some States are. I am glad to notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen,</inline> the Leader of the Labour party in New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> its sub-leader, have praised the agreement, and seem to think that it is a capital settlement of the difficulty. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to say very much about the agreement entered into, in secret caucus, between the State Premiers and the Commonwealth Government. That will come before us in the shape of a Bill, and we shall then- have an opportunity of passing a few remarks on the suspicious circumstances which surrounded that conspiracy against the solvency of the Commonwealth. The representatives of the Commonwealth Government, and the representatives of the1 States, met in a Guy Fawkes fashion - in the dark. No record of their speeches was made, and we are told that even the blotting-pads were burnt every night from the fear that some evidence of the exact method by which the final arrangement was come to would be discovered and published. Con: duct of that kind was not creditable to men charged with a high and responsible duty, referring to the most important matters connected with the welfare of the Commonwealth. The people of Australia have never been accustomed to their affairs being settled by a secret assembly. All their business is done in a fair, open, and above board fashion. Their courts of justice, their municipal councils, their shire councils, their State Parliaments, and their Federal Parliament are open to the public, and it is only when we have a Parliament within a Parliament that everything is shrouded in silence and conducted in secrecy. I have no doubt that, on a future occasion, honorable senators will have a good deal to say on that point. In the meantime, I wish to address myself to the Budget as it is -before us. I do not know whether  II  shall be in order in referring to certain utterances made in another place - I suppose I shall not - but perhaps I shall not be transgressing if I say that this Budget does not bear upon its face any evidence of having been framed by one expert in such matters. Seeing that the </para>

                <para class="block">Treasurer boasted of having introduced no less than fourteen or fifteen Budgets, one would expect something approaching the finished article at the hands of a man of so much experience. It appears to me that this is the most impotent Budget which has ever been presented to this Parliament. It does not give us even the right figures. I do not know what has been wrong with the Department. The deficit is stated at £1,200,000, whereas, in fact, it approaches £1,800,000. To put the position shortly, the estimated revenue for the current year is £14,555,765, and the estimated expenditure is £15,702,649. But honorable senators will observe that only a sum of £850,000 is included for old-age pensions, whereas, as we know, it will take, at the lowest estimate, £1,500,000 to cover that item, so that the estimated expenditure is at least £600,000 below the amount actually required. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am taking the year's expenditure, and instead of being as stated in the Budget papers £15,702,000, it will be £16,352,000, leaving a deficit of £1,797,000 on the year's transactions, as against the deficit stated in the Budget papers of £1,146,000. How is that deficit to be provided for? It is proposed that it shall be provided for partly by drawing upon a trust fund established by the last Deakin Government at the instance of the Labour party, and amounting to £655,799, and partly by the issue of Treasury bills to the amount of £1,200,000. The Government are proposing to defray the current expenditure of the year partly out of hoarded revenue, so to speak, and partly out of money that is to be borrowed. I would point out in passing that, but for the strenuous efforts made by the Labour party in connexion with the passing of the Surplus Revenue Bill, to which my honorable friends opposite, who are now supporting the Government, were most virulently opposed, the Government would be in a very much worse position than they are to-day, or we should have had no old-age pensions scheme established. </para>

                        <para>- If I remember rightly many honorable senators who are now supporting the Government were bitterly opposed to the Surplus Revenue Bill. They said it was unconstitutional, and proposed a robbing of the States. Some characterized it as " Rob Roy ' ' finance ; a putting of our hands into the State Treasuries and filching from them revenue rightly belonging to the States. Every condemnatory adjective in the dictionary was hurled at that Bill by honorable senators opposite when it was being passed in the Senate. I have here the division which took place on the second reading of the Bill on the 3rd June, 1908. </para>

                        <para>- The probability is that Senators Walker, Cameron, and Gray were paired against the Bill, but pairs are not recorded in the Senate journals. It is, however, a matter of fact that the passing of that Bill was bitterly opposed by honorable senators opposite who then sat on this side of the chamber. I say that but for the passing of that measure we should have had no old-age pensions scheme, or the deficit now shown would be very much reduced. If I have to choose I do not say that I would choose to have a deficit, but I have always been a believer in old-age pensions, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and his colleagues had been sufficiently broadminded to give the Labour Government a chance to show their capacity, we should have had a proposal for financing the deficit very different from that which is  now  placed before us. But honorable senators opposite would not give the Labour party a chance. They cut off our heads before we had an opportunity to put our policy into operation. It is very strange that at one time, and that not very long ago, the honorable gentleman at the head of the present Government had an idea of carrying out exactly the same financial policy as that which has been put forward by the Labour party.

                <para class="block">That is what the honorable gentleman said at Toowoomba before he became contaminated by association with honorable senators opposite. No sooner did he find himself dependent for his political life upon Cook and Company than he immediately turned right round so far as his financial policy was concerned. It may be taken as an axiom of government that such an obligation as old-age pensions ought not, in  any  circumstances, to be defrayed out of borrowed money. But the present Government propose to pay. old-age pensions in that way. That is a confession either of national poverty, national impotence, or of mental barrenness on the part of the Government. Is Australia so poor that she cannot afford to pay pensions to her old people without going to the pawnshop, and pledging her credit ? It is one of the most serious charges that could be brought against any country to say that it cannot  pay  current expenses, or cannot maintain its aged poor without borrowing. </para>

                        <para>- An overdraft  is  not always a sign of poverty. It may  be  a sign that there are some assets -to meet the overdraft; or,  as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has suggested, some future to  be  drawn upon. But very few people incur overdrafts  in  order to give money in charity, or to pay deferred wages. A man who found it necessary to borrow for any such purpose would probably be considered not particularly solvent. However a private individual in such a position might be regarded, I say that there is absolutely no necessity for the Commonwealth to borrow money to pay old-age pensions. There are vast sources of taxation which have never been touched yet, by either the Commonwealth or the State Governments. </para>

                        <para>- I interpret it in that way because that is exactly what the honorable senator intended his words to convey. The honorable senator says : " Here is a member of the Labour party proposing more taxation." I say, and it must be evident to every one, that the affairs of this country could not be carried on without taxation. I do not propose to increase taxation in the aggregate, but to change the incidence of existing taxation, and that is exactly what honorable senators opposite, who are continually interjecting, are afraid of. At the present moment, the burden of taxation is upon the working classes in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the rich, but if the rich do not get their pensions directly from the Treasury, they get a very much larger dole than 10s. per week indirectly out of the Treasury. Since the honorable gentleman has asked me that question, I would direct his attention to one or two facts. It is calculated that £2,000,000 per annum will be required to defray the cost of our old-age pensions scheme. Honorable senators opposite will say that that is a very large sum  - that it represents a dreadful waste, and that it will only encourage thriftlessness and provide a post against which loafers may lean. But has it ever occurred to them! that a gift ten times as large is being made every year to the private land-owners of Australia ? I estimate the sum annually passing into their pockets, and which ought to be going into the Treasury, at £20,000,000, or ten times the amount which it is proposed to pay to old-age pensioners. ,£20,000,000 annually is practically being paid to the owners of land as the result of community-created values. Honorable senators opposite look astonished. Here is something, apparently, which they have not discovered. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> says that he has not the imagination necessary to qualify him' to grasp the position. But I would point out that he has not a grasp of the facts. That is what is wrong with him. If honorable senators opposite are open to conversion- - I will not say. to conviction - I will give them a few figures which will probably have the effect of opening their eyes. We have in Australia today a debt of ,£250,000,000. A very large proportion of that sum has been expended in what may be called the development of Australian resources - in the building of railways, post and telegraph offices, bridges and roads, in effecting harbor and river improvements, and in a hundred and one other ways, every one of which has had the effect of making land more and more valuable. I think that I am well within the mark when I say that the expenditure of that ,£250,000,000 has resulted in an added value throughout the Continent of something like ^£300,000,000 or ^400,000,000. In some .cases, the expenditure of £1,000,000  has resulted in an added value of ,£10,000,000 - in others, the increment has not been so large. But I am quite within the mark when I claim that the expenditure of that ,£250,000,000 has increased the land values of the Commonwealth by at least .£400,000,000. </para>

By whom has that value been created ? By the community. By the expenditure of borrowed money, for which the community is  wholly  responsible. Every farthing pf that ,£20,000,000 per annum is now being pocketed by private individuals when it should be passing into the public Treasury. </para>

                            knows that this is the first occasion upon which old-age pensions have had to be provided. Up to date we have built all our works out of revenue. It is only a subterfuge on his part to say that the proposed borrowing is for the purpose of enabling us to undertake the construction of public works. It is for nothing of the kind. Since the inauguration of the Commonwealth we have never borrowed a single farthing for the carrying out of public works. Indeed, upon one occasion -
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline>
                            remembers the occasion just as well as I do - this Parliament put its foot down in a very decisive fashion upon the idea of borrowing, when it was mooted By a previous Treasurer. It has been the settled policy of this Parliament to construct its works cut of revenue, and, therefore,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline>
                            claim that the proposed loan is for reproductive works goes by the board. The deficit has been caused by the added expenditure of the year; by the new item of old-age pensions, £1,500,000, £650,000 of which is to be drawn out of the surplus revenue fund. The whole deficit, if it can be called a deficit, has been caused by the passing of the Old-age Pensions Act. The Labour party foresaw, as clearly as it was possible to do, that the new engagements for old-age pensions, defence, and post and telegraph extensions, would mean a very much larger expenditure than had hitherto been necessary, But they proposed to meet that expenditure in quite a different fashion from the present Government. They proposed to tax wealth, not poverty. They proposed to get, as I have said, at some proportion of that £20,000,000 per annum which is now pouring, a rich golden flood, into the pockets of the bloated land monopolists and financial institutions throughout Australia, which are so largely interested in the wealth of this empty Commonwealth.

                        <para>- I have pointed out that hitherto we have built all our new works out of revenue, and that it is only when we are dealing with an old-age pension scheme it is proposed that we should begin to borrow. I say that it is degrading to borrow for such a purpose. It is a confession of weakness, impotence, national poverty, and governmental barrenness. What kind of advertisement will this be to Australia when it is published in the newspapers of Great Britain, America, and the Continent of Europe- when it is said that the people of this country have inaugurated an old-age pension scheme, but that they are going to their " uncle " for the money, and are passing the burden on to posterity ? These people will say, "It is ridiculous; it is being charitable at some one else's expense." </para>

                        <para>- I prefer to adopt the honorable senator's word. We are being just and humane at the expense of posterity. The little children who are running about our feet to-day, going to school - they will have to pay the bill. We do not care. The daisies will be growing above us when the promissory notes will have to be met. We shall be in some other country, quite indifferent to the consequences of our present misdoing. From the point of view of honorable senators who desire that Australia shall receive a large accession of population in the near future, we ought to tax ourselves for this purpose. We ought to pay these pensions out of revenue. Otherwise we should abandon the whole scheme. We should wipe it off the statute-book. It is an absolute disgrace to a young country like Australia that it should go to "uncle" to pay its old people the pensions which we consider they ought to receive. Because this is a wealthy country. If it were not, how could it bear this bloodsucking to the tune of ,£20,000,000 per annum which is going on year by year ? Any other country would be bled white under such an operation. Yet Australia remains healthy and happy, for the reason that she is young and strong and has great recuperative powers. But the poor people of this country do not take the matter quite so lightly as honorable senators do. They have to find between ^10,000,000 and ,£11,000,000 sterling per annum from Customs and Excise. This means a very great burden indeed to a man with a family. It means, roughly, about ,£2 10s. per head per annum. </para>

                        <para>- I was complaining of the revenue duties, not of the protective duties. The honorable senator ought really to study the science of fiscalism. He should grasp the difference between revenue tariffism and Protection. If he will turn to the pages of those much-despised volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and read over the debates while the Tariff was under consideration, he may be able to arrive at a very clear under standing of the difference between the two policies. The difference between a revenue duty and a protective duty is this : Protective duties create industries in Australia. They keep out imported goods, and encourage the production of those goods within our own country. They give employment to our own people ; add to the wealth of Australia; assist in the development of our national resources, and give our young people an opportunity of becoming accustomed to the practice of the arts and science which flourish in the older lands. A. revenue Tariff, on the contrary, drags money out of the pockets of the poor, without creating a single industry. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator never tried to point that out to me. I did not give a single vote for a revenue duty while the Tariff was under discussion, so far as I can remember. If I did, it was inadvertently, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> can point out to me a duty for which I voted that has not a protective incidence, I shall be extremely glad to reverse my vote on that item when I get an opportunity. But the honorable senator voted constantly for revenue duties, except on steel rails. He believed in high duties in that case, because New South Wales was particularly affected. The honorable senator is a revenue-tariffist.  His  policy means taxing the poor and allowing the rich to escape. </para>

                        <para>- They pay very little in proportion to income as compared with the poor. The honorable senator can work out the sum for himself. A working man, with a wife and a family of four "children, pays ,£15 per annum in Customs taxation. Say that his income is <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> a week. That means that his income for seven and a half weeks per annum goes to pay his share of taxation. Take a pei  son with an income of ,£1,000 per annum. Assuming that he has a family of the same size, his contribution towards Customs and Excise would probably be very little higher. Say that it amounted to 10s. per head per annum higher. That is to say, his family would pay <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> per head instead of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. Consequently his contribution to the Customs and Excise revenue would be .£18 per annum. But suppose that he pays ,£20 per annum, as compared with the .£15 paid bv the man with an income of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per \veek. In that case his income for one week would cover his expenditure in this direction. Do honorable senators opposite claim that that is equality of taxation ? If a man with an income of .£1,000 per annum paid in the same proportion as the  poor beggar with only ,£2 a week, instead of contributing ,£20 he would pay £150. That is the kind of taxation that I should like to see imposed. It would not do much harm to the man with an income of ,£1,000 a year if he had to pay .£150 in taxation. It would not seriously interfere with his household arrangements. He would be able to get three square meals per day out of ,£850 per annum. Probably he would also be able to get a little bit of supper occasionally, and be able to take his wife and family to the theatre. Not a single necessary of life would be beyond his reach, and he would be able to purchase some luxuries. But think of the other man, with his .£104 per annum. Take ,£15 a year from that, and what does it mean ? It means that you are taxing the bread of his children. It means that you are levying tribute on their requirements. It means that you are cutting right into their every-day life, and snatching from them many necessaries. That is the difference between our system of taxation as it affects the rich and the poor, and the system favoured by honorable senators opposite. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the other side. Each man, woman, and child in this country pays on an average £2 10s. per annum in Customs and Excise taxation ; and the! Customs revenue, as we know, is contributed to most largely by the poorest of our people. The poorer a man is, and the larger his  family  the more he has to pay in proportion to his income. We need a large population, and yet the only way we have adopted of encouraging the poor fellow with the large family has been to tax and tax him. Every child he adds to the strength' of the community means more taxation heaped upon the wretched man's shoulders. The system is absolutely rotten from beginning to end. The Labour party wants to alter all this. It wishes to change the incidence of taxation, to place some portion of the burden on the strong shoulders of the rich. Those who are able to carry something on their backs should be compelled to do so. And the over-burdened men who are staggering under the great weight they have to carry should be relieved. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will not take even this small dose. If I could get him to swallow it, there might not be so much difficulty im inducing him to take more by-and-by. I suppose that he knows something about the operation of that instrument called the wedge. When a man wants to split a tree he inserts the thin edge of the wedge. He does not try to put in the head, and hammer away at the point ; but he puts in the point and hammers away at the head. The Labour party is trying to get the point to enter. So far, it has not entered in Commonwealth politics, but I believe that it will enter before very long, and it will enter very much more freely in State politics in the future than it has done in the past. The more it enters, and the more effectively, it does its work, the better it will be 'for this country and every one therein. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and why should I not say it? I believe that "an exemption of £5,000 is only a beginning. I expect that within twenty years it will not be  ,£5,000,  or  .£500  either, but something less than either of those sums. That is the method by which the Labour party proposes to find the money for old-age pensions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> talked about the State debts, and how the Commonwealth could borrow at a much cheaper rate than the States. Suppose that at the present moment the Commonwealth tried to float a loan on the London market, and that Cohen and Company discovered - as they very soon would do, because they know every move on the board here better than we 'do - that we proposed to issue Treasury bills to pay old-age pensions. What would they say? They would say: "These beggars cannot pay their old-age pensions without borrowing. Yet they came to us, telling us how good their security is, and demanding a low rate of interest, and all that." I believe it would mean a \ per cent, on any loan floated on the London market at the present moment if Australia unfortunately were compelled to have recourse to that sort ot thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> seems to think that borrowing is good business. It is very good business for the banker. We know that banks could not live unless people borrowed money from them. The honorable senator deposits ,£  1,000  at  2  per cent, for a year, and probably  3  per cent, for a term of two years. Wanting a loan I go to the bank, produce my security, and ask for an overdraft. I get his  £1,000,  but for the accommodation I have to pay interest at the rate of  7  or  8  per cent. That is how bankers make their living, and the honorable senator, with his recollection of forty years' banking experience, cannot get away from the idea that borrowing means progress and prosperity. I agree with the honorable gentleman up to a certain point. If a man cannot get on without borrowing, and can obtain a loan, he would be a fool if he did not borrow. But the position I take up is that every year we are allowing a waste more than enough to do everything we want, to accomplish every national end that we have in view, and until that leakage has been stopped we- are not justified in going on to the money market. The honorable senator asked : " How could we build a transcontinental railway without borrowing?" </para>

                        <para>- That is very much worse than borrowing. I am against the land grant system, but if it were found necessary to borrow for the purpose of building a railway across the continent to Western Australia I should not stand in the way. Australia has borrowed £250,000,000, and no country under the sun, so far as I know, can show such splendid assets for borrowed money as can Australia. If that money had not been borrowed Australia would still, to all intents and purposes, be a desert, or be inhabited by only a few sheep and cattle men. </para>

                        <para>- No. In the early stages of Australia's history, when she had no resources to fall back upon, when she was young and had nothing, so to speak, but her own strong right arm and broad fair fields to work upon, then it was absolutely necessary, if anything was to be done, that she should borrow from the older countries of the world. But now, When she has enormous resources to draw upon, why should she borrow ? When she has these huge community -created values amounting to ,£400,000,000, lying in the banks, so to speak, and producing an annual revenue of ,£20,000,000, which is going into the pockets of some one, to draw  upon, why should she borrow ? I know that this will not appeal to honorable senators opposite. They will not allow the Commonwealth to touch a single farthing of this £[20,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- Then I do not know what to say to the honorable senator. I do not know what he can have been thinking about. I understand that he has written, a book upon Socialism, and let me say that I think he is deserving of severe reprobation, and that perhaps a vote of censure upon him should be passed for having published a book without placing a copy of it in the hands of each of his colleagues in the Senate. If the honorable senator's book, which I shall some day, I hope, peruse with pleasure, does not display a better acquaintance with the economic facts of Australia than is indicated by the honorable senator's interjection, I am afraid that any profit I shall be likely to derive from the reading of it will be very slight indeed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is very fond of talking, about the transferred properties, and asks how we are to pay for them without floating a loan ? We do not need to float a loan to pay for them. We can take over from the States the responsibility for loans equivalent in value. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that the Federation would be liable for the redemption of the loans taken over, and for the annual interest upon them, but I do not see any other way in which the transferred properties can be paid for. I should be quite prepared to take over £10,000,000 in the aggregate - so much from each of the States in accordance with the value of the property transferred - and become responsible for the principal, and the payment of the annual interest. In addition to that, I would advocate the establishment of a sinking fund. I am glad to find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is also in favour of that, and that he and I are agreed at least on one point in connexion with these matters. That disposes of the transferred properties. Then there is the Federal Capital to be provided for, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> says that we must borrow for that; I am not very sure that we must. If we could get a fair slice of the £20,000,000 I have referred to we could establish the Federal Capital without incurring a very large debt, and more especially if we went to Dalgety. Of course, if we are to go to Yass-Canberra heaven only knows how much we shall have to borrow. If we go to Yass-Canberra, I believe it will take millions and millions to establish a Capital there, and we must borrow for the purpose. That is one .reason why I am opposed to the selection of that particular locality for the establishment of the Federal Capital. If ve went to the rich and fertile district of Dalgety, it would not be necessary to borrow to establish the Capital. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to borrowing if the country is unable to obtain the money required in any' other way, but, believing as I do that there is a sum of £20,000,000, a part of which might annually be garnered into the public Treasury by any Government having the honesty and courage to tackle the problem, I am disposed to vigorously oppose any attempt to launch the Commonwealth on a borrowing policy. Whilst there is such a leakage of public revenue, it would be criminal to load the Commonwealth with a burden of debt. That,. stated very shortly, is my attitude towards a borrowing policy. So long as this vast area of unexplored taxation exists I shall not favour such a policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> asked whether it would not be necessary to borrow if we took over the Northern Territory. The Government have not shown any very great alacrity in the matter of the transfer of the Territory. I remember only a short time ago listening to the head of the Government while he eloquently addressed a very large public gathering in Melbourne. The honorable gentleman's text on that occasion was " The Empty North." He rolled the phrase over his tongue as a sweet morsel. It seemed to me to be a companion phrase to " the empty cradle," and certainly the honorable gentleman rocked it for all it was worth. He had a map of Australia behind him. and a long wand with which he pointed to the very small corner of the continent that is populated. He appealed to his audience for the filling up of the "empty north," and the audience cheered him as one man.  While he was speaking they saw millions and millions of people populating that Territory. I must say that I had my thoughts during the honorable gentleman's speech, and they were of the empty south. I thought that it would have been more statesmanlike if the honorable gentleman, who represents a district of Victoria, tried to populate this portion of Australia before attempting to plant millions of people away in the remote district he indicated. I was afraid, at the time, that the honorable gentleman really intended to carry out his policy, but' that was because I had, for the moment, forgotten his chief characteristic. I might have known that there was nothing in it - that his speech was only so much frothy verbiage and humbugging pretence. It was something with which to tickle the ears of the groundlings, and to excite the admiring applause of the multitude. Now that the honorable gentleman is on the box seat again, the "empty north" is, apparently, to remain empty." It will be getting emptier and emptier, like the heads of the Fusion Government. They are unable to develop a policy which will commend itself to any ordinary business intelligence. Their policy is to borrow - to pledge posterity. We are not able, they say, to meet the engagements of the hour, and we can do nothing unless we resort to Cohen for a loan. We cannot populate the " empty north," they say, unless we do something of that kind. I may tell the Senate frankly that I am not particularly troubled about the ' ' empty north." What is vexing my spirit more than anything else is the empty south, the empty east, and the empty west. I should like to see those empty spaces filled before we begin to talk about filling the empty north. I am thinking of Victoria, with its huge areas of unoccupied country. I am thinking of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> proposal in connexion with dry farming. I honour the honorable senator for the work that he has done in that connexion, because I believe that that system of agriculture contains within itself great possibilities for Australia. The man who advocates that system of cultivation, and acquaints the people of Australia, with its methods and results, does a great deal better service to the Commonwealth than do the heads of the Fusion Government. I wish to see the south, the east, and the west populated, and when that is brought about I have not the slightest doubt that the empty north will be able to take care of itself. But it is not my policy, but the policy of the Deakin Government, that Parliament is concerned with, and that Government has pledged itself to fill up the empty north. Is there any sign of it in- the Estimates? What do the Government propose to do? I do not address myself to the Government bench, because it is empty, and even if it were occupied I should not look there, because I know that when I look to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and the two or three honorable senators who surround him, I am looking to the masters of the Government - to the men who hold the fate of the Government in the hollow of their hands. I look to them for inspiration and guidance, and not to the Government. The Government is a mere driven mule, compelled to go in whichever direction its drivers choose to guide it. Its drivers are to be seen seated round <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker.</inline> I should like to ask Senators Walker, Macfarlane, and Gray, the trinity who hold the fate of the Government in their hands, whether they are in favour of peopling the " empty north " ? If they are, will they say what there is in this Budget to show that the Government are in earnest in this matter? </para>

I have been talking to him for the past eight years, but I am sorry to say that I have made very little impression on him, for the reason that he is past redemption. The policy of the Government is to take over the Northern Territory from South Australia, to become responsible for any debt which that State may have incurred in administering its affairs, and to construct a railway through the centre of the continent. But has any sum been placed on the Estimates in that connexion? If so, it is an infinitesimal amount. Evidently the Government are not in earnest in this matter. They do not intend to do anything with the Territory, except hold it up as a kind of carrot before the eyes of the multitude. I am of opinion that the Northern Territory ought to be taken over by the Commonwealth. The Federation should have control of it. If the Government are serious in this matter; I will support their proposal to take it over. </para>

As a member of this Parliament I refuse to be bound by any conditions in regard to its future development. If South Australia hands over the Territory, with its liability, to us, that State has no right whatever to impose conditions as to its future development. South Australia has bungled her administration of the Northern Territory. She is in the position of a man who has made a mess of his business, who is practically bankrupt, and who yet has the temerity to say to another individual, " If you will take over my business and become liable for my debts, you are welcome to do so, but only on condition that I have a controlling voice in its Future management." That seems to me a most curious position to 'fake up. For a man who has muddled his business to presume to lay down conditions which shall bind the individual who comes to his rescue- </para>

That State got rid of the kanakas- in the interests of Australia, and no persons were more anxious to get rid of their, than were the Queenslanders. If the Northern Territory be taken over by the Commonwealth it will be taken over in the interests of Australia. If we shoulder its debt, surely that should  be quite enough without South Australia being permitted to lay down the future policy of the Commonwealth. Surely that State has sufficient confidence in the Commonwealth to leave the future development of the Territory in our hands. If it has not, there is not much brotherly love between South Australia and the Commonwealth. </para>

I am so sensible of the necessity for the Commonwealth securing the Territory that if South Australia is not reasonable in this matter I think that the Imperial Government should be approached with a request that the control of the Territory should be taken out of the hands of that State and handed over to the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> had something to say about the Federal Capital site. I have been wondering why it is that more vigour has not been imported into the settlement of this great national question. It is a question which cannot be regarded as other than of the first importance. Why, then, do we find the Ministry so lacking in interest in regard to it? Surely there is no division in the Cabinet upon it ! The honorable gentlemen who hold the fate of the Government in their hands are chiefly representatives of New South Wales, and if they do not bring the whip to bear upon the steed in the shaft that State should certainly take them to task for not compelling the Ministry to take speedy and effective action. This Parliament has been blamed for the delay which has occurred in the settlement of this question. I maintain that no blame can properly be laid at our doors. Upon two occasions this Parliament has actually chosen a site. Upon the first occasion I approved of the site ; upon the second, I did not. But the fact remains that upon two occasions this Parliament selected a site for the Federal </para>

What was our experience in connexion with the first site which was chosen by Parliament? The New . South Wales Government objected to the locality, to the area and to everything in connexion with it, although it had itself offered that very district as a site to the Commonwealth'. As a result nothing was done. The New South Wales Government placed every possible obstruction in the way of a settlement being arrived  at, until' ultimately, after a great deal of wire-pulling, intriguing, thimble-rigging, and not too creditable conduct on the part of certain individuals, another site was chosen. Now fresh difficulties have made their appearance. </para>

                        <para>- My own opinion is that the New South Wales Government object to granting the Commonwealth a territory embracing an area of  900  square miles. Possibly they are of opinion that if they decline to grant that area this Parliament will throw out the Yass-Canberra site just as it threw out the Dalgety site, and thus hang up the question indefinitely.' Personally, I would like to see this question settled, although I confess that I am in no great hurry to leave Melbourne. I am by no means enamoured of this city, but I recognise that it is better to live here than in the wilderness of Yass-Canberra. If the New South Wales Government are not particularly anxious that this Parliament should sit within its borders, and that the terms of the Constitution should be honoured, I shall not trouble myself. But I am surprised that the Government who are largely  supported by New South Wales representatives, both in this Chamber and in another place, are not proceeding more energetically to establish the Federal Capital. The fixing of the area and the choice of the site might very well be submitted to the people. Apparently, the New South Wales Government cannot be brought to terms. The Commonwealth insists upon an area which the New South Wales Government consider too large. Meanwhile, the question is apparently hung, like Mahomet's coffin, between heaven and earth. No settlement is arrived at. At the next Federal election we should ascertain, by a referendum, the opinion of the people as to whether the area should be  900  square miles, and whether the site should be Dalgety or Yass-Canberra. If that were done I believe that the people of the Commonwealth, by a large majority, would indorse the choice of Dalgety, and declare that  900  square miles was not too large an area. I do not say that a referendum would settle the matter finally, because the New South Wales Government seem to be so cantankerous in disposition that it is really difficult to know what would please them. I have not the slightest idea, and I do not think that the senators from New South Wales themselves know. But it would be worth while to find out the opinion of the people of this continent on the Capital Site question. I should like to say a few words with regard to the settlement which has been arrived at between the Commonwealth Government and the Premiers of the States. I consider that that settlement is infinitely worse for the people of Australia than the Braddon section of the Constitution was. Under that section, the Commonwealth Parliament had complete liberty as to methods of taxation. If it raised £10,000,000 from Customs and Excise, £7,500,000 had to be paid to the States. If it raised ^£5,000,000, three-fourths of that sum had to be paid to the States. If it did not raise a single farthing from Customs and  Excise, I suppose that three-fourths of nothing had to be paid to the States ; and perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will be able to calculate how much that would be ! </para>

Under this proposed arrangement, the Commonwealth Parliament is bound to raise 25s. per head per annum from Customs and Excise.' That is to say, the Protectionist policy which Australia has adopted will always be subject to' this drawback, that we shall be compelled to raise 25s. from Customs and Excise, and to pay that sum to the States, before a single farthing is available for Commonwealth purposes. </para>

May I venture to put this proposition before him? The better the Tariff protects the lower the revenue obtained- Is not that how a protective Tariff operates? Take the Tariff of Germany, which is one of the most completely protective in the world. . It yields only 15s. per head per annum. In the </para>

                <para class="block">United States, another highly Protectionist country, the Tariff yields between 25s. and 26s. per head per annum. In Canada, a Confederation which in some of its aspects is very similar to our own, the yield of the Tariff is about 38s. per head per annum. I have said on several occasions that ultimately, if we maintain our policy of Protection, the Tariff will yield only as much per head as the Tariff of the United States. We are entitled to assume that, instead of getting more revenue from Customs and Excise, we shall get less and less as the years go on. Within a very limited period we shall be drawing only the bare amount which the Government are engaging to hand over to the States. </para>

I can assure the Senate that, whatever voice I might have in Labour councils would have been exercised in the direction of altering that arrangement, even if it had. been arrived at, because I did not believe that it was on sound lines. The decision was influenced very largely by gentlemen from the State represented by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I will not say that it was tainted on' that account ; but, at the same time, it seemed to me to be an arrangement which, although it might be put up with for a few years, was not to be looked . upon as a fixed and permanent agreement as to the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared to trust a minority of the people. The honorable senator surely knows how an alteration of the Constitution is brought about. You must not only nave a majority of the electors all over the Commonwealth, but you must have a majority of the electors in a majority of the States. There is a wheel within a wheel. The inner wheel blocks the operations of the outer wheel. If the honorable senator is willing to leave the matter to a majority of the people of the Commonwealth, I can have no earthly objection to raise against a decision arrived at in that way. But when we have the proviso that, in addition to one majority, you must also have a majority of the States, then I say that a difficulty is created which cannot be got over lightly. </para>

                        <para>- I should not offer any objection to that if I ceased to become a member. But, while I last, I hope that the Senate will not disappear. That is plain speaking. I am not prepared to enter into details at present, but when the matter comes up again, I shall be quite willing to say whether the Senate ought, or ought not, to disappear. We are dealing now with the means by which an alteration of the Constitution can be brought about, and I am urging that it will be a very dangerous course to place an arrangement of this kind in the Constitution, and thus make it exceedingly difficult of alteration. I said, in the first instance, that it would be impossible, if this agreement were made permanent, to carry out a policy of Protection such as Australia has mapped out for itself. If that policy be carried out faithfully and honestly, our revenue from Customs and Excise must continually decrease. If that happens, then, undoubtedly, whatever Government may be in power, will take the line of least resistance, instead of going for direct taxation. I may say here that several of the State Premiers have expressed themselves in the most hostile fashion to the Federal Parliament imposing direct taxation. They claim that as their own particular preserve, and have a notice erected, ' ' Trespassers will be prosecuted." So that any Federal Government which, like the Fusion Government, desired to continue on good terms with the State Governments would naturally turn to indirect taxation for revenue. What would that mean ? It would mean a revenue Tariff. It  would mean that we should have a high Tariff on many of the necessaries of life. We had a suggestion here recently with regard to the taxation of tea, kerosene, and cotton piece goods. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. They even agreed that if the Commonwealth would impose those taxes it could retain the proceeds, thus showing that they were opposed, not only to levying direct taxation through the Commonwealth, but even to being compelled to impose direct taxation .themselves. I think I am entitled to repeat this in the ears of the electors. I am not talking now to the men who are  sitting on these benches, but to the electors outside who control the Parliament and the affairs of the Commonwealth. In this secret 'Conference, which has been held in Melbourne, we had a conspiracy to foist' more and more taxation upon the shoulders of the poor. If the poor are foolish enough to be willing to carry even a bigger load than the one they now carry, then they deserve everything that the Government and the Parliament care to place upon them. They have the power in their own hands. They can, if they choose, shift the burden of taxation off their own shoulders on to the shoulders of the wealthy at the next election. All that they have to do is to send the Labour party into this Parliament with a majority. If they do that a bloodless revolution will have been accomplished, and " fat ;' will have to contribute" to the Federal Treasury in a proportion altogether contrary to past experience. If this agreement is perpetuated our protective policy will be largely interfered with and checked ; it will be continually governed by the necessity to raise 25s. per head for the States. I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, as an, ardent Protectionist, whether he would like to see that policy go to. the wall in the way I have suggested? Of course, I know that other honorable senators are not so anxious about it as he is. Many of them would rather have a Free Trade or revenue Tariff - one which would not create industries, but which would merely drag the last farthing from the pockets of the working classes. </para>

                        <para>- That may be what the State Premiers want, but the men and women in Australia have said that they want protection to the worker and to the consumer. How are they going to get that under an arrangement of this kind? Why, sir, the thing is impossible. This agreement is simply an affront to the people, and if they agree to it they will be very much more stupid than I think they are. The State Premiers are crowing over the triumph they have accomplished, and they have good reason to do so. They have simply beaten the Commonwealth Government at every point. No doubt the Commonwealth will get more revenue under the agreement than it does under the Braddon blot. But even the Braddon blot was merely a temporary expedient. The framers of the Constitution foresaw that the needs of the Commonwealth would be continually widening, that the area of its functions would constantly enlarge, and that the revenue it required would be continually more and more. They knew that perfectly well, and they said that at the end of ten years the Parliament of the Commonwealth should have the right to deal with its own revenue in its own way. But the present Ministry are attempting to pin the people of Australia down to a revenue Tariff for all time. To put it in its most naked and most offensive way, to me, at any rate, they have banded themselves together on the side of wealth as against poverty. They have ranged themselves on the side of the rich to protect them against legitimate taxation, and they have declared themselves, from that point of view, at any rate, to be the enemies of the poor. That is how I brand them, and how I intend to brand them when I go before the electors. </para>

                    <para>. - On this occasion I do not intend to refer to very many matters. I compliment the Government upon their new departure of affording to the Senate an opportunity to discuss the Budget proposals simultaneously with another place; and I hope that the precedent will be followed on all occasions. Previous speakers have referred, some of them at length, to a provisional agreement which has been concluded between the representatives of the States and of the Commonwealth. I do not intend to make more than a casual reference to the agreement to-night, as I shall have an opportunity of discussing the proposals embodied therein when a Bill for an alteration of the Constitution is submitted. The Premiers' Conference has established two precedents, and, to my mind, very dangerous ones. In the first place, each House of the National Parliament ad- 'journed for a week in order to al.'ow three members of the Federal Ministry to attend the Conference. I characterized the action of the Government in asking for the adjournment as a diabolical waste of time, and the precedent which they then established ought not to be followed hereafter. During the last few years in London, some  very important Conferences have been held on matters affecting the welfare of the British Empire. In 1907, the Imperial Conference and the Navigation Conference met, and quite recently the Imperial Defence Conference assembled. At each of those Conferences there were present the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and other prominent members of the British Parliament, who assisted at the deliberations. </para>

                        <para>- That was not the reason publicly given for the meeting of State Premiers. They met, it was said, to discuss important public questions  as between the Commonwealth and the States. There was no reason why the heads of the States and the Commonwealth should not have given publicity to their deliberations, so that the people might know exactly what course each delegate shaped, and what part he took in the discussion of the financial problem which they now say has been, settled. There is yet a great deal to be. said in connexion with this settlement. This Parliament and the several State Parliaments have yet to consider it, and should the proposals to give it effect succeed in. passing this Parliament, the people of Australia will be given an opportunity to ratify or reject it. Dealing now with the Budget, the first thing in it to attract my attention* is the proposal to initiate a borrowing policy. According to the Budget statement we are confronted with a probable deficit of ,£1,200,060. The Government propose to meet it by the issue of Treasury bonds, or, in other words, by initiating a system of borrowing in -connexion with Commonwealth finance. I regret this new departure of the Deakin-Cook Ministry. There are already six borrowers from Australia in the London market, as each of the six States carries on a borrowing policy- The Federation so far has he.en able to conduct its business without borrowing one halfpenny, but the present Government propose to add a seventh borrower to those who are already operating in London from Australia. The Government whom they displaced announced a policy in the Governor-General's speech at the opening of this session. They made suggestions as to the manner in which they would raise the money to meet the obligations they proposed to incur. One proposal they made was for a tax on the unimproved values of land. There is no hint of such a proposal' in the policy of the present Ministry. I believe that a tax on the unimproved values of land, coupled with an absentee tax, would have been sufficient to raise the greater portion of the money required to meet the expected deficit. Again, the policy advocated by the Fisher Government proposed the nationalization of the monopolies that are to-day cursing Australia. We hear no word of a similar proposal from the present occupants of the Treasury bench. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was: addressing himself to the necessity of a tax on the unimproved values of land, in. order that the lands of the Commonwealth, might be made available to the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> interjected that we were always advocating new taxation. It is important to remember that the taxation we advocate would fall upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it. Indirect taxation is unjust in its incidence, whilst direct taxation is an equitable system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> pointed out that through duties of Customs every individual in Australia is penalized to the extent of ?2 10s. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> interjected that an expenditure of ,?16 yearly for every family in Australia on drink, sport, and so on, was the other side of the question. I cannot, for the life of me, see how it is the other side of the question. The evils of drink constitute a question entirely different from that of taxation. </para>

I dare say that if one had time to go thoroughly into the question it would not be difficult to discover figures even more convincing than those, I have just referred to of the necessity for a land values tax to burst up large estates, and make land available for our people. There is another place in the world to-day which is being agitated in connexion with the land question. The Chancellor of the Exchequer of Great Britain to-day has dared to bring down a Budget proposing the imposition of a tax on land. The landlords of the country are up in arms, and threats are made to depose the present Liberal Government on account of the proposals contained in their Budget.

                        Chancellor of the Exchequer, delivered an important speech at Limehouse, East London, last night, in which he dealt with the Budget proposals and the duties of landlords. " The possession of land," said the Minister in the course of his remarks, " is not merely for its enjoyment, but involves a question of stewardship, and unless landlords discharge the duties attaching to ownership a time will come to reconsider the conditions under which land is held.

                <para>I am very much afraid that, as a result of the land system at present in force in Australia, there are some cupboards bare, and the lot of some of our countrymen is very hard to bear. The time was ripe long ago for the imposition of this taxation. No Government in charge of the affairs of this young nation will be carrying out their duty to the people if they put off its imposition any longer. I find that the Government expect to receive from Customs and Excise a revenue of ,?10,800,000. Our total estimated receipts for 1909-10 amount to .?14,555,765- The total estimated expenditure amounts to ?7,867,621, leaving a balance available of ,?6,688,144. The amount due to the States under the Braddon section is ?7,891,481, leaving a deficit of ?1,200,000, which, as I have already said, the Government intend to cover by the issue of Treasury bonds. One item in the agreement between the Federal Government and the State Premiers, if given effect to, would reduce the deficit by ?600,000. Looking at the figures as they appear in the Budget, I have to ask myself one or two serious questions. Either the Government of the day are not sincere in their policy, or the Budget is not worth the paper it is written on. The Budget tells us that there is to be a deficit of ?1,200,000. I direct the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to the fact that only a few weeks ago his colleague, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, read to the Senate a statement of the Ministerial policy, and that no provision is made in- the Budget to give effect to some of the most important features of the policy then announced. In addition, something has occurred since which was not referred to in the statement of Ministerial policy in connexion with defence, and for which, also, there is no provision made in the Budget; The present Government thought it wise, not long ago, to offer a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> or its equivalent, to Great Britain. When the Fisher Government was .in power the present Prime Minister said that nothing less than a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> would meet the situation. A cry was raised that the Parliament should be called together at once, in order that, during the height of a scare; a proposal to present a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain might be rushed through. Parliament did not reassemble until about the usual time, and there was then no challenge of the Fisher Government by the Opposition on the question of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> The Fisher Government were displaced without the common courtesy of a consideration of their policy speech, and a week or two afterwards we found. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> cabling an offer to Great Britain of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> with the proviso "or its alternative." What does the alternative mean? It means that, notwithstanding all the avowals of that gentleman and his colleagues, they had to wait until the Imperial Defence Conference told them what their defence policy ought to be. That is the position occupied . by the man who has always preached a self-reliant Australia. He will not give us a single hint as to the nature of the defence policy of the Government until after the return of Colonel Foxton to Melbourne. Upon these Estimates I do not see any provision for the expenditure of the ,£2,000,000 which will be required for the presentation to the Empire of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> or its equivalent. Either the Government are sincere or they are not. </para>

                        <para>- I credit them and other honorable senators with being sincere in their professions. Another expenditure to which the Government are committed has reference to the extension of postal facilities. The Postal Department is growing daily. Many portions of our continent are becoming populated. The distances between various centres are great, and thus it comes about that as soon as a party of plucky prospectors make a find, a settlement springs up, and telephonic, telegraphic, and mail communication is required. The Postal Department will certainly have to incur a stupendous expenditure in the near future. The very smallest sum which I can put down in this connexion is j£i, 000,000. There is no more knotty problem to be solved than that relating to telephonic rates. We all know how- useful is the telephone in commercial and private life. But we also recognise that those who use that instrument most do not pay the most for it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> was Postmaster-General he formulated a scheme under which the present rates were to be revised, and under which the larger users would be compelled to pay more than the smaller ones. But the moment he was succeeded by, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, his scheme for the revision of those rates was thrown into the waste-paper basket. Nothing has since been done in the matter, except to appoint two accountants to inquire into those rates. If the scheme formulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> were impracticable, why was it necessary to appoint two accountants to inquire into the question of rates whilst the Postal Commission was sitting? Another expenditure to which the Government are committed has reference to the payment of invalid pensions. The smallest estimate which I can make for these pensions in the near future is ,£250,000. There are thousands of invalids in Australia to-day to whom the - payment of pensions would be a boon, and why should we hold out a promise to grant them pensions unless we provide upon the Estimates for a start in that connexion? Then, I think, that  an  additional sum will be required for the payment of old-age pensions. From estimates which have been framed, I gather that next year these pensions will probably cost ,£1,750,000. The Estimates, however, contain no provision for that additional expenditure. Moreover, a considerable outlay will be necessitated in connexion with the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth. Of course, I  am  assuming that the agreement which was entered into between the late Premier of South Australia and the Prime Minister will be ratified.

Parliament has selected a site, and the expenditure of £5,000 upon it will simply mean hanging up the whole question for an indefinite period. The Estimates also include an item of £[100 for lighthouses. Yet only the other day the Minister of Trade and Customs, in answer to an inquiry by a representative of one of the Melbourne newspapers, declared that the estimated cost of taking over the lighthouses from the States would be £60,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- My point is that only £500 has been placed on the Estimates in this connexion, notwithstanding that there are a number of places on the Australian coast which are not properly lighted. These are a source of great danger to navigation. They have been pointed out by the captains of vessels trading on our coasts. The State authorities are anxious that lighthouses, beacons, and buoys should be taken over by the Commonwealth, and yet no real provision has been made for their transfer in this Budget. I would further point out that an Inter-State Commission proposed by this Government for the purpose of reviewing industrial conditions throughout Australia cannot be created without the expenditure of money. At least £[5,000 will be required in this connexion, and yet no provision has been made for it upon the Estimates. If the Deakin-Cook Government are sincere in the policy which they have placed before the people, instead of the deficit during the current year amounting to £1,200,000, it will be at least double that. But there are other obligations to which the Commonwealth will be committed in the near future. An additional sum of £1,000,000, at least, will be needed for the payment of old-age and invalid pensions, and the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth will involve an expenditure of  £[3,000,000  or  £[4,000,000,  quite apart from the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. While on the subject of that railway, I marvel very much that no financial provision has been made for its construction. The reports of the two surveying parties and of the independent surveyor, who were authorized to make a survey of the route which it would traverse, are favorable to its construction. But, notwithstanding that fact, the gentleman who is responsible for the Budget, who, from the time he lands in Western Australia until he leaves it, does nothing but' boast of what he has done for that State in connexion with the proposed transcontinental line, who is always denouncing the Labour party for having done nothing in, that matter- </para>

                        <para>- If I could not do so, I would at' least tell the people why the necessary provision was not made there. There is also an immigration policy. I notice that £[20,000 is put down for that purpose. Before we have any right to spend money on advertising the resources of Australia, we must open up the lands of the country by the imposition of a tax. Another matter to which the present Government are committed, and for which they have introduced a Bill, is the appointment of a High Commissioner in London. I cannot see that any provision has been made for that purpose. I believe that the High Commissioner's Department is to cost something like £8,000 cr £10,000 a year. Why is not that expenditure mentioned in the Budget papers? Altogether, the Budget seems to be scarcely worth the time that has been occupied in studying it, or the paper on which it is printed. With reference to the defence policy, I observe that the only increase this year, as compared with last, is an amount of .£556,520. That is not nearly enough. The amount should have been at least double, in order to prepare for an efficient system of defence for this country. Here, again,  however7  I cannot blame the Government for not having gone further. They cannot move hand or foot in the way of announcing a defence policy lo the Commonwealth until the return of their ' delegate. They sent Colonel Foxton to London to say, " Please tell us what Australia is to do to defend itself." Colonel Foxton has to come back, and will tell the Deakin-Cook Government what they are to do. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with the honorable senator who has just sat down in congratulating the Government upon the opportunity which has been afforded to the Senate to discuss the broad financial lines of the policy of the Government. I trust that the course that has been followed on the present occasion will be repeated. I take it that when the Estimates come before us, we shall have a further opportunity of thoroughly overhauling the Federal Departments, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has delivered a speech interesting and remarkable for its candour. He anticipates that the present Government will initiate a system of borrowing, in order 10 discharge some of its duties. He pointed out that he intended to resist strongly a borrowing policy, and gave his reason. He said that there were about ^400,000,000 worth- of what he called community-created values, which, at 5 per cent., would realize £[20,000,000 ;. and until that source of revenue was exhausted he would strongly oppose the borrowing policy. It has often been charged against our opponents that they intended to use what they call the community-created value of land for the purpose of bearing almost entirely the cost of government. I understand that that view represents the attitude of the Opposition. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> upon the candour, vigour, and clearness with which he expounded that policy. I do not think that his colleagues will materially tone down or object to what he said. For that reason I would not have had his speech shortened by a single line. It will make admirable material when we have to discuss these issues' before the electors. </para>

                        <para>- I further take the opportunity of saying that I hope that the Government will have the courage of their convictions, and that for the purpose of building what may be called permanent reproductive works, they will go forward either in the direction of a loan policy with a sinking fund, or will introduce a system of capitalizing accounts. I venture to express a preference for the former method. That is to say, where works are permanent and reproductive, we ought not to charge the current year's revenue with the whole cost, but should divide it over a number of years. I further wish to say that if the financial proposals of the Government in this respect are much longer delayed, I shall not be altogether -a generous supporter of theirs, but shall probably be found to be more captious and insistent with regard to the policy which should be adopted in the construction of new works of a permanent and reproductive character. I hold, as I have indicated on more than one occasion, that, inasmuch as this country requires an immense amount of developmental work, it is impossible to charge the cost to current revenue. The logical result of that policy must be, if it is continued much longer, to arrest development in Australia. I am glad to find that there is some indication of an intention on the part of the Government to be no longer frightened by this bogy regarding loans. If the loans are raised for permanent reproductive works of a developmental character, and the money is spent on sound lines, it is a policy which is consistent with the proper economic development of the Commonwealth.  The policy of constructing such works out of revenue is one as to which my feeling will be well understood when I call it to a very large extent " fool finance." I trust that it will not be continued much longer. </para>

                        <para>- It is independent criticism on an important point, lt is a matter to which I have referred on many platforms before my own constituents and elsewhere. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in his speech this afternoon furnished me with strong reasons why I should make this criticism. He pointed out that for purposes of our defence policy, and for payment for certain necessary works, we should adopt a kind of capitalization system, whereby the necessary expenditure would be spread over a number of years. I say, in addition, that if the works to be carried out are developmental and reproductive, the policy of spreading their cost over a number of years is still more justifiable. Objection has been raised by critics opposite to the arrangement made between the Premiers of the States and the Commonwealth Ministry. It is a Ten important arrangement, no matter how honorable senators opposite may seek to disparage it. The Conference itself was one of the most important ever held in the Commonwealth. Its results will shortly be brought before us, and before every State Parliament in a concrete form. There is no disparagement of dignity in the Treasurer and Prime Minister entering into a Conference with the State Premiers, when both the Commonwealth and the States have an equal interest in the satisfactory solution of the financial difficulty. One objection raised is that the Conference was held in secret. But if my memory of current political history be correct, honorable senators opposite have also met in secret caucuses. </para>

                        <para>- He cannot escape that question. 1 am pointing out an analogy. Honorable senators opposite, since they have been a party, have always excluded the press while they were discussing the details of" any policy which they were preparing for the purposes of submitting it to the people, ls there any substantial difference between the position of the State Premiers and the position of the Commonwealth Prime Minister and hil Treasurer when they met together to formulate a policy to submit to us, and, through us, to the country. Why, sir, the analogy between the course which the Labour party took when formulating important principles of their policy and the line which was taken by the State Premiers and the Prime Minister is so complete that the moment it is pointed out the criticism against it reacts, so to speak, like a lash on the backs of the critics. </para>

                        <para>- Mv honorable friend may call the Conference by whatever term he likes. What I am concerned in is the fact that if there was any justification for the course pursued in the circumstances, our friends on the opposite side have afforded precedent over and over again. It  is somewhat amusing, as well as strange, to find that the course pursued so consistently by my honorable friends opposite is highly reprehensible when it is followed by others. The resolutions which are shortly to be submitted by the Government to us, and by the Premiers to the State Parliaments, have been severely objected to by our friend's on the Opposition benches. I feel very much gratified at the directness of their opposition to those resolutions. From the history of previous Conferences, especially the Labour Conference which met in Brisbane in July, 1908, I expected that the scheme which has been mutually agreed upon by the State Premiers and Commonwealth Ministers, inasmuch as, substantially, it is closely analogous in its financial results to that recommended to the public by my friends opposite - I thought that the scheme would have been welcomed by the Opposition, and that the Prime Minister and Treasurer would have received a great deal of support from the other side in inducing the electors to accept it as a final settlement, so far as such financial matters can be said to be finally settled. But I am glad that some critics on the other side have made it clear that they intend to oppose this settlement. Substantially, what were the proposals recommended or strongly supported by the Labour Conference which met in Brisbane in July, 1908? They were to average the contributions from Customs and Excise for five typical years, and the average would be about .£9,500,000. They were to deduct the cost of postal administration, the cost of old-age pensions, and other expenditure amounting to .£1, 000,000, making probably a total deduction of about £4,600,000, and the balance, which would be about .£4,951)000, was to be distributed to the States <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> At that time the population of Australia was about 4,057,136. On their own financial proposals - and we credited them with all sincerity when they were put forward - the average contribution to the States comes out at <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 4s. 5d. per head. What do we propose to do? </para>

                        <para>- I thank my honorable friend for the interjection ; that is what it came to. My honorable friends on the other side are now falling out about how far they meant those proposals to be accepted by the people. No two criticisms on that side with regard to what went on at the Conference, or what was intended to be taken therefrom, square one with the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> with remarkable clearness and candour, almost damned the scheme from the beginning. He contended that it was far too liberal to the States. I welcome that kind of criticism, and the Government may be gratified at having given the opportunity which has called forth such comment. I do not intend to go into details with regard to the financial administration of the Departments. But I want to place on record the fact that the States and the State Premiers, if they represent the States, are behaving with remarkable generosity to the Commonwealth. The figures show that beyond doubt. Suppose that the Braddon section, misnamed the Braddon blot, were continued after 1 910, then, if the average contributions from Customs, and Excise amounted to .between £10,000,000 and £1 <inline font-style="italic">1,000,000,</inline> New South Wales would receive about £3,864,000; Victoria, £2,074,646; Queensland, £[1,035,507 ; South Australia, £[656,648; Western- Australia, £[622,704; and Tasmania, £233,899. In other words, on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, New South Wales would receive £[2 os. 4-Jd. ; Victoria, £1  i2s.  of d. ; Queensland, £[1 16s. 6£d. ; South Australia, £1 ns. 6d. ; Western Australia, £2 5s. 9½d. ; and Tasmania, £1 4s. 10½d. On a return of 25s. per head, the States are giving up to the Commonwealth, as compared with the condition of affairs under the Braddon section, the following sums : - New South Wales, £1,243,490; Victoria, £457,^46; Queensland, £[326,757 ; South Australia, £135,398; and Western Australia, £282,704; while Tasmania, fortunately, for the first time, is going to gain about  £I,IOL  In -the face of these figures - and I think that substantially they are unchallengeable - it is not criticism, but a libel on the States to say that they are not dealing with us in a very generous spirit. We ought to recognise that fact. </para>

                        <para>- I remember that. To some extent, the figures represent more than Queensland is giving up. But allowing for the expense of the old-age pensions, the States, in consenting through their Premiers to accept a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return of 25s., are showing a spirit expressive of a desire to come to an amicable and satisfactory conclusion between themselves and the Commonwealth. They are practically saying to the Commonwealth, " We recognise your financial obligations in every direction ; we give to you between £[2,000,000 and £3,000,000; try to manage on that for some time." If we alter the system of expenditure on what might be called permanent and reproductive works, if the Government of the day will exercise a strong controlling hand over the expenditure of the Departments, then, unless some entirely unexpected claims crop up- </para>

                        <para>- I have said so pretty distinctly on several occasions. If we bear in mind all these precautions, I think that for some years to come the Commonwealth will be very well able to pay its way ; while the various Departments, especially that of Defence, will be made infinitely more efficient. I wish now to draw attention to the growth in the various Departments of expenditure directly attributable to Federation. I do so in order to show that there is some justification for the criticisms of the State Premiers and Parliaments as to the increase in Commonwealth expenditure and their suspicion of the financial drift of the Commonwealth. In the year 1902-3 the expenditure on the Federal Parliament was £108,939. In 1908-9 it had risen to £[165,524. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly do. For this year the estimate runs up to £211,511. I can understand that in two of the years during the period to which my figures refer, the fact that general elections had to be provided for, added to the cost of Parliament, and the increase in the estimate for 1909-10 as compared with the expenditure for 1908-9 may be to a large extent attributed to the coming general election. Still I think that these increases should not be so large, because the expense of holding general elections should now be less costly. I am speaking as I am entitled, and I think expected to speak, in putting the State view of this matter. Through their Premiers the States have exhibited a liberal spirit towards the Commonwealth in saying that they will take 25s. per head, and thank us for that, and we have a right in speaking here on behalf of the States to insist that the expenditure in connexion with the various Federal Departments shall be more carefully scrutinized, and, if possible, dealt with with a firmer hand. In the Department of External Affairs the expenditure for 1902- 3 was £34,518 In 1908-9 it had risen to £[66,054, and the estimate for 1909-10  is £80,336. I shall shorten my remarks on this point by avoiding details of the different Departments, and by giving the total result. The total expenditure to be attributed solely to the institution of Federation was, in 1902-3, £502,703. It should be noted here that the Adelaide estimate of the necessary extra expense of Federation was about , £353,000 per annum, but in the second or third year of Federation that estimate was vastly exceeded, and Federal expenditure' reached </para>

                        <para>- I believe so. Some people I know said that too much reliance ought not to be placed on that estimate, and that it was to some extent "faked" in order to induce the people of the various States to consent to join the Federation. Apparently there was some justification for the contention, however uncharitable to Ministers and their predecessors in office it may appear to say so. The fact remains that the total expenditure solely attributable to Federation amounted to £502,703 in 1902-3, and to £717,444 in 1908-9, while the estimate for the current year is £859,251. Ministers, when they come to speak on the subject, may be prepared with a complete answer to these figures, but it cannot be disputed that the cost of Federation has gone up unexpectedly, and that there is room, in the face of the figures I have given, for some strong Treasurer to exercise a commanding influence in insisting upon economy in administration. </para>

                        <para>- It requires some answer. I am putting the matter in a critical, but not, I think, in a hostile fashion. I can deal now with a Department with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is familiar. The honorable senator made a speech, which was excellent in many respects and supplied a complete justification for some financial principles which I hold. He may be able to give some explanation of the increased expenditure on the Defence Department. The expenditure in 1902-3 amounted to £712,290. In 1908-9 it had increased to £949,309, and this year the expenditure is estimated to be £1,246,604. I make this criticism without the slightest objection to the very large sum proposed for this year. I think that it is not one penny more than is needed, and probably the Minister of Defence, if he could get it, could spend with advantage on the Department £500,000 or £750,000 more than is being asked for. I wish, however, to make the point that the increase in the expenditure proposed on this Department in 1909- 10, as compared with the expenditure in 1902-3, represents an' increase of 75 per cent. I should like to know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is prepared to say from his experience of the Department that it has increased to the extent of 75 per cent. in efficiency as a war machine since the establishment of Federation. If as a war machine it had increased in efficiency to the extent of 75 per cent., no man in Australia could object to the increased expenditure. I fear that, notwithstanding this remarkable increase in expenditure, there has been no corresponding increase of efficiency in a single branch of the Department of Defence. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who is universally acknowledged to have made a thoroughly successful Minister of Defence during his short administration of the Department, will be prepared to say that the increased expenditure to which I have referred, has been followed by a corresponding increase of efficiency. I have given some consideration to the subject, and have consulted at times with experts. I have been told that, notwithstanding the increased expenditure on the Defence Department, it is very doubtful whether our Defence Forces, as a war machine, are not less efficient now under Commonwealth administration than they were as separate units under the State Governments. My complaint is not that under the Commonwealth the expenditure on the Department of Defence has been increased, but I complain that, notwithstanding the fact that the Federal Parliament has year after year added to the taxation of the people of Australia, in order to increase the efficiency of our Defence Forces, their efficiency has not been increased. Parliament is justified in insisting that this state of affairs shall not continue much longer. The people of Australia are not only willing but anxious to spend money to secure the reasonable efficiency of our Defence Forces, but they have a right to insist that if there is to be increased expenditure on the Defence Department, Parliament shall have assurance df a corresponding increase in efficiency. I have more figures to show the way in which Commonwealth expenditure has mounted up, but 1 think I have said sufficient to direct the attention of Ministers to the position of the Government in the matter. I think there is sufficient ground, not for mere carping criticism, but for pointing out the serious drift in the expenditure of the 'Commonwealth. It is, unfortunately, an historical fact in the financial administration of the Commonwealth during the whole of its existence that until the present time we have had no Ministry strong enough to exercise an independent hand in the matter of finance. But, fortunately, now, through the fusion of parties, we have a Ministry strong enough to formulate a policy and be responsible for it. The position now, happily for this Parliament, and for the people, is that if their policy is not accepted by this Parliament, the Government can appeal confidently to the people with a set of followers behind them who will, generally speaking, support the whole of their proposals. Unfortunately, the history of previous Governments has been that the occupants of the Treasury benches have felt more strongly called upon to watch one another than, to watch, their opponents. That position of affairs does not now exist, and considering the importance of- their financial and other proposals, it is well for Australia that we now have a fused and strong Government with supporters who are not afraid to offer criticism and advice even to their own leaders. I shall confine my concluding remarks to the question of the population of Australia. I" shall be as brief as I possibly can, having regard to the importance of the subject. There is an item on the Estimates of £[20,000 for advertising Australia. The Commonwealth Government can do no more than advertise Australia. They have not yet the power, nor 'would I consent to give them the power to incur expense in the introduction of immigrants. The only regret I have in the matter is that at present we cannot find more than £[20,000 for the purpose of advertising </para>

                <para>Australia throughout the world. There is one remarkable feature in regard to the growth and development of the population of Australia, which will be better realized if I reduce the facts to figures and percentages. Dealing first of all with the capital cities, I wish to show how the population of Australia is being slowly but surely concentrated in a few large cities. The population of Sydney in 1900 was 490,600. </para>

The effect of that would be to add to the price of land. Every one coming to us with the intention to take up land knows that we have a party here who pledge their political existence to the policy of taxing land, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has properly interpreted the mind of the Opposition in the matter they advocate, that the tax should be equal to the full amount of the community-created value of the land. No wonder the prospect of such a policy is keeping the lands of Australia a desert. </para>

Still, I claim the right to voice my own opinions. As has been pointed out bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> honorable senators opposite do not intend that_ the system of exemption should be continued. I say that there is no policy more calculated to keep people off the lands of Australia than is the policy of imposing a tax up to the limit of .the community - created values of land. Of course, we all recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is a veritable walking encyclopaedia of knowledge. At the same time that fact does not deter me from pointing out the increase of population which has occurred in our metropolitan cities between 1900 and 1908. That increase has been " as follows : - Sydney, 2.83 per cent. ; Melbourne, 1.38 per cent. ; Brisbane, 1.91 per cent. ; Adelaide, 1.52 per cent. ; Perth, 4.89 per cent. ; Hobart, 2.33 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may hold that opinion, but I entertain quite another. I was returned to this Parliament on the distinct understanding that whilst I have no particular objection to a land tax - in other words, whilst I ' recognise that there is no reason why land should be immune from its proper share of taxation - I am opposed to the Commonwealth Government levying a tax upon a single acre except in time of national emergency. </para>

                        <para>- That is arguable from a lawyer's point of view. I think that under the Constitution we have power to levy a land tax. Certainly we have power to levy such a tax if we are threatened with an outbreak of war. But as, in addition to possessing sole control over the Customs and Excise revenue, the whole area of taxation is open to us, I contend that we ought to leave to the States this vast sphere of residual taxation. The more we confine our functions to our own domain the better will it be for ourselves and for the States. Let me point to another remarkable feature in connexion with the development of population in Australia. In our six capital cities we have a population of 1,553,900, and in ten of our largest towns a population of 330,781. In other words, nearly 2,000,000 persons, out of a total population of 4,197,038, or 43 per cent., are settled in those cities and towns. Further, if we draw a straight line from Townsville to Adelaide, we shall find that nineteen-twentieths of our entire population is settled to the south-east of that line. More than two-thirds of the area of Australia, which, according to the reports of reliable explorers, is remarkably rich in natural resources, is to-day practically a howling wilderness, just as it was in the days of Cook, and Dampier. About 4,000,000 persons are concentrated in a few cities and towns in the south-eastern portion of Australia. Is there any honorable senator with an appreciation of the trend of events in the East and of the possible combinations in Europe, who does not recognise that if this remarkable tendency be not immediately arrested we shall stand in very grave danger? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand the policy of the Opposition in regard to this matter. When honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber say that they desire to spend more money upon immigration, my honorable friends opposite exclaim, "You must not do that until you insist upon the States opening up their lands." Such a method of criticism seems to me as stupid as it would be to say that it is highly desirable that a man should learn to swim, but that as people are sometimes drowned, he ought not to go near the water. </para>

                        <para>- It is none the worse for that, provided it be sound. It is quite as good as farmer's logic. I have occupied a little more time than I had intended. I rose to congratulate the Government upon the excellent opportunity which they have afforded the Senate of discussing the Budget. I have availed myself of it to point out that there is a good deal of justice in the criticism by the States of the financial administration df the Commonwealth, to express the hope that the Government will continue to cultivate" the amicable relations which have resulted from the recent Conference of the Premiers, to assure them of my hearty support in giving effect to the agreement which has been arrived at regarding the future financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, and of my intention to call upon the electors of Queensland, to cordially indorse the action of their Premier in that connexion. </para>
