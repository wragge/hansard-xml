I may mention that, on applying for some Bills at Hobart lately, I was told by the officers that they had only an office copy, and that other offices had none at all.

                        <para>[2.39]. - When this measure was last before the Senate, I promised to consider the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on a very important phase of it. Clause 14 provides for the insertion of a new provision - 87b - in the principal Act, and that' deals with the avoidance of certain conditions attached to the sale of patented articles. In a very thoughtful speech, my honorable friend drew my attention to certain constitutional aspects of the matter. He directed special attention to three cases which he quoted. Before dealing with one case in particular, I should like to say that I have given considerable attention to this matter, and have been in consultation with the Attorney-General and the Secretary of his Department concerning it. I frankly admit that the constitutional question raised is by no means free from difficulty. The view that we take is this. According to the terms of the Constitution, section 51, </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the pence, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to- </para>
                    <para>Then paragraph xviii. provides that we have power to make laws with respect to - copyrights, patents of inventions and designs, and trade marks. </para>
                    <para class="block">Subsequently, in paragraph xxxix, it is provided that Parliament has power to deal with - matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in either House thereof, or in the Government of the Commonwealth, or in the Federal judicature, or in any department or officer of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">Therefore we have full power to deal as we think proper with the law with respect to patents of inventions and designs. The question arises whether the clause of the Bill to which attention has been directed comes within the sphere of patent law. If it does not, it is, of course, subject to the constitutional objection which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has raised. The first feature to be borne in mind is that the clause is taken from the English Act. Whilst I admit, of course, that our jurisdiction in that respect is not completely analogous - I do not suggest for a moment that our Constitution is an analogue of the British Constitution - at the same time the fact remains that the provision does not appear in connexion with a law dealing with contracts, but is included in an Act dealing with patents.. That fact would seem to suggest that it is reasonable to say that the provision comes within the sphere of patent law. The design and object of the clause is this: We say that a patent shall not be used in such a way as to be harmful to trade or industry. I contend that it . is within: our power to lay down the terms and conditions under which patents shall be issued. A patent is a grant of a privilege or concession on the part of the Crown. The-  whole scheme of legislation on this subject bears out that fundamental view. It is, therefore, surely for the Crown to lay down the terms upon which the concession shall foe granted. </para>

                            <para>- It simply provides that the rights and .privileges conferred by patents shall not be abused, and therefore my contention is that it is properly part and parcel of patent law. If that view be accepted - I think that it is a correct view ; certainly it represents the view of the Attorney-General's Department - then we are simply inserting a clause containing a condition affecting the issue of patents. Any person accepting a patent after the passing of this measure must accept it and deal with it subject to this particular condition. Just in the same way, when premises are leased, say, for a term of ninety-nine years, stringent conditions are generally laid down. If anybody subsequently becomes interested in the whole or part of that lease, he necessarily has to deal with it upon the terms that it contains. In the clause to which I refer power is taken under the terms of the Constitution to prevent abuses of patents. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will probably remember that some little time ago the attention of the Senate was directed to the fact that oppressive conditions were introduced into agreements relating to certain American bootmaking machinery. The Government, remembering that, and also being aware of the section introduced into the Imperial Act of 1907 for the purpose of dealing with the same contingency in the Mother Country, where the same company was enabled practically to control the boot trade through the use of its patented machinery - the Government, I say, being aware of the evil and abuse that existed, introduced into this Bill a provision with the object of removing it. Of course I am aware that in certain cases the High Court has declared the law very strongly against an invasion of the sphere of the States, No doubt the cases quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> went very far in that direction. 1 do not deny for a moment that this Parliament has jurisdiction only within the limits of the Constitution. But there is no attempt on the present occasion to go beyond those limits. We do not attempt to go beyond what may fairly be regarded <inline font-style="italic">sib</inline> patent law. As I have already pointed out, a similar provision forms part of the patent law of the Mother Country itself. If that view be correct, the clause is a good one. But under any circumstances, even if we were in doubt, I should think that we were justified in retaining the clause, recognising that the High Court has the ultimate power of deciding as to its validity or otherwise. I think the opinion is sound that it is properly contained in the Bill. When we know that it is intended to cope with an evil, it is all the more necessary that we should include it.  If, by any possible chance, it were declared to be invalid - and I do not admit that that is at all likely - what would follow would be, not that the Patent Bill as we pass it would be invalid, but only this particular provision. From every  standpoint,  I think that the Senate would Le justified in including it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred particularly to what is known as the "Phonograph Case" in which it was held that - </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but what I contend is that it is in relation to the patent law. I gave, as an instance, the case of where a man takes a lease of property. There are certain conditions laid down in the lease, and every one dealing with the property must deal with it subject to all the terms and conditions of the lease. So I say that, in this particular case, Parliament is given power under the Constitution, to make any laws it thinks proper with respect to patents. I submit that, being aware of a particular abuse of patents, we have a right to lay down conditions governing the issue of patents, with the design and object of remedying that abuse. I submit that that is the correct view to take of the matter; and, of course, as I have already said, even if there were a doubt on the subject, we should still be justified in including the provision referred to, because the evil is one which must be contended against.

                    <para class="block">I submit this motion under the standing order which gives the Senate power to give an instruction to the Committee on a Bill to make amendments which might not be relevant to the Bill itself, but which are relevant to the principal Act. This is the only way in which I could bring such an amendment before the Committee. In asking the Senate to give this instruction to the Committee it is necessary that I should remind honorable senators that the present schedule of the principal Act provides for fees which in the aggregate amount to a considerable sum-. It must be admitted that they represent a considerable reduction in what it cost the patentee to patent an invention when the six separate State Acts were in operation. The total amount of fees provided for in the principal Act comes to , £13. The amendment I ask the Senate to instruct the Committee to consider is intended to bring our schedule of fees into line with the fees charged in the United States. Every honorable senator will agree that we do not wish to make money out of patent fees. To regard patent fees as a kind of tax would be to seek to make revenue out of what we really desire to encourage, namely, the inventive spirit of the people. As a matter of fact, we have been making money out of patent fees since the passing of the principal Act. In 1903-4 we made a profit from patents and trade marks of£636. In 1904-5 we made a profit of £1,264, and in 1905-6 the value of receipts over expenditure in connexion with the Patent Office amounted to£12,246. It will be seen that we have been making a profit out of the operations of the Patent Office. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. At the present time the office rental is included in the expenditure. Patentees are thus called upon to pay the whole cost of the upkeep of the office, including even the charge for rental. I do not think that we desire to make a profit out of the Patent Office. It would pay the country to make a loss upon' it so long as we gave patentees greater facilities to patent their inventions. We ought to make the fees which they are charged as reasonable as possible. I have no desire to labour this point. The question involved is merely one of opinion. This is not a party matter, but it is one of which every honorable senator should take an independent view. Everybody who desires to encourage the inventive genius of the people must recognise that <inline font-style="italic">£13</inline> is a considerable tax to impose upon inventors. It must not be forgotten that some inventors have to spend hundreds of pounds in conducting . experiments and in purchasing material, and yet, on top of that expenditure, we charge them fees to the extent of .£13- </para>

                        BEST (Victoria - Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.3]. - I shall be very glad if honorable senators will give this proposal careful attention, because, whilst we all sympathize with the view that our patent fees should be made as small as possible, consistently, of course, with the office paying its way, we are scarcely justified in incurring a loss in this connexion. I propose to show that it is estimated that during the current year we shall sustain a substantial loss upon the Patent Office. I shall presently account for what appears to be the excessive profit which has been derived from that source during previous years. The point which I wish to emphasize is that, with the exception of the United States, the fees which are charged by the Commonwealth are enormously below those levied by any other country in the world.

                            <para>- I do not" object to that proposition. I merely say that the fees which we at present charge are very reasonable, and are enormously below those levied by any other country with the exception of the United States. It will be observed that in the principal Act certain fees are specified. For instance, upon filing an application for a patent the fee is <inline font-style="italic">£1,</inline> upon acceptance of the complete specification <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> is charged, in connexion with the preparation of a patent for sealing- which involves a good deal of work, including a reference to expert examiners - a fee of £$ is charged. The last-named amount my honorable friend wishes to reduce to <inline font-style="italic">£2.</inline> Then, on the expiration of the seventh year of the period covered by the patent - that is to say, after the patentee has had the fullest opportunity to ascertain the commercial value of his patent - he has the option of declaring whether or not he intends to proceed further with it. If he finds that it possesses a commercial value he is asked to pay a fee °f ;£5 f°r its renewal. This amount <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> wishes to reduce to <inline font-style="italic">£2.</inline> Under the schedule of the principal Act, upon the notice of filing opposition to a patent a fee of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> is charged, and this sum my honorable friend wishes to reduce to <inline font-style="italic">£1.</inline> As I have already mentioned, these fees total <inline font-style="italic">£13.</inline> For that amount an inventor can patent his invention throughout the Commonwealth and secure its renewal. In regard to the fee charged for sealing a patent, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposes to reduce from <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">£2,</inline> I may say that the average sealings ' per year number about 1,315. Those which have been submitted for sealing purposes since the Act came into operation on the 1st June, 1904, total 6,758- an average of 1,315 per year. The revenue thus derived averages ,£6,575 annually. Last year out of 7,968 applications for patents all with the exception of  208 were completed up to the stage of sealing. Taking the average to which I have referred, it is estimated that the loss which would be occasioned by the adoption of the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would be £3,945perannum. That is the amount of the loss which would be incurred by reducing the fee for sealing patents from £5 to £2. That loss, in conjunction with the estimated loss on the working of the Patent Office for the current year, namely, £2,703, would make the total anticipated loss £6,648. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In 1906- 7 the revenue from the office totalled £24,000 and the expenditure £15,000. The receipts in excess of the expenditure were £9,123. During the previous year the profit derived by the Commonwealth from the Patent Office was £12,246. The explanation of the anticipated drop is that the large revenues for those years were due to the number of applications for sealing which had been filed in the States in previous years, and also to the proclamation of the Commonwealth Trade Marks Act. The receipts for 1907- 8 were accounted for by reason of the same state of affairs regarding the issue of trade mark certificates. As regards the present year, the Commissioner reports that the revenue of the Patents and Trade Marks office is about normal, subject to a small annual increase, which is anticipated to take place. The loss shown on this year's operations should not be a permanent one, particularly when the renewal fees come in. At the same time we are sailing very close to the wind. We have cut down our fees as much as we can, consistently with carrying on the work of the office without serious loss. We only want to make the office self supporting. If it could be established for a moment that we were making a profit, I should be only too glad to concede what my honorable friend has asked. </para>

                            <para>- No, because, in my opinion, the fees are exceedingly reasonable. In support of that statement, I propose to quote the renewal fees which are payable in various countries for the seventh to the fourteenth year of a patent. In the Mother Country, the amount payable is £77 ; in Austria, £73 10s. ; in Belgium, £33 5s. ; in Canada, £8 6s. 8d. ; in Cape Colony, £10 ; in France, £26 7s. 2d. ; in New Zealand, £10 ; in Norway, £23 3s. 9d. ; in Russia, £130 ; in Spain, £22 15s. ; in Sweden, £27 12s.1d. ; in the United States, nil ; and in Australia, £5. Prior to Federation, in New South Wales there was no renewal fee payable ; in Victoria there was a fee of £2 10s. ; in Queensland, £10; in South Australia, £2 10s.; in Western Australia, £10; and in Tasmania, £15. My honorable friends will see that in Australia generally a large reduction has been made. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> proposal to reduce the opposition fee from £2 to £1, I think it would hardly be wise to do so, because if it would have any tendency at all it would really be to encourage a number of frivolous applications. Prior to Federation an inventor in Australia had to pay £91 10s. for a patent which now costs him £13. Let me now quote the total fees which are payable in other countries. That for which a man pays £13 in Australia he would have to pay £197 10s. for in Austria, £7 3s. 7d. in America, £82 in Belgium, £12 6s. 5d. in Canada, £35 in Cape Colony, £59 in France, £260 in Germany, £100 in Great Britain, £159 in Hungary, £27 13s. 4d. in India, £9 10s. in Japan, £17 10s. in New Zealand, £30 6s. 8d. in Norway, £233 9s. 2d. in Russia, £56 17s. 6d. in Spain, and £74 10s.5d. in Sweden. It will be seen that we have endeavoured to make a very large concession to patentees. We are hardly justified in incurring a loss in connexion with our patent office. I submit that the fees at present are fair and reasonable, and therefore should not be reduced. </para>

                        <para>. -I should be pleased if the Minister could see his way to withdraw his opposition. I think that this matter might be left for consideration in Committee. I should not care to express an opinion regarding the Minister's figures without an examination of. them. Tt is desirable that honorable senators should have an opportunity to see the bearings of the figures. We are not to assume at once that the view put upon them by the Minister is the only one which can be submitted. He has spoken of a patent covering the whole of Australia. Suppose that he threw in the desert of Sahara, what good would it do? The important point is not the number of square miles, but the number of people covered by a patent. If, in the United States, with a population of eighty millions, the fee is £7, the relative charge in Australia would be 7s., instead of £13. We cannot judge patent charges simply by the area of the country which the patent covers, nor should we be governed by a consideration of the extraordinary charges which were collected in Australia prior to Federation. Speaking on the second reading of the Bill and without a knowledge of the course which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposed to take, I said that in my opinion a great deal of the prosperity of the United States was due to her remarkably advantageous patent law.I have held that belief for a great many years. Certainly all my sympathies go in the direction of exceedingly low patent charges, and 1 do not at all agree with the view that the Patent Office ought to be made self-supporting, because there should be a higher object in view.I suggest to the Minister that this is not quite the time when he should ask the Senate to decide this point . It could be better decided in Committee, after we had fully considered its bearings. </para>

                        has put the matter very fairly, and I think that the Minister might yield to the suggestion that this matter, involving the consideration of figures should be dealt with in Committee. There can be no doubt that patentees and intending patentees have derived very great benefit from Federation. That was one of the objects we had in view in promoting the union of the States. Prior to that event, one of the great obstacles to the encouragement of inventors was the fact that each State had its own patent law, with a scale of fees which had to be paid, no patent being of any value as a protection outside the boundaries of the State in which it was granted. All that, however, was remedied when the Commonwealth took over the control of the patent laws. I admit the great desirability of encouraging inventors. There is nothing more calculated to promote the prosperity of a country, particularly the manufacturing interests, and, of course, the agricultural interests, than the encouragement of inventors.I do not think that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline>
                        said one word too much when he declared that a good deal of the prosperity of America, the enormous impetus in the development of machinery manufactures, has been largely due to the liberality of its patent law, and to the encouragement which it has given to inventors. I am not quite sure, though, that I agree with him that the Department should be self-supporting, because there are many applicants for patents, if not patentees, who are utterly unable to pay any fees. We know that very many of the most famous and useful inventions have been discovered and brought into play by penniless inventors. We should remember that the inventors of some of the finest inventions which have been of benefit to humanity, reaped no advantage from them simply because of their poverty, and that the advantage went to those who, having the means, took over the inventions. At the same time I think that unless there is cause shown to the contrary we ought, as far as we can, to make the Department pay its way. But after what we have heard from the Minister, it is impossible for us to say whether it is likely to pay its way on a reduced scale of fees. It is perfectly inexplicable to me that after the Department has yielded a large surplus for some years, we should now be told that it is likely to show a deficit of £2,000 this year. I believe that in one year there was a surplus of as much as £12,000 ; and if that is a fact it shows that somehow or other a very heavy burden was placed on applicants for patents. I am unable to understand how the estimated deficiency for this year can arise. My honorable friend's explanation does not throw any light on the reasons for the surplus in previous years. He says that it is on account of money returned to the States. But no fees had to be returned to the States.

                            <para>- We did not seal State patents. A State patentee was at liberty to apply for a Commonwealth patent, but the efficacy of State patents remained. The administration of the State Acts was transferred to the Commonwealth simply as a matter of convenience. A patentee was enabled to apply for  a Commonwealth patent, but the new patent superseded the old one only as to the unexpired time. That did not involve any transfer of moneys received to the States. I should like to hear from the Minister some further explanation as to how the. surplus was arrived at. It would be wise to give honorable senators an opportunity in Committee of eliciting more complete figures. I should like to say a word or two for the consideration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as to his suggested reductions of fees. I hope that he will further consider some of his suggestions. He proposes to reduce to £1 the fee of £2 on giving notice of opposition to a patent. Like the Minister, I consider that that is a strange way of encouraging inventors. By reducing the fee which a person who desires to oppose a patent has to pay before the opposition can be entertained, we rather injure patentees. I think that that fee ought to be retained, because any one who has knowledge of the practice with regard to patents is aware that very often opposition is lodged by some one out of what I may call " sheer cussedness," and with a view of obstruction rather than because there is any well-founded ground for contending that the patent in question has not merits. T also invite attention to the £5 renewal fee. I confess that at present I do not see why it should be reduced. </para>

                            <para>- At the end of the seven years' period - in some countries the term runs for fourteen years - if the patent were of no value it would not be renewed, and no fee would be paid. But if the patent were valuable, we may rest assured that the value would have been proved to be substantial and satisfactory to the patentee before he would pay the renewal fee. If it be worth his while to renew, I think, as at present advised, that £5 is not an excessive amount. It is a payment made by a patentee who is assured of the probable profitableness of his invention. I quite agree, however, that the fee of £5 paid for preparation for sealing might very well be reduced. The Minister contended that a great deal has to be done for the £5. All that I know of that is done is that the letters patent are printed on a piece of parchment, sealed, and handed to the patentee. The patent is issued on a printed form, and nothing is done except to fill up a few blanks, and affix the seal. I shall therefore assist my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in his proposal to have the matter further considered in Committee, and I trust that the Minister will then be able, with the assistance of the officers of his Department, to give us further information as to how the surplus of past years was made up, together with further details relating to the estimated deficiency of £2,000 this year. </para>

                        <para>. - I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as to the desirableness of giving to inventors all the benefits we can as cheaply as possible. The figures quoted by the Minister regarding the charges made do not put the question as clearly as might be wished. Different charges are made at different stages in the issue of a patent. I have before me some figures which show the charges made at the various stages in various countries. In New Zealand the charges up to sealing amount to £2 10s., as compared with £8 in the Commonwealth ; but in that country the renewal charge is £15, as compared with our £5. In Great Britain the charges up to sealing amount to £5, and the renewal charge is £95. In Canada the charges up to sealing amount to £4 2s. 2d., and the renewal charge is £8 4s. 4d. In the United States the charges up to sealing are £7 3s. 9d., and there is no renewal charge whatever. The Minister has contended that we must obtain sufficient revenue to make the office self-supporting. I quite agree with him. But I also agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that when a man is struggling with a| new invention we should relieve him, as far as possible, of fees, whereas when his patent has become a success, and he has made money out of it, we may very properly charge him a high fee for renewal. In the United States the policy pursued is rather curious. There, when a. patentee has made money out of his invention, they charge him nothing for renewal. I should like the fees in the Commonwealth to be made as cheap as they are in New Zealand up to sealing, and when a patentee asks for a renewal there is no objection to making him pay a good fee. </para>

                        <para>. - I trust that the Minister will reconsider his opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> proposal. We ought to give some attention to the fees to be charged to patentees. I find from the Budget papers that the revenue from patents for the year 1908-9 was £13,623, whereas salaries amount to only £9,394. There is, therefore, ample room for the payment of rent, still leaving a small margin of profit to the credit of the office. But there is a very large sum of £8,475put down as contingencies for 1909-10. I arn not satisfied about that item. I do not understand what " contingencies " cover. We ought to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining the matter in Committee quite apart from the question of reducing fees. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will, however, be well advised if he takes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> advice, and modifies some of his proposals. If he did that he would, I think, carry the Senate with him. </para>

                        <para>.- The time has gone by when we can afford to be indifferent to revenue. We must now conserve revenue in every possible way. It appears to me that the Minister has acted quite rightly in objecting to the proposed instruction being given to the Committee, because he has made up his mind that he is not justified in giving up the large amount of revenue involved. As he has no doubt about the matter himself, he was not justified in agreeing to the recommittal. The figures with which we have been furnished show that our Patent Act has been a success, and has accomplished the object for which it was passed. Why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should have suggested a reduction of the renewal fee I cannot understand ; because when a patent has been in force for a number of years, and a renewal is asked for, it shows that the invention is an exceedingly payable one. If a patentee cannot afford to pay £5 on getting the bit of parchment that protects him throughout the Commonwealth, he can afford to pay nothing. We all know that a barrister will not look at a brief even for a few minutes without a fee of £5, and in some cases of £50. We all know also that a little bit of parchment called a probate, with the seal of a Court affixed to it, is not issued without the payment of a fee which, in the case of an estate worth £100,000, amounts in this State to as much as £10,000. </para>

                            <para>- There is only one country in the world that is more liberal than we are with reference to the renewal fee. The United States makes no charge whatever. But Austria charges £19410s. for renewal of a patent, Belgium charges £82 5s. 4d., Canada £8 4s. 4d., Cape Colony £30, and France £39. Do honorable senators know what renewal fee Germany charges? There have perhaps been a greater number of chemical and scientific inventions in Germany than in any other country. The desire in Germany is to encourage inventors because it is known that the trade of the country has been enormously increased as a result of their encouragement, and yet they impose for renewals of patents a fee of £257 10s. Our honorable friends opposite are growling because here we charge a fee of £5. In Great Britain a fee of £95 is charged for a renewal of a patent ; in Hungary, £156 7s. 6d.  ;  in India, £25; in Japan, £17; in New Zealand, £15; in Norway, £28 14s. 2d.  ;  in Russia, £228 11s. 8d. ; in Spain, £56 12s.1d; and in Sweden, £73 9s. 4½d. The facts gathered from all parts of the world go to show that we have done what our honorable friends opposite desire, and now they think that we should do something more. They wish to be more than liberal and generous to a man who is given protection under the law at the expense of every taxpayer in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I join with those who hope the Minister will see his way to agree to the motion. I know that the honorable senator believed that to accept such amendments as are proposed would not be in the best interest's of the Commonwealth. But perhaps the facts which have been submitted to the Senate since he spoke have been such as have induced him to change his mind on the subject. He should know that there can be no possible harm done by permitting the proposed amendments to be considered in Committee. I know of nothing which is of more importance to the general wellbeing of the community than that those who are possessed of inventive genius and capacity should be given every opportunity to secure patents for their inventions at the lowest possible cost. I think that it must be of advantage to the Commonwealth to enable inventors to secure patents for their inventions as cheaply as possible. Honorable senators who have referred to the high fees charged in other countries have not been able, so far as I could see, to show that there are any substantial objections to the very low fees charged in the United States. We know that no country in the world has derived greater advantage from the operation of its patent laws than has the United States, and the patent fees there are the lowest in the world. I again ask the Minister whether, after hearing the debate on the motion, he cannot see his way to consent to have the proposed amendments considered in Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the request to the Minister to let this matter be considered in Committee. I am as anxious as is any member of the Senate that the Government Departments shall pay their way. We can accept the Minister's assurance that he desires to conserve the revenue, but there is something to be said on the other side, and we can better consider the details of the matter in Committee. If it can be shown that by the adoption of the proposed amendments the revenue of the Department would be seriously affected, we need not agree to them; but if it is shown that the revenue will not be affected, the success of the operation of the patent laws of America must justify a favorable consideration of the amendments. Nothing can be lost by giving honorable senators an opportunity to consider the honorable senator's proposal in Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to ask the Minister whether there is any particular reason for making this clause retrospective. To do so may affect some rights which have already been acquired. I think this is a dangerous provision. I have no objection to the Commissioner being given the powers asked for in this clause from the time of the passing of the Bill, but he should not be given the power to demand fees, possibly from some one who was in no way responsible for their non-payment in the first instance. </para>

                            <para>- It affects fees as well as costs. It refers to " any sum ordered by the Commissioner to be paid as costs," and that may be held to cover the list of fees to which I have already referred. In connexion with the registration of a patent, the Commissioner may have ordered the payment of a certain sum as costs. The costs may not have been paid, and in the meantime the patent may have changed hands three or four times. Under this clause the Commissioner, in such a case, would be given power to demand the payment of the costs from some one who was in no way responsible for them. </para>

Under section 14 of the principal Act the Commissioner may do a number of things. For instance, he may summon witnesses, receive evidence upon oath, and require the production of documents. After a hearing he may award costs against any party to any proceeding before him. But it has transpired that whilst the Commissioner is able to award costs, no machinery has been provided for the purpose of enforcing their payment. This Bill supplies that omission. Surely there can be no reasonable objection urged to such a provision. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. My. honorable friend objects to sub-clause 2, which makes the operation of this provision retrospective. But I would point out to him that the clause merely provides machinery for enforcing the payment of debts under orders which are already in existence. It does not retrospectively impose any liability upon anybody. It merely enforces payment to-day on the part of the individual who was liable yesterday - a payment which could not previously be enforced, owing to the absence of the necessary machinery. By retaining the clause in its present form, no injustice will be done to anybody. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators will recollect that upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill I spoke at considerable length upon this clause, and, with their permission, I would like to call attention to some statements which I then made. I do so in the hope that Ministers will afterwards see their way to allow progress to be reported, so as to permit of further time being devoted to the consideration of this provision. Upon the occasion to which I have alluded, I pointed out that in this matter a wide difference exists between the position occupied by Australia and that occupied by the Mother Country. Now, we all know that Great Britain stands at the head of the world's manufacturing countries, and I have no complaint to urge because the Parliament of the United Kingdom has decreed that patents granted within its borders must, within a prescribed time, be worked there. I admit, however, that I am not satisfied as to the wisdom of the adoption of that course, and I am quite certain that it will not be in the interests of Australia if we decide to adopt a similar course. In speaking upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I called the attention of honorable senators to the position occupied by the United States in this connexion. I showed that an agreement has practically been completed between that country and Germany under which manufacture in either country will be regarded as sufficient. Consequently, patentees who have been granted patent rights in either of those countries  will not be required to work their inventions within the country which has issued those patent rights. In this connexion, I desire to again read a communication which was recently received by a leading firm of patent agents in Australia, from Washington. It is as follows :  - </para>

                    <para>In compliance with the request contained in your letter of 4th May, for information relative to arrangements entered into between the United States and Germany, in regard to the working of patents in such countries, I am sending you herewith a copy of the treaty which has been negotiated and which has received the approval of both the German Reichstag and the United States Senate. It awaits formal ratification by the exchange of copies by diplomatic officials and the proclamation of the  President,  before it will become effective. </para>
                    <para>I understand that efforts are being made to negotiate such treaties with all countries whose Patent Laws contain requirements as to manufacture. It is to be regretted that Great Britain rejected all such proposals, and it is not impossible that some retaliatory legislation will be adopted here in the near future. In fact, numerous Bills have been introduced into Congress, and it has only been by the determined efforts that at least one of these Bills has not become a law. The whole difficulty appears to have been stirred up by the recently-enacted British law. </para>

Such a law would be the laughing stock of the world. In view of the sparse population of Australia, and of its lack of development in all sorts of directions, I think that a provision under which patent rights would be revoked, unless the patented article or process is manufactured or carried on within the Commonwealth within a certain period, would be eminently undesirable, however desirable it might be forty or fifty years hence. I hope that the Committee will reject the clause. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be seen that on revision I have practically met the objections which were taken by honorable senators to my proposal in its original form. What I now propose is to make the charge up to the time of sealing £5, and the renewal fee £8. I do not propose to alter the total amount of the charges payable to the office, but merely to make things easier for an inventor up to the time of sealing. To <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> I am indebted for a copy of <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Official Journal of Patents.</inline> It contains a scale of fees, which covers a full page, and which is not to be found in the Act at all, because it was made under the power to frame regulations. Some of these fees take effect before sealing, so that the schedule to this Bill does not disclose the real facts. For instance, on an application to amend a specification before sealing - a thing which frequently has to be done - a fee of £2 is payable. A fee of  5s. is charged for correcting a clerical error before sealing. Again, if an applicant asks for an enlargement of time to give a complete specification, if not exceeding one month, the fee is £1, if not exceeding two months it is £2, and if not exceeding three months it is ,£3. All this money has to be paid before the patent is sealed. After sealing, and before renewal, there is a scale of fees which may be charged for doing various things. Probably the Minister will say that not so many patents are renewed as are sealed, and that, therefore, a fee of .£8 is not an equivalent to the office. I submit that if that fee is not regarded as sufficient, it should be made even higher. My contention is that we ought not to collect revenue from inventors up to the time of sealing. On the contrary, we ought to encourage them up to that time, in order to enable them to get their patents on to the market. I feel sure that the Minister, though naturally inclined to adhere to his Bill, is in sympathy with my proposition. He certainly cannot say that, if adopted, it would make a serious inroad on the revenue. I may add that I have dropped the amendment of the opposition fee. </para>

I pointed out that, with the exception of one or two countries, Australia makes the lowest charge in the world. For £13 we are now doing what other countries charge as high as £250 for doing.

                            <para>- That may be so. I have explained that the large revenue for 1905-6 and 1906-7 was due to the large number of accumulated sealings of applications filed in previous years, and also to the proclamation of the Commonwealth Trade Marks Act ; and that the large revenue for 1907-8 was accounted for by reason of the same state of affairs regarding the issue of trade-mark certificates. In 1904-5, we returned to the States £5&gt;38&lt;5; in i9°5-6» -£6,388; in 1906-7, £4,700; in 1907-8, £2,973; and in 1908-9, £1,739. It is only now that we have arrived at normal conditions in the office1, and the estimated', deficiency for this year is, I repeat, £2,703. Haying regard to the exceedingly low fees which are charged, we are not justified, I submit, in incurring an additional loss. Under the original proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the annual loss was estimated at nearly £4,000, and that, together with the estimated deficit for this year, would mean a total loss of £6,648. My honorable friend now proposes to reduce the sealing fee by £3, and to increase the renewal fee to £8. That would not go far towards making up the annual deficit. As a matter of fact, we have not received a renewal fee, because the Act has not been in operation long enough. The number of sealings averages 1,315, and the proposed reduction of the fee would involve a loss °f £3&gt;945- In consideration of that loss, . my honorable friend proposes to increase the renewal fee by £3. We cannot say how many patents are likely to be renewed ; but the proposed fee would not by any. means compensate for the yearly loss which we should suffer in other directions. </para>

                            <para>- That is all problematical. My honorable friend will surely see that we are not justified in throwing away in a light and airy fashion nearly £6,000. Having regard to the total fee which was charged in Australia prior to the Federation, and the high fees which are now charged in other countries, I contend that honorable senators will not be justified in reducing the sealing fee. When the office is carried on at a profit, if that stage should be reached, it will surely be time enough for proposing a reduction in the fees. </para>

                            <para>- That is what is done, as a matter of fact. Something has been stated about additional fees. I am told that in one case, the only one of its kind in over  14,700  cases lodged, and presenting very unusual features, the amount in fees was the largest ever paid in any one case, the cost to the applicant and opponents being£15 and  £9  respectively. In this three oppositions were lodged to the grant of letters patent. I think that what is proposed really means a substantial loss, to which, at this juncture, we are not justified in consenting. </para>

                        <para>.- I trust that the  Chairman  will put the proposed new clause to the Committee in two parts, so that those who are in favour of the reduction of the fees up to sealing may be able to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment, whilst, at the same time, being free to vote for or against an increased fee for renewal. The Minister has tried to impress us with the idea that the fees charged in the Commonwealth are cheap, as compared with those in other countries. I do not deny that. In New Zealand, the fees amount to  £17 10s.,  and, in England, to  £100.  But they are divided in such a way as not to bear very heavily upon a man who has taken out his patent. If the fees up to sealing are reduced, I am prepared to vote for an increase of the renewal fee. America is the only country in the world that charges no fee for the renewal of a patent. Why that should be so, I do not know. I should be prepared to vote for a renewal fee of  £10,  or even  £12,  which I think would be quite reasonable, but we should certainly make the initial fees as low as possible. </para>

Of course, it is very nice to move to reduce fees. The member of Parliament who votes for such a proposition is likely to get himself a very good name. He may be called a "jolly good fellow," and so forth. But we must have regard to things as they are, and I feel that tha </para>

                    <para class="block">Commonwealth cannot afford' the loss that would be involved in these amendments. It appears that the proportion of patents renewed to the number granted under the State Acts was about 20 per cent. If all the patents issued were renewed, or if even 70 or 80 per cent. of them were renewed, I could understand the position of those honorable senators who urge that the loss involved in reducing the initial fees could be made up by increasing the renewal fees. But the revenue derived from renewals is not likely to be large. We should, therefore, do well to wait for a year or two, and see how the Act works. If it be found that the office is worked at a profit, I am sure that the Government would not desire that state of things to continue. It is merely desired that the Patent Office shall cover expenses, and we should even be prepared for a small loss. But in these matters I prefer to trust the authorities in charge, and we ought not to rush into reductions without knowing how they will operate. We should be wise to follow the Government in this matter. </para>

                        has said as to the percentage of renewals emphasizes the necessity of keeping the sealing fee as low as possible. I was not previously aware that such an enormous proportion of patents were not renewed. My honorable friend tells us that 80 per cent. are not renewed. If that be the case, it affords the strongest argument for making the fees on application as low as possible. The figures seem to me to show that the object of the patent law in encouraging people to make inventions is operating very strongly. We want it to operate strongly. It is operating strongly because, for every patent that is renewed, four are not, being, I presume, failures. The great object which we have in view is to tempt people to exert their intelligence and their inventive faculties in order that their patents may be made successful. Therefore,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl'</inline>
                        s argument is really a strong plea for the reduction of the preliminary fees. I was somewhat startled when the Minister urged that we could not rely upon the renewal fees, because, in respect of State patents, they had to be returned to the States. I ventured to take exception to that remark. My honorable friend then quoted, section 19, paragraph
                        <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline>
                        of the Patents Act 1903. Now, I venture to point out that that provision gives, so far as I can see, no express authority for the payment of renewal fees to the States. Every one of these renewal fees, with respect to patents granted by States, is apparently paid under the Commonwealth Act. " Section 19 provides that -

The money paid on renewal, and which has been collected with respect to State patents, would appear to be Commonwealth revenue. If such fees have been returned to the States, it looks like throwing away the Commonwealth revenue. The very definition of a patent supports my contention. A patent means - </para>

                            <para>- On renewal the patent is granted by the Commonwealth. Section  19A  referred to by the Minister does not warrant the payment to the State. I am in favour of an increase of the renewal fee. I consider it perfectly legitimate to increase that fee. If a patent is worth renewing, it might be worth the patentee's while to pay a substantial fee for its renewal. I can understand that it might be well worth while to renew certain patents at a cost of hundreds of pounds. </para>

                        BEST (Victoria - Minister of Trade and Customs)  [4.44].  - The Commissioner tells me that, taking last year -  1908-9  - in connexion with receipts under administration of the State Acts, as required by section  190  of the Patent Act  1903,  there was returned to the States a gross sum of £1,739;a large proportion of that amount was for renewals. I cannot now give further particulars, but I shall only be too glad to have the figures taken out, in order to show what proportion of the gross amount is covered by renewal fees.

                        SYMON (South Australia)  [4.45].  - I am obliged to my honorable friend for the information. Of course, I cannot expect him to analyze the figures now. I do not wish to enlarge upon that particular matter. I would suggest to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                        that he should be satisfied with a reduction of the  £5  fee to  £2,  and then accept
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray's</inline>
                        suggestion to increase the renewal fee to  £12.  I think that would be a fair adjustment. To reduce the fee paid since the Act came into operation by  £3  would be to reduce it by more than half. If it is reduced by  £2  the fee will then be  £3,  and I may tell honorable senators that probably that is about the usual fee for the parchment document with the incidental trouble connected with it. With a fee of  £5  we should have charges up to the sealing amounting to  £6,  as against the United States charge of  £7 3s. 9d.  I am strongly in favour of the reduction of the present fee, which I think is exorbitant, and the Minister's reasons against the proposed reduction, on the ground of the expense of administration, are not convincing, to my mind.

                        to increase the fee for the renewal of patents will not have the desired effect. With the exception of one or two countries, the renewal fees which are charged in other parts of the world are very large indeed. In the Mother Country the fee is £95, and in Germany, it is £257. If the object of the amendment is to make good the revenue which we have sacrificed under the new clause of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                        it will scarcely achieve its purpose, seeing that renewal fees can be charged only once in every seven years.

                            <para>- I scarcely think that is so. When an inventor has had three, five, or seven years' experience of his patent, he must know whether or not it has a commercial value. Having regard to the fact that the renewal fees in other countries are so much larger than our own, and that our Patent Office must be made to pay its way, I would suggest that the charge in this connexion should be increased to £15, payable in two instalments of £7 10s. each, at the end of the fourth and seventh year after the patent rights have been issued. </para>

                            <para>- If the Committee will agree to make the fee £15, it will be a very low one, even then. I am merely anxious to give effect to the desire of honorable senators to make the Office pay its way. I am sure that it cannot be made to pay its way if we charge only  £12  for the renewal fee. It is idle to suggest that the increased number of applicants will make good the loss of revenue which we must sustain as the result of our action this afternoon. At present, 1,315 applications for patents are sealed annually, and the Commonwealth will incur a loss of  £2  upon each of these. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia) [5.2]. - My honorable friend, the Minister of Trade and Customs, has put his view before the Committee very clearly. But I appeal to honorable senators not to sanction such a large increase in the renewal fee as he has suggested. We must pay some regard to the applicants whose applications are now going through the Patent Office. I would rather see the renewal fee fixed at£10, which would be equivalent to an increase of  100  per cent.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline>
                        however, has suggested that it should be £12, and as he has had more practical experience of business than I have had, I am prepared to vote for that amount. But I am not willing to increase the fee by  200  per cent All the statements which have been made by the Minister of Trade and Customs in regard to the loss which the Commonwealth will sustain, consequent upon the reduction of our patent fees, are merely in the nature of conjecture. We ought not to levy an increased tax of  200  per cent. upon inventors whose applications for patents are now passing through the Patent Office.

                    <para class="block">The next clause vests in the Minister power to erect lighthouses, to alter or remove lighthouses or marine marks, and to vary the character of any lighthouses, or the manner cf exhibiting lights therein. In passing this Bill I hold that we should be absolutely abrogating the powers conferred on us by the Constitution. That charter of government affirms that the Commonwealth shall take over the control of lighthouses. In moving the second reading of this Bill, the Minister of Trade and Customs told us that the Government had despatched an officer of the Commonwealth to the various States for the purpose of discussing the subject-matter of this Bill with the officers of those States. He further informed us that as the result of the inquiries by that officer, a schedule had been framed of the lighthouses which the States wish to retain, and of those which they desire to hand over to the Commonwealth. I do not think that the framers of the Constitution contemplated any such position. It is in the interests of Australia that its lighthouses, beacons, and buoys should be placed under one supreme control. But that is exactly what the Government do not propose to do. The only inference which can be drawn from this Bill is that the States will retain some lighthouses, beacons, buoys, and lightships. Paragraph  6  of clause  8  says - </para>

Consequently, a very grave condition of affairs may arise. For instance, if the Commonwealth decides to erect a lighthouse alongside a State light, and orders the removal of the latter, the State authorities may please themselves as to whether they comply with that order. </para>

The Bill does not provide that only certain lights shall be taken over. If the term cannot be defined, the better plan would be for the Government to tell us what arrangements have been made with regard to the lights to be taken over. We are told that a schedule of such lights has been prepared, and I contend that the Senate ought to have been supplied with that information. We should not abrogate our right under the Constitution, but should control all the lights on the coast. </para>

                            <para>- Every light. We are asked to institute a system of dual control. That means that the Commonwealth will have to maintain vessels right round the coast for the purpose of attending to lighthouses, lightships, buoys, and beacons, and each State will have to maintain a Department for the purpose of looking after those left under its control. That will introduce an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and, of course, it will double the necessary cost. If we are to take over 120 lights, I presume that we shall have to take over the staffs of 120 lights. We shall leave some staffs with the State, and that will probably stop promotion to a number of men. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the rub with me, but it is a point which I think should be considered. The Bill does not indicate what is intended to be done with the men. It does not indicate whether they are to be taken over and placed in the Public Service, or whether they are to be casual employes of the Commonwealth. I intend to vote against the second reading, because I do not see how it is possible to make the Bill satisfactory to the country, and I hope that honorable senators will follow my example. </para>

I am surprised at the Government bringing in a half measure which may not be availed of to its fullest extent by a timorous Government, such as themselves, in exercising their powers under the Constitution. This Parliament is invested with clear and distinct authority to take over lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard an honorable senator ask whether the Commonwealth is going to take over the lighthouses which are in the vicinity of harbors or under the control of harbor authorities. That would be a very fine line to draw. Unquestionably, we have the right to take over lightships. I have never seen a lightship except in the vicinity of a harbor or  within a harbor. The same remark applies to beacons and buoys. Surely it is not the duty of the Government to submit a half measure when asking the Parliament to exercise a legislative power under the Constitution ? </para>

                            <para>- We have a Fusion Government, which is prepared to go on to the loan market t? finance any scheme which they favour. I object to the language of clause 5 of this Bill, because it gives to the Commonwealth Government an option to take over only those lighthouses, beacons, and buoys which a State Government are satisfied to concede to it. That is a wrong principle to adopt. If Ave say that the State Governments shall be consulted', they will only allow to pass to our control those lighthouses, beacons, and buoy's which are the most expensive ones to keep in order. The same thing has happened in the administration of the Postal Department. The law provides that some isolated post-offices may administer the Savings Banks of the States. The States avail themselves of that provision to the extent of allowing the most expensive branches of that institution to be carried on at the cost of the Commonwealth; but wherever a great saving can be effected by the use of their own officers in populous centres, they run their own Savings Banks. I believe that if clause 5 is passed in its present form, the States are likely to shoulder on to the Commonwealth, so to speak, only those lighthouses which are so situated as to involve a heavy expenditure for maintenance and repair. It is quite clear from the language of the Bill that the intention of the Commonwealth Government is not to take over all lighthouses, beacons, and buoys. Clause 8 provides that if the owner of any marine mark, or of any lamp or light, fails to do so and so, certain penalties shall fall upon him. It clearly implies that, after the measure has been passed, owners of some lights, beacons, and buoys will still exist. Clearly there will be divided control in the management of our lighthouses, beacons, and buoys. Why should we be asked to pass a half -measure when unquestionably we have authority to take over all these services and maintain them efficiently ? </para>

                            <para>- The Constitution places no limitation upon the legislative power of the Commonwealth in that regard. We should not allow the Bill to pass without entering a strong protest. If it were passed in a form to empower the Government to take over all lighthouses, beacons, and buoys, it would be a perfect measure. There is another peculiarity about this half-digested Bill. It provides that ships deriving a benefit from marine marks by being warned off dangerous places shall pay a certain sum to the Commonwealth. How is a clear distinction to be drawn between the amount which will be properly due to the Commonwealth and that which will be payable to private individuals or to States? </para>

                            <para>- Yes. For instance, if along a given coast there is a Commonwealth light at one point, and a State light at another, is the owner of a ship to be called upon to say whether he obtained most benefit from the Commonwealth or the State light? It will be a mistake to have divided control as to a service which should be in charge of one authority. This measure is utterly unlike the Quarantine Act. When the Federal Parliament was passing that measure, it took power to apply quarantine in its ' fullest sense within the limits of the Commonwealth. There was no half, measure to the effect that quarantine should be applied to persons and not to plants and animals. There was no qualification whatever. It was declared that the Quarantine Act should come into operation on a certain date, and there was no restriction as to the class of objects to. which it should apply. Why depart from that principle in this instance, by allowing the Government to take over only a portion of the lights, beacons, and buoys around our coast? </para>

In another portion of the Bill, clause 8. there is a trace of remarkable tenderness on the part of the Government towards a State owning any beacon, buoy, or lighthouse, which fails to do certain things. There is a penalty; but if the owner happens to be a State Government it is entirely exempt from the penalty.

                            <para>-I do not see a reason for differentiating between two classes of owners. What is proposed is entirely anomalous. If a State Government is to be allowed to refuse to take any notice of what the Federal Government requires, where does the Federal authority come in ? If the owner of a beacon or buoy happens to be a subordinate authority, it has to obey whatever requirements are made by the Federal Government. But if the owner happens to be a State Government, it is entirely exempt from penalty, and can simply say, "We have your notice, but we fail to recognise the utility of it, and therefore we entirely ignore it." This seems to me to be a most unreasonable anomaly, and I trust that it will not be agreed to. I am sorry that the measure has been produced in so crude a state. Evidently it has not been well digested. There appears to me to be a clear intention on the part of the Government not to carry out the powers intrusted to us by the Constitution. </para>

One would have thought, hearing my honorable friends, that such words had never been heard of before in Federal legislation.

                    <para class="block">That section was inserted in the Quarantine Act because it was recognised that there were difficulties in connexion with the taking over of quarantine stations. At the present moment I am making arrangements with the States for the purpose of taking over various quarantine stations. It is, therefore, clear that the words which have given such a great shock to my honorable friends opposite, with regard to lighthouses, follow a well-established precedent. Again, it was competent for us, under the terms of the Constitution, to take over matters relating to astronomical and meteorological observations. What did we do in that case? We entered into an arrangement with the States, using exactly the same words, and providing for the Governor-General entering into an arrangement with the Governor of any State for the purpose of taking over meteorological stations. Under the Census and Statistics Act we did precisely the same thing. The case of lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys is exactly on all fours with those other cases. </para>

The States have, from time to time, requested us to take them over. If we issued a proclamation in the usual way, it would mean a considerably increased expense; because, as honorable senators can understand, there are certain harbor lights under the control of harbor boards and other authorities, and there are certain lights in rivers which are attended to by officers discharging other duties than merely looking after the lights in question. There is also a difficulty on account of the fact that there was no special Department in some States for controlling these matters.

                            <para>- It is necessary to do so. The question arises as to which lights would come under the proclamation. The matter was discussed at three or four Conferences, and after consultation with the State authorities it was agreed that the Commonwealth should take over the coastal lights, and for the present leave the harbor and river and channel beacon lights and buoys to continue under the control of the State authorities. In these circumstances the clause to which I have referred was prepared, and a section similar to it appears in half-a-dozen of our Acts. We take power to enter into arrangements with the various State Governments as to the lights to be taken over. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston</inline> was sent to the several States to discuss which lights it was desirable should be taken over, and if, in Committee, honorable senators desire to know which particular lights are to be taken over in each of the States.I shall be prepared to submit a list which has been made out. But I wish honorable senators to understand that it is not a final list. It has been prepared for a tentative purpose, and meets tentatively with the approval of the State authorities. The actual lights to be taken over will be the subject of subsequent arrangement, but the list which has been prepared will sufficiently indicate the character of the lights in each State which are to be taken over. </para>

                            <para>- They will, of course, be transferred properties in the usual way under the Constitution. The State Governments are willing that these lights should be transferred to the Commonwealth, and we are willing to take them over. It is thought that harbor or channel and river lights can be more conveniently managed and maintained by the State authorities under existing conditions. </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly what the State Governments will desire to do, and it is natural and proper that they should do so. I hope that the State Governments will be animated by the same desire as the Federal Government, to charge only the actual cost of upkeep, and probably something in addition to provide for a sinking fund to meet the cost of construction of lighthouses. It is estimated that the cost of maintaining some 120 lighthouses proposed to be taken over will be something like £60,000 per year. We have to ascertain the cost of maintenance of the lights we take over, and we have power to levy fees, for services rendered, on ships passing or deriving benefit from any lights or marine mark to recoup the expense to which we are put in maintaining the lights. Under the head of light dues; harbor dues, tonnage dues, and so on, the various State Governments now levy fees for the maintenance of lights and marine marks, and as we shall be relieving them of an expenditure of about £60,000 per year they will, no doubt, in their desire to encourage shipping, remit the dues they now charge to the extent of the liability of which we shall relieve them. I submit that there could not be a fairer "or more reasonable arrangement. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We have full power to do that if a State light interferes with a Commonwealth light, or if, in our opinion, it interferes with navigation. Taking the extreme case of friction or difficulty arising with a State Government in this connexion, all we should have to do would be to issue a proclamation, and then we could take over the whole of the lights. My honorable friends will see that they have quite misconceived the design and object of the Bill, and that the Commonwealth will have the fullest protection under it. </para>

                            <para>- It is very proper far the State Governments to hand over to the Commonwealth the ocean lights, which are the .most expensive to maintain. We shall not suffer in any way, because we shall levy light dues to recoup the expense of maintaining the lights we take over. There might be some objection if this were a matter of taxation, but the dues levied will be merely charges for services rendered, and, as I have said, we have a right to expect that the State Governments will remit the dues to the extent of the liability of which we relieve them. </para>

                        <para>. - I know that it is intended to take over the light at Cape Moreton. There are three other lights, within a few miles of each other, on Moreton Island, but the Government propose to have nothing whatever to do with them. Thus the question of a divided control will arise. At the present time all the men engaged on the four lighthouses in question are in the employ of the Queensland Government. But if the Commonwealth takes over only one of those lights, the position will be that the men engaged in that lighthouse will be Federal servants, whereas those employed in the other lighthouses will be State servants. I would further point out that, whilst it has been the practice hitherto for one vessel to carry stores to those lighthouses, under this Bill two will be required. I cannot understand how the measure will operate, except in the way of increasing expenditure. Apparently the only lights which the Government propose to take over are those which can be seen from the ocean. There is a light at Caloundra, another at Double Island Point, and a third at Fraser's Island. Are these the only lights in Queensland which the Government propose to take over? I ask the Minister to supply us with a list of the lights on the Queensland coast over which the Commonwealth intends to assume control. </para>

Therefore, it may fairly be assumed that the fullest advantage will be taken of local opportunities for working those lights. </para>

In connexion with quarantine matters, we propose to take over all those officers who are exclusively engaged on quarantine work. In precisely the same way we intend to take over those officers who are associated with the working of the lights over which we intend to assume control. I wish honorable senators distinctly to understand that I am not bound in any. way by the list of lights which I am about to submit as representing those which the Commonwealth proposes to take over. But in Queensland those lights are - Cape Moreton, Double Island Point, Sandy Cape, Lady Elliot Island, Bustard Head,' Cape Capricorn, North Reef, Pine Islet, Flat Top Island, Dent Island, Cape Bowling -Green, Cape Cleveland, North Barnard Island, Low Island, Archer Point, Rocky Islet, Grassy Hill, Pipon Island, Claremont Island Lightship, Piper Island Lightship, Goode Island, Booby Island. </para>

In the case which has been cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> one set of officers will be called upon to keep a particular lighthouse in a state of efficiency whilst another set of officers will render similar service to each of three other lighthouses. The adoption of such a system must inevitably result in gross extravagance. The lights in places like Hobson's Bay, Corio Bay, and Port Jackson should be under one control. </para>

                    <para>The arrangement which I propose would suit both the State and Commonwealth authorities. It would certainly make for economy, and for maintaining in a state of efficiency all the marine marks around our coast. Under the Bill in its present form there will be a divided control over lights used in Moreton Bay and presumably over lights used in Hobson's Bay. It is not a thing which should be allowed by the Bill. I have therefore submitted an amendment to exclude marine marks which are within rivers or on river banks, because they can be easily controlled and kept in order with shore appliances. Steamers will have to be employed to attend to the lighthouses, beacons, and buoys, under the Common wealth, and other vessels will have to be employed to attend to those under State control. My object in moving the amendment is to remove the possibility of dispute or friction hereafter, and to delineate as nearly as possible the spheres of action of the States and the Commonwealth with regard to marine marks. </para>

I assume that the Bill embodies practically an arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States, and that at all times it will be possible for the former to take over, should experience demonstrate the necessity, any particular harbor lights. We need not trouble about leaving with the States authority regarding harbor lights. Nor do I see any particular reason why any honorable senator should be anxious to withdraw such authority. </para>

                        is acting very unwisely. This Bill represents practically an arrangement with the States. There is a reasonable understanding with the States as to which lights should be taken over. But the honorable senator desires the Commonwealth to take over all lights except those in rivers or on river banks. In other words, he wants to lead the Commonwealth into the very trouble which we are seeking to avoid.  His  amendment would compel the Government to take over all harbor lights, and lights under the control of various State authorities except the lights in rivers and on river banks. We should be called upon to determine where a river commenced, what lights were on the river and which of them were associated with that river alone.

                        <para>. - I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that this is a permissive Bill. It has been introduced in consequence of an arrangement having been made by the Commonwealth with the State Governments and Marine Boards to take over certain lights, some of which have been named. The honorable senator wants the Commonwealth to take over harbor lights. Take, for instance, Hobart. Under the Bill the Commonwealth proposes to take over the Derwent light, which is located at the mouth of the River Derwent, but not to take over any of the lights in the river up to Hobart, because they are not ocean lights. I take it that the proposal of the Ministry, and the desire of honorable senators generally, is to take over only ocean lights. That will provide a fair field for Federal control, and where no dispute is likely to arise between the Commonwealth and a State. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that he ought not to press his amendment. I notice that clause 8 empowers the Commonwealth to take over marine marks in rivers, or, indeed, anywhere. </para>

I regard this Bill as only part and parcel of a navigation law. When we take control of navigation, we shall be responsible for leading lights, marks, and buoys in all navigable rivers. If the Commonwealth is to be responsible for the navigation of a ship in narrow waters, surely it should also be responsible for laying down the buoys and beacons to guide the ship, and for the control of the pilots. The advice which the Minister will get about laying down new buoys and erecting beacons and lighthouses will come from Commonwealth servants, and not from State servants. The Government did good work in trying to come to an arrangement with the States as to the lights to be taken over. But I think that they should now go one step farther, and say that, inasmuch as the Commonwealth will be responsible for navigation in every navigable water, it should also be responsible for the lights to guide navigators. </para>

                            <para>- Why not? When the Navigation Bill is passed, the Commonwealth Government will exercise control over every man employed on a ship which is trading on any one of those rivers. We are to have control of the waterways, but not of the marks and beacons placed, or to be placed, thereon. This partial legislation ought to be held over until it can be considered more fully. Lighthouses are dealt with in the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act. The Minister has stated that, in regard to lighthouses, no doubt the Commonwealth will work in conjunction with the States. So far as quarantine is concerned, the Commonwealth has no officers, except the employes at the quarantine station in a State. The health officers are State officers working for the Commonwealth. If this Bill is left in its present form, it will be necessary for the States to maintain a fleet of ships to look after their lighthouses, and the Commonwealth will have either to enter into contracts with the States to maintain and provision Federal lighthouses, or to procure a fleet of ships, in which case Commonwealth ships and State vessels would be called upon to go over almost the same water. I object to the lighthouses being placed under divided control. It is just as necessary for the Commonwealth to take full control over lights, beacons, and buoys in rivers as it is to take control over the navigation of ships therein. If this Bill is passed as it stands, we shall have this peculiar position, that, while the Commonwealth will be responsible for determining the side of a channel on which a ship shall go, it will have no control over the buoys which indicate the position of that channel. I hope that honorable senators, will recognise the necessity of the  Chairman  being moved out of the Chair, so that the whole subject may be dealt with in a fresh Bill. </para>

Therefore, we ought to allow this proposal to pass and be content to learn from experience. </para>

                        <para>- It is an absolute fact, and no gibe can get rid of it. The intention is to deprive the Judge of the power of exercising his discretion if he wishes to obtain the assistance of counsel. It is frequently stated by honorable senators opposite that members of the legal profession belong to what they choose to call a " union." It is rather significant that the supporters of one kind of unionism are opposed to competent members of unions of another kind appearing before a Court established under Commonwealth law. Another point to be remembered is that owing to the relations between the Commonwealth and the States in industrial affairs important questions of law will necessarily arise with regard to which the Court will have jurisdiction. These questions, of a purely legal and technical nature, should be laid before the Court in the most competent manner possible, by trained counsel. </para>

                        <para>- We can deal with matters of that kind when they are properly brought under our notice. It must be within the knowledge of every member of the Committee that over and over again Judges of the highest eminence - even the Law Lords in England - call upon parties to provide counsel in order that the Court may have the benefit of hearing argument on questions of law. We are now building up a system of law affecting Constitutional relations in industrial matters between the States and the Commonwealth. In these cases, there are practically no legal precedents. We are laying down the law for the first time. Yet it is proposed to deprive the Court of the opportunity of hearing arguments from competent counsel. When the original Bill was under discussion, Parliament had cognisance of the fact that Constitutional questions would arise, and it was considered advisable to relieve litigants of the cost of employing counsel ; but it was also distinctly understood that if the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, in the exercise of his discretion, required the assistance of counsel, he should not be deprived of that aid. What reason is there why the law should be amended in this respect? Why should we cast any reflection on the  President  of the Court in this manner? As no sufficient reason has been given for withdrawing from the  President  the power to exercise this discretion, and as <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> the Court and the parties appearing before it should have the right to secure the assistance of counsel, I shall resist the amendment. We know enough of the history of the Court to be able to say that the  President  is not a man who would saddle litigants with unnecessary expense. No doubt nine-tenths of the questions coming before the Court will be questions of fact on which the parties will be able to assist the Court to a sound decision. But on questions in connexion with which the  President  as interpreter of the Constitution might require the assistance of counsel, we have no right to tie his hands. </para>

Upon that occasion he pointed out that the scope of the measure exceeded the powers vested in this Parliament by the Constitution. I do not know what view he takes of the matter now, because events which have since transpired may have modified his opinion. But not only does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> not propose to limit the provisions of the Bill - he actually proposes to enlarge them. </para>

                    <para>- No; that deals with another matter. The scope of the Bill, I repeat, is not confined to foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, but, of course its operations in that regard could be limited. In the second place, there is no demand for a measure of this kind at the present time. It contains a principle which is not only new and experimental, but also most debatable. The principle has not yet been incorporated in any companies law in Australia, and is unknown to British companies legislation; and, as I have said, it is largely experimental. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That quotation goes to prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> who, as a representative of the Government, holds a leading position in this Chamber, held a very decided opinion last year regarding the constitutionality of this Bill, and of the clause which we are now discussing. But instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> endeavouring to bring its provisions within the limits of the Constitution, he proposes to make its constitutionality still more questionable. That being so, before we proceed to debate the merits or demerits of the clause itself, we are entitled to some explanation from the honorable senator - who, I presume, has fortified himself with authorities on this question - as to the constitutionality of the Bill. </para>

                            proposes to extend the principle of this Bill to any company, thus making it, from my stand-point, much more objectionable than it was in its original form.

In speaking upon this matter last year,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                            pointed out that the chief danger to be apprehended from the Bill was that under the legal definition of " net profits " any company might use the funds of its clients to relieve itself of its liabilities.

                        <para>- I propose to debate the amendment with a view to showing the evil which may result from extending the provisions of the Bill, and I intend to continue in that vein until I am ruled out of order. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> definition of " net profits" be correct, what will be the effect of agreeing to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment? We shall enable any number of ephemeral adventurers who may choose to come together, either in an insurance company, a banking company, or even a trust company, to start operations with a vast uncalled capital, and perhaps a paid-up capital amounting to little or nothing, and we shall allow them to relieve themselves of their liabilities out of their clients' moneys. Is not that a most dangerous thing to allow ? Possibly there might not be any danger if this legislation were applied to a very stable financial corporation like the Bank of New South Wales, the Bank of Australasia, or another bank of similar standing. But by extending the operation of the Bill to all companies, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> now suggests, we should allow its most dangerous feature to be made use of by the most suspected persons in the Commonwealth. In Australia we have had instances in which responsible companies, such as insurance companies, have got together with no capital, except what was sufficient to furnish a two-roomed office, and provide a bottle of ink and blotting pad, and a chair or two. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause sets out that the Bill is to cover, not merely banks, but all companies. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to consider whether that is not outside the constitutional power of the Commonwealth, as laid down by the High Court in the recent case of Huddart Parker and Co. Generally speaking, that decision was to the effect that the Commonwealth had no jurisdiction over companies or corporations doing purely domestic business. When the Bill was last before the Senate I assumed that it dealt solely with banks, and to that extent might have come within paragraph  xiii.  of section  51  of the Constitution, which deals with banking. But from this interpretation clause it is quite clear that all companies are intended to be included. I do not propose to submit an amendment, but merely invite my honorable friend to consider the point I have raised. I do not suggest that we should postpone the consideration of the Bill, but that we should proceed until we reach a stage when, if necessary, the Bill could be recommitted for the purpose of recasting this provision. </para>

                    <para>.- I think it well that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> should make further inquiry as to the constitutionality of any legislation we might pass in regard to any company formed in a State. If the operation of the Bill is confined strictly to banking companies, it is perhaps more than likely that we have jurisdiction over them in that capacity. But if it is to operate on any company in a State, for whatever purpose it may have been formed, I think it is highly questionable whether it would be constitutional. </para>

I am very pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has agreed to postpone the consideration of the clause so that it may be further examined. I hope that he will come to the conclusion if he can that the Bill, if it is to become law, should be confined strictly to carrying out the objects which he has in view, and should not go beyond those objects. I believe that by-and-by a Commonwealth Government will have to introduce comprehensive banking legislation.

                    <para>. - I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that unless he has satisfied himself as to what the correct definition of "Joint Stock Company " ought to be it would be better to allow the proposed new clause to stand in that regard than to alter it as now proposed. If the word "Banking" is inserted and it is found that that term is not sufficient - and I do not think that it is a clear definition - it will be necessary to recommit the Bill. I suggest to my honorable friend that he should allow the clause to pass as it is, and then after he has taken the advice of counsel he will know whether it is necessary to alter the term " Joint. Stock Company." </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say. I do not know what alterations of the old Bill were rendered necessary by the decision of the High Court. To put on a plaster here and a patch there is no way in which to approach the consideration of a serious subject of this kind. The proposed new clause is before the Committee in its entirety, and I intend to point out some of the dangers attached to this class of legislation. We have "now reached the crux- of the measure. What is proposed to be done? -In the case of incorporated banks it is proposed to vary the contract under which their charter was issued to them. That is a very serious thing for a private senator to undertake to do. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to make up for that slight omission on his part. I shall show, from my point of view, what the clause really means, .and the honorable senator is perfectly welcome to show what it means from his point of view. The variation of contract which he asks the Committee to accept, is, in my estimation, an exceedingly dangerous one. Certain banking corporations in Australia received their charters, not from Australian Legislatures, but from the British Government. One of the conditions of those charters was that a certain proportion of capital « should not be called up, but should remain for ever uncalled, unless to save the bank from liquidation. Such were not the precise terms of the contract, but in plain language that is what was meant. What was the object of providing that a certain proportion of the capital should be uncalled? It simply meant that a specified amount of uncalled capital was to be held in a perpetual reserve, for which the shareholders were to be liable, as a security to the depositors, clients, and <inline font-style="italic">customers</inline> of the bank generally. I hold that that provision was an exceedingly wise one. It must be recollected that this was not put into the bank charters by the vile Labour party. It was inserted by some of the most conservative statesmen in the Mother Country, and by some of the most stable commercial people in the world. It will, therefore, be well for this Parliament to pause before it allows such a safeguard to be removed. As the banks are at present situated in Australia, their creditors have the security of the reserve funds, and also of the uncalled liability of the shareholders, in case of any. default. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> Bill becomes law, the creditors will have only the security of the bank's reserve fund. They will have no recourse whatever to the shareholders. </para>

No attention was paid to the matter at all, because every one thought that the Bill would go no further. There are senators in this chamber now who "voted for the second reading, but who, if they had considered that there was serious risk of the passage of the Bill, would have voted against it. I say so deliberately, with those senators looking me in the face. </para>

                        <para>- It would come from net profits. Now this is exactly the point where the legal definition of net profits has to be considered. What is that legal definition? I confess to a certain amount of diffidence in expressing my view on this subject in a Chamber where we have such an array of legal talent. The opinion that I offer is, of course, subject to correction, because legal authorities often differ amongst themselves. </para>

                            is very much concerned with the interests of the shareholders in the banks. My sole concern is with the interests of the customers and creditors of the banks. I consider that it would be a most dangerous thing if we removed one important safeguard which tends to insure the safety of the banks. I have a most vivid recollection of the suffering brought upon innocent people by the failure of banks in 1893 .
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline>
                            provision that existing reserves are not to be touched has nothing to do with the issue. They can be used for the purpose of relieving the shareholders of liability nevertheless. I have before me the opinion expressed on this subject on a former occasion by a legal member of the Senate, namely,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline>
                            who is probably as capable a lawyer as we have here. I am fortified by his opinion that the legal definition of " net profit " is what I have stated. If that be so, the banks could sell their properties, convert all their reserves, and apply the proceeds for the particular purpose that
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline>
                            has in view. They could relieve themselves of the liability imposed upon them by the charters under which they are carrying on their business. I say again that this proposal is unthinkably dangerous. It is the most audacious proposal that this Parliament has ever been asked to accept. Apart from the mere question of monetary liability, the portion of the uncalled capital which cannot be called up, as provided in the charters of the banks, gives an immense advantage in insuring their stability.

                        <para>- That is so, I am free to admit. Sometimes when the uncalled capital was required to be used it was not there. But let me point out where the safeguard comes in. If the honorable senator will go into the Library and consult some of the leading banking authorities, he will find that this view is borne out by them. The very fact that there is a large uncalled capital staring bank directors and shareholders in the face - a liability resting upon them in case of any default - always tends to make those shareholders and directors exceedingly cautious. Knowing the obligation resting upon them in case the bank makes default, they are exceedingly careful to conduct their business on safe lines. But if that safeguard be removed, we render it safe for these people, in their greed for enormous profits, to undertake the most risky business; they will be able to "go smash " without any ill effects to themselves. </para>

What would be the effect of such profits? It would be that the shares would double and treble in value on the stock exchange, and shareholders who had pocketed  20  or  25  per cent. for two or three years and then sold their stock at double or treble its original price would not care what became of the bank afterwards. </para>

                        <para>- And that is the motive behind all profit-making. A corporation has no soul. It considers nothing but profit. It is a remarkable fact that individuals of the highest integrity will in their corporate capacity do things characterized by the most despicable meanness, which they would not dream for a moment of doing in their private capacity. That fact has been commented upon by many of the best-known writers. Under existing conditions shareholders in banks having a large uncalled liability are apt to very carefully scrutinize their accounts, to insist that they must be run on safe lines, and that as few risks as possible shall be taken. If this safeguard is removed in the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> proposes, they will be encouraged to say, " Let us plunge ; let us take a few risks. We can collar  25  per cent. dividends, and we shall have no ultimate liability." There is a danger that such a policy would be followed if the safeguards were removed. Such a policy would almost inevitably end in disaster, and when the bank smashed incalculable suffering and hardship would be entailed, perhaps, upon widows and orphans amongst the shareholders. Why should such a state of affairs be brought about merely because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> wishes to safeguard the interests of the fat shareholders of banks? </para>

But that is what might follow if his Bill were passed. I am sure that if the honorable senator were seized with the enormity of the proposition he submits, he would be one of the first to repudiate it. We know that the mother of. even the most deformed infant is apt to consider her child the most sublime creature on the face of the earth, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> as the mother of this little legislative bantling, no doubt, regards it as the most perfect piece of legislation that could be proposed. As the law stands at present there is nothing whatever to prevent the shareholders of a financial institution building up the highest possible reserve in order to safeguard themselves and their customers ; but they cannot by doing so relieve themselves from ultimate liability in the event of disaster. They can build up reserve funds, invest them in Government securities, and adopt every other kind of safeguard, but according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> they wish, in doing so, to be allowed to relieve themselves of the liability imposed upon them by the charters under which they have made their fortunes. I am opposed to that. I say that the limitations included in their charters were so included for very wise purposes, and we should not, without very serious consideration, attempt to tamper with them.

                        <para>- I know that the honorable senator approves generally of what Legislative Councils have done in the past as the great champions of vested interests; but he now proposes to vary the contract entered into by the Bank of New South Wales at the time to which he refers. Leaving that part of the subject for the present, I wish to remind the Committee of the very serious danger that might arise under this measure in connexion with the formation of new companies with a very large uncalled capital. There are several banks in Australia at the present time that have not more than one-tenth of their capital called up. The remaining nine-tenths is uncalled capital; and, if honorable senators will remember what I have said as to the definition of " net profits," they will see that these companies, if they were vicious enough to do so - and that there are vicious people in the community is proved by the necessity under which we are to continually legislate against them - might apply their clients' money to relieving themselves of every farthing of liability. The danger would probably be greater in the case of new companies which might hereafter be formed, and the formation of which would be encouraged by the passing of this Bill. Companies might be formed practically without any capital at all. They might make a great splash, and claim that their capital amounted to £1, 500,000, of which not more than £100,000 might be called up. If people were fools enough to do business with them, and some persons might be induced to do so to give them a start, these companies, under this Bill, would be in a position to use their clients' money to pay up the whole of their £1,500,000 of capital, and they would be absolutely relieved of all liability. I hope that other members of the Committee will express an opinion on this question. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has brought this measure forward without sufficient consideration from the point of view of the public. He has been so long and honorably associated with banks and banking people that he is desirous of placing them in a good position. That is perhaps a very natural desire on the part of the honorable senator, and I do not cavil at it. But I say that it is the business of the Senate to safeguard the interests of the whole of the people, and not merely those of a particular class who may be connected with banks or financial institutions as shareholders or directors. There are other matters raised by a later part of the clause with which I shall not now attempt to deal. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to tell the Committee what answers he can give to the objections I have urged to the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - There is some force in the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> with respect to the restrictive effect of the clause. But, as against what the honorable senator has said, I point out that the reserve liability, as he must know, is sometimes not equal in value to its nominal amount. If the provisions of this Bill were complied with in all cases, and, for instance, a reserve liability of£100,000 was represented by a reserve fund of that amount in the hands of trustees, the money could be secured at once in the event of a crisis, and the widows and orphans, to whom the honorable senator referred, would be saved all the trouble he has mentioned. </para>

                    <para>Profits (or net profits) are the excess of returns over advances; the excess of what is obtained over the cost of obtaining it. Losses, on the other hand, are the excess of advances over returns ; the excess of the cost of obtaining over what is obtained. Profits and net profits are for all legal purposes synonymous expressions; but the returns themselves are often called gross profits; hence it becomes necessary to call profits net profits in order to avoid confusion. In the present treatise, however, the word profits will be used in the sense of net profits ; and the expression gross profits will be avoided as much as possible. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must not ask me to be responsible for what some persons did in days gone by. I can speak with forty years' experience of one institution, that has always taken care to pay dividends only out of what it earned, and to put any surplus to a reserve fund, or to the writing off of bad debts. I do not see why, because one or two unfortunate banks came to grief in days gone by,  we should treat all these institutions as in the hands of dishonest persons. Many of the banks that came to grief in  1893  would have been prevented from smashing if they had been able to comply with such a provision as is contained  in this BiU. So far from it being merely for the benefit of the shareholders it is largely for the benefit of the creditors. As I have already said, a company which paid a.  10  per cent, dividend and put aside  2  per cent, of its profits would, in thirty-one and a-half years, have ample funds with which to meet the whole of its reserve liability. Now, in the history of a bank thirty-one and a-haH years is a very short period. The clause states - </para>

                <para>When a bank requires new capital it is not an uncommon thing for it to issue new shares at a premium, and the amount thus realized is usually placed to the credit of the reserve fund. This provision will permit of that being done. The clause continues -  and the proceeds of sale of forfeited shares or any portion or portions thereof respectively and such sums (if any) as represent the recovery of debts previously written off as bad. </para>
                <para>I think that in itself the clause is sufficiently explanatory. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has spoken in a perfectly straightforward fashion, and without heat. I congratulate him upon his improvement, and I trust that he will withdraw his objection to the clause. If he will do so I promise to obtain the best legal advice upon it, and after a little more discussion to move that progress be reported, and that the further consideration of the Bill be deferred for a month. I admit that the measure is a little bantling, but it is a remarkable circumstance that so far only one man whom I have consulted has found fault with it, and that upon the ground that the institution with which he is associated does not require it. Yet that very institution suspended payment in  1893.  Three advantages will flow from the passing of the measure. In the first place, it would make provision for meeting the reserve liabilities of companies, which would be an advantage to the shareholders. In the second place, it would confer an advantage upon the creditors of companies, and, lastly, it would compel trustees to invest their funds in Government stock, so that in the course of time they would hold in reserve a large amount of Government stock in lieu of having to go abroad to seek investments. </para>

                    <para>. - So far I have not spoken upon this Bill during the current session, although I voted for its second reading last year. If, however, a vote were taken upon it now, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> would find that a majority in this chamber are opposed to it. The provision which has been eliminated from the measure and that which it is now proposed to insert in it constitute its crux. I voted for its second reading, not because I entirely believed in it, but because I was prepared to hear debate upon its main principle. But now that we have reached the stage when we have to decide whether we will accept its provisions in detail, I feel bound to say that I cannot vote for them. I think that the Committee will be well advised if it decides to take a test vote upon this clause. To prolong the discussion would not he very satisfactory to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> when he knows that some of those who have been according the Bill a tentative support are not in favour of it. Of course, I recognise that it possesses some good features. To my mind its one fatal disadvantage is that it would do away with one of the safeguards of public credit in connexion with any limited liability company. In such companies the shareholders act the part of watch-dogs by keeping a keen eye upon the directors. The compelling motive which they have in this connexion is a desire, not merely to safeguard their profits, but also to safeguard themselves against being called upon to foot the uncalled liability which, under the Companies Act, they may be required to face. It is that uncalled liability which acts as a spur to the shareholders, and induces them to insure that the policy of the directors shall be a safe one. My great objection to the Bill is that it will take away that spur. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales)  [9.22].  - The suggestion made by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    regarding the wisdom of taking a test vote upon this, clause is an admirable one, because the object of the Committee must either be to pass a Bill which will be of »benefit to the community, or to reject a measure; which ought not to appear upon our statute-book. I think it is much more desirable to adopt the course which has been suggested than to fight the Bill time after time, thus delaying the pro.gress of business after honorable senators have made up their minds regarding it. But before the question is put, I should like to refer to one or two matters which have cropped up during this debate. In reply to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline>
                    I would point out that there are some banks conducting business in Australia to-day which received their charters from the Home authorities. In. my judgment, any legislation which we may enact will extend to them only so far as local matters are concerned, and so far as strictly local business is affected. Where, under a charter which has been granted to a bank carrying on business here by Great Britain,  a man is liable to pay a certain sum of money, no legislation that we may enact will affect his responsibility as a shareholder to make up any reserve liability. If such a bank had to go into liquidation, the whole .of its shareholders would be liable to make up the reserve liability upon their shares, irrespective of any fund which might have been created in the Commonwealth. That fund, having been created, could be made applicable to the general payment of the bank's debts. Such an institution would occupy no stronger position than it would occupy if the reserve fund had been built up in the ordinary way for the purpose of strengthening its hand in the conduct of its business and in the making of its profits. But take the case of - another bank which has derived its statutory power from one of the States of the Commonwealth. It would be able to take advantage of the protection which would be afforded by this Bill. If a sufficient sum of money were set apart to form a reserve fund to meet its reserve liability, its shareholders would be protected, and that fund would be available for the benefit of creditors generally-
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    has affirmed that the fact that a reserve liability attaches to the shareholders of certain companies makes them watch very keenly the manner in which the affairs of those companies are conducted. But, so far as I can judge - and I have had some experience in these matters- - such a consideration does not influence the average shareholder in any degree whatever. He is usually very keen to obtain affair amount of profit on his investment, but I do not think that he looks to the amount of the reserve liability which he is accepting when he purchases his shares.

                        <para>- That is quite true. Again, there is a large number of companies in which the shareholders are not responsible for anything more than the unpaid amount of their calls. When once those calls have been paid up, they have no liability whatever. In such companies the shareholders certainly do not watch the directors keenly, because they fear their reserve liability. If they look keenly after the directors, that is because they want to get dividends. We have recognised this principle in our legislation regarding ordinary, companies. Again, with regard to certain mining companies established under the No Liability <inline font-style="italic">Acts,</inline> there is no liability upon a share. A man pays  5s.  or  10s.  on account of a  £1  share, and when further calls are made he can, if he sees fit, snap his fingers at the directors, and decline to pay any more money. He is not subject to any liability under the .law. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, and any one doing business with a bank after this Bill is passed will be able to ascertain whether a fund is being built up to meet the reserve liability in case of liquidation. It comes to about the same thing. Suppose "that there is a liability of  £100,000  distributed over  100  individuals, and that the company goes into liquidation. Out of that number only sixty or eighty may be capable of paying their reserve liability, and the balance will go into the Bankruptcy Court because they cannot manage to raise the money required of them. Under this BiU a certain proportion of the profits, instead of going to the shareholders, will be put on one side, in order to meet the reserve liability, and if, ultimately, a fund of  £100,000  is built up, the creditors will be safe to that extent, and the money will have been taken out of the net profits. I understand that the difficulty which has occurred to the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is that the directors may sell and dispose of the whole of the properties representing what are termed the reserves, and bring them into the accounts as profits on the year. That is, I think, more imaginary than real. </para>

                        <para>- No. If a test vote is taken, it will show whether we are prepared to accept the principle of this provision.

Whether they are real or fanciful, they are difficulties which ought to be met and settled, if possible. If honorable senators are prepared to accept this principle, they should vote for the provision on the understanding that if it does not sufficiently safeguard the interests of possible creditors of an institution, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will consent to a re-committal, in order to obtain the desired safeguards. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that some further light has been thrown on this subject. I think that the last speaker is labouring under a very severe misapprehension with regard to the effect of this provision, if passed. He has put in a proviso which, I consider, is a very good one, and that is that the provision shall only be passed on the distinct understanding that if additional safeguards are found to be necessary they shall be provided. If time permitted I could cite different authorities to show that the whole of the present reserve funds pf a bank could be converted in the future, and the proceeds of that conversion called net profits, and devoted to those purposes. If this provision is embodied in the Bill, it will be essential to provide that no present reserve fund shall be converted. As things are at the present time, the customers and creditors of a bank have the security of the reserve fund, and also the security of the reserve liability of the bank shareholders. If, however, the Bill became law, they would have only the reserve funds to fall back upon, because the reserve liability of the shareholders would be gone. </para>

                        <para>- I am. I admit that in the event of a bank failing, that fund would be absolutely intact. Every one knows that the reserve liability of a bank is a mere flea-bite compared with its liabilities to customers and creditors. In the event of the penal restriction being removed, what satisfaction would it be to clients and creditors to have a mere flea-bite of a reserve fund intact, while the directors and shareholders went off scot free? This is a most dangerous provision to enact. Last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> pointed out that, according to the legal definition; net profits is the surplus of what a man received in any one year, no matter from what sources, over and above what he paid away. </para>

                    <para>Accordingly if a company with a paid-up capital of £100,000 likes to buy, say, ten acres of coal for £100,000, and works one acre per annum, and, after paying expenses of raising the coal and of management has, say, £15,000 per annum in hand, that sum is profit available for dividends, and there is no obligation on the company to treat any part of it as capital ; and when at the end of ten years the coal has been worked out, and the £100,000 has disappeared, and the capital has thus been reduced to nil, we are not to regard this as a reduction of capital prohibited by the Act. Yet it is obvious that each half-year's income includes a return to the company of part of its capital outlay, and, therefore, that the company each year pays dividends consisting in part of capital. </para>

                        <para>- They did not go to gaol ; they were elevated to Upper Houses and some of them received titles. They are now regarded as heroes of civilization, and when the honorable senator walks the streets of Brisbane they will pat him on the back as a friend of theirs. There is nothing under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> proposal to prevent the banks from converting their reserves and calling the result profit. They can sell their properties and their Government securities, and call the proceeds net profit. They can in this manner build up their reserve fund, and free themselves from liability. I trust that the Bill will go no further. But if the clause under discussion be carried, I shall take other opportunities of proposing additional safeguards. </para>
