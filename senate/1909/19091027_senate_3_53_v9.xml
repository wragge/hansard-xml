                        <para>-Relative to a question asked by me some weeks ago, and in respect to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council promised to obtain information, can he tell the Senate what practice is being followed with regard to the establishment of telephonic conveniences on the slot principle in hotels? I have pointed out to the honorable senator the discrimination which exists in Sydney in regard to reputable hotels, and which has operated detrimentally to some, and advantageously to others. I hope that he has the desired information in his possession. </para>

                        <para>-I have received a return giving the information which the honorable senator seeks, but as one portion of it appeared to be slightly ambiguous,I sent it back to the Department. I hope, in the course of the afternoon, to have a correction made, and then I shall be glad to bring the return under the notice of the honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago, I asked that the papers relating to the case of the alleged confectionery combine should be laid on the table of the Senate or the Library, and the Minister of Trade and Customs replied that some of them were confidential. I then asked if he would have a <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of such papers as were not confidential laid on the table, and he promised to consider my request. I desire to know whether he has yet arrived at a decision. </para>

As the territory has now been defined, there is no portion of a State railway within its boundaries, and the clause is, therefore, unnecessary. </para>

                <para>Thatthere following new clause be inserted :  - 11a. - (x.) Duties of Customs or of Excise collected in the Territory shall be new revenue within the meaning of the Surplus Revenue Act 1908. (2.) Duties of Customs or of Excise collected in the Territory on goods which afterwards pass into a State for consumption shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been collected not in the Territory but in the State.  (3.) Duties of Customs or of Excise collected in a State on goods which afterwards pass into the Territory for consumption shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been collected not in the State but in the Territory. (4.) This section shall come into operation on the proclaimed day referred to in section six. </para>
                <para class="block">Honorable senators will notice that the Bill makes provision for the recognition of any equitable claim which the Government of New South Wales is able to make with respect to the payment of all revenues collected within the Federal territory up to the date of the proclamation accepting that territory on behalf of the Commonwealth, and in respect of some revenue even after that date. I do not cavil at that, as I consider it is a just provision. But I would direct attention to the fact that the Bill makes no provision at all for the recognition of any claim by the Commonwealth Government for the payment of revenues from the territory to which the Commonwealth, may be equitably entitled. There is a clause providing that the laws of New South Wales and their administration shall continue until such time as the Commonwealth Parliament otherwise provides. I desire that, from the date on which the territory is accepted by proclamation, every shilling of revenue contributed by the residents of the territory shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth. It is for this purpose that I have proposed the insertion of the new clause which honorable senators have had before them in print. I commend it to the good sense of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but I come to my second argument, which is that we are rapidly approaching the time when, by the operation of the Constitution, or by the adoption of the proposed or any other financial agreement, the bookkeeping system will cease to exist. The honorable senator's amendment proposes to provide for the interregnum which will occur between the time when the Bill comes into operation, which will probably be towards the end of the year, and the time when, by the acceptance of the financial agreement, or the expiry of the Braddon section, the bookkeeping system will be brought to a close. </para>

If the financial agreement be adopted, the proposed new clause would operate only for a very, few months, and against the very slight advantage to be derived from the receipt of revenue for that period from a population of 1,000, or 1,200 people, we have to set the tremendous difficulties and disadvantages surrounding the collection of that revenue. We should have to draw around the Federal territory a temporary cordon of Customs Houses. </para>

                        <para>- That would he equivalent to  25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for six months. I am assuming that that is the maximum period for which the honorable senator's proposal, if adopted, would apply. Is it worth while, in view of the small amount that is involved, subjecting the residents of this area to the inconvenience which would be inflicted upon them under any such arrangement? Is it worth while requiring the Customs officers who would have to be stationed there to make the suggested division of Customs revenue? I woul'd also point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that if this Bill becomes law, as I anticipate it will - and I am entitled -to indulge in that anticipation, in view of the vote which was registered last -week - it will devolve upon the Government, on the transfer of the Federal Territory, to submit further legislative proposals, providing for the internal government of that Territory. In view of that circumstance, of the small amount that would be involved, of the extreme trouble that would be experienced in collecting it, and of the irritation that would be engendered amongst the inhabitants of the area concerned,'! submit that it is scarcely worth' while imposing such a restriction as the honorable senator has proposed. I trust that he will see fit to withdraw the clause. </para>

                    <para>..' - I - I do not think that the arguments advanced by the Vice-President of the Executive Council are sufficiently strong te induce any honorable senator to withdraw a proposition of this kind. If he will look at the map of the Yass-Canberra area,, he cannot fail to recognise that nearly all the settlers within that area are located irc one corner. It is idle for him to suggest that the residents along the border of the Federal Territory would be inconvenienced by my proposal. As a matter of fact, there is no settlement upon the catchment area of the Cotter River. The whole of this district is served from two points, viz., Yass and Queanbeyan. If the proposed new clause be inserted, there is nothing to prevent the Government from stationing a junior Customs officer at the railway stations of Queanbeyan and Yass to take tally of the goods which cross from New South Wales into the proposed Federal Territory, so that the Commonwealth may be credited? with all the revenue that is properly derivable from the entry of those goods. The Vice-President -of. the Executive Council has urged that the amount that would be involved is not a large one. But I notice that wherever the interests of New South Wales are concerned, provision is made for giving her every farthing to which she is entitled. I .do not cavil at that. It is the proper thing to do. But it is equally fair that from the very moment this area becomes Federal Territory, the Commonwealth should receive every farthing of revenue to which it is justly entitled. I do not think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council can show that any difficulty would be experienced under my proposal. The honorable gentleman has assumed ' that the new clause, if adopted, would operate only for a very short period, because he anticipates that the proposed financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States will probably become law. I hold that no Government has a right to assume anything of the kind. No Minister is entitled to. base an argument upon any such assump-tion until Parliament has spoken upon the subject. Further, it is the business of Parliament to legislate for things as they are. The proposed new clause is merely in the nature of a tentative provision which is intended to cover an interregnum. It is so eminently fair that the Vice-President of the Executive Council cannot cavil at it. I say that on behalf of the Commonwealth which we primarily represent, we should insist upon the Federation receiving the same fair deal that we are prepared to grant to New South Wales. As a matter of fact, the procedure which is contemplated in my proposal has been adopted from the very inception of the Commonwealth. If I wish to send 5s. worth of goods from Melbourne to Queensland, I am obliged to fill in a Customs form. </para>

It is true that police are stationed at Yass and Queanbeyan, but those towns will be in New South Wales territory. Under the Bill, that State will continue to receive revenue from lands which are in course of alienation under contract, and I do not cavil at that. But while we are prepared to do a fair thing to New South Wales, we should insist upon an equally fair deal being extended to the Commonwealth, which includes the people of all the States, and not merely those of New South Wales.

                    <para>. - May I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that, by the issue of a proclamation, the Commonwealth Government can, if they choose to do so, retain all the Customs and Excise revenue that may be collected within the Federal Territory. They possess that power under the Constitution. But as the Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out, it is questionable whether it would be expedient to harry the inhabitants of that Territory by placing around it a cordon of Customs officers. I submit that this is a matter in which we may confidently trust the Government. I repeat that they have full power to retain every penny of Customs and Excise revenue that may be collected within the Federal Territory, if they think it worth while to do so. If it is not worth while, the Commonwealth should not be put to the expense either of collecting the Customs and Excise revenue or of harrying the residents of the district. There is not a Government in Australia that will want money more urgently than will the Commonwealth Government. They will want all they can collect. But probably the game of collecting the Customs and Excise revenue in the Federal area during the period specified will not be worth the candle. Consequently, by. carrying <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Givens'</inline> proposed new clause we may be harrying the people of the district on account of little or no return, whilst the cost of enforcing the law in the form suggested may be more than the revenue derivable. The Government have plenary power to collect the revenue if they choose to do so. Can we not trust the Government to determine between the two issues, and to collect every penny if it is worth while to do so? </para>

Everything is sacrificed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade.</inline> We are now proposing to take over territory situated in New South Wales, and we make no provision whatever for laying claim to our own revenue. That revenue will be collected in New South Wales and credited to that- State. Such a position is absolutely ridiculous. We are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, that what I. propose would harry the residents. We should not harry them any more than any one in the Commonwealth is harried by the ordinary administration of the Customs. </para>

                        <para>- My proposal would not have any such effect. As to the argument that the administration would be excessively costly, I reply that all that would be required would be the services of a junior Customs officer at each of the two stations, Yass and Queanbeyan, through which all goods enter the territory. When.  1  send a parcel of goods worth, perhaps, not more than 5s., to my home in Queensland, and have" to go to the Customs office and fill in a form, I do not whine that I am harried. I have to do that simply to enable the proper amount of revenue to be credited to each State. Why should we not also adjust the proper amount to be credited to the Commonwealth when it hasa territory of its own? </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared to trust the present Government, or any Government, in matters with which Parliament should itself deal. It is not safe to trust any Government. In no Parliament with which I have been acquainted has the Legislature allowed itself to be dominated by a Government in such a fashion. No self-respecting Parliament would allow its functions to be abrogated by saying : ' ' We can trust the Government to do this." What is Parliament for if the Government is to be trusted to do everything? It is the duty of Parliament to prescribe exactly what shall be done; and I am asking for nothing that is not eminently fair and just. Even the Minister in opposing my proposed new clause had not a word to say against the principle of my claim. It has been said that the revenue will not amount to much. It will amount approximately to 50s. per head per annum. The interregnum may cover- twelve months or more. It may be a great deal longer. If the interregnum be shorter, this provision wilt automatically disappear. After the Braddon section expires in 1910 the bookkeeping sections of the Constitution will still remain in operation " until the Parliament otherwise provides." It cannot be seriously thought that this Commonwealth Parliament, having succeeded in passing this Bill, will sit down quietly and do nothing mote. Work will have to be done within the territory, and there may be a large influx of population. Although the population is not more than 1,200 now, there may be  5,000  or 6,000 people there within five or six months of the passing of this measure. Why should New South Wales get the revenue which properly belongs to the Commonwealth? It is the duty of this Parliament to see that the Commonwealth receives it. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will not press the amendment, because I can assure him that it is wholly unnecessary. He might just as well have asked that the word "permanently " should precede or follow the word " surrender " in paragraph  1,  or that the words "for ever" should be inserted after the word " protect " in paragraph  4.  The legal interpretation of paragraph  3  is very simple. It simply means that the State shall never sell or lease the land or allow it to be occupied. </para>

                        <para>- Surely my honorable friend can see the difference between a reservation by a sovereign authority, which answers to no one but itself, and an agreement between two sovereign authorities, which are answerable to the Courts. An individual may follow his inclination in the prosecution of his business, but he cannot do that when he is bound by an agreement with some one else. This is an agreement between New South Wales and the Commonwealth, and it cannot be broken by either party without the other having the right to apply to the Court. In view of that fact and the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,I</inline> ask the honorable senator not to divide the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems almost unarguable that, if New South Wales attempted to sell or let the reserve the Commonwealth would have ample power to. restrain the State from doing so. To my mind the insertion of the word " permanently " would cast a doubt upon our plenary power. If the clause is passed as it stands it seems to me almost self-evident that the Commonwealth could restrain the State under that section of the Constitution which requires every State and StateCourt to observe our law. The amendment is quite unnecessary, and it might be dangerous to put in any word qualifying our power. </para>

I do not profess to have as much knowledge about these matters as he has, but it appears to me that this reservation of the catchment areas of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo rivers will belong to the State, and that the Commonwealth will have no control over them except as its interests are affected by paragraph  3  of the agreement. May I ask the Minister why the State does not hand over the catchment areas to the Commonwealth? </para>

                        <para>- With all deference to the honorable senator, I should like to say that the law is a most uncertain scieuce, if it can be called a science at all. It is often a case of " Heads I win, tails you lose." Decisions in the Courts often depend on the state of the Judges' livers. We should frame this agreement so that there can be no doubt as to what we really mean. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sure that it would not be wise to strike them out, but I am not greatly interested in their omission, because the people one hundred years hence will have the same right to conduct the affairs of the . Commonwealth that we have to deal with the matters which are now before us. Our intention should be stated in this agreement so plainly that not even judges or lawyers could distort it. So far as I can see, paragraph 3 of the agreement does not state exactly what we intend, and in the circumstances I think it  is  extremely desirable that the amendment should be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- That paragraph states that the State shall not pollute and shall protect from pollution the waters of those rivers. But that is the very thing I desire to emphasize before we finally pass clause 3. We shall really have no power to force the State Government to carry out this duty effectively. I think that paragraph3 is a good paragraph so far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. We cannot be absolutely assured that these rivers will be protected from pollution unless we own the catchment areas ourselves. It would be impossible to alter the agreement in that respect now, because the Government would, no doubt, resist such a proposal ; but I think the Vice-President of the Executive Council might undertake to see that these catchment areas shall not be used as camping reserves or places on which to run stock by adjoining land holders, or occupied in such a way as might lead to the pollution of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo- Rivers. The honorable senator might consider the advisability of proposing some amendment to meet my objection. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has often by interjection suggested that in most cases the lawyers' costs constitute a sufficient penalty. I cannot conceive that with a clear obligation imposed upon the Government of New South Wales by this paragraph, they would set out to look for trouble, and take such action as would result in a heavy penalty upon the State, even though the penalty would be in the form of lawyers' costs, and not in the form of a fine. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that there is some danger of the territory comprised in these catchment areas becoming a sort of no-man's land. The Government of New South Wales agreed to reserve these areas for all time from sale, lease and occupation, except with the concurrence of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth Government will not be anxious ' to extend the right of the State Government to utilize these land? If the State Government can make no use of these lands, why should they not be prepared to hand them over entirely to the Commonwealth? I am afraid that right alongside what may be a very closely populated area we shall have a no-man's land. </para>

In that case, by the terms of paragraph 2, the interests of the Commonwealth are declared to be paramount. No development can take place which will result in a diminution of the flow down those rivers. The same rule is applicable to the private owner, except that the State undertakes the obligation of seeing that he does not pollute any stream. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J.

When the Commonwealth asked New South Wales for a grant of 900 square miles of territory, it asked for an area which was sufficient. </para>

                    <para>. - Next in importance to the' area comprised within the Federal territory is the area which is to be granted to the Commonwealth for the .purposes of a port. The Senate has already declared that it is necessary to have a Federal port by inserting in the Seat of Government Act 1908, a provision that the Federal territory should contain an outlet to the sea. I would draw attention to the fact that in the clause with which we are now dealing, the land which it is proposed to concede to the Commonwealth for the purposes of a port is defined as that portion of Jervis Bay which is coloured red upon the map that is hanging in the chamber. I have scaled that map, and I find that that country at its narrowest part is very little more than half a mile across. I would further point out that in the past the areas which are outlined in blue have been reserved by the State for defence purposes. These it was intended to hand back to New South Wales- </para>

Be: tween the area that is- coloured red and* that which is coloured blue there is a small tract of country which is white, and which' I note is to remain State territory. </para>

                        <para>- The proposal is that the land at Jervis Bay which is to be granted to the Commonwealth, shall extend only to high-water mark. " In other words the Commonwealth will not be able to exercise any control over the territorial waters within that port. We shall, of course, have the right to erect wharfs if they are necessary for Federal purposes', but the water surrounding those . wharfs will be under State control, because under the proposed agreement the territorial waters will not be transferred to us. My first point, therefore, is that the area which it is proposed to hand over to the Commonwealth for a port is altogether inadequate. In the second place it is not of a shape which will permit of  a port of any size being built upon it. I, therefore, intend to move - </para>

                        <para>- If the Senate is of opinion that we do not require a port, then we do not need even two square miles of country at Jervis Bay, But either we require a port or we do not. If we do, we want a sufficient area upon which we can build one, and two square miles is insufficient for the purpose. I trust that my proposal will not be treated as a party one. I submit it in perfect good faith, but I say that when we are making an agreement with New South Wales we have a right to ask that State to grant us an area which we deem sufficient for our purposes at Jervis Bay. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, Guthrie</inline> can tell the Committee that a good portion of the Darling Road within Jervis Bay is not navigable. Vessels would have practically to go round in a circle in order to get into the anchorage of the port if one were established there. At the present time a sand-spit runs out into the Bay for a distance of two miles, and, therefore, there is no direct entrance into that road. </para>

                        <para>- No, All the waters within three miles of the coast of Australia are under the control of the States-; 1 submit that, altogether apart from the question of area, the Commonwealth ought to control the waters of the Federal port. The area that is defined in the agreement in this connexion is altogether inadequate. I would ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether he does not regard my proposal as a legitimate one, and one in which the New South Wales Government would acquiesce? I am not asking that State to forego valuable land. I merely wish to avoid future complications arising as the result of a divided control over land and water. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has raised two points. The first has reference to whether the area proposed to be ceded to the Commonwealth, to enable it to establish a Federal port, is sufficient. I do not gather that the honorable senator has moved an amendment, but I understand that what he desires is that the New South. Wales Government should be asked to hand over to the Commonwealth, in lieu of the two square miles of country coloured red upon the map, all the land east of the line which now forms the western boundary of the proposed Federal territory. That would embrace an area of ten square miles. I do not intend to argue, the question of whether, for the purposes of a port, two square miles is likely to be a sufficient area for all imaginative possibilities. But I say that the New South Wales Government has given us an area of land which was never contemplated by the Constitution. She has undertaken to grant a certain portion of land to the Commonwealth, to enable it to establish a Federal port. That area embraces a great deal more land than the New South Wales Government owns at Port Jackson to-day. </para>

                        <para>- No sovereign rights are vested in the Commonwealth over the piece of property at Jervis Bay. The whole question comes down to this : The State Government offers to grant an area of two square miles, and there is behind that area land which may or may not be necessary for Federal purposes. If it be thought necessary, the Federal Government will be able to do with that land what it is able to do with any other land that is required for public purposes - say, for the purpose of a rifle range or a post-office. It can step in and take possession, compensating the owner. In this instance, the cost of resumption would not be great. New South Wales has given up as much as we can reasonably ask her to give, in view of the circumstances of the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that a vessel entering the Bay would have to go two or three miles to the north-west, and then turn south. I have before me the Admiralty chart, and, so far as I can see, it would not be at all necessary to do so. </para>

                        <para>- It is possible to trace with a pencil on the chart a course which a vessel could take, giving an ample depth, and not requiring her to go anything like three miles out of her convenient course. If there were anything in the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> it applies equally to Port Jackson, which, as I suppose honorable senators will admit', is generally considered to be a very fine harbor. It has there been considered necessary for ships to take a particular course, which is marked out by beacons and lights. There is one point upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> touched which, I must confess, gave me some little anxiety in the first instance. I refer to the term " high- water mark." When I first saw the agreement I immediately drew attention to those words'. But the Attorney-General has given very considerable thought to the matter, and has pointed out that, whether the words are left in or not makes no difference. I think that we can accept his assurance with confidence. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> himself supplied an answer, because he has stated that, for all Federal purposes, we should be able to carry on any works or operations we thought fit, irrespective of the words in question. </para>

                        <para>- I thought the words "high-water mark" were taken exception to because it was considered that the Commonwealth would be hampered if it were desired to construct wharfs or slips, or anything of the kind. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has admitted that the Commonwealth would have ample power to carry out any Federal purpose that it thought fit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> still seems to be dubious, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and the Attorney-General together form a strong combination to whose authority I am prepared to submit. There has never been any question as to the power of the Commonwealth to do anything that may be considered necessary .to carry out Federal functions. That power will not be restrained or hampered iri the slightest degree either by the insertion or the omission of these words. They make practically no difference to our power. That being so, it would hardly lie worth while to make an amendment immaterial in itself which would necessitate the agreement having to be sent back elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- Something has been said as to what was done in America. But we have to avoid making the mistakes that have been made in the United States. We are now attempting to build up a naval Defence Force for the Commonwealth. Yet we are not to have an inch of ground for the purpose of housing the vessels of our Defence Force. The proposal is absolutely ridiculous, to my mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that he can trace on the Admiralty chart by means of a pencil a convenient course which ships could take in entering the Federal port. That may seem an easy thing to do, but apparently the honorable senator has taken no note of sunken rocks or reefs, which would prevent a vessel from taking any but a very narrow passage indeed. </para>

Two rocky heads project from the shore at S.W. by W.¾ W. 2¼ miles, and W. by S.½ S. 2¾ miles from the north extreme of Bowen Isle ; the north-western of the two heads having some dry and sunken rocks close off it. A sand-spit, with 2 fathoms water on it, projects half a mile north-westward from the eastern part of the bay, and adds to the security of the anchorage by breaking the swell which sets in. </para>

                <para class="block">From those particulars honorable senators can work out the passage a vessel would have to follow. But what is more important is that the land that is to be granted to us stops at high water mark. As far as I can learn there is at Jervis Bay a rise and fall of something like  6  feet. On a sloping shore such as this there would probably be a distance of half-a-mile or three-quarters of a mile between high-water and low-water mark. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that the honorable senator has any authority for saying so. If we want this piece of land at all, it is for the purpose of building and repairing our ships. If the State of New South Wales decided to erect wharfs at low-water mark the Commonwealth would, of course, have power to take over the works. But the State might have spent half-a-million of money, and we should certainly have to pay a very big price. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, the amendment is a fairly reasonable one. Every one knows that I am not in favour of the Bill ; but I think that if the Commonwealth is to have access to the sea, there is good reason why it should have a sufficient area of land at Jervis Bay. In my second-reading speech, I pointed out that, although I was opposed to the Bill, the Commonwealth would no doubt be called upon to do a great deal of work in that locality. We have been offered, a piece of land which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> is half-a-mile wide. If it is the intention of the Government to introduce a system of naval defence, we shall need a considerable area for the purpose of erecting docks and other works. I can easily understand the action of the State Government if they think that the Commonwealth should not carry out these operations on their own Territory, but should establish the necessary works at the State capitals, preferably at Sydney, I suppose, because it seems to me that the Bill is based upon the idea of securing an advantage to that city at the expense of the Commonwealth. If that is the position, I can easily understand the State Government wanting to give to the Commonwealth only a small area to provide access by railway from the Capital to the port. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is, however, asking that an additional area should be granted to the Commonwealth, in order that it may be in a position to carry out any operations which may be deemed necessary. The Minister said that we need not bother about asking for more land, because we can buy what we want. At present, the land in question is of very little value. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but no doubt the Commonwealth would proceed to announce its intention to lay down certain works, and that, of course, would considerably enhance the value of the land which it required. In making provision for the expenditure of large sums in that locality the Commonwealth would increase the value of the land on which the works would be erected. If the State Government are sincere, they will not make the slightest objection to granting the area which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> desires to be included in the agreement. The Minister has stated that at present it is not of much value, but he is not prepared to ask the State to grant it. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to  me  that the Government of the Commonwealth is not supposed to dot an" i " or cross  a  " t " so long as the document happens to be submitted by the Premier of New South Wales. A newspaper suggested the other week that for all practical purposes he might as well be the autocrat of the Commonwealth and instruct its Government to carry out his behests. It will be detrimental to the public interest if the Commonwealth does not secure an additional area of land at Jervis Bay. In connexion with naval matters there has always been  an  idea that public money should be spent in the ports of each State. It is necessary to dissipate that . idea, and that can only be done by the Commonwealth carrying out all works of that kind  on  its own territory. By that means  a  blow will be aimed at the parochial spirit which now prevails. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> holds the view that  a  large expenditure of Federal money should be allotted to Sydney, then it seems to me that the Commonwealth Government are playing into his hands by refusing to accept this amendment. It. should be borne in mind that we are not asking for the cession of any land of particular value. I have noticed in connexion with all such agreements that the State proposes to cede to the Commonwealth land which is of very little value, and which it has not attempted to make use of.  In  most cases no effort has been made to  increase  the value of the land or induce persons to settle thereon. It seems to me that the Commonwealth Government are either not in earnest or afraid that if they accepted the amendment the Premier of  Mew  South Wales would tell them that they must do his bidding, which, of course, they would be prepared to do. I intend to vote for the amendment, because I think it is necessary that the Commonwealth should have more land at Jervis Bay than is proposed to be granted under the agreement. </para>

Those of us who are imbued with national ideas look forward to the time when we shall have arsenals, ship-building yards, dock yards, and factories established on our own territory ; and. unless we can secure Federal territory on . the shores of Jervis Bay, we cannot realize those ideas. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that if we are to be cribb'd, cabin'd, and confin'd in the way proposed in this agreement, we should be just as well off without any land at Jervis Bay. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel inclined, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> to vote against this paragraph. The proposal of the New South Wales Government to grant this small area of land at Jervis Bay is on a par with the stingy, mean, parsimonious and un-Federal conduct which has been pursued by the New South Wales Government throughout the whole of these negotiations. A most unFederal spirit has been exhibited, and anything that has been granted by the New South Wales Government to the Commonwealth has been offered in a most grudging fashion? </para>

                        <para>- No, we shall be merely in the position of an ordinary freeholder. My contention, however, is that the area proposed to be granted at Jervis Bay is not sufficient. I should have preferred that the area should be Commonwealth property. I think it ought to be; it is distinctly discreditable to the New South Wales Government that they should offer such a small area on such terms, but it is equally discreditable to the Commonwealth Government to agree to accept such an offer. If the New South Wales Government had been stingy and mean the Commonwealth Government has been paltry and petty. Apparently the two Governments are well met. They have long been searching for each other up and down the earth, and they , have at last met. It is a pity that the affairs of the Commonwealth should be in the hands of such " little Australians," who, with their little microscope set to their eyes, peer at this question. </para>

                        <para>- I am confining my remarks strictly to the 2 square miles of country proposed to be granted to the Commonwealth at Jervis Bay. We should be given a larger area, and I am astonished that members of this Committee should be prepared to agree to the proposal made. Seeing that the numbers were even in the last division, the Government might very well postpone this paragraph and reopen negotiations with the New South Wales Government with a view to securing a larger area at Jervis Bay. If we can strike out the clause well and good, but I am afraid we shall not be able to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I did expect some help from the honorable senator. Surely he does not think that 2 square miles is a sufficiently large area for the Federal port of a huge continent like Australia? The honorable senator appears to be in the same boat as honorable senators on the Government side. They do not seem to have any idea of the huge area of this continent, or of the immense population which it will some day carry. Australia is nearly as large as the whole of Europe, and in the clays to come will probably have a population as great as the population of Europe at the present time. Yet it is proposed by the New South Wales Government to offer to the Commonwealth for a port no more than 1,280 acres of land. That would not make a decent farm. In many portions of Australia a dairyman would require more land to keep a dozen cows than the New South Wales Government offer to the Commonwealth for a Federal harbor. </para>

                        <para>- It is the small - ness of the area about which I am troubled at the present moment. Australia is as large as the United States of America, and the probability is that we shall one day have a huge fleet, and that many trading vessels will be owned by the Commonwealth Government. We shall require shipbuilding yards and arsenals, and we cannot carry out the undertakings that will <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> necessary upon the 2 square miles of Jervis Bay offered by the New South Wales Government. The grudging spirit displayed by that Government makes me despair for the future of the Commonwealth. My only hope is that some day the control of its affairs' will get into the hands of men who are possessed of larger minds, and who are imbued with more generous instincts than are the gentlemen of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is such an excellent example. </para>

                <para class="block">Any area which may be surrendered to the Commonwealth at Jervis Bay will be as much Federal territory in essence as will be the Capital territory itself. A staff of Federal officials will have to be stationed there, and we shall probably have to build a dock and establish a ship building yard there. ' Yet it is proposed to locate all those officials and all these works upon a small area of 2 square miles. I believe in being thankful for what is worth receiving, but I do not believe in being grateful for what is not worth having. Consequently I shall vote for the rejection of the paragraph. Of course, I quite recognise the reason underlying the attitude. of the Government upon this question. We have in charge of the Bill a gentleman who, in the past, used his influence to secure a reduction of the area of the Federal territory for which this Parliament stipulated. When the Commonwealth Parliament decided in favour of an area of . 900 square miles in the vicinity of Dalgety, he did his best to secure a reduction of that area. Consequently his action in this matter is thoroughly consistent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has stated that we ought not to look a gift horse in the mouth. If the animal has more than one good tooth in his head, probably we ought not to do so, but if he is an utterly shocking specimen of a horse we ought to reject him altogether. Our rejection of this paragraph may make the New South Wales authorities act more liberally towards us in the future. The country in the vicinity of Jervis Bay is in the nature of the low sandy scrub, which is characteristic of the New South Wales coast. I shall vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I entertain two objections to the paragraph. The first has reference to the area which it is proposed to grant the Commonwealth to enable it to establish a Federal port, and which I contend is altogether too small. My second objection is that the Commonwealth will be able to exercise no territorial rights whatever over the area in question. It is well known that a State can prohibit the owners of land from doing certain things with that land, and I should like to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether it is not a fact that the New South Wales Government will be able to prohibit the Commonwealth from doing whatever it may choose with its territory ? </para>

                    <para>. - It will be admitted that about the only qualification possessed by the Yass-Canberra district for the purposes of a Federal Capital site is that it offers us a Federal port. If, under the proposed agreement, the usefulness of that port is to be curtailed in any way, I would prefer to see the Bill hung up indefinitely. I have no desire to delay the acceptance by the Commonwealth of the territory to be granted by New South Wales, but if we are not to exercise full control over the frontage to Jervis Bay, and if every facility to make full use of that port is not to be granted to us, I hold that the acquisition of a Federal territory will prove of very little value. Other honorable senators have already pointed out the defects connected with this paragraph, and I have no desire to repeat them. But I cannot allow it to pass without entering my protest against the whole scheme as it is now before us. </para>

                <para>This paragraph provides for the construction and maintenance of a railway between the territory and Jervis Bay. It makes provision for procuring timber and ballast, but no provision is made for providing water for the locomotives. The railway will be approximately 125 miles in length, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener's</inline> report. </para>

In the opinion of honorable senators opposite it would, appear that Parliament ought not to place an unholy finger on any portion of this agreement. Parliament is to be relegated to a secondary position, instead of being the primary factor. We are here merely to register decisions arrived at between the two Governments, and honorable senators opposite do not care two straws about the interests of the Commonwealth. The most slavish adherence to the agreement is maintained by the Ministerial supporters. </para>

                        <para>- Ballast and timber do not fall from the heavens as water does. The right to take water is sufficiently secured by Our having the right to construct and maintain the railway to Jervis Bay. It is really not worth our while to take up the time of the Committee by discussing such a trivial point. We have heard a good deal from time to time as to what has happened in America, but as soon as it is pointed out that the United States Government has no such powers as are being insured to the Commonwealth, we are told that American precedents have nothing to do with the matter. The United States Government has no constitutional right to construct railways or wharfs or ship-building yards. Yet such works have been constructed by the Federal power. In my opinion the amendment is purely obstructive. It is nothing to me personally whether New South Wales grants to the Federation the whole of Jervis Bay or a small portion of the foreshore. But I like to see a little moderation practised and some business transacted instead of . the whole afternoon being wasted. </para>

                        <para>- No. This amendment has simply been proposed for the purpose of wasting time. It is quite clear from the paragraph that the Commonwealth will have the right to obtain water for the construction of the railway. Do honorable members on the other side want to make use of nonsensical arguments for the purpose of wasting time; or do they wish to proceed with the Bill ? I know that some honorable senators on that side have said that they are prepared to do any mortal thing to wreck the Bill. Of course, if they were strong enough, I would not blame them for trying to defeat the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - If anything is calculated to invite opposition to the agreement or to wreck the Bill it is the reckless and unwarranted charge which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has made. I do not think that there is the slightest intention, on this side to obstruct. To my mind the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is a very pertinent one, and so far no solid objection has been offered to it. I do not think that he is actuated by a desire to obstruct or wreck the Bill. My only aim now is to make the measure as sensible and practical as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has said that it is well known that water is necessary for the working of a railway, quoting the first few lines of paragraph a. It is equally well-known that timber and ballast are necessary for the construction and maintenance of a railway. If it is necessary to include in the agreement timber and ballast for the construction and maintenance of the proposed railway it is doubly necessary to include the word " water ." in order to obviate the possibility of trouble arising in that regard. I shall vote for the amendment. I hope that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> again rises to make a charge against any honorable senators he will be in a position to name those who have made use of threats, and will not hide himself behind generalities. </para>

                    <para>. - I certainly think that this is a very necessary amendment. Surely every one will admit that it is just as necessary to mention in the agreement water for the working of the proposed railway as to mention timber and ballast for its construction. I think that it will be well to mention all the articles which may be required in connexion with the railway. It may, of course, be argued that water is not a material for the construction of a railway ; but, in my opinion, the amendment is a very fitting one to make. It is not submitted with the object of delaying business, but in order to make certain that the Commonwealth shall have full control of all building and other things necessary for the construction of the line. The proposal should be treated a little more seriously than it has been. </para>

                    <para>. - This paragraph confines our use of the waters referred to for the generation of electricity. It is quite possible that in the near future some power may be discovered which will, to a great extent, displace electricity. The march of science is so rapid nowadays that we do not know what new discovery may be made next week. I think we should have the right to use these waters for the generation of any kind of power that the Commonwealth may decide to generate. I, therefore, move - </para>

                    <para>. - If this agreement had been drawn up before the discovery of electricity, and the word "steam" were substituted in this paragraph for the word "electricity," it would have been possible for the State Government of New South Wales, subsequent to the discovery that electricity could be generated by water power, to prevent the Commonwealth from making use of these waters for the generation of that power. We ought to safeguard the rights of the Commonwealth in this connexion as far as is possible. The Federal city is to be established for all time, and in the light of the .discoveries of the past, surely no honorable senator is so conservative as to assert that no force will be discovered in the future which may displace electricity, as electricity bids fair to displace steam at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposes a precaution which we ought to take, to enable the Commonwealth Government to make use of the waters referred to in this paragraph, for the purpose of generating any force that it might be advantageous to make use of for railway or other purposes. It is' not very creditable to honorable senators opposite that they should rely upon their numbers to vote down every suggestion made from this side, without giving it the attention it deserves. </para>

                    <para>- - I do not think I ever listened to a more Conservative utterance than that delivered by the Vice-President of the Executive Council on my amendment. If this agreement had come before a Parliament of a hundred years ago, when the waterwheel was the machine ' usually driven by water power, and a similar suggestion were treated in the same fashion, we, looking back to the period, would undoubtedly be struck by the extreme Conservatism of the opponents of such a proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asked me if I could mention any power other than electricity that is likely to be generated by the use of water. I do not claim; to be a scientific inventor. All I know is that during recent years scientists have been marching from invention to invention. Will any honorable senator have the temerity to say that electricity represents the last word in the matter of power? I do not believe that it does, and I say that the Commonwealth, should enjoy the full benefit conferred bv all future inventions in that connexion. I want- </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator ought not to provoke replies by interjecting. All I claim is that the last word has not been uttered in the matter of inventions. Within the next decade - it may be within a year - some other power, greater in its force and cheaper in its working than electricity, may be discovered. But under this paragraph of the proposed agreement, although that power may be generated by water, the Commonwealth would not. be permitted to make use of it. </para>

I wish to give the Commonwealth the right to convey electrical power from the Snowy River to the port of Jervis Bay. The clause under consideration merely gives the Commonwealth the right to convey electrical power from the Snowy River through the Federal territory, which means Yass-Canberra. I think it must be evident to all that in the future a number of works which will require to use electrical power if they are to be conducted economically will be established at the Federal port. I therefore ask the Committee to agree to a proposal under which the Commonwealth will be enabled to convey electrical power from the Snowy River to Jervis Bay. I move - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is very close to being one of them. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> imagines that the supporters of the Bill desire that electrical power shall be brought from the Snowy River to that little sandy ridge at Jervis Bay he is making a sad mistake. Everybody can now see what is the intention of New South Wales. It is intended that the Commonwealth arsenal and all other Commonwealth works shall benefit Sydney only, and not the territory which is defined in the proposed agreement. I have no hope that the Committee will for a moment consider the advisableness of doing a sensible act - an act for which they would be applauded in the future. Under this clause of the proposed agreement the New South Wales Government practically say to the Commonwealth, " You may build a railway through the Federal Territory if you choose to Jervis Bay. But so far as shipbuilding yards and works requiring the transmission of power are concerned, they shall be established at Port Jackson." I hope that the Committee wilt agree to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not suppose that at this stage of the development of the Commonwealth any one will dispute the proposition that the advancement of agriculture is of supreme interest to the whole of Australia. As a corollary it follows that the Commonwealth is equally interested with the States in the promotion of agriculture. </para>

                            <para>- I am fairly certain that what the Premiers objected to was interference by the Commonwealth in the jurisdiction of the States over the development of their own lands; but that is an entirely different matter from the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau. Much has been said by honorable senators opposite to the effect that by taking this step the Commonwealth may, unintentionally or otherwise, interfere with the supremacy of the States in reference to the control of their lands. I may congratulate honorable senators who use that argument upon being on this occasion champions of State Rights, though they must pardon me for saying that I can scarcely believe that they are sincere. Another argument which has been used is that the Bureau of Agriculture will cause expense, and that the States cannot afford that the Commonwealth shall spend money in this direction. I congratulate honorable senators who have become so jealous of the interests of the States, even in so small a matter of expenditure. Nevertheless, I cannot but wonder at their change of attitude. Judging from what one can read in the newspapers, one would assume that they were particularly anxious that the Commonwealth Parliament should take all it could from the States. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot take the newspapers as invariably accurate interpreters of the views of honorable senators opposite, but I do know that it has been reported that there is a strong party in this Parliament which is using its endeavours to take all that is possible from the States. A senator who cannot speak from expert knowledge on the question before us has to make up his mind from arguments that have been used in the course of debate. But arguments of the kind that I have just described are not, I venture to say, very well worth listening to. </para>

                            <para>- There were other arguments with which I shall deal in the course of my speech. It seems to me that the opposition to the Bill entirely misconceives its purpose, which is to identify the Commonwealth with the States in the work of investigating the important scientific problems which are necessarily associated with agriculture. There are very few senators who are more anxious than I am to preserve the rights of the States over the development of their territories, and if I thought for a moment that the Bill contemplated any intrusion on that domain, or any interference with the operations of each </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the States will continue to do so, but I wish to assure the honorable senator, who must be reckoned as to a large extent an agricultural expert, that if this Bill be properly administered, it is not possible that the Commonwealth will interfere with that work. As the Constitution stands, the Bill will not empower the Federal Government to interfere in the slightest tittle with the work of the States in this regard. Honorable senators on the other side imagine that power will exist in the Bill to interfere with the States' control of their own lands, and their development, whether by railways or by science. But if honorable senators will reflect for a moment, they will see that it cannot endow -the Commonwealth with that power, because at any time the States will have the right to ask the High Court to restrain the Commonwealth, and keep it in its place until the Constitution is amended. If recent circumstances had riot shown that there should be created a kind of guaranteeing authority which the States might consult in matters; of difficulty, 1 should not be an advocate of this measure. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that any extra expense has -been unnecessarily cast upon the taxpayers, because in the past the States have been driven by the circumstances of our position to consult with the Commonwealth authorities on subjects directly or indirectly connected with our work. But here is the position which has arisen, and which has a strong influence on my mind. As regards the development of agriculture, we know that between the States there are conflicting decisions and conflicting rules of administration as to the exportation and importation of the most valuable of agricultural produce. Over and over again a State has complained that another State has used its police power to exclude the products of that State, in order that certain producers or bands of producers might exploit their own State. Take, for instance, the potato blight. Two or three States are -now at loggerheads, and New South Wales is accusing Victoria of using for selfish reasons, its particular jurisdiction to the prejudice of potato-growers elsewhere. It is the same with New South Wales. The States have recently been brought into conflict over this matter. Frequently the State experts give to their respective Departments advice which is absolutely conflicting and contradictory. The result is that, in the interchange of products there is a perpetual and irritating conflict. If my honorable friends on the other side are content with that, I, strong supporter as I am of State Rights, am not. I am anxious to see a free interchange of products, especially manufactured products, between the States. So far as is possible, the interchange of animal and agricultural products should be placed on the same footing. At present the only bar to such an interchange is an eternal conflict between the scientific experts of the States. On the advice of its experts one State immediately proceeds to prohibit the products of another State; then the next State seeks reprisals, an3 thus the very intention of the Constitution, that there shall be a free interchange of products, is steadily frustrated. It may be urged that the States have the power to enforce their rights with regard to the interchange of products, and that the Commonwealth has a like power. If the Commonwealth thinks that a State is unduly interfering with the transmission of products into another State, it has the right to appeal to the High Court to put an end to the dispute between the- two States. Conversely, a State may think that certain regulations devised by experts are an undue interference with its trade with another State. That State has also the power to appeal to the High Court for an interpretation. The one source of relief at present is the High Court, with all its attendant expense. In the face of a difficulty of that kind, there is no State which will agree to rush into the High Court without having been given some extraordinary provocation. Conversely the proposition is equally good. The Commonwealth naturally refrains from bringing the States before the High Court, and the result is that there is a conflict between the States on this important point. The sources of conflict are continually increasing, and with a view to promoting the best interests of the States, the Commonwealth should establish a scientific tribunal which, not by reason of superior scientific knowledge, but by reason of its independent and impartial position, could be asked as a sort of scientific arbitrator, to express an opinion. The Government have no desire, I think, to intrude upon the jurisdiction or work of the States. Their aim is to establish a Bureau which will comprise some scientific experts of such acknowledged eminence in their respective departments that when a conflict arises between the States, the latter will appeal to that scientific tribunal, which will be able to give an impartial decision. The Commonwealth can ask the Court to put an end to the strife, or the States may make that appeal. In the face of the loss which is being suffered by the States in the present conflict, will my honorable friends on the other side say that some expense, not necessarily a large one, cannot be wisely incurred ? </para>

The words which I have quoted from the report of the Conference held at Hobart in 1909 show that the Premiers were unable to say, until the Commonwealth Parliament took action, whether it intended to assist in or interfere with scientific inquiry in connexion with agriculture by the State authorities. Sooner or later the Commonwealth authority must follow the example set by the Government of every other civilized State, and begin the work of the scientific development of agriculture. The Government propose that we should begin this work now, .and so far from the State Premiers being directly ' hostile to action by the Commonwealth in this direction, they admit in their latest statement that until they know what action the Commonwealth Parliament proposes to take they are unable to say whether it will conflict with State jurisdiction or not. It is universally admitted that the work of the United States Bureau of Agriculture has been of incalculable benefit not only to that country, but to the whole world. I ask honorable senators who are opposing this Bill to say in what way the United States Bureau has conflicted with the jurisdiction of the State authorities in that country. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's interjection is not to the point. The point is that the Government of the various States of the United States has the same control over agricultural production within their boundaries that our State Governments have. State bureaux have been established, and for forty years their work and' the work of the Federal Bureau at Washington have been coordinated, without any complaint on the part of the Government of any one of the United States that the action of the Federal Government has in any way restricted them in the work of agricultural development. </para>

                            <para>- I do not admit that the State bureaux in the United States had done nothing up to the time that the Federal authority established its Bureau of Agriculture. It is a remarkable feature, which should arrest the attention of honorable senators who oppose the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau for the Commonwealth, that immediately the Federal Government instituted an Agricultural Bureau for the United States, the State Governments began to emulate the Federal authority in the matter of scientific investigation, and it cannot be shown that the State and Federal Bureaux have at any time been in conflict. I admit that if we had an Administration which was inspired by a desire to bring about unification some cause might exist for apprehension. </para>

                            <para>- Then, why should not the honorable senator hear it again ? If the Government were animated by a desire to bring about unification, they might precipitate a conflict with the States. But surely even a Ministry which was composed of members of the Labour party would not be disposed to lightly thrust aside the splendid results which have been obtained by the Agricultural Departments in the various States, in order to bring about a conflict with those States!. They would be rash, indeed, or worse than rash, if they attempted to do that. I take it that this Bill contemplates the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture consisting mainly of scientific investigators whose researches will be such that, should a .conflict occur between the States themselves in reference to the interchange of plants or animals, or upon any matter connected with plant or animal disease, reference may be made to it as a thoroughly impartial tribunal. To me, it is evident that, if something be not done by this Parliament to compose the differences which at present exist between the States in regard to the exclusion of each other's products, litigation will result in the High Court. In any such litigation, the Commonwealth will be bound to intervene. But how can the Commonwealth appear as a .litigant before the High Court unless its position can be supported by scientific experts? There need be no fear that, under this Bill, injury will be done to the Agricultural Departments of the States. On the other hand, it contains immense possibilities for good. We all know that about i860, the French vineyards were threatened with destruction by a certain species of caterpillar. The State experts failed to discover, either the origin of the disease, or a means of destroying it. The Italian Government occupied a similar position, and, therefore, the services of the great Pasteur were requisitioned to investigate the pest. He did so, and his efforts resulted in the saving of the silk industry. Indeed, it is calculated that his labours within four or five years, not only restored the silk industry - which was valued at £250,000,000 - to France, but saved it for all time. We also remember the investigations of the celebrated Koch, of Berlin, in reference to anthrax ; and we know how those investigations resulted in the development of the cattle industry,  not only in France and Germany, but throughout the world. This Bill ' aims at establishing nothing more nor less than a Bureau of Advice consisting of impartial experts whose reputation will be sufficient to establish their standing amongst the States. </para>

                            <para>- I am not disputing the efficiency of a single Department of Agriculture within the States. But we must all recognise that a conflict is imminent between the States in reference to the exclusion of each other's products. Apparently, they are unable to reconcile their differences. It is of vast importance that the possibility of such a conflict shall be ended without delay. I can see only one way out of the difficulty, and that is by the establishment of a Bureau of Advice consisting of scientific experts, whose reputation will be such that the States, when they cannot agree amongst themselves, can confidently refer the matter in dispute to them. If honorable senators opposite think for a moment that this Bill goes too far in the matter of interfering with State jurisdiction, they have an effective remedy in their hands. They can refuse to grant the necessary supply to enable a Federal' Bureau of Agriculture to be established. The Bill merely gives expression to a desire on the part of the Government to secure the best expert knowledge that is available upon agricultural subjects - to collect the results of the experiments conducted all over the globe, and to impart that information to the States. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and others imagine for a moment that the Bill unduly trenches upon the powers of the States, they can resist any proposal to grant Supply for the purpose of promoting scientific investigation by the Department. </para>

                            <para>- Then what is the use of it ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger went on to say in his usual free and eloquent style that he had read in the newspapers the statement that the members of the Opposition were anxious to squeeze every penny that they could out of the States. May I point out to him that the opposition to this Bill is not based upon financial considerations at all. It is rather based upon the fact that everything which a Federal Bureau of Agriculture could accomplish is already being accomplished by the States and in a better manner. Regarding the assertion that the Opposition desire to squeeze every penny they can from the States, I wish to give it an emphatic denial. I am surprised that any honorable senator should believe such a foolish story. We are endeavouring to protect the States and to hold the scales evenly in all matters as between the States and the Commonwealth. If in doing that, we sometimes appear to be jealously guarding national interests, we cannot justly be accused of attempting to deprive the States of their financial resources. I hold that every function which is outlined in the Bill is already being adequately discharged by the States.

                    <para class="block">During the course of this debate it has been frequently stated that many, if not all of the States, are already attending to these matters. If the position were otherwise - if the States were not paying attention to such all-important matters as horticultural, viticultural and dairying pursuits, the Bill would be worthy of consideration. My opposition to it is not of a facetious character. I recognise the importance of fully developing the agricultural, horticultural and viticultural industries of the Commonwealth. If I did not realize that in many of the States everything possible was being done in that direction, I would welcome this Bill. But before I resume my seat I intend to prove that the States are looking after these matters in a more able and practical manner than a Federal Agricultural Bureau could possibly do. When he was speaking upon this Bill the other evening, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> referred to Rhodesia. He told us that in that country there was a Director of Agriculture, an entomologist, and other expert officers, assisted by a staff of junior officers ; and he gave that as a reason why we should establish a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, entirely forgetting that by so doing we should be simply adding another Department to four or five that already exist in the States. The next point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> raised was in the nature of a protest against any attempt on the. part of the Commonwealth to centralize. But in the very same breath in which he ridiculed the idea of centralization he advocated the centralization of our Agricultural Departments. A more inconsistent position it is difficult to conceive. The Bill provides for the making of experimental investigations. For that purpose we shall require the services of experts. But there are experts in the various States who are already doing similar work. Consequently there is a danger of conflict of opinion and authority between the national experts and the State experts. We have in Western Australia an entomologist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Compere, who has been sent by the Government to other parts of the world conducting investigations into the eradication of the fruit fly, and other pests by means of parasites. The expenses in connexion with his researches have been borne by the Western Australian and Californian Governments. When these experiments were first instituted there was a doubt amongst the fruit-growers of Western Australia as to whether the money would be wisely spent, and whether beneficial results would be obtained. There is now a general concurrence of opinion amongst the growers that the researches of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Compere</inline> have been beneficial. But there is another expert in New South Wales, Mr.Froggart, whose opinions on these matters carry considerable weight, and must necessarily be respected. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Froggart</inline> does not believe in the parasites introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Compere.</inline> Now, it is just possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Froggart</inline> maybecome our Commonwealth expert. In that case, we might have him laying an embargo on the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Compere.</inline> Although the Western Australian people might consider the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Compere</inline> to be beneficial, the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth expert in charge of the Bureau of Agriculture might say. " No, you cannot proceed with that work." There we should have at once the commencement of friction. . I have not an intimate knowledge of the work which is being done in all the States, but I do know what is being done in Western Australia. Useful information has also been given to us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell as to the good work being done in South Australia. That information surely might be the means of causing honorable senators to pause before voting for the second reading of this Bill. The Agricultural Department of Western Australia is conducting practical scientific work in relation to agriculture in all its various branches. At the head of the Department is Professor Lowrie, an agricultural authority well known throughout Australasia. Under his control there are five State experimental farms, namely, these at Nangeenan, Chapman, Hamel, Brunswick, and Narrogin. The Nangeenan and Chapman farms are used for experiments in relation to cereals. Endeavours have been made to discover the wheat that is most suitable for growing in Western Australia. Every variety of wheat and oats considered suitable to Western Australian conditions has been planted under various methods in regard to soils, fertilizers and cultivation. In addition, experiments are being carried out at the Nangeenan farm, with a view to ascertain the best fodders for sheep-raising in the eastern districts. After harvesting the seed of the most successful crops is sold to the farmers. At the Hamel State Farm a special feature takes the form of experiments in connexion with permanent pastures, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ber.thoul</inline> has carried out a number of interesting and successful experiments in hybridizing wheat. One of the varieties bred by him, known as Alpha, has proved itself to be one of the most suitable wheats for the lighter rainfall districts lying between the Midland and Great Southern railways and the ten degrees rainfall line. Further down, on the Great Southern line, at -Brunswick, there is a State dairy farm, where experiments are being carried out in connexion with .irrigation and the growing of fodder crops for ensilage, &amp;c. There are stud stock, at the farm and the progeny , are sold to the farmers. There was a good deal of doubt when the Brunswick State farm was established as to its work. The Minister of Lands experienced a . considerable amount of opposition, founded on a doubt as to whether irrigation could be successfully conducted in that country. But by perseverance and persistency he has proved .that it can be done. There is also a stock branch of the Department under the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weir,</inline> who has under him a number of experienced inspectors. Throughout the winter months <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weir</inline> delivers a series of lectures, in various parts of the State on diseases of stock, their prevention and cure, and on breeding and raising. We also have in Western Australia in connexion with the Agricultural. Department an analyst whose services are available in connexion with the analysis of soils and other scientific work. In this connexion I. may mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mann,</inline> the Government Analyst, has discovered an antidote for the poison weeds of Western Australia. In connexion with the horticultural -branch of the Department a considerable amount of attention has been paid to the prevention and eradication  of fruit pests. Some years ago the Department adopted the system of eradication of orchard pests by parasites ; and, as I have already mentioned, the Californian Department of Agriculture agreed to defray half the expenses of the Western Australian Government entomologist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Compere,</inline> incurred in this connexion. I think I have now furnished proof that so far as Western Australia is concerned there is no necessity for the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture. Similar testimony has been given from' South Australia, and I daresay before the debate closes tangible -evidence to the same effect will be given from the other States. Reverting to the work of the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, I may mention that experts in all branches are retained to assist any of the farmers who desire their services. In the annual report of the Secretary for Agriculture complete details are given of the results of all experimental work. The Department also controls and runs its own refrigerating works at Perth, and abattoirs at Kalgoorlie. It is likewise proposed to establish further large refrigerating works at North Fremantle and abattoirs in the principal centres. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in moving the second reading of the Bill, quoted a resolution passed by the Nurserymen's Association, in favour of the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture; and the honorable senator relied upon it as a principal argument in favour of the Bill becoming law. I have every respect for a resolution passed by an association which has an intimate knowledge of the subject with which we are dealing. I admit that the opinion of the association in question is worthy of consideration. But because an association of that kind has passed such a resolution that is no reason why we should pass this Bill. Any amount of evidence has been adduced to show that such an organization is not necessary. There is another phase of the question which it may be well for us to consider, and that is the importance of a local knowledge of soils, pests, and similar matters. The officers of the Commonwealth Bureau cannot have that intimate and technical knowledge of the nature of soils and the changes in the atmosphere which the experts in the State Departments have. One of the principal factors in the success of the experiments conducted by the officials of the States has been that they possess an intimate knowledge of local conditions. It has been stated by men who know what they are speaking about, that an experiment with certain parasites in Western Australia, which might prove successful there, might be a hopeless failure if tried in Victoria or New South Wales. I cannot see how a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, if created, can assist in anyway the farming, agricultural, or dairying community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> in a very half-hearted speech in support of the Bill, admitted the danger of a conflict of opinion between the Federal and State experts. That is a great danger which we have to guard against. There is no escaping from the fact that, no matter how strong might be the representation of one State expert in connexion with a certain matter, the opinion of the Federal expert would always be taken, and, consequently there is a danger that some State, might suffer. I do not think that there is any necessity for me to further labour the question. It might be a very wise act on the part of the Government to beat a graceful retreat and withdraw the measure. All I have to say in conclusion is that, were there not in existence State Departments of Agriculture, which are doing this work in a more effective way than a Commonwealth Department could do it, I would support the Bill ; but, in present circumstances, I feel compelled to vote against its second reading. </para>

                            <para>- I heard that remark made more than once by the last  speaker.  In the exercise of the Commonwealth's undoubted power to establish a Bureau of Agriculture, the Bill proposes to follow well considered lines, which have served us in analogous circumstances. By a measure which was almost parallel in form, we brought into existence our Department of Census and Statistics. By a measure similarly drafted, and by a procedure which it is proposed to follow in this instance, we established our Bureau of Meteorology. Every argument which was used by the last  speaker  could have been used with equal effect in opposition to those two measures. These arguments, however, were not adduced ; and if they had been adduced, our present experience of the operation of those measures would have shattered them to pieces. Will any person venture to say that the Department of Census and Statistics has not justified its existence? Although it has been in active existence for two or three years, still there remain in the several States Statistical Departments carrying out their work as theretofore. There has been no clashing with the Commonwealth Department. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> referred to an expert in Western Australia who has applied himself assiduously to the study of certain matters in connexion with agriculture or horticulture, and suggested the possibility, if this measure were passed, of a. Commonwealth officer intervening and preventing his methods from being carried out. There can be no possible clash of authority so far. as Executive action is concerned, although  there might be a difference of opinion, and it would then be for individual agriculturists or horticulturists who were affected to take which opinion they chose. They would at least have the benefit of two opinions, instead of one. The object of this measure is not to supersede the State systems which aim at the improvement of agriculture within their several territorial limits. Nor is it for the purpose of adding an additional huge Department, which might be practically in many respects duplicating the work of one or more of the State Departments, or which would be charged with, functions that would make their work overlap. Quite the contrary. The object is to bring into existence a central body of qualified individuals, empowered by law to obtain from the State experts all the information which they possibly can regarding matters that will be of general interest, and not merely of interest to one particular State. That information will be collated, co-ordinated, and compared, and the result of the work will be distributed throughout the Commonwealth. Will it be pretended that  there  is in existence at present an organization which is attempting to do any portion of such work? </para>

                            <para>- That is purely voluntary action, more or less spasmodic, and possibly only on occasions when there is no conflict between them. We have only to look at the daily newspapers for the last few months to find one State  vieing  with another in the endeavour to shut out staple products of a third, and that there is a conflict of opinion between the several State experts as to the desirableness or otherwise of excluding one another's products. It is a curious coincidence, in many such cases, that the opinions of the State experts seem to be inclined to what may be considered parochial interests; and when I make that remark, I do not intend  to  reflect upon them. There is not the slightest doubt that very often at the first sign of disease amongst certain agricultural products of a State, a panic arises amongst those who are charged with the responsibility of keeping similar products free from disease in another State where it is not supposed to exist. I think I have made it clear that the Agricultural Bureau is not intended to be a new huge Department overlapping, in the discharge of its duties, the work which is done by, any one of the existing State systems; but that, on the contrary, it will be one which, as a central body, will receive from each State all the information which is not merely of peculiar value to a single State, utilizing it for the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. As regards the distribution of the results of. comparisons, how is it possible for a single State, or for the six States, by voluntary action in present circumstances, to effectively distribute such information? It is not possible. When we consider, however, the organization of the Public Service, we see that the Commonwealth has at its disposal every  facilty  which can be desired for the effective distribution of the results of the investigations of a central body. For one thing, it has the organization of the Post Office. It has also the organization which is associated with the collection and compilation of statistics, and the work which is done by that organization at present will be perfected by utilizing it for the collection and dissemination of the .results of the proposed investigations. That work, and the work of a central Bureau of Agriculture will, in a reflex way, each assist to perfect the other. </para>

                            <para>- The clause with regard to organization. My honorable friend must remember that this? is a skeleton measure such as were the Census and Statistics Bill, and the Bureau of Meteorology Bill. It is intended, by a procedure similar to that which followed the passage of those measures, to establish a Bureau of Agriculture which, day by day, week by week, and year by year, will develop itself upon the general lines laid down in the Statute, and upon provisions that will be made by the Minister in due conformity with the Statute. In some of his concluding remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> referred to the fact that in these matters, a great deal of value attached to an intimate personal acquaintance with the locality. I was rather sorry that he did not. use that argument a little earlier, because, if I remember rightly, in <inline font-style="italic">America at Work,</inline> Foster Fraser refers to the splendid work which is done by the Department of Agriculture at Washington. I have not had time to turn up the reference, but shall do so' and ask some later speaker to quote it. He states that samples of soil from widely different parts of the whole territory of the United States are sent to the Department,  and that it is asked to report as to the quality of the soil, its suitability or otherwise for certain productions, and the particular products for which it is best adapted. </para>

                            <para>- A central Department which day by day handles samples of soil from the whole of the States, is far more likely to be able to say for which) particular production a certain sample is suitable than is one whose experience is confined to the soils, varying though they may be, of one particular State. The Federal experts will have a wider range of experience. They will know what  .5-  taking place in all parts of Australia. There may be one part of Australia, for instance, where a particular product is grown to an enormous extent, and another part where no individual ever thinks of turning his soil to account for that form of production. Yet it may be that there are some isolated tracts of soil in the second-named State which would be equally productive if turned to the purpose which I mentioned with regard to the first-named State. Honorable senators who oppose this Bill on the ground that it does not provide for the establishment of an effective department must find it hard to reconcile their attitude with their support of two measures of a similar character, the results from which have justified their passage beyond all expectation. </para>

                            <para>- I refer to the measures which so far as the circumstances rendered it possible were identical in form with this Bill, and under which we established the Department of Census and Statistics and the Department of Meteorology. In answer to the argument that a Federal Agricultural Bureau would overlap the work at present being done by the State Agricultural Departments, I say that honorable senators must see that that is not at all the object of this measure. Its object is rather to bring about the harmonious co-operation . of a central body in touch with each one of the State systems, drawing from each, all that is not purely parochial in character, but to the best interests of the Commonwealth. By the investigation and comparison of that information, and the publication of results, the best advantage, not of any single State, but of the whole of the States of the Commonwealth' will be served. I hope that honorable senators will see that in passing this measure they will be exercising a power which it is not only desirable that the Commonwealth Parliament should exercise, but one which it. has too long neglected to exercise, and which <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> the interests of the producers of Australia it is the bounden duty of this Parliament to now exercise. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened to a great deal of the debate on the second reading of this Bill. Many references have been made to the troubles that have arisen as the result of the action of State Governments in dealing with various diseases and pests affecting plants and animals. Only two years ago- it was proposed in this Parliament that the Commonwealth authorities should deal with these matters under the Quarantine Act. Honorable senators who are strongly supporting this measure denounced that proposal as an interference with State rights. They contended then that it was necessary that the State Government should be permitted to administer this kind of legislation for themselves. Although the Government have power by proclamation under the Quarantine Act to assume responsibility for dealing with these matters, no Federal Government has since the passing of the Quarantine Act dreamt of doing anything of the sort. Complaint is made at the present time that the authorities of one State prevent the introduction of the products of another on the ground that they fear the spread of certain diseases. I have been looking up the report of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock, and I find that  the Federal Government withdrew from the business-paper of a conference of experts a matter affecting the Inter- State transfer of products which had been set down for discussion. The Federal Government went so far as to inform the State Governments through this conference of State experts that they did not intend in  any way to avail themselves of the powers given them under the Quarantine Act, but would leave the whole matter to the administration of the' State Governments. On the first page of the report to which I have referred I find the following : - </para>

                        <para>An important meeting of representatives of the different Departments of the States was held in Melbourne during March to consider and suggest  the  best methods whereby the Quarantine Act of the Commonwealth, so far as it relates to stock and plants, could be worked to the best interests of the States. This Department was represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> P. Orr, the  Deputy  Chief Inspector of Stock ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> Dodd, the Principal Veterinary Surgeon and Bacteriologist, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> H. Benson, the Instructor in Fruit Culture. The findings of this Conference were submitted to the Commonwealth authorities, and, no doubt, influenced the regulations which have been issued under the Act. An important point in connexion with this Conference was that, although the power to regulate diseases by sea (Inter-State) and internally with regard to Australia, is apparently embodied in the Act, discussion upon these matters was withdrawn by the Commonwealth authorities from the. business-paper, with an intimation that there is no present intention of interfering in such matters. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is argued in support of this Bill that the Commonwealth Government should have the power to take action in these matters, but the fact remains that, although they have the power under the Quarantine Act, they are not prepared to exercise it, because they have intimated to the State Governments that it is not at present their intention to do so. Of what use is it in these circumstances for one honorable senator, after another, to get .up and say that if we pass this Bill it will have some effect in .preventing one State from refusing to admit the products of another and from quarantining the products, of a certain area in another State? The power to do this was given to the Federal Government by this Parliament two years ago, and we have not since had a Federal Government with sufficient backbone to exercise it. At a first glance one might be disposed to support such a Bill as this. When I saw it first I thought that it might be used to stimulate the agricultural industry in the various States. Then I began to wonder how under this Bill a Federal  Agricultural  Bureau could do any more than is being done at present by the various State Agricultural Departments. The Bill involves the establishment of another Federal Department, and we are told that attached to it there will be experts in all branches of scientific agriculture. I am afraid that that hope is one which will not be realized. The officers of this Department will be members of the Commonwealth Public Service and under the Public Service Act, unless the Public Service Commissioner is prepared to certify that there is no man in any Commonwealth Departments or in any of the State Departments competent to fill these positions, we shall be unable to go outside to secure men for trie purpose. If, for instance,  Ave  require an experienced bacteriologist at the head of this Department, is it likely that the Public Service Commissioner will  certify  that all the men employed in that capacity in the State Departments are incompetent? No honorable senator would contend that the Public Service Commissioner is likely to do anything of the sort. The men holding these positions in the various State Departments have been selected because they were believed to be  competent,  and the best men who could be secured. It is not unreasonable to suppose that many of these State experts would be applicants for positions in connexion with the Federal Agricultural Bureau, and the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner would have to certify that they are all incompetent, before we could go outside to select an expert. This would apply to every branch of agriculture. We are told by those who support this Bill that the experts of the Federal department will be able to give advice to the various State departments. What has been the experience of the past? Let me: say that in Queensland a great deal of' trouble has been experienced in dealing1 with the tick pest, and I do not think that if 'a Federal Bureau of Agriculture were established it could do any more than the Queensland Government have done in connexion "with this matter. As soon as the  pest was discovered in the north, the State" Government tried by every means in their - power to prevent its spread. When they realized that the pest was spreading in spite of all their efforts they selected two men, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> an expert in stock,-; and. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hunt,</inline> and commissioned them to go to America and find out all they: could there "as ' to what should be done  to prevent the spread of the tick pest and the red-water disease. Very little advantage was derived from the investigation of these commissioners in the United States, because it was discovered that the State Agricultural Department had by the construction of dips and the quarantining of cattle in various areas done all that it was possible to do to prevent the spread of the pest. </para>

                            <para>- The State Departments there are doing excellent work, but they are doing it under the direction of the Federal authorities. Only the other evening <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> spoke of the way in which the central Department makes grants of land to the States for the purpose of experimental farms. Indeed, it assists them in every possible way, so that they may keep the Central Bureau supplied with up-to-date information. But in Australia the system which has hitherto been in vogue has been for each State to do all that it possibly could to disseminate knowledge amongst those who are engaged in agricultural and stock-raising pursuits. Let me cite as an illustration the grub pest which made its appearance in the sugar industry. I contend that everything which could be done by a Federal Bureau of Agriculture in the direction of getting rid of that grub has already been done by the Queensland Agricultural Department. The Government of that State have obtained all the information that it is possible to secure in this connexion from outside sources. It also requisitioned the services of one of the recognised experts of the world- </para>

                            <para>- A Federal Bureau of Agriculture could accomplish nothing which is not being accomplished by the States at the present time. Let .us look at the work which the Queensland Department of Agriculture is attempting to perform.  1  hold in my hand the official journal of that Department. It contains reports by the principal of the agricultural division and the chemistry division, by the principal veterinary surgeon and bacteriologist, by the instructor in fruit culture, the instructor in tropical agriculture, and the colonial botanist. Some of these men are as eminent in their profession as are any to be found in Australia. In fact, the Queensland botanist is in the very forefront of that branch of science to-day. The journal also includes reports by the entomologist arid vegetable pathologist, the tobacco expert, and the dairy expert, in addition to reports from the managers of about six or seven farms, and agricultural and pastoral statistics. If the Central Bureau of Agriculture were to undertake all these functions, what would be the position ? Simply that the Government would be afforded an opportunity of extending a large amount of patronage without diminishing the expenditure of the States by a single penny, because the States would require officers to fill the vacancies caused by the appointment of any of their own officers to the Central Bureau. Unless the Public Service Commissioner is prepared to certify that none of the officers connected with the Slate Agricultural Departments are competent, their places would have to be filled - in the event of their appointment to the </para>

                        <para>I need not take up the time of the Conference in labouring this motion. It is really a complementary motion to the one we have just carried. The previous one dealt with the immigration question in connexion with land settlement, and incidentally, agricultural development as well. The second resolution deals with the development of agricultural resources purely as a matter of State concern, and irrespective altogether of immigration or foreign action, and the reason it is placed on the business-paper is that, in my opinion, it is desirable to declare our own views upon this point; because recently on an occasional visit to Wagga, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne was present, he took the opportunity in the course of a speech he made there to indicate that the intention of the Federal Government was to establish an Agricultural Department. Now, if there is one thing with which the internal policy of a States is entirely associated it is the "question of agri-cultural  development and the general expansion of agricultural resources. I do not understand how at the present time the Commonwealth Government can establish an Agricultural Department without directly impinging and encroaching upon the functions reserved to themselves by the States in regard to agriculture. I think that on this question we are all absolutely in agreement. Therefore, I need not take up time on the subject, except to say that in our opinion it is necessary to declare that the work of developing our agricultural resources is entirely a question of State concern. </para>

I have made several protests in public speeches on the matter, and have interviewed Federal Ministers, to whom I declared my opposition to the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau or Department until there has been a Conference called of the Premiers or the Ministers of Agriculture of the States in order to see whether it is actually necessary, and if it is necessary, what departmental work should be taken up by the Federal authorities, and what should be kept in the hands of the States, with a view, on account of our small population, of preventing duplication. For duplication will inevitably take place if a new Department is established. </para>

That is to say, more and more work was being taken up by the central authority, in spite of the fact that a large amount of assistance was being given by the central Government to the various State institutions.

                        <para>For the past fifteen years the Federal Department has grown rapidly, but in spite of this growth there has been a lack of definite policy regarding the respective spheres of Federal and State activity. This has led to duplication of work and considerable friction along certain lines. One general statement holds good. The growth of the Federal Department has been accompanied by a corresponding decline in the vigour and influence in the State Departments. To-day the only State agricultural agency which can be considered to have a standing at all comparable to the Federal agricultural bureaux are the State experimental stations. And the popularity of these stations rests in some measure on the fact that they are supported in part by Federal appropriations. Last year the amount of the appropriations was  740,000  dollars. The cause of the growth of the Federal and the decline of the State bureaux lies quite largely outside the character of the work done. One is popular because the people do not realize that they are taxed for it; the other is subject to constant criticism because its expenses are known to increase taxation. The expenses of the Federal bureaux are paid from indirect taxation, and the expenses of State bureaux are from direct taxation. State legislators who make appropriations for State bureaux are always on the defensive, because this work means an increase in taxation. The congressman or senator who secures an appropriation for work by the Federal Department in his State is looked upon at home as a benefactor. Public opinion in the United States regards the Federal Treasury as a common hopper, in which forty-six States are engaged in a scramble to get the largest possible share. The congressman or senator who can secure a public building or an investigation of pear blight by a Federal bureaux has only commendation for his achievement; and this means praise for the pear-blight worker as well. The State Bureaux; especially the State experimental stations, have made numerous protests against what they term an encroachment on the Federal Department. Committees" have been appointed at their annual conventions to present to the Secretary of Agriculture the protests of the State stations against the duplication of Stale work by the Federal Department, and asking for the limitation of the scope of the Federal Department's work. The action of these Committees has, however, lacked the vigour and definiteness necessary to accomplish anything. The reason of this is that the State stations are not supported by local sentiment or by their congressional delegations. During the past five years they have been moving along a more effective line. That is, they are pressing for Federal appropriation for State stations. Success in such an appropriation makes the senator or congressman as popular at home as in getting an appropriation for work in his State by the Federal bureaux. In the last five years there have been secured large Federal appropriations for State- stations under what is known as the Adam's fund, an increase in the Hatch fund, and Federal appropriation for State horse-breeding establishments. I would point out that, although there has been a huge expenditure in the past on account of Federal experimental work in the United States, the matter has now taken a reverse step, and the Federal authorities are making appropriations for the State authorities to carry out that work. We want to be very careful how far we go here in initiating establishments similar to those in the United States. </para>

                        <para>I am entirely in accord with what has fallen from the Premier of New South Wales and from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne.</inline> In reply to the suggestion made by the Acting Premier of South Australia, that any resolution we pass here can have little effect, I may say that the last time this matter was discussed in Conference at Hobart the then Prime Minister stated that the right of the State Premiers was keenly realized. They should, he said, be consulted in the sense in which responsible Ministers intrusted with responsible duties should consult other men intrusted with  similar  duties. He added : " We are very anxious, before introducing measures to the Federal Parliament, to have the advantage of the opinions of this Conference." The honorable member will see that it is the desire of the Commonwealth to have our views on this very important matter. It was brought up in Hobart by the then Minister of Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> who stated that it was the intention of the Federal Government to establish an Agricultural Department. He said that he considered the Constitution of the Commonwealth had greatly circumscribed the power of the State Agricultural Departments to do all that they might desire in the way of developing the agricultural industries. The Constitution, for. instance, had' taken away from the States .the .right to encourage the production or export of products by means of bounties or bonuses. But- there are many other ways in which the State Governments can insure agricultural development. Something like ^,"50,000 from revenue was spent in our State last year in connexion with the development of agriculture, while no less than £158,000 was spent from loan. We are: establishing State experimental farms in the different districts of the State, so that the settlers in those localities may have the opportunity of profiting by the experimental work that is done by the Government. I certainly think that if a Federal Agricultural Department is established there is every likelihood of a duplication of work. The development of our agricultural lands is, in my opinion, purely a matter for the States ; and I am satisfied, as far as our own State is concerned, that anything that the State Government could do in that way would be of very great value. </para>

' Each member of the Conference, I think, spoke upon this matter. In the first place, the opinion was expressed that it was doubtful whether the Federal Government had power  to establish  such a Department. 'We have at various times passed "legislation which has been the subject of  appeals to  the High Court by .the States, .and we know very well that if the  States believed that the Commonwealth was 'interfering with matters that concerned them alone, in all probability this matter .would also form the subject of an appeal.

There is another aspect of this matter. If there were reason for believing that the States were not doing the best they could within their own sphere, I could easily understand the Federal Government wanting to establish a Bureau. But at present the Federal Government has not a solitary inch of land upon which to do anything in the way of experiment. There is some talk of taking over the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- I have already quoted the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> a former Minister of Agriculture in., Victoria - a man who, I believe, has done everything possible to promote agricultural interests in his own State- who has pointed out that all the important work in America is by no means being done by the Central Bureau, but that there is more activity in the State Bureaux than there ever was before. But my point is that in this country we have all classes of soils, and can produce all varieties of agricultural produce. In Tasmania, in the south, we can grow products that nourish in temperate climates; in Queensland, in the north, we can grow cotton, coffee, and all kinds of tropical products. The State of Queensland has, I believe, done more in connexion with the development of tropical agriculture than any other State. If they are doing that, would they derive any assistance from the Central Bureau, established at Melbourne or Canberra? No, not unless the Common wealth was able to secure the services of men who had devoted a large amount of attention to tropical agriculture. What would that mean? It would mean that the Commonwealth would have to secure the services of men who, by reason of opportunities afforded to them had been able to become experts, or, at any rate, were students, or had been of some assistance to tropical agriculture. But that would not do any practical good, because in these matters the local interest is what has to be considered. In the case of the sugar industry, what was the position? We had an office in Brisbane, but we also had different stations established at various centres along the coast. In every district in which men were engaged in growing cane there were experimental stations, where some chemists carried on investigations and gave practical advice to the growers. There was no necessity for a man who was growing cane on the Mosman or the Mulgrave to send samples of soil to Brisbane to be analyzed, because each district had an establishment of its own. Mackay, if I remember aright, had the best establishment in connexion with the industry. There was also an establishment in the Bundaberg district. The men who conducted these establishments were recognised to some extent as expert chemists. The Brisbane office was simply an office in which all the clerical work was done, and from which reports were issued, but the practical work was done in the various districts along the coast. Suppose that the Commonwealth established a Bureau of Agriculture at Canberra, would the men in Northern Queensland have to send samples of soil to that place before they could get any assistance, or would the Commonwealth establish experimental stations along the coast, and maintain experts there? A Central Bureau is not necessary. By means of experimental stations and tropical experimental farms, the Queensland Government are doing all that they possibly can to assist tropical agriculture in the State. We cannot expect a man who is resident in the southern portion of Australia to understand what is required in the northern portion. Only the other day we had a case in point. Bananas were being sent from Queensland to Melbourne, where the State authorities apparently knew very little about that fruit. They had a regulation that if bananas from the north were not positively green on their arrival they should be destroyed. If, however, the bananas were yellow and fit to be consumed they were not allowed to be landed, but were condemned and ordered to be destroyed. The staff of the State Agricultural Department did not include one man who had ever been in a tropical district, but lately it sent an officer to North Queensland, and he has told the residents that he had learned more there in a. month than he had ever learned in Melbourne. He recognised that the departmental regulations were altogether at fault. He stated that the Department had been penalizing the production of one part of Australia, not because it desired to do an injury to that place, but because it did not know sufficient about the business to be able to frame an intelligent regulation. The regulations have been altered, but not until a considerable agitation had been carried on, and an officer had been sent to the north to recommend to the Department the best method of dealing with the matter. That is a practical illustration of what happens under the existing system. A fruit expert came down from Queensland to Melbourne on two or three occasions to point out the true facts to the Department, but it would not interfere with the regulations until it had despatched an officer to Queensland, and now it is prepared to act far more generously than it had previously done. That is the sort of administration which is required. Unless the Federal Bureau is to be an enormous institution with experimental stations all over Australia, and officers in touch with agriculture, dairying, horticulture, viticulture, live stock and forestry, it will be of very little use indeed.. It is to be charged for instance, with the acquisition and diffusion of information connected with those subjects. But how is it to get the information except from the State Departments? </para>

                            <para>- Probably the Commonwealth would be able to get places in different parts of Australia, provided that it had control of them, but, of course, at present it has not. It will have to depend upon the institutions which the Central Bureau will to some extent duplicate or perhaps supersede. I do not' believe that the States will recede from the position which they have taken up regarding their Agricultural Departments. I. notice that one of the objects of the proposed Central Bureau will be " the carrying out of experiments and investigations." Where is that work to be done? At present the Commonwealth Government do not propose to establish experimental farms in connexion with tropical or semi-tropical or temperate climate agriculture. I do not see what a Central Bureau could possibly do except collect information from the State Departments, collate it, and circulate it throughout Australia. It certainly could not get more information from outside sources than do the State Departments. If I know anything about the State experts, they are obtaining from countries in which experiments are being carried out, all the information which is. suitable to assist the development of agriculture in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly they are, and they are doing the practical work in the very place where it is most valuable to agriculturists. My opinion is that the great body of agriculturists would never come into contact with the proposed Central Bureau. It has been stated that this Bill is similar to that under which the Meteorological Department was established, but that Department does not conduct any experiments. All that it does is to collect information from various officers in the States, collate it in Melbourne, and distribute by telegram information concerning rainfall and weather. Throughout the States it has what may be termed sub-departments. It has officers who are not only collecting information, but issuing warnings. At first I felt inclined to support the second reading of this Bill, but when I looked into its provisions more closely, I recognised that at present the Commonwealth would not be able to do any more than is being done by the States. By-and-by, when it has a territory of its own to develop, it might be able to establish a bureau of agriculture which would enables the Government to assist settlers. But it; would require to collect a considerable quantity of information, especially in connexion with tropical agriculture, before it.  could render useful assistance to those who would be under its direct jurisdiction. I do not think that the Government really intend that the measure shall become law, though, of course, they may want honorable senators to agree to its second reading. I do not believe for a moment that if the Bill were read a second time the Government are prepared to carry it through during this session. It seems to me that it has only been brought in to be used as an electioneering placard, to enable the Government to say, " We wanted to render some assistance to agriculture ; we were prepared to spend a sum of public money with the object of distributing information and making experiments." Believing that the Bill is premature, that there is no business in it, and that it has only been introduced as an electioneering placard, I intend to vote against its second reading. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support the second reading of this Bill, and I hope I shall be able to support the third reading, although that will depend to a great extent upon what the Government have to say as to their, immediate intentions. I support the measure, because of the supreme importance to Australia of primary production. It is the primary producer that we must support and help in every possible way. As showing the importance of our primary products, I should like to say that our export of pastoral products amounts in value to no less than £35,000,000 a year. That is in addition to what we produce for home consumption. The value of our agricultural products is something like £30,000,000 a year, and our dairy products are valued at about £9,000,000. I say that this is a wonderful record for Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Without the assistance so far of a Federal Agricultural Bureau. It is a record of which we in Australia have every reason to be proud. If by scientific investigation, experiment, and research we could increase the average yield of wheat by merely one bushel per acre, we should more than cover the whole cost of any Federal Agricultural Department we might establish. If by research and investigation we can improve and increase our dairying products and other primary products the establishment of a Federal Agricultural Bureau will .be amply justified. There are 14,000,000 acres at present under, cultivation in Australia. But we all know that there are immense areas remaining to be cultivated. We know also that there are great areas of country which at one time were thought to be useless and unfit for cultivation, which can be cultivated with profit. The Adelaide express passes over a stretch of country which is to-day falsely called, " The Ninety-Mile Desert." There was an opinion held at one time that that country was practically useless, and unfit for cultivation, but any one travelling over the railway to-day will see that miles of that country have been brought under cultivation. Not long ago I was myself on a farm in that district, and, although the soil appeared to be worthless, sandy soil, it produced something like 13 bushels of wheat to the acre in the last wheat season. We have scattered throughout the Commonwealth great, areas of what appears to be inferior country, but which, as the result of research, experiment, and knowledge may be brought under profitable cultivation, and so vastly increase the agricultural production of the Commonwealth. It is all very well to establish and protect local manufactures, but after all we can only expect our secondary industries to supply our own requirements. We are unable to export their products, in com petition with the products of similar industries carried on with cheaper labour in other countries. </para>

                            <para>- Naturally they are I say that our distance from the markets of the world and our dearer labour as compared, not only with that of America, but with that of other countries, makes  it impossible for us to export to any great extent the products of our secondary industries. It is all the more necessary that we should do all we can to increase our primary productions. I believe that the establishment of a Federal Agricultural Bureau will be of very great advantage to us in this direction. We have heard a great deal of what has been done, and is at present being done by the State Agricultural Departments. I am not here to belittle their work in any way, and I do not believe that the establishment of a Federal Agricultural Bureau would in any way injure them. I know that splendid work is being done by the Agricultural Departments in New South Wales and in some of the other States. I do not know very much about what is being done in Queensland and in Western Australia, but I know that in Australia five agricultural colleges have been established, and that there are between 600 and 700 students attending them. We have a right to expect a much larger attendance at these colleges in a country like Australia which depends for its prosperity to so great an extent upon the cultivation of the soil. It would be a great deal better if we had 6,000 students attending these colleges. I think that South Australia can claim credit for leading the way in this line of work. I believe that it was in1879 that it was first decided to establish a School of Agriculture in that State, although active operations were not commenced until about1882. The establishment of the Roseworthy college has been of immense benefit to the whole community of South Australia. </para>

The work he is doing is of a very satisfactory character, and of great benefit to the State. South Australia has, I think, what is lacking in all the other States, and that is an Agricultural Bureau, in addition to its Agricultural College. I happened to be <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> intimitely associated with the steps taken to establish the Agricultural Bureau in that State. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Albert</inline> Molineux did a wonderful work for agriculture in Australia - first of all, through 'the <inline font-style="italic">Garden and Field</inline> newspaper, which he carried on, and which he started in my printing office. He was a compositor by trade, and I gave him the opportunity of setting up the paper for himself in my office, and afterwards printed it for him. He was the man who first advocated the establishment of what is now the South Australian Agricultural Bureau. That bureau has at the present time about120 branches throughout the State, composed of practical men, who are working on the soil. They do a great deal of good work. The members have regular meetings, at which they discuss papers of practical interest, exchange experiences, and are generally helpful to one another. We have had people in South Australia experimenting in dry farming for. many years. I believe that even the visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Koebele</inline> to discover an aphis for the destruction of the San Jose scale in America was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Molineux. Mr. Molineux</inline> has an able successor in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Summers,</inline> a young man, who was brought up in the office, and is now carrying on the work there. Honorable senators have complained that this Bill does not propose the establishment of any board. I am personally very glad that it does not. Some honorable senators have said that under this measure we are being asked to give someone a blank cheque which he may fill up with any amount he pleases, but I do not regard it in that light. I consider that by the establishment of a Federal Agricultural Bureau we shall not interfere with, but shall supplement and co-ordinate the valuable work at present done by the various State Departments. Clause 4 of the Bill provides that - </para>

                        <para>To my mind the Agricultural Department of the United States is the most useful organization in the world. It does not do all it sets out to accomplish ; but the machinery is there,  and  the enthusiasm is there. Above nil - and this is the point - it is practical to the American. The results of experiments spell dollars. It is thorough. </para>

                            <para>- We have only been Federated for a few years, and prior to Federation, it was impossible for anything in this connexion to be done by the Federal authority. Consequently, the work was thrown upon the States, and right nobly they have done it. Nobody will wish to depreciate the value of that work, or to see it overlapped in any way. The work of the proposed Bureau of Agriculture is clearly defined in clause 3 of the Bill ; and it is all practical work. I am aware that as yet the Commonwealth possesses no land to which it can devote its energies. But I understand that this Parliament is going to ratify the agreement made with South Australia for the transfer of the Northern Territory. I am led to believe that it does not intend to repudiate that agreement. </para>

                            <para>- May I be permitted to say that the Northern Territory will have to be developed, and developed by white labour. Consequently, there will exist a need for scientific investigation with a view to the encouragement of tropical agriculture. Persons who settle in the Territory will require to know what they ought to grow, and how and when they ought to grow it. We know that the Territory will produce rice and cotton. Indeed, the latter commodity is growing wild there. It will also grow indiarubber, and many other tropical products. Consequently, we shall need to do everything that we can to help the man upon the soil. I do not suggest that we should at once establish a large Federal institution. In my judgment, the first step should be the initiation of an up-to-date scientific laboratory in which experiments may be conducted which cannot be conducted by the States at the present time. Of course, inquiry will have to be made to prevent the possibility of Commonwealth functions overlapping State functions. In short, I think that the Central Bureau of Agriculture should be brought into operation gradually. The question of how much it shall do rests entirely with this Parliament. The Government must state what expenditure they propose to incur, and, unless the authority for that expenditure be forthcoming, they will be powerless. I wish to see a scientific Department established to do work which the States are not capable of doing for the purpose of assisting our primary producers. I feel certain that if this enterprise be managed as it ought to be managed, the States will have no reason to complain, and that the work done will benefit alike the States and the Commonwealth. </para>
