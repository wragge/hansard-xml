                        <para>In Australia there is scarcely a business or occupation of any kind that is not now regulated by an agreement or understanding as to prices and conditions, and the results to the public are altogether satisfactory and beneficial. Space will allow here but a single illustration of this, and we. choose one that may, at the same time, help to show the absurdity of the law, namely, the Newspaper Trust. It is well known that there, is among the newspaper proprietors of Australia an agreement that all cable messages from Europe shall be obtained- through one channel only,' and which in restraint of trade forbids any paper to receive and publish any independent cables. This it is that explains why the cables published daily in all the different papers are identical. As a result of this arrangement, instead of cable news appearing in a small number of larger papers only, every newspaper throughout the Commonwealth, even in the remotest backblocks, is enabled to supply its readers daily with the latest intelligence from all parts of the world. But however beneficial this may be to the public, it is, under the Australian Industries Preservation Act (section 7), an offence, for which the penalty is <inline font-style="italic">Â£500.</inline> However, it is quite certain that no Government will dare to put the law in operation against so powerful an organization as the Press." </para>

                that last week
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                accused me, while claiming a very prominent position in connexion with the establishment of old-age pensions in Australia, of pairing against the Surplus Revenue Bill, without which Bill, he said, old-age pensions could not be paid. I have taken the trouble to look up the matter, and ascertain the facts. At the end of May I asked the then Prime Minister,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline>
                if there was any chance of the question of old-age pensions coming on in Parliament during the session, because I had booked my passage to go to the northern part of Australia, but would not go if the matter was to be dealt with. He assured me that it would not come on. In pursuance of that promise, I left Sydney by steamer at 9.15 p.m. on Tuesday, the 2nd June, as I find by . reference to my old pocket-book. On looking at the pair-book, I find that I was paired on the 3rd June against the Surplus Revenue Bill. The pair was made when I was out of Australian waters. I was on the high seas. I take no exception to the pair ; I do not know who made it; I blame no one ; but so far as any connexion between the pair and the question of old-age pensions is concerned, there was positively nothing for which I am in any way responsible. I also desire to mention that the Surplus Revenue Bill did not contain one word in reference to old-age pensions, the appropriation for which was made in a measure subsequently passed.

                        <para>. - It is to me a matter of very great amusement to find honorable senators opposite continually objecting to the fusion which has taken place amongst other honorable senators. I am particularly amused, because fusion is practically the backbone of the Labour Party. It has been their backbone both in Government and in Opposition. Their party consists of an alliance of free-traders and protectionists. </para>

                            <para>- I am anxious to inform honorable senators that this is not the first time I have been a party to a fusion. I go further, and say that in all probability if a fusion of Federal Free Traders and Protectionists had not taken place in New South Wales in 1898 there would have "been no Federation, or it would not have come off at that date, and if delayed I do not know when it might have eventuated. I propose to refer to the events in' New South Wales at that time for the instruction of honorable senators,' and I think that the facts I shall bring forward will be of some interest. In 1898 we were just about to face a State election for the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. The movement for Federation had then made considerable progress. A statement had been made by a number of opponents of Federation that Free Traders and Protectionists together really intended to upset the Free Trade policy of New South Wales. This had a bad effect, and if the idea had been allowed to take possession of  the public mind it would have been quite impossible to persuade the people of the Free Trade State of New South Wales to vote as they ultimately did for Federation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund,</inline> then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., Barton,</inline> was the leader of the Federal party in the State, and in his published manifesto he included this paragraph - </para>

                    Barton wrote at the bottom of my letter, the single word "Yes." It became necessary for me to take hold of the subject with considerable vigour, because statements were being continually made as to what the Free Traders and Protectionists together were going to do with regard to the Free Trade fiscal policy of New South Wales. I have here a long letter which appeared in the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>
                    of 1 8th July, 1898. I followed that up two or three days later with another letter, from which I shall read some extracts. I may say that in the meantime I had requested
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline>
                    Barton to communicate with some of his leading Protectionist supporters and get them to make a clear statement on the subject. I deal with that in the following way -

Of course, I know very well there are in the protectionist ranks some men whose pledges would not be valued very highly, but I don't care a button for such men, for they are helpless against the bulk of their party and their leaders, just as similar men are similarly helpless on the free-trade side. . That the protectionists as a party will during the whole of the next Par-  liament let the fiscal policy alone is now an established fact, and there is therefore nothing o prevent the free-traders and protectionists working together to bring about a Federal union of these Colonies at an early date. </para>

                            <para>To-day I and many others, the sincerity of whose attachment to the principles of free-trade cannot be questioned, are being subjected to what is only mildly described as misrepresentation. In our judgment, the time has arrived when the union of the Australian Colonies is imperatively called for; called for, I take it, by every consideration that can appeal to the patriot and the statesman ; called for by the course of events, both within and. without the borders of Australia ; and we are at one with every man who, whatever his views on other subjects may be, is prepared to make this subject of Federation the controlling factor of this general election and of the coming Parliament. We are told that we are participators in a protectionist conspiracy; that the Protectionist Party with one hand will wave the flag of Australian brotherhood, whilst with the other hand they will drive the assassin's knife into the heart of the fiscal system of New South Wales. We men who, like myself have toiled hard for many years in the interests of free-trade, and who would far sooner cut off our right hands than be false to our faith, have this charge levelled at us. The cry that freetrade is in danger is a "political dodge" - the danger that threatens is to the political life of those whose actions in regard to the great question of the day do not inspire us with confidence. It is thought the danger may be staved off by raising the old fiscal battle-cry. That the alleged conspiracy does not exist, and that we are neither participators in it, nor dupes of others who are, can easily be shown. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite clear that there was a fusion of political parties in New South Wales as the result of which Federation was brought about. I am very emphatic in saying that but for that fusion, Federation would not have been an accomplished fact to-day. It was on account of the fusion that Federation was rendered possible. I do not think that the other States would have federated if New South Wales had stood out of the Union. The fusion of parties which recently took place in this Parliament was brought about for the purpose of furthering the greatness of Australia under Federation. There is every justification for that fusion. We cannot travel any part of the world without being impressed with the wonderful developments that are taking place in science, art, trade, invention, and discovery of all kinds. Nor can we avoid noticing that the art of government is daily receiving more attention. Parliamentary work is becoming more and more important every year. The developments of the twentieth century have been very great indeed. The advances which have been made during the past fifty years have been most remarkable, but the developments of the few years of the present century have exceeded those which occurred during the last century. Changes are now taking place such as have never been known before. We are living in stirring and anxious times, and we need a Government which represents a majority of the people of Australia - not a limited portion of its inhabitants, however loyal and able they may be. There was an urgent necessity for the formation of a strong political party such as has recently been formed. It is incumbent upon the electors of the Commonwealth to return to this Parliament the very best men available. I hope that the people will bear that fact in mind at the next general election. If we get the best men' and a Government that is really representative of the majority of the people of Australia, we may expect Australia to be able to hold its head* high in' the world. Not only has the Mother Country given Australia self-government, but she has gone far. beyond that. She has conferred upon Australia the power of absolute government over a territory greater in extent than England, Scotland,, and Wales combined. I refer to Papua. When we remember that the boundary of our territory there touches German territory on the north and Dutch territory on the west, it will be seen that we are face to face with possibilities of trouble. Nothing in the world's history has been more prolific of conflict between nations than boundary disputes. We may any day be face to face with trouble with Germany in Papua affecting the boundary between Australian and German territory. The possibility of such a thing ought to make us feel that we owe it to the Mother Country as well as to ourselves that we should be able to speak with a majority voice. Not only have we this power in Papua, but we have before us the probability of having other territories to govern before long'. We are to take over Norfolk Island. Though that island has. practically been under Australian government - that is, the Government of New South Wales - for many years, yet it is now to become formally a part of the territory of the Commonwealth. We shall in the future have control of other territories in the South Seas, as, for example, at the New Hebrides. These matters point to the necessity of having a Government strong in itself, strong in the power at its back, and strong in its ability to deal with great questions in a way that will command the respect of the world and the confidence of the Home Government. These are great reasons why there should be a fusion in Australia, and why I and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> with other Protectionists here could not stand aloof and allow all sorts of trouble to eventuate, leaving important matters in abeyance while we fight over matters upon which we do not think in common. Now let me refer to the Dreadnought matter. When the proposal' to present a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain was first initiated, I did not lose many minutes before I wrote a letter to the ex-Minister of Defence, promising him straightaway my vote in the Senate in support of the gift. I thought that it was not fair to the Government that we who believed in the proposal should leave ourselves in the position of being able to quibble afterwards. I spoke straight out. I did more than that.  1  said in my letter, " Not only will I give my vote, and not only am I in favour of the gift of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> but I think that a gift of five <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> would represent more closely the position that Australia should take up, and it is a position towards which I think Australian opinion will gradually mature." It has been said that the agitation for <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> in England was, to a large extent, fomented by party feeling. ' I am bound to admit that great use has been made of the position for party purposes in England. If honorable senators will refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Westminster Gazette</inline> of the 1 2th or 14th May last, they will find over my signature a very indignant letter, denouncing the use that has been made of Australian patriotism to further the purposes of the Protectionist party. But I am not going to be misled. Because I see what is being done, I am not going to lose sight of the necessities of the case. I noticed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> on, I think, the day after he arrived from England, referred to the agitation in England, and said he thought 'that that agitation had been worked up for party, purposes. But on the very next day came a cable message, indicating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reginald</inline> McKenna, the political head of the Admiralty, had made a statement which confirmed all that had been said by other people previously. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will be prepared in the Senate to-day to tell us absolutely that Ave are fools for our pains. </para>

It is nothing to me whether Australia presents to the Mother Country a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or makes some other contribution towards Imperial defence. The great and important factor is that Australia is to-day prepared to take her share of the burden.' That i(s. what I am aiming at. You may call it presenting a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or anything you like, but the essential fact is that Australia is to-day awake to the necessity of taking some share of the burden of Empire. That is all I am anxious for. and all that I ask for, no matter what form our participation may happen to take. </para>

                            <para>- There can be no question of the misapprehension which the honorable senator was under when he allowed himself, in the poverty of his argument, to make use of this assertion. How could it be true? How could people save their pockets by gifts of Â£10,000 for the purpose of promoting a policy which must increase taxation ? The thing is ludicrous, and will not bear looking at for a moment. </para>

                            <para>- However much the taxation of the country mav grow, whatever increase there is that facilitates the imposition of new taxation - and that is what honorable senators want - the grant of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> made it easier, and not more difficult, to impose a land tax. I do not propose to review at length the late Government's defiant action with regard to coastal defence. After pledges had been given here and elsewhere, after votes - mine for one - had been obtained by a distinct statement that nothing would be done in  the matter until the Parliament had had an opportunity of deciding how the money should be expended. </para>

                            <para>- Let me refer a little to my own position in regard to Free Trade. When we Free Traders did our utmost to bring about Federation, we saw that there was one branch of Free Trade which was to be secured for ever, and that was freedom of trade among the States. For years and years we fought for this Free Trade. Our esteemed friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, used to tell us how Victoria robbed New South Wales of about Â£1,000,000 a year. But all that is a thing of the past. The States may trade together without let or hindrance, and that right cannot be taken away. We believed that we had a fair chance of winning freedom for our external trade ; but, as honorable senators know, we have not succeeded there. </para>

                            <para>- Not yet ; but I, who have some faith in the common sense of Australians, and think that they will ultimately find out the right course, anticipate that some opportunity may arise for raising the question successfully, and that Australia may yet be a Free Trade country. The growing cost of living must be telling a lesson to the people. Speaking on Friday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> wanted to know where we were in regard to taxation, if new duties on tea and so on were to be proposed. The people of this country are taxed by Customs duties far too much, and a duty on tea will not be imposed with my consent. I remind honorable senators that they were parties to the imposition of a big duty on sugar, and to arrangements by which an enormous amount was diverted fiom the Treasury. We are paying about Â£1,200,000 in consequence of that duty, and the Treasury is finally enriched <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the time of about , Â£200,000, and a solid Â£1,000,000 is absorbed by the industry, but the people pay the money. We are asked to believe that this position does not  exist; but I know that it does. If this enormous payment which is made by the people, came into the Treasury,' it would do a great deal to settle many difficult questions of Federal finance. The people of Australia are infinitely over-taxed through the Customs, and I shall be no party to the imposition of additional taxation, unless some of the present burdens are first of all removed. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly, I shall do my best in that direction. I desire to refer to another matter on which I feel very strongly, and that is that freedom of trade is an Empire necessity. I feel very certain that when we, with our huge and empty continent, erected Tariff barriers, we affronted the world. When Canada inaugurated a system of preference eight or ten years ago, she inaugurated at the same time a Tariff war with Germany. What does it all mean? These things have brought new troubles to the Empire. Have honorable senators forgotten the troubles and the enmities of the old Victorian stock tax ? I have not. I know what feelings of enmity in adjoining Colonies it was the cause of. And I can understand and appreciate thoroughly the feelings of enmity which must exist today in various countries at a tiny population such as ours, possessing itself of a huge country, and yet holding aloof by our Tariff from the trade of other countries. </para>

                            <para>- Germany cannot do it; she has no great continents filled with handfuls of Germans. The position is widely different. I do not desire to raise a fiscal debate here ; that is far from my thought.

                    <para>I am convinced of it. I have been fighting for freedom of trade for twenty years, and for very much stronger reasons than the mere advantage of it to Australia ; I have been fighting for it for the interest of the Empire. I have felt all along that the existence of the Empire to a very considerable extent depended upon that. We claim the supremacy of the seas. And as long as the Empire maintains a policy of freedom, the. supremacy of the seas may well be associated with that policy, but not without it. I shall conclude mv few remarks with a reference or two to our friends of the Labour party. A few days ago,  I read a case where a man was charged before a police magistrate with having forged some bogus testimonials of the work he had done and of his personal qualities, and the excuse for doing if was that he did not know of any other way of obtaining sympathy. That is very much the state of affairs with cur friends opposite. They have called themselves the Labour party. They have purloined the term " Labour." There is no honorable senator here who, on the average, has lived a harder life than I have, who has put more work into every 24 hours than I have done; but I am a non-Labour man, and they are Labour men. That is a dodging appeal to the sympathies . of the public. I have heard honorable senators sneer at there being so many lawyers in this Parliament. I believe that in New South Wales there are about six budding barristers belonging to the Labour party. </para>

Men may be like the lillies of the valley : they toil not, neither do they spin, yet if they know how to spell labour, they will be the salt df the earth. That is the policy with which honorable senators opposite wish to beguile the innocent electors. They are up to all sorts of petty tricks to win sympathy in regard to their late expulsion from office. They whine all day long about it, and represent themselves as having been so badly treated that they are entitled to say all sorts of queer things about the new Government. A man is refused a pair ; the pairing season is gone, and the despairing season lias arrived. Thai, is really the position, I think. I very frequently pass a few yards from this: chamber a memorial to the eight hours, movement in Victoria, but I never do so without giving it a smile.

Where was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> in that year ? If we may believe the Labour party to-day, it is they, and they alone, who. have done all these great things, and started schemes of all sorts for the amelioration of labour. Long before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> was thought of the object of the eight hours movement had been gained . and all kinds of action taken in all civilized countries for the amelioration of those who labour. Honorable senators opposite and their friends have taken advantage of the existence of these movements to trade on the sympathies of the public, and to persuade the public who often are only too gullible that they are the only real Simon Pure. </para>

                        <para>. - I take advantage of this opportunity to make a protest. I sat and listened as patiently as I could to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> and I expected that he would have been good enough to have related his conversion. I am sorry that the honorable senator failed to do so. I presume that as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who we know is diplomatic, sits alongside the honorable senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is to some extent under his wing, and perhaps at his bidding as well. I ha.ve received <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> photograph, and I cherish it. I told my wife and family that I had received it, and intended to bring it over to South Australia, because there are very few members of the Senate whom I like better than the honorable senator, but it is amazing to me to see a man whose photograph as the champion of Free Trade appears at the head of a statement which I have received sitting on the -same side in this chamber with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who I am sure is not feeling very happy to-day. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will supply me with another copy of his beautiful photograph attached to some production which will not be such a caricature of his action in joining forces with the Protectionists. I do like consistency, and from the honorable senator I expected at least consistency.

                            <para>- Why does the honorable senator refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson?</inline> My object in referring to the pairs given to Senators Pulsford and Dobson by honorable senators on this side was to reply to the press, because even in our Adelaide newspapers references are almost daily made to the refusal by the Labour, party to give pairs, as if we were the <inline font-style="italic">most</inline> wicked people under the canopy of heaven. We are here met on a serious occasion. The times are trying. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will be thought a much more cautious man than I am, but in the circumstances in which the present Government made the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> or its equivalent, to Great Britain, the honorable senator has said that he would have given five. </para>

                            <para>- That would be worse. If a Labour senator said what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has said, it would be thought that he ought to be sent to a lunatic asylum. At least five of the representatives of South Australia in the Senate are opposed to the gift of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is as strongly opposed to it as are members of the Labour party. I cannot speak for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> and I do not profess to do so. When in South Australia, I received the newspapers regularly, and the political news always attracted my attention. I felt that the manoeuvres that were being carried on by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin, Sir John</inline> Forrest, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> were deplorable. When the Fisher Government took it upon themselves to order torpedo boats, those opposed to them said: "You have done wrong. You had not the authority of Parliament," and in referring to the payment of old-age pensions, they said to the Fisher Government : " You have not the money to pay old-age pensions." What followed? Could inconsistency go further? They then said : " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> you must give a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain." </para>

He took every possible step to frighten the Fisher Ministry into acceding to his demand, and he declared that the necessary money with which to pay old-age pensions was not available.

                            <para>- Where is the logic in such an attitude ? I say that there is none. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence object to direct taxation, and declare that the requisite funds for administering the affairs of Government should be provided out of Customs and Excise revenue. What does that mean ? Does it not mean an increase in the cost of living ? </para>

                            <para>- The policy of the late Government was clear and unmistakable. They were prepared to initiate a scheme of defence very much upon the lines laid down by the previous Deakin Administration ; they were ready to establish an institution somewhat akin to a State bank; they were willing to impose a tax upon estates the unimproved value of which exceeded Â£5,000, and to levy an additional impost upon absentee landlords without; any exemption whatever. In short, their policy was absolutely a sound one. I am proud of the fact that they manfully stuck to their guns, and refused to back down upon a single item. They declined to convene Parliament at an earlier date than was necessary, and they refused to accede to the clamour to present a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the Mother Country. Before this Parliament prorogued last year, I remarked to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and the present Minister of Defence that I recognised that with the next shuffle of the political cards they would occupy the Treasury benches. Immediately after the prorogation, in addressing a meeting at Yass, I said that, knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> as I did and recognising his anxiety for office, those who sat behind him and those who would like "to be linked with him in a Government, would join forces for the purpose of displacing the Labour Government as soon as Parliament reassembled. That prophecy has been fulfilled to the letter. But the late Government were deposed from office in a most unfair manner. In passing, I may  mention that I was very pleased to notice a report in the newspapers to-day in connexion with the Yass-Canberra Capital site. From a perusal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener's</inline> report, I was under the impression that there was a scarcity of water of good quality within the selected area. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that on our visit of inspection we saw some dirty water, but we also saw some most beautiful' water. What I feared was that the Premier of New South Wales had attempted to intimidate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener,</inline> because his report was adverse to the locality which is favored by the former. I have the greatest faith in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener's</inline> ability and straightforwardness, but if I believed that the Premier of New South Wales had threatened that officer in any way, my allegiance to the Yass-Canberra site would be seriously shaken. Only yesterday a correspondent of an Adelaide newspaper stated that notwithstanding all that I had said in favour of the site, I was absolutely wrong. In reply, I may say that when I visited the site a second time, in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> I was more impressed with it than ever. We obtained a billycan of water from the Cotter Creek and I enjoyed the nicest drink of tea, made from it, that I have had for a long time. I wish now to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> whether he will not give us some information in reference to the financial question ? If he will not, when I return to South Australia at the end of the week I shall have to admit - if I am interviewed by a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> - that all our attempts to draw the Government have failed. We are elected to this Senate for a specific purpose. We are here to safeguard State rights. Why, then, 'should we not be trusted? The Government have refused to recommend the Governor-General to grant a dissolution- </para>

In order to secure a change of Government, and to escape the imposition of a progressive land tax, the wealthy men -of that State promoted this scare along with the Tory crowd which is pulling the ropes in Old England.

It was within the power of the Labour party for a number of years to turn out the Deakin Government, who always had the Conservative element at their throat. </para>

If I had desired to occupy time, I might have produced letters and quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> What did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> say, speaking of those who are his. present supporters, on the 20th October last? He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had behind him the wreckage of the anti-Socialist party, the Free Trade party, the Black Labour party, and the Reactionary party. At. that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> proclaimed that he would not touch the Conservatives; but to-day he is sitting with the. wreckage. The wreckage came and beseeched him to take them up. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest said, " I will not be led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> ; w'e must have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> or I myself will lead." We hear much about the caucus. But there were plenty of caucus meetings while the present Government were in process of formation. Some of the caucuses were held at the Grand Hotel. I was pleased to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> name figuring prominently at that time, because, if there was anything to be distributed, he had as much right to a share as any one, on account of his ability. On one occasion I read how, at fifteen minutes past 12 o'clock, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen, Senator Best,</inline> and others adjourned te the Grand Hotel to come to a final decision as to what was to be the policy of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and he never forgave us. As I have said, the Deakin Government had only three direct supporters in the Senate. They were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best, Senator Keating,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> Now " Fair play is bonnie play," and if justice had been done Sena- for Keating should have occupied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> position in the present Government. He was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> senior. Surely the matter of religion should not have influence in these matters. Probably the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was passed over was' that he has not so much of the scheming instinct about him as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has. He is not so impatient. He is willing to wait until his time comes, when, probably, he will be able to run for the Presidentship, or something of that kind. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> being of a more impetuous turn of mind, could not wait. He said, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,.</inline> " The Labour party have no right to be in office ; let us get them out of it." </para>

                            <para>- And he ought to study others. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was a Minister before him, and sustained the position with credit to himself when he led the Senate. He was a grand and able man. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> jumped his claim l.y performing an acrobatic feat. Some reference has been made to the occasion when I took a seat on the side of the Chamber opposite to the supporters of the Deakin Government. The reason why I took that seat was as a protest against the way in which the Deakin Government dealt with the new Protection question. The most effective way of showing my feeling was by changing my seat. I was never a supporter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> personally. I told the people of South Australia that I had no faith in the man. Although a Protectionist on new Protection lines, at the same time I preferred <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H. Reid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> The one is a practical common sense man, and the other is one who lives in the clouds, and with whom I could not have anything to do. Out of the thirteen representatives of South Australia in this Parliament, not one was returned as a Deakin supporter. I wish that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> or some other supporter of the present Government would come over to South Australia, and explain their policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> was over there some time ago, and made some very able speeches on the Protectionist question. If he came now, he would be gagged. </para>

                        <para>- Since the initiation of this debate, it has been said in many quarters that the Labour party has been guilty of serious obstruction. If I understand that word rightly, obstruction can only come from one side of a legislative chamber. Having watched the debates very carefully in both branches of the Legislature, I can say that a fair share of time has been occupied by members of both parties. Consequently, the charge of obstruction cannot be laid at the door of the Opposition in either House. I want to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> a question before he leaves the chamber, as he appears to be about to do. Towards the close of his address I attempted to engage his attention, and receive an answer to a question, but he was so much engrossed with his thoughts and his eloquence, which was, I admit, very interesting, that he did. nbt hear it, though repeated. He was then attempting to ridicule the members of the Labour party bv doubting whether they were sincere in their motives, their utterances, and their actions. He asked this question, " Where was. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> in 1856, when the question of eight hours a day was initiated?" He spoke of the monument near by, which was erected to commemorate the initiation of the eight hours movement in Victoria. I ask the honorable senator where he was when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Cobden, the champion of the Free Trade movement at Home, was one of the most eloquent advocates and exponents in the reform movement in the thirties. Is the honorable senator any less a Free .Trader to-day because he was not alive at that period ? Perhaps he was alive then. </para>

                            <para>-I was referring to the occupants of the Treasury benches. There is nothing on which they agree - no principle in politics on which they have ever or are now or ever can agree - except their mutual hostility to the Labour party, and their desire, at all hazards, to remove them from being in possession of the government of this country. This statement goes on to announce ' that the new Government will establish an InterState Commission. I am inclined to think that this is another sop. The Government have already created one record in the number of their Ministers. No previous Government included ten Ministers. Why should there have been ten in this case, seven Ministers of State and three Honorary Ministers. By the way, the Prime Minister is supposed to be an Honorary Minister. </para>

                            <para>- At this stage of Federal history, I should like to have a definition of what an honorary Minister really is? Does he receive any remuneration for his services to the Commonwealth ? I venture to think that every one of these gentlemen is receiving "to-day remuneration for his services to the country. This fusion Government contains seven lawyers. I have no antipathy to the members of the legal profession, or to the legal members of this Government. Personally, I have every respect for these gentlemen, but I intend to watch very carefully any proposals emanating from a Government in which members of the devil's brigade constitute a majority, because it always has been said that we cannot expect very much progressive legislation from such a combination. I thought  that by the establishment of the InterState 'Commission there might be a possibility of placating two or three more Government supporters. </para>

I know that there are two or three fusionists who are keenly disappointed because they were not included in the present Cabinet. They have been silenced by the knowledge that, according to the Ministerial statement, an Inter-State Commission is about to be appointed. Possibly, these two or three malcontents may be commissioned. </para>

                            <para>- With all due respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> I may say that since this question was brought forward, I have travelled over a great deal of the Commonwealth, and speaking, not only as a party man, but from my experience of employers as well as employes in various parts of Australia, I repeat, that to-day the Australian public generally desire an amendment of the Constitution giving the Federal Parliament power to deal with those industries which are affected by the Tariff. I say that, although the appointment of an Inter-State Commission may, for many reasons, be advisable, it will not go to the root of this question. I would, on many grounds, support the appointment of an Inter-State Commission ; but it will not remedy the existing position, so far as our power to give effect to new Protection is concerned. We must go further, and have an amendment of the Constitution. I say, also, that the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> are going behind their promises lo the people of Australia, and are attempting to evade the position by such a subterfuge as the appointment of an Inter-State Commission. The next matter dealt with in the Ministerial statement is the appointment of a High Commissioner. I realize the necessity for such an appointment, which I think has been too long delayed. It is essential that the people of the Commonwealth should be represented at what is now known as the " Heart of the Empire." New Zealand. Canada, and South Africa, are represented there ; and no delay should take place in the appointment of a High Commissioner for Australia. All I wish to say in connexion with this matter is that, before the appointment is made, the name of the gentleman favored by the Federal Government should be submitted to this Parliament. I do not desire that the name should be included in the Bill, because I know that that could not be done; but I do say that, before the appointment is made, the Federal Parliament should have a voice in the selection of the man to occupy the position. There is another matter mentioned in the Ministerial statement which, :\t present, through the medium of the Press Conference in London, is engaging the attention of the world. I refer to the proposed cheapening of the cable service. I do not know what the intentions of the Government are in this connexion ; but I ask them to consider seriously the necessity of trying to kill the present cable monopoly. Whilst the agitation by the Press Conference is laudable in one way, I do not think that it will best serve the interests of the people of Australia if the rates for press cables only are reduced. In common with all who have the welfare of the people of Australia at heart, I should like to see the cable rates so cheapened as to bring our people into easy communication with the people of other 'portions of the Empire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> are, we know, great advocates of Imperial unity. </para>

What I wish to point out is that, if we are going to have a real Imperial unity, if the bonds of Empire and the silken threads of unity are to be strengthened, it can only be bv the establishment of cheap intercommunication between the various portions of the Empire. Why should only the press of Australia be given the advantage of low rates ? Why should not every person in Australia, if the necessity demanded, be able to communicate with his ar her people in every portion of the British Empire at equally low rates. </para>

I believe the present Government intend to submit to Parliament the draft agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia. If it comes before us in ils present form, there are certain clauses in that agreement to which I shall object, but I strongly favour the proposal to take over the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that that position will arise. I do not think that the Federal Parliament is quite prepared to accept the dictum of South Australia, as set out in the agreement referred to. The next item mentioned in the statement is old-age pensions. I am glad to be able to say that, for once, I can congratulate the Government on something. They express a very laudable intention to lower the residential and age conditions governing the payment of old-age pensions. But I do protest that it was scarcely fair for the head of the present Government to say, as he has said, that the payment of old-age pensions was in danger. Apart altogether from party political warfare, there was no reason why such a statement should be made. . I have said that there was no reason, but 1 forgot. There was one reason, and' that was that every member of the present Government felt that at all hazards he must discredit his immediate predecessor in office- </para>

                            <para>- When the honorable senator, who is a very good judge of rubbish, next addresses the Senate, I hope that he will embrace the opportunity to justify the assertion which he has made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has stated that old-age pensions are being paid in New South Wales. I know that they have been paid there for some years, and the same remark is applicable to Victoria. But I would remind him that under the Old-age Pensions Act passed by this Parliament, the number of persons who will obtain relief in New South Wales and Victoria - particularly in Victoria - will be very greatly increased. Although New South Wales and Victoria are two great States of the Commonwealth, the honorable senator must recollect that there are four other States in the Federal Union. Surely they must be considered ? </para>

                            <para>- If any man is deserving of credit for the fact that old-age pensions will be paid on the 15th July next, it is the Leader of the Opposition in another place. When the Surplus Revenue Bill was about to be submitted to Parliament by the last Deakin Administration, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> suggested that a portion of the surplus balances which had previously been returned to the States should be devoted to a trust account for the payment of old-age pensions. The Surplus 'Revenue Bill was considered in due course, and what did we find ? We found honorable senators in this chamber, as well as honorable members in another place, opposing it, notwithstanding that it provided the money with which to pay old-age pensions, and to initiate an effective scheme of, defence. They opposed its passage, notwithstanding that they knew that, if the measure were rejected, old-age pensions could not be paid. As a matter of fact they admitted that upon the floor of the Senate. But when they were on the public platform seeking the suffrages of the people, 'these <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> honorable senators declared themselves in favour of a Commonwealth scheme of old-age pensions. As Leader of the Senate at the time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> was. charged with the duty of piloting the Surplus Revenue Bill through this Chamber, and he had to contend with no stronger opponent of it than the honorable gentleman .who now sits like a cooing dove beside him - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> - who was also supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> Since then these gentlemen have united, and they now tell us that the payment of old-age pensions was once in jeopardy. No greater lie was ever manufactured than the statement which was made yesterday- </para>

                            <para>- The statement to which I have directed attention is a most remarkable one. Is it possible for such legislation to be introduced, seeing that the present Government was conceived in the sanctum of the Employers' Federation, that it was born in the Grand Hotel, and that it can be kept alive only by the political nourishment which is served up in the columns of the Melbourne daily newspapers ? Yet a Government which has come into existence under such conditions has the temerity to calmly inform us that it intends to introduce legislation for the repression of trusts. In doing so, I think that it has plumbed the depths of ridicule. If such an announcement does not amount to burlesque, I do not know what burlesque means. It is nothing more or less than an insult to the intelligence of honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- A day or two ago the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> - and I use the name of that journal with a certain amount of trepidation - under scare headlines, announced that it had discovered a secret plot to oust the present Government. In support of its statement, it published a copy of a circular written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> and forwarded to certain members of his organization,  in which it was suggested that a meeting should be called for the purpose of formulating a policy for the ensuing elections. In effect, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said : " How dare <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> do anything of the kind? Have we not already  framed a policy for the Government? We do not want any Walpoles on the job. What we want are wall-flowers." Anybody who has watched the progress of events at the Seat of Government during the past few weeks must have observed that there are any number -of wall-flowers on the Government benches in the Senate, and in another place. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that the two words which most readily occur to honorable senators opposite are "bosh" and  "sosh."  Why do they not get up in their places, and deliver coherent speeches, instead of making such interjections? The morning after it was announced that Colonel Foxton would be the representative of Australia at the Imperial Conference, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> came out with a leading article of a very strong character. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was, in years past in this State, the maker and  unmaker  of Ministries. It has been attempting to play the same part in Federal affairs. I believe that on the present occasion the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has been successful in making the Ministry now in office. But the people of Australia will be the  unmakers  of this Government. In the article to which I refer, the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> in very strong language, demanded the cancellation of the appointment of Colonel Foxton. It gave reasons which have been buttressed during recent debates in both Chambers of the Legislature, showing that <inline font-style="italic">not only</inline> was  Colonel Foxton  anti-Australian in regard to his views on the White Australia question, but that also in a published interview, which was referred to last week by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in his admirable speech,  Colonel Foxton  had declared himself in favour of an increased subsidy to the Imperial Navy. I say, without the slightest fear of contradiction, that any member of the Australian Parliament who to-day says that he would grant an increased monetary subsidy to the Imperial Navy, does not truly represent the opinions of the Australian public. The leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reminded the public that Colonel Foxton was an advocate of black labour, and of an increased Naval subsidy, and was, therefore, by no means the man to go to England to advocate a scheme of Australian defence. </para>

Colonel Foxton  dare not give one vote at the Conference without the sanction bv cable of the combination who occupy the Ministerial benches. </para>

                            <para>- We come with a policy that we explained on the public plat form before being elected. We said to the people that, if elected, we would endeavour to carry out that policy in legislative form. We go further, and sign a promise to adhere to the platform. On the other hand,  Colonel Foxton  has gone Home as the representative of the Government with an alleged Australian defence policy. Why should not  Colonel Foxton  be free to speak and vote at the Conference as the representative of the Government without having to keep in constant touch with the Ministry, who will tell him what he is to do? If he is not caucus-ridden and caucus-bound, I do not know who is. It strikes me that the Government were forced to send an irresponsible person to England on this mission. The Minister of Defence dare not go. He dare not leave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> by himself. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> could not go Home and leave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook in charge. The only alleged military gentleman in the combination was  Colonel Foxton.  Hence Australia is sacrificed. What was the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron?</inline> Why  did not the Government send him ? . He is a proved soldier, who knows more about defence than any member of the present Government. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the government of a country, .or the affairs of a Parliament can be carried on by assumptions. What we want are facts, and I invite Ministers, when they reply to me, to contradict successfully my statement. What have the Government done in connexion with the offer of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought?</inline> Behind the back of Parliament, they have committed the country to the construction and presentation of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> or some alternative, which may be acceptable to the Imperial naval authorities. Suppose that the offer of a ship had been accepted right out, without regard to an alternative. It would have been built in a British ship-building yard, the material would have been procured from Great Britain or some other country, the workmen employed upon the construction would have been British, and the money would have been spent there. Of course, I would rather see my fellow countrymen employed than foreigners ; but it is a strange thing that the only Australian, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> - the man who is preaching the doctrine of a self-reliant Australia, the necessity of encouraging and developing our industries and resources - should be the one to say to the Old . Country, "Here is a gift of ,Â£2,000,000. Spend the money in England while our workmen in Australia are allowed almost to starve." Now, where is the money for this purpose to come from ? . When .1 was speaking on a former occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> interjected, " You are not too sure as to whether we will borrow the money or not." </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is wise for me to be in a hurry in connexion with this policy. There is only one other way in which the money can be obtained  without resort to borrowing, and that is by asking the States to forego a certain proportion of the money returnable to them. If they assent to the request, good and well. But it will be a very strange thing to me if they agree to the proposal, considering that only a month or two ago, they raised a hue and cry that the Commonwealth was robbing them by the enactment of the Surplus Revenue Bill. Again, if they agree to the proposal, they will be robbing their taxpayers. No matter how the proposal is looked at, it means that the Australian taxpayer will have to pay the piper, while somebody else calls the tune. </para>

                            <para>- A dock is being constructed at that port, and I am not so parochial minded as is my honorable friend. I know that docks may be provided anywhere so long as he is a Minister of the Crown. That is about the extent of his anxiety. I do not, I repeat, know what the alternative, to a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> is. This Government will not let the Parliament or the people of Australia know what it is until the Imperial Defence Conference has finished its labours. What does that mean ? It means that despite all the statements which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> that they had a scheme of Australian defence, until the Defence Conference has decided what the scheme should be they will not tell our people. If the Government had a scheme of defence they would have said to their delegate, "Go to the Conference and state what our scheme is, and if they will not agree with it, come back and we will deal with the matter ourselves." I wonder whether the Government are prepared to test the feeling of Parliament on this question of presenting to the Old Country a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or an alternative. Will they dare to go to a division ? I do not think that they will. I believe that if they had the courage of their convictions, and came down with a message from His Excellency recommending that a certain sum be appropriated for the presentation of a. <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or the building of a dock on some portion of the Australian coast, as a naval base, they would be successful in carrying it through so far as numbers were concerned, but the trouble would be that the division list would mean the political extinction of some of their supporters. For that reason they are afraid to take the opinion of the Parliament. They prefer to wait until their delegate, or alleged delegate, has returned from London, and then the life of this Parliament will have expired by effluxion , of time, and the question of the promise of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> or some other alternative, will be kept for the platform in those constituencies where they think that it might be suitable, and if it is not suitable we shall hear nothing about a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> from the platform. </para>

Evidently the Director of Naval Forces is under the impression that sooner or later Great Britain may lose the supremacy of the seas.

In view of that paragraph, however, why should we be concentrating our efforts and energies on the presentation of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought?</inline> Why should we not confine our energies to the building up of a local defence, which in a national emergency would be a valuable adjunct to protect our Â£170,000,000 worth of sea-borne commerce between Great Britain and Australia? </para><interjection>

                            <para>- It should have been <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> pleasure, as well as his duty, to be here a week ago. Instead of attending to his private business in New South Wales, he should have been here to look after the public business, for which he is being paid. When interrupted,  1 was referring to the question of telephone charges. I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick was not long in yielding to the representations of the Employers' Federation in connexion with the scale of charges proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> the late Postmaster-General. Those charges might, or might not, have been too high, but there is no doubt that they were framed with a desire to compel the larger users of the telephone to pay the larger amount. It is not fair that the private user of the telephone should be called upon to pay as much for the service as the commercial user, especially in view of the fact that in these days of keen competition the telephone is of such great assistance to the business man. </para>

                                statement is a . reflection on the officers of the Department. While in office, the honorable senator will have to depend on the assistance of the officers whom he is now reviling. Mention is made in the Ministerial statement of the Navigation Bill. I hope that it will be pressed on with, and that no more delay will arise in the passing of that very important measure.

There are one or two other matters referred to in the Ministerial statement to which I might refer ; but I have no wish to occupy the time of the Senate unnecessarily. 1 might refer to the financial proposals of the Government, and particularly to their proposal to float a loan. I dare say that the Government will shortly ask this Parliament to borrow money in Australia, or somewhere else, for improving our postal facilities. </para>

But it is not the kind of business that 1, or the party of which I am a member, go in for. It is, however, the kind of business that the present combination party are going in for, and that many of them in the past did go in for in the various States, with the result that to-day Australia has a national debt hanging over her which she never would have had if there had been effective opposition to this policy on business lines. This is the kind of business policy which has been strangling Australia until now, and honorable senators opposite desire to draw the cord tighter around the necks of the people of Australia by borrowing more money. I need not further discuss the statement introduced by the present Government, any more than to say that it is not worth the paper that it is written on. I fail to' see how the present Government can hope to regulate or suppress trusts, or any other evil which at the present time is menacing the interests of Australia, whilst they are bound hand and foot by the Employers' Federation, who  are responsible for their presence on the Treasury benches. </para>

                    <para class="block">It seems but yesterday that many of the present occupants of the Ministerial benches were on this side of the House. It seems but yesterday that those honorable senators tried, by every known device, to emasculate the Tariff, to strangle existing industries, and to refuse, absolutely and definitely, the giving of any assistance with a view to the creation of new industries in any part of Australia. It seems but yesterday since every opportunity they had was availed of to oppose everything of a national character. But a change has come over the scene, and it has been brought about mainly, we are told, by one or two honorable gentlemen sitting on the opposite side. There was, not long ago, a mighty army of Liberals sitting there - a trinity who claimed the kudos for all the advanced legislation at present on the national statute-book. The trinity were Senators Best, Keating, and Trenwith. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has all the characteristics of his chief, the Prime Minister. He has an intense lust for power. He has an insatiable appetite. When out of office, disappointment, dyspepsia, and despair are written largely on his face. Nothing will appease the honorable senator's hunger but the Ministerial nose-bag, and as soon as he gets his nose inside of that bag it does not matter whether it contains Protectionist oats, Free Trade chaff, or anti-sosh carrots, he partakes of all with avidity, a complete change comes over his countenance, and for the moment he appears to be happy. Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who, I am sorry, is not present. We know that he looks anything but happy. The honorable senator was at one time the hope of Tasmania, so far as Liberalism is concerned. When the present Prime Minister journeyed to that island State some time ago, one of the first to greet him was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> With that honorable senator the Prime Minister, we were told by a certain newspaper, had a triumphal march from one end of the State to the other. Various meetings were addressed by the Prime Minister, and it was said that there was an awakening and revival of Liberalism, and that the next elections in the island State would show unmistakably the results of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> mission to Tasmania. The elections took place very shortly after, and we had an opportunity to read in the great organ of the National Liberal party - the <inline font-style="italic">Argus -</inline> because that newspaper is now the organ of the National Liberal party., and helped to bring about the combination- </para>

                    <para class="block">I called the attention of one of my friends of the Labour party to this statement of the results. He had been over there assisting candidates at the election and he said that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> report was scarcely correct, because the anti-Laborites returned numbered seventeen, and that the Deakinite Liberals secured the return of one candidate named Rattle, whilst three other Deakinite candidates lost their deposits. So that what we read in the newspapers was really the result of the imaginative mind of the pressman- who accompanied <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> on his trip. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I expect, played his part in connexion with the fusion of parties which recently took place in this Parliament. Consequently I watched his. face prior to the formation of the Government with some interest. Hope was written largely upon it. "Two members," he doubtless said to himself, " are required in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has had a long innings, and surely the claims of Tasmania cannot be overlooked, especially in view of the part which I played in assisting to make the visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to that State the success which it is alleged to have been." </para>

                            <para>- I think I shall. I never believed that honorable senators holding such diverse views could come together for any length of time, or for any good purposed Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> He has been a consistent opponent of land monopoly. If he is so still, I would remind him that he is sitting side by side with the champions- of industrial monopoly, and with the strongest advocates of earth monopoly to be found in any Parliament in Australia.. There are a couple of honorable senators to whom I wish briefly to refer. For a long time one of them exercised himself in endeavouring to educate the women of Australia upon the question of " National Assism." I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I do not know why the ladies do not now extend to him the invitations which formerly came his way. Evidently they have discovered that his political views are not palatable to them. However, the fusion party has discovered a new political Adonis in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. Whenever the ladies of a certain political organization in Victoria require a  speaker  they need only send a post card or a telephone message to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, and his services are at their disposal. The honorable senator will discourse upon any subject under the sun. Possibly he tells the women whom he addresses that the Labour party desire higher wages and shorter hours, and a number of other reforms which will mean disaster to the common weal. Senators St. Ledger, Fraser, Vardon, Gray, and Walker- </para>

                            <para>- And what annoys me, frequently annoys the great majority of the electors of the Commonwealth. Had a dissolution been granted a few weeks ago, I venture to say that some of those who were most prominent in the recent fusion negotiations would not have been returned to this Parliament. The Ministerial statement of policy contains many promises. It is full of vague generalities ; but it contains nothing of a substantial character, so far as the masses of the people are concerned. I even doubt whether it will be printed, because the motion for its printing has yet to be carried. For some few weeks prior to the recent fusion of political parties, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper watched the course of events very closely, and it was much alarmed when it realized that the proposed amalgamation was likely to take a definite shape. On the 18th March last, it wrote - </para>

                        <para>This hankering for the suppression of all but two parties is really a desire to suppress the intellectual life of the people. There is no room in two parties for many men to develop the best that is in them. A union between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> would mean the political emasculation of tens of thousands of men who might be constrained to become the followers of one or other of them. Who cannot see that yoking together two such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Irvine would suppress in both all that should distinguish each ? And the injury that such suppression does to the individual is carried along into all the ramifications of the political life of the country. </para>

                    <para>We are now asked to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Irvine, who has been denounced by this very newspaper, who has even been denounced by members of the so-called Liberal party, as a Conservative and reactionary, has changed his political opinions, and that he is as anxious as are other honorable members to give effect, for example, to a scheme of new Protection. We all know the part which he played when the Tariff was under consideration. At the last election, he was returned as a Protectionist. In the House of Representatives, 287 divisions took place upon the Tariff proposals of the last Deakin Government. Upon 82 occasions <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine</inline> voted against the Government duty, he paired against it upon 28 occasions, and he neither paired nor voted 108 times. In other words, he was against effective Protection 218 times. He voted for the Government duty only 50 times, and paired in favour of it 19 times.

                        <para>He stands for everything which the capitalist holds dear and which the toiler detests. While drawing his own parliamentary salary, and shirking the work attached to it, he will still leave the States in possession of the power they abuse, to the encouragement of the sweater. And this is the type of politician with whom the Liberal party is asked to form a permanent and efficient junction. There is satire in the very suggestion. If there be, as Conservatism alleges, something immoral in the past agreement between Labour and Liberalism, by means of which each has gained the maximum of what it desired to achieve, what can be said of .the suggestion that Reactionaries, like the man we have described, shall join with a party of progress in order to carry on Government by a manipulated majority ? The repulsiveness of such a compact stands out in its native ugliness when put under the searchlight, and it ought to make every good Liberal scout it as he would the introduction of the plague. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is not the slightest doubt that the majority behind the Government is "a manipulated majority." How the manipulation was worked time will show. This <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> when Premier of the State of Victoria, was known as " Coercion Irvine." He introduced in the Legislative Assembly a Strike Suppression Bill, some of the provisions of which would disgrace even Russia. He also emasculated our Factories Act. It will be within the knowledge of honorable senators that a Factories Act, embodying many beneficent principles, was passed by the State Parliament some years ago. That Act enabled Wages Boards to be created. They were composed of an equal number of employers and employes with an independent  chairman.  The Boards met and discussed questions pertaining to the trades for which they were appointed. After a Board had discussed various phases a determination was arrived at which, was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette.</inline> That determination fixed hours of labour, rates of pay, and1 the number of apprentices to be employed. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine</inline> was Premier he caused the Act to be amended, so that the determination of a Wages Board had to be carried by a seven- tenths majority, and the  chairman  had no say in the decision. That is to say, a Board composed of five employers and five employes, presided over by a  chairman,  could not arrive at a. decision by a simple majority ; but either two employers or two employes had to change their views before a determination could be arrived at. The absurdity of the thing was so manifest that not long afterwards the provision was repealed. Again, the original Act gave power for its provisions to be extended to shires. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine</inline> amended it so as to permit an unlimited number of apprentices to be employed, and so as to take away the power of extension to shires. He also permitted apprentices over the age of twenty-one to be employed. What was more, his amending Act allowed a final appeal to an Appeal Court. Under- the original Act the determination of the Board was final  and  absolute. The amendment, carried at the instigation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> as the result of giving appeal to a Court, had the effect of removing one of the best provisions from the original measure, and in some cases made it impossible for unions which were not financially strong to carry their cases to Court. Another matter of the highest importance to the workers was that the Appeal Court was bound by a provision in the Irvine amending Act, permitting the Court to fix the wages at the rates paid by " reputable " employers. We know that in one industry the ' 1 most reputable ' ' employer was found to be paying only 36s. per week. The Court fixed that rate as the wage to be paid to those employed in the industry. We are asked to believe that from such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Irvine the workers are likely to get a measure of new Protection that will be of advantage to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn</inline> is another member of this fusion party. He is the  president  of the Employers' Federation, which body, of course, strongly supports the present Government. A short while ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn</inline> was welcoming a British manufacturer to one of the gatherings of the Employers' Federation, and he made use of these significant words - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator can pick out one or two items, but one swallow does not make a summer. Taking the Tariff as a whole, whatever Protection there is in it was secured by the members of the Labour party. Some of the prominent fusionists not only opposed the Tariff, but stayed here hour after hour to " stone- wall " it. The Deakin party claim that they passed the Old-age Pensions Act. The facts are, as partly related by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer,</inline> the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, some time back asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> in the House of Representatives when old-age pensions were likely to become operative. He replied by saying that it would depend upon the Premiers' Conference at Hobart. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer</inline> said : " If there is no agreement between the Premiers at Hobart, are we to understand that old-age pensions will not be operative until the expiration of the Braddon blot' in  1910?" <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said: "I am afraid that is so." Those remarks can be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> So that had it not been for the Labour party, old-age pensions would not have been payable until  19 10. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> pointed out means whereby the nucleus of a fund could be created at once, and, therefore, all credit is due, not to the Deakin Government, but to the Labour party, for having pointed out how the pensions could be made payable. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know of a single opponent at that time. All opposition seemed to have disappeared. Certainly, they opposed the principle that the surplus revenue should not be paid into a fund for the payment of old-age pensions. When the Fisher Government was in power, extreme anxiety was manifested by certain members of the Opposition that Parliament should be convened as speedily as possible. The Government arranged that it should meet about a month earlier than had been the practice with previous Governments. But that would not satisfy these honorable members. They were determined that Parliament should be called together immediately the round-robin was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Fisher at Gympie. In fact, they said, " We want work; work we must have; we are uneasy and unhappy when we are out of harness." But as evidence of insincerity and hollowness, we find that as soon as ever Parliament is called together the Government have to send special wires to bring certain honorable senators here to attend to their duties. Why were they anxious to get Parliament to meet so much earlier than is customary ? </para>

It was attended by all the members of the Deakin party, including Senators Trenwith, Keating, and Best, and so pathetic, I believe, were the scenes-, that rivulets of tears were shed over the proposal that there should be a parting of the ways, that this united party should be rent asunder. Some of them joined the fusion very reluctantly. </para>

                            <para>- No ; if we believe that a thing is wrong, we do not do it, and if it is right there is no occasion to shed tears. We do not know what influences were at work. However, very sad and pathetic scenes took place at that historic gathering. It was not a united caucus at all, because there was a division of opinion. That has been marked in another Chamber since then, and it will be more marked, I am sanguine, after a general election has been held. In their anxiety to get Parliament convened and to work, they started sky-rocketing. They said that the Empire was in danger, that battleships were being built as rapidly by Germany as by England, in order to overthrow the latter's supremacy of the seas, that it was imperatively necessary that a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> should be given to the Mother Country by the Commonwealth Parliament, and that if the Fisher Government did not offer the gift, it should not be allowed to live, that a censure motion would be tabled, and that those who were behind the movement knew that there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the proposed gift. What has happened to the movement? We know what has happened to it, because it never had any existence outside of two States in the Union. It was never seriously discussed in some parts of Australia. I venture to say that, with the exception of Victoria and New South Wales, you would not get ten persons out of 100 in a State to approve of it. You would not get a tenth of the population of this State to approve of the proposal. </para>

There is not a newspaper in South Australia which favours it.

                        <para>In South Australia the movement ceased almost as soon as it started - indeed, it hardly started at all. A similar remark applied to all the other States except New South Wales and Victoria, wher.e a few ill-balanced folk strove desperately to arouse enthusiasm, but failed unquestionably and emphatically. Australians absolutely refused to be goaded into' a frenzy to please a score or two of excitable feather-headed folk. </para>

The only vote he really was concerned about then was a vote to displace the Labour Government, and restore him to the position of a Cabinet Minister. I know what forces are behind this fusion. There is no doubt that newspaperdom is behind it.. There has been a fusion of political parties, and a fusion of newspapers throughout Australia. There are only two parties now in politics - Labour and anti-Labour. </para>

We are told that the only reason why a number of so-called Liberals joined the present fusion party was because their political existence was threatened by outside Labour organizations. Members of Parliament who sacrifice principles in which they believe because they are afraid of losing their seats, are not entitled to much consideration or respect. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne was threatened with opposition in his constituency. Various meetings of Labour leagues were held, and urged that a Labour candidate should be run in opposition to him; but that did not prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne from remaining true to the pledges he made to the people who had returned him. </para>

No member of any other political party has greater freedom of conscience and action. What freedom or independence of action have many honorable senators on the other side? We know that they were not even consulted about the fusion of parties. </para>

It is because of this big combination that I venture to assert that not one honorable senator sitting on the other side can claim to-day to be a free man. Every honorable senator who is a member of the fusion party, and who has subscribed to its platform, whatever that may be, must support it up to the hilt. He dare not break away . from, that party, because', if he did, his political existence would be brought to an end. In every vote which some honorable senators opposite will give upon matters which have to be dealt with by this Parliament, they will abandon their life-long principles, or their names will be omitted from the newspaper ticket when the general election comes round. That is a very humiliating position for honorable senators to be placed in. </para>

No combination of the newspapers in any part of Australia can force any Labour member to do that which he does not believe to be right. But some honorable senators opposite have recently done what they knew in their hearts to be wrong, in order merely to save their political skins. The present Government have submitted to Parliament a printed statement, in which I find one or two paragraphs, under the heading " Industrial," that call for consideration. Referring to the Inter-State Commission, I find the statement made - </para>

                        is known to every observing man that in the city of Melbourne there are thousands of unemployed. There is not a trade or calling affiliated with the Trades and Labour Council of Victoria that has not within its ranks scores of unemployed men, who are anxious for work, and unable to obtain it. There is not a city, town, borough, or hamlet in the whole of this State in which there are not many persons unemployed. Recently I had an opportunity, with a member of the House of Representatives, to visit towns in the Western District of Victoria. In each of those towns we were confronted with men who had been out of work for long periods of time, and who saw no immediate prospect of obtaining employment. Recently, in Warrnambool, which is the centre of a very rich agricultural and pastoral district, Â£300 was set aside by the State Government for the plantation of marram grass, te prevent the drifting of sea sand. For that work no less than 300 men were registered for employment.

                            <para>- I know that that paragraph will be warmly supported by those who believe that population is synonymous with prosperity, and that all that needs to be done in order to insure a permanent and prosperous community is to open wide the gate to all and sundry who wish to come to Australia. But I ask what opportunities offer to the unemployed in our midst, let alone the unemployed in other countries, to obtain land or employment in Australia? It is true that some of the State Governments have introduced systems of immigration. In Western Australia the State Government has been carrying out such a system for a long time. But recent events have shown that in Perth, and in the main cities of Western Australia, there have been agitations of unemployed, who have been clamouring for work, and agitations on the part of recently ai rived immigrants who have been clamouring for land. Some recently arrived  immigrants,  who  deputationized  the State Government, said that they had been through all the States, and were unable to get any land, because the best land was all taken up. One recently arrived immigrant, who was a member of an unemployed deputation, said that when he left the Old Land1 he was promised that as soon as he arrived in Western Australia he would be able to obtain remunerative employment as a farm labourer. He added that 30s. per week ir* Western Australia was not as good as 15s. a week in the Old Country, the wage which he was receiving before he left for Australia. The fact is that there is very little scope in Australia to-day for farm labourers or for labourers of any other description. It is not that there is not ample room for ten times our present population; but because there will never be any permanent prosperity in Australia until we have iri power a Government that realizes the causes of unemployment. What are the causes of unemployment? They are, first of all, land monopoly. Whilst the lands are monopolized in any State of the Commonwealth we can never hope for advancement or progress. </para>

In Victoria recently, we had evidence that certain members of the State "Government were opposed to a tax on land values. They said they had nothing to" learn from New Zealand and yet, after making this statement, they  deputed  the Minister for Lands to go to New Zealand; and since his return the Government have announced their intention to  introduce a scientific system of land taxation and development. </para>

                            <para>- Before a progressive land tax was adopted in New Zealand population was leaving it as fast as it could, and the Dominion was almost on the verge of bankruptcy. But when the late John Ballance came into power, he promptly introduced a measure for the taxation of land values, which resulted in the bursting up of some of the large estates. Additional avenues of employment were thus opened up, thousands of people were settled upon the land, and the clouds of depression were superseded by the sunshine of prosperity. There are many measures on the statute-book of New Zealand which might be copied with advantage even by this Parliament. I know, that we have frequently been told that in the Commonwealth ample land is available to those who may desire it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger lias declared that in Queensland alone there are millions of acres awaiting development. If that were the case, it is remarkable that the Government of that State has, for a long time past, been engaged in the repurchase of estates for closer settlement purposes. In Victoria, estate after estate has been re-purchased. As a matter of fact, from 1901 to 1908, the Victorian Government have re-purchased 211,140 acres, at a cost of ,Â£1,471,300. The total number of persons settled upon the land so resumed is 1,470. </para>

                        <para>In 20 schools, with an aggregate enrolment of.s55&gt; n0 fewer than 503 of the children assisted in dairy work, the time thus spent ranging from one and a-half hours to four hours each day. In addition to dairy work and school work, 117 children walked over two miles to school. On the average, 157 children arrived at school late, while 119 were authorized by parents to leave early. Taking one individual school, with an enrolment of 96, 50 children were engaged in dairying, 35 came late, and 20 left early, the average time spent in dairying work being three hours. The teacher writes : - " Fully 30 per cent, are unfitted to receive the full benefit of instruction, as they are nearly all drowsy, languid, and inert during the afternoon session. This is not so pronounced in winter as in summer. At present few, if any, rise earlier than 5 to 5.30; but the time is now approaching when many will rise at 4 to 4.30 a.m. This is the cause of the tired feeling which pervades the school in the af.ternoon, and any teacher in a dairy centre who denies that it. exists must be himself affected so badly as to be oblivious of his surroundings." The teacher cites individual cases. In one instance, two State boys, aged 10 and 12 respectively, have on occasions to milk from 30 to 40 cows. "The worst cases," he continues,' " are those of State boys and families engaged on shares or wages. In these </para>

Nearly three decades ago some of this land was classified, under the Berry Act as second and third class, and was then valued at <inline font-style="italic">Â£2</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Â£3</inline> per acre. Some of the land acquired at has been let at from 8s. 6d. to 30s. per acre per annum. So high have been the rents exacted that men who have done their best to make a livelihood upon it, have had to give up the task in despair. Upon these estates only about fifty men are permanently employed. Under a progressive land tax these estates, as well as others, would be broken up, and prosperity would be created, not only in that portion of Victoria, but in every other part of the Commonwealth. </para>

The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said, when it was first proposed to bring about the fusion of parties, that such an alliance would be like that of a lamb with a leopard. But the unnatural alliance has been consummated. I do not know what members of Parliament the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> writer had in his mind. The probabilities are that by the lambs he meant such as the three Liberal members of. the Senate - Senators Keating, Best, and Trenwith - and by the leopards he probably meant all those who hold views in contradistinction to theirs. The leopard cannot change his spots. Neither can political leopards. They have merely changed their seats. </para>

                            <para>- There is no wailing and gnashing of teeth on our part because we are in Opposition, but there is detestation with respect to the change of opinions of certain honorable senators opposite. The combination is unnatural, and. therefore, I believe that it will be brought to a speedy termination. I am satisfied that the fusion cannot hang together for a lengthened period, because it consists of so many divergent views and contrary parties, constituted of the flotsam and jetsam of almost every political party that we have had in Australia since the inception of Federation. How can we expect such a party to work for Australia's greatness and advancement? The thing is impossible. The motion before the Chair is that a paper be printed. The paper is already printed, and, therefore, the motion simply means that we are asked to approve of the policy of the Government, whatever it is. The more one reads the statement, the more difficult it is to understand it. But whatever it contains- </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know that I should have spoken in this debate except for the fact that I have been personally named by . several speakers. It appears to me that the debate is bound to be a fruitless one, and it is occupying time that might be more profitably employed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was, I think, the first to refer to me as sitting over here in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray, Senator Pulsford,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> My answer to that is that I have never sat anywhere else than where I now sit since I have been in'the Senate, and that I have done so for physical reasons. Without regard to those in power, I shall continue to sit here, so that the seat which I occupy does not indicate anything. But it is perhaps due to my comrades in the Senate, and to the  100,000  odd people who voted for me at the election, that I should define my attitude in regard to the present situation. When we dispersed for the recess, I was sitting here in conjunction with supporters of the late Labour Government. My honorable friends opposite know that my sympathies during the whole of my political life have Ijeen with the aspirations of the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- And my political acts have been in the same direction. However, the Labour Government was dispossessed. Now, I had some voice in the discussion as to whether they should be dispossessed, and, as vigorously as I was able, I urged that an effort to remove them from' office should not be made. But the party with whom I have also been associated during my political life - the Democratic party in Victoria - decided that their support of the Government should be withdrawn. Singularly enough, it was withdrawn in exactly the manner in' which the Labour party's support of the Deakin Government was withdrawn. Admittedly, the Labour party had no fault to find with their policy. </para>

                            <para>- That, at all events, was my impression. The Labour party sent a notice to the Deakin Government - a formal, polite, and courteous notice - stating that the Government could not rely upon their support any further. No reason was given, except that the time for withdrawing the support had arrived'. That is my recollection of the case. The Deakin Government were put out, and they recognised, as far as their action went, that their removal was inevitable, and that it was not a matter to scream over or screech about, or an occasion for making a noise, or calling nasty names. They retired. There was, as I understand, a desire on the part of those who were in direct Opposition to coalesce with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and the Deakin party, as the Labour party had coalesced with the Opposition to put out the Deakin party. </para>

                            <para>- The Opposition voted with the Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> refused to be any party to the procedure that was suggested to him. I think that that was a gracious and a proper position for him to take. The new Government had a right to have time in which to frame their proposals and present them to the country and to Parliament. The support of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> party was the absolutely necessary condition of the Labour Government having the chance to succeed with its policy. But it proceeded at once, or as. quickly as it possibly could, to give notice to quit to those people upon whom it must rely for its continued existence. Personally, that consideration would not influence me. It never has done. But I can easily understand the attitude of men who said/" These people have declared their desire that they shall not be further burdened with our support; they have expressed their desire that we shall be removed from the arena that enables us to support them ; therefore, it is necessary for us to consider how the principles in which we believe may be maintained.''' </para>

                            <para>- I shall state what my hopes are. I am endeavouring to point out clearly the situation as it presents itself to my niind. As I have said, I spoke and voted against a similar message being sent to the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> as had been sent to the previous Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> Then a further question arose, and that was a proposal to amalgamate, coalesce or form an alliance, with the direct Opposition. The ground on which that alliance was, it was said, to be made was that the Opposition had agreed to a very large number of the views which I held and have held for years, and which honorable senators opposite hold and have held for years. For instance, as honorable senators know, during all my political career I have been an extremely militant Protectionist. Perhaps I may be wrong, but I earnestly believe in that policy, and the allegation is that the Opposition have agreed that there shall be no interfering with the Tariff in the direction of Free Trade, and that so far as there is any interference to remove anomalies it shall be on the lines of the Protectionist policy. I do not knbw whether they are in earnest about that, and can be relied upon; but if they are I do not care that during all their lives they have been engaged in resisting Protection. My practice lias always been to accept good from wherever it came however unlikely it was that good could come from that source. In that connexion I am perfectly easy in my mind, though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell assures me that if I were to go to Adelaide now to say anything on political matters I should be gagged. I do not believe it. I do not believe that in Adelaide or anywhere else the people of Australia who have observed my actions for the last thirty years, would do that. </para>

These honorable senators who are sitting by me, and to whom the honorable senator refers as being round my neck have been my comrades here for nearly six years. The bulk of them have held views very widely diverging from mine. During the whole of that period I have done them the honour to acknowledge that they earnestly differed from me, and that they believed that they were right. They claim now, some of them, to be willing and prepared to believe in some of the views I hold. If they are prepared to give effect to them I am here to assist them by every means in my power. That is my position. </para>

                            <para>- I am waiting. I have not said anything objectionable to my friends opposite, as they know, although some persons have said things of me aggressively. I do not allude to honorable senators, because I have to acknowledge that from them I have received thji. greatest possible courtesy and kindness, and I T believe confidence. I refer to members of an organization who for years have said things of me and at me and to me for which there was no warrant, and it will be observed by any person who has taken any notice that I have never hit back or said anything in return. I am not hitting back now. It is only when it is said that I am in an awkward position that I speak. I am not in the slightest  difficulty. I am perfectly independent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Findley</inline> mentioned my name several times, and spoke of honorable senators on this side as being press fettered or in some other way fettered. But permit nae to inform him, and anybody else who thinks that I am press or otherwise fettered, that I am not built that way. I never have been, and am not likely to be fettered by any consideration other than my judgment of what is right. My position is that if the Labour Government had been permitted to remain in office there was a great deal of its policy which I should have ardently indorsed. It was not permitted to remain; it is not here to present its policy, but I am a trustee of the people of Victoria sent here to watch the legislation that is presented, and to endeavour to advance and facilitate the carrying of measures in the interests of the people. </para>

H. Irvine. When the fate of the Federal Constitution, which we now applaud, was trembling in the balance in Victoria, I, as a member of the Convention, who was very much dissatisfied with some of the provisions of the Bill, but still convinced that on the whole it was a Bill that we ought to indorse, said so. I was on a platform to advocate its acceptance, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> Smith, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> B. Patterson, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duncan</inline> Gillies, and a number of others who were called the . most ultra Tories in Victoria, and I was twitted with that. I replied, " It does not matter to me who come on to my platform I welcome them," and some members of the Labour organization in- Victoria called me traitor. I have had that term yelled out at me in the street because of that act. At that time the Labour party in Victoria were opposed to the acceptance of the Constitution Bill on the ground that it was undemocratic, and I' was called a traitor because, with a fuller knowledge, and, perhaps, in some instances, with a better judgment, I thought it on the whole a democratic Bill. Honorable senators know that now the Labour party think that it is an extremely democratic Constitution, not yet what they would like, but better than anything that surrounds us on any hand, And they are anxious, some of them, to bring all legislation under its provisions by means of unification. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is in error. I can tell him what he is thinking of, if the  President  will kindly permit me. Some years ago there was a meeting Weld at the Town Hall to form a league. I think it was a Federal league. It was proposed to mix two issues, and I objected to another issue being added to the one under discussion. I forget now the subject, but I am perfectly clear that my objection was not to the granting of womanhood suffrage, because I had always been in favour of that : in fact, I had always advocated it from every platform where I had the opportunity, and I was  president  of the league in Victoria when we succeeded in achieving our object. The ground of my objection on that occasion was the mixing of two issues. That shows the unfairness of that kind of opposition that twists circumstances unwarrantably, in order to make it appear that a man holds views which he does not. </para>

                            <para>- It does matter, because these things are being twisted. I will assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is engaged in dealing with a trade union matter, and some one' comes forward with a proposition which is entirely irrelevant to the issue. If it were relevant, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> would be in accord with it ; but, being irrelevant, the honorable senator would very; properly say, " I quite agree with your view, but this is not the time or place for your proposition." That is the kind of opposition I presented at the time to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> refers. Of course, all who know me are aware that it is incorrect to say that I ever was opposed to the female franchise. Indeed, in supporting the Constitution Bill throughout Victoria, I argued 'that the provision it made for adult suffrage was one of the elements of its splendidly democratic character. It was made imperative, under the Constitution, that the 'franchise for Australia must be an adult franchise. We provided that the Federal Parliament might create a uniform franchise; but it could not take from any citizen or set of citizens the franchise they enjoyed, and, as the women had the franchise in South Australia at the time the Constitution was framed, it was imperative that, whenever a uniform franchise was adopted, it must include every adult in Australia. So <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> will see that he was in error in his assumption that that was the ground of objection to me. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. There was a time when other members of this Senate were "new" Protectionists; and a time, since my presence here, when other honorable senators who have been very loud in their advocacy of Protection, declared that Free Trade was the proper policy. I do not think that they were dishonest when they said that Free Trade was right. I believe that they thought so. I do not think they are dishonest now when they say that Protection is right. I believe that they have been converted. I think that is a fair and proper assumption ; and it is, at any rate, the assumption on which I desire to proceed. </para>

                                looks jolly, but he is not as happy as I have known him to be. I said a few minutes ago that my mission here is to legislate. The members of the late Government are not now in a position to propose any measures of legislation for my approval. There is in office a Government who have undertaken to present some measures of which I heartily approve. I. want to get on with those measures, or to prove that the Government is not in earnest. Honorable senators opposite say that the Government, and those supporting them, are not in earnest, and are only pretending that they believe in these things. Are they not acting suicidally in, I will not say wasting, but in unnecessarily occupying time? If they believe what they say and I think they do, surely their policy is to sit as quiet as possible and compel the introduction of these measures by the people who they say do not wish to introduce them ?

                            <para>- Perhaps my honorable friend is right in suggesting that we get a little amusement out of- the discussion, which, otherwise we should lose. But generally speaking, discussions of this character are subversive of progress and of useful work. I again urge that my honorable friends opposite desire measures and not office. </para>

Honorable senators opposite are playing entirely into the hands of the Ministerial party by getting up all this excitement and making long' speeches. </para>

It was at my instance that provision for the payment of a minimum wage to labourers was placed in such -i concrete and definite form that it became impossible for contractors to evade it. It was at my instance that an old-age pensions system was introduced into Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- No. There was no pension payable at the time to which the honorable senator refers. The law had1 lapsed, and if a proposal had not been made in favour of the 'payment of 8s.  a  week by the Government of which I was then a member, our old-age pensioners would have received' no shillings a week. The wise course for us to follow in connexion with progressive legislation is to accept at once what is practicable, and to reach out subsequently for the other portion, which we have not been able to obtain - not to determine that we must have the whole loaf or nothing. A pension of 8s. per week at the time of which the honorable senator speaks was possible; but with the Legislative Council which we then had a payment of ros. per week would have been impossible. To-day in this State old-age pensioners receive ios. per week. </para>

"They have indicated that in the event of failure, they propose, to take the steps which I have suggested.

                            <para>- That is their opinion, perhaps ; it is not mine. I see no real difference between the issue of a paper currency and a silver currency. Neither the one nor the other is money in the sense of being equivalent to face value. Both the paper currency and the silver are simply promises to pay, and they only have effect as currency on the security of the State that issues them. If the State that issues them is an insecure and Insolvent State, they will not pass at their face value, but simply at their intrinsic value. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to enter at length into a discussion of what would be necessary to guarantee a paper currency. But I should like to say, incidentally, that in Great Britain, or in any part of Australia, twenty shillings can be exchanged with ease for a sovereign, without any trouble, because the guarantee behind them gives them their face value. If we can do that in regard to ten shillings' worth of silver, we can do it with regard to a farthing's worth of paper. It may have no intrinsic value . at all ; but the guarantee behind it constitutes an effective and face value guarantee. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely expressing my own views. I do not know that there are any other points in the Government's programme with which I disagree. I have expressed my attitude about the efficacy of their method of securing the new Protection. But I also express my confidence in their earnestness, and my belief that if they find that the method they are at present adopting is ineffective, they will adopt the other method. I doubt the wisdom of borrowing. I think it not necessary, on any evidence that has at present been submitted. In a general wav, I look upon borrowing as dangerous and bad' in principle. The Commonwealth has;' initiated the principle of paying for new  public works out of revenue. It has done that very largely. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is an admirable one. The Commonwealth has already spent something like Â£3,500,000 on new public works. Under the conditions that prevailed in the States, and under the conditions that some honorable senators desire to initiate in the Commonwealth, we should have spent loan money to that amount. If money, had been borrowed, close upon ,Â£500,000 would already have been paid in interest. </para>

                            <para>- Assuming that the payments extended over the eight years during which the Commonwealth has been in existence, the interest payments would te a great deal more ; but I do not know exactly the period within which these expenditures were undertaken, and it is necessary to know that, in order to be able 10 say how much interest would have accrued. But, at any rate, we should have spent a considerable sum in interest. As we have not spent the money in that way, these reproductive works must have earned that money for us ; and we have got it to spend this year, without costing the people of Australia one penny. I think that that is worth remembering; and I take the liberty to mention it here, in order that honorable senators may not be deceived at any time as to the attitude that I intend to take up. </para>

                            <para>- I regret them, nevertheless, because I was very anxious not to say anything to hurt any one's feelings. I am amongst friends here ; because I call all the members of this Senate my comrades, and I flatter myself that many of them are personal friends. Amongst: friends, I do not think that words that are offensive should be used ; nor should there be any undue heat; and I am very sorry if anything that I have said has hurt anyone. I assure those who, perhaps in mv interest, fear that I am tied, or trammelled, that they can disabuse their minds of that idea. I am not tied or enslaved in anyway. </para>

                        <para>. - If there is any party in this Senate that ought to be satisfied with the present, state of affairs, it is the Labour party. They are now in the position to which they have endeavoured to attain for some considerable time. Personally, I compliment the ex-Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> on. having made at Gympie a very straight-out manly speech, showing exactly the course which he and the Labour party intend to pursue. It is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> put it, a policy of State Socialism. That is. shown, by the fact that it is acknowledged that the party is going for land nationalization.. The nationalization of the land is, I suppose, one of the first things to te achieved if State Socialism is to te carried out. </para>

                            <para>- Then, I should' like to know what State Socialism does mean. I understood that it meant the nationalization of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange; and if the land is .not the first means of production, I am afraid that the issue is not as clean cut as it ought to te. The Labour party, I think, are perfectly justified in saying that they are going to secure a majority of seats 'if they can. They are justified in saying that they do not look upon any mail as being "as good as Labour," if he is not a member of their party. In that respect, we have a clean-cut issue. If the Labour party are returned on their own policy with a majority, they should be in a position to carry out that policy without the aid of any other party. It has not been so in the past. There is no doubt that the Labour party attempted to push <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> as far as they possibly could. When they could not push him any further, they said, "You stand aside now; we will lead and you can push." But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was not prepared to do the pushing, as the Labour party had done it for him. It is right that we should get to the position of two parties in politics. Then, whatever Government is in power will be supported by those who are in agreement with the whole of their policy, and they themselves will be responsible for that policy to the country. </para>

He said that some of us were Conservatives. I never professed to be a Conservative. I do not see how there can be a Conservative party in a young country like this. Any party that wants to stand in the way of progress must be pushed on one side. The electors of South Australia returned me on the opinions which I expressed. I had the support of certain organizations ; but none of them asked me to sign their platform, or questioned me as to what I believed in. They supported me on my public utterances. </para>

I wish to come now to the statement which the Government have presented. I confess that it seems to me to be rather general in its character. ' I should have been pleased if it had been a little more definite in some of its expressions. It is proposed in the statement I notice to appoint an Inter-State Commission, and to clothe it with what I regard as very large powers.  It is to perform the functions of a Board of Trade, to have a general oversight of production and exchange, to act as a Federal Labour Bureau, to supervise the working of the Customs Tariff in its operation upon the investment of Australian capital and labour in Australian industries, to advise in regard to inconsistencies in its schedules, and so on.

I am one of those who believe that there should be as little interference as possible. I do not think that there should be any clashing between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to industrial legislation. It may be right that where any State has not made legislative provision for the securing of fair and proper wages- to the workers, the Commonwealth should be able to step in, but I believe that the work can be better done by the States than by the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is not for me to say, but I imagine that there must be legislation for the purpose of granting the power. I do not believe in freedom of contract between employers and employes. I hold that we should endeavour to see that fair wages are paid for fair labour. But, on the other hand, I do not believe in a State coddling manufactures. It was said just now that the Commonwealth may interfere where there is no State legislation, but I do not think that it ought to interfere where a State has made satisfactory provision for securing fair conditions of labour in various industries. So far as I can learn the idea of the Labour party was to hand the whole of the industrial conditions of the 'Commonwealth over to the Federal Arbitration Court for administration. It was said, I think, in the first place, that such administration should apply to protected industries only, but later I understand the proposal was extended to all industries. I do not think that the change of view matters very much, because I can hardly find an industry which is not protected. It appears to me that pretty well every industry in a State, right down to primary producers, is protected. Therefore, the Federal Court must have power to deal with all industries. </para>

The same thing can be said, in regard to the farming industry, as there are duties on hay, wheat, and oats. The dairying industry is also protected, as there are duties on butter, cheese, bacon, and other articles. If the whole of the industries are handed over to the Arbitration Court every industry will be brought within its control. </para>

                            <para>- If the whole of the industries are handed, over to the Arbitration Court they must come under its control. It is all very well to hand over to a Court the power to fix wages, and it may be a very right thing to hand over legislation with regard to conditions of trade, that is as to how a man shall carry on his manufacture. But there is one thing which we cannot do. We cannot pass a law which will make a man earn the wage fixed for him, and that is perhaps where a difficulty may arise. </para>

                            <para>- What I wish to point out is that the Legislature cannot surround industries with a set of artificial conditions which will not stand the ordinary strain and stress of commercial life, and. very often, that is what is proposed. In these matters I do not like a resort by the parties to a Court. It antagonizes the parties straight away. One is plaintiff and one is defendant, and instead of going into Court in a friendly fashion, the parties go in almost as enemies. I believe in the principle of conciliation, conference, mutual consideration. I have always supported the use of Wages Boards, because it brings together the people who are directly connected with the industry, and know all about its conditions. I believe that they are more competent to fix up these matters amongst themselves than any Court could be. </para>

                            <para>- The men at Broken Hill and Block Ten were out. However, that does hot alter my contention, that in all cases the people who are interested and working in a trade, whatever it may be, are better able to come to a satisfactory decision than a Court is likely to be. The other night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> whois not here now, instanced one employer who said that employers were not responsible for women and children. Is it fair to take that man as a typical employer? </para>

They were going to take employment with the company, and then strike a blow by leaving the works at an opportune time - a time when metals were high and things were blooming.. He hoped that the men who went on at the smelters and the refinery would do as little work as they possibly could, as that would be good enough for capitalism. </para>

When he was addressing the men of his own trade, he said, " Always do your best, and put as good work on the inside of the wall as on the outside." . That is much better than the advice given by the man at Port Pirie. </para>

                            <para>- I am not talking about the law, but about men. A reference is made in the Ministerial statement to the intention of the Government to adopt a policy of immigration to settle people on our lands. The reply to that is that there is no land, and that it is necessary to break up the big estates. For that purpose, the Labour Government proposed to impose a very stiff progressive land tax. I believe that the idea was eventually to make it the first step in a policy of land nationalization. If that be so, it was of very little use to throw the sop proposed to the man holding land worth less than Â£5,000. If the object were nationalization of the land, it would not matter whether a man held Â£50,000 worth or Â£50 worth of land, eventually the rental value would all be taxed out. </para>

                                Russell will admit that he has contended that land taxation was necessary to burst up the big estates. After all we have heard, it is not a little strange to learn that only 6.62 per cent, of the land of the Commonwealth has so far been alienated. It is a libel upon Australia to say that the whole of our good land is comprised in that 6.62 per cent.

He is a Labour man, and a practical farmer. He was a member of the Wheat Commission appointed in that State, and, as such, paid a visit of inspection to the west coast, and also to the lands east of . the Murray. After going over the land, he submitted a report on what he saw, in which he said, referring to lands on the Murray and on Eyre's Peninsula - </para>

                        <para>No doubt many seekers after land will be asking which is the better place to go to - the Peninsula or the country just reviewed. On the Peninsula there is more country available, probably 2,000,0000 acres, as against 1,000,000 acres here ; consequently, there is a greater extent of good country in the larger area. The Murray country is nearer the centres of population ; a gulf has to be crossed to get to the Peninsula land. The rainfall on the Peninsula is probably more reliable than across the Murray. Some have friends doing well in both places. These and other minor considerations will influence settlers in their choice, but whether they go across the Gulf or across the Murray they will find land on which they will be able to build up happy and prosperous homes, and become contributing factors in the great development which should take place in every direction as the result of opening up some 3,000,000 acres of land to profitable settlement. </para>

                        <para>I boldly assert that the bulk of the land holders in' Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia have been cutting up and selling their estates for the last ten to twenty years, and they are now, especially in Victoria and Riverina, where the demand is the greatest, putting a large quantity of land on the market. I say that at the present time there is more land " offering - mainly in New South Wales - than there are men to buy it. </para>

                        <para>I notice that the young men of the present day don't care to go out to the Mallee in Victoria or .the western division of New South Wales or to Queensland ; they like a nice climate, close to a railway, and not too far from Melbourne or Sydney. Look at the Victorians who have helped to colonize Queensland ; the Fairbairns, Olivers, Murphys, then men like Sydney Kidman, the late C. B. and Hurtle Fisher, they did not stay in the green grass country. </para>

                            <para>- I have quoted the statement, and it is open to contradiction if it can be fairly contradicted. I say that it is an absolute fact that what the Labour , party wants to do is to burst up the estates close to railway lines, where all pioneering work has been done, and I hold that we should encourage our young men to go out and . do some .pioneering work themselves. A land tax will not open these waste places. It will not assist in the defence of the country. It will not put people upon these open spaces. </para>

                            <para>- No. Everybody has a right to contribute his fair share of taxation towards the government of the country. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell of yet another scriptural passage which he will find in all the synoptic gospels. It is related that Jesus Christ said to a certain young man " Sell all that <inline font-style="italic">thou</inline> hast and give to the poor." But a progressive land tax means - if it means anything - " Go thou and sell all that some other people have and give to the community." </para>

In this connexion I am forcibly reminded of a story which I heard some time ago concerning two men who were arguing about the Scriptures. One said to the other, " I can prove to you that, according to the Bible, you ought to commit suicide." The other replied, " Nonsense, the Bible does not teach that." Then the first speaker said, "Does not the Bible say that  Ahithophel  went home, put his house in order, and hanged himself." " But," replied his companion, "That proves nothing," to which the first  speaker  retorted, " Yes, but does not the Bible also say, ' Go thou and do likewise' ?" Of course, the argument is not convincing, but it is about as good as some of the scriptural quotations which are made in this Senate. With the proposal of the Ministry to appoint a High Commissioner I heartily agree. It is high time that Australia was properly represented in London, just as are the other over-sea Dominions. I observe in the Ministerial statement of policy a reference to the Northern Territory. The statement is made - </para>

Not long ago I was a member of a deputation which waited on the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> in Adelaide, for the purpose of asking him whether he would carry the transcontinental railway from Pine Creek- through the centre of the Northern Territory. He declined to pledge himself to do so. " What I wish to know is whether the Northern Territory is to be taken over by the Commonwealth under the terms of the agreement made with the South Australian Government. If a railway is not to be built from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, we have a right to know how it is intended to- develop the Territory. As far as I can see it can be developed only by the construction of that line. Such a railway is necessary for the purpose of developing the country, as well as for defence purposes. If a line be constructed east of the Territory that will not result in its development. Should the </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth must be in the position to pour in men by the thousand, and deal out lire and steel to any one who questions the effectiveness- of its occupation. To do this it must build that strategic railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek to connect the Territory with the more populous portions of the Commonwealth, and make it ours in fact as well as in name. Even if the Territory were a desolate waste, "full of devils," and unhealthy to boot, that railway would be necessary, vital, indispensable to the safety of the Australian nation. But the Territory is not a barren waste, and, in addition to securing something extra in the shape of natural safety, the Commonwealth stands to gain in importance and wealth by linking up the empty province and settling it with a white fighting population. All moneys expended in the taking over and occupying of the Territory would be merely capital invested in a remunerative business. It is a land of immense possibilities. Around its vast' coastline is a strip of country varying from 80 to ioo miles in width, in which, the rainfall averages over 40 inches per annum, and in some portions of which it averages over 65. This gives a well-watered area of 86,500 square miles, capable of maintaining a population of 30,000,000 or 40,000,000. The island of Java supports 29,000,000 on an area of 50,500 square miles, a large portion of which is rugged mountain, and quite unfit for cultivation. Practically the whole sea-board of the Territory is suitable for cultivation of some sort, and the interior is far from being the sandy desolation it has been painted. In addition to the 86,500 square miles, which average over 40 inches annually, there is another strip of 120,600 square miles which has between 30 and 40 inches annually ; 96,790 square miles with between 20 and 30; 213,430 with between 10 and 20; and 6,300 with less than 10 inches per annum. </para>

                        <para>The requirements of our transcontinental line are tremendous, and it is doubtful if there is any other country in the world, except Mexico, where nature has given a route which combines all the essentials of such a railway as does the Oodnadatta to Pine Creek line. </para>

                                <para>Being a strategic line for the conveyance of troops in war time, it must take the shortest route across the continent. The O.P. Ck. line fills the bill excellently. It crosses the continent at its narrowest part, the distance from water to sea being only 1,638 miles. In considering this matter, it must be remembered that Port Augusta lies over 100 miles north of Sydney, and that Adelaide is only So miles south of the New South Wales capital on exactly the same parallel of latitude as Jervis Bay. </para>
                            </item>
                            <item label="2.">
                                <para>Very often it happens that the shortest route presents so many engineering difficulties that a longer line is more quickly built. But in this case the facts are all the other way. For not only is the Oodnadatta-Pine Creek line the shortest in actual distance, but it starts off with the additional advantage of having 575 miles already constructed, and which can be changed in a few weeks from narrow to broad gauge. </para>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <para>In building a strategic line through a country where there is no population to offer local resistance, and to build up armies by making good the attrition of war, country must be chosen that lends itself to defence. And the only course across Central Australia that does lend itself to defence is that which would be traversed by that same Pine Creek to Oodnadatta line. Of this more anon. </para>
                        <para>As the best defence is a sturdy and numerous population, extracting its living from the soil, our strategic railway, in addition to providing the shortest route across the continent, and being the line most quickly built, must also be one that will encourage settlement. It should run through country with a good rainfall, and where the land is not alienated in large blocks, and where the Government can hold out inducements to the people to go on the land. And again, the Oodnadatta to Pine Creek line fills the bill. So much has fixture favoured Australia in this respect that it really looks as though the continent had been specially designed by the Defence Department of nature's creation department. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that justice is going to be done, not only to South Australia, but to the Territory itself. It should be handled so as to be effectively occupied and thus made valuable for defence purposes. That brings me to the defence proposals of the Government. No reference is made to the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> question in the Ministerial statement. I said in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> a little while ago, that I agree with the statement quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">South Australian Register.</inline> So I do. But the Commonwealth Government have submitted a proposition to the British authorities. If in reply to that the British Government were to say, " The very best thing that you can do is to build us a battleship," I should vote for the proposal, and should personally subscribe all I possibly could towards the fund. Personally, however, I do not think that that is the best thing to do. We can render better assistance in some other way. As the question has been put to the Imperial Government, we have to wait for their answer. We want to know how they think we can best assist them in the defence of the Empire, and in retaining British supremacy at sea. I shall await with much interest the proposals that are made. With regard to the matter of universal military training, and the establishment of an army, my personal opinion is that some modification of the Swiss system would be the best that we could adopt. We could not adopt the Swiss system exactly, because Switzerland is a compact little country, whilst ours is a large one. But the principle is sound. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It would have made no difference to the States, but it might have made a difference in respect to the surplus paid over. If the Commonwealth had made the interest payment on the properties instead of the States the debit would have been to the Commonwealth instead <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> to the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> suggested handing overÂ£5,000,000 per annum to the States for all time, with some oddments thrown in. The State Premiers declared that the States could only remain solvent with an income from Customs and Excise ofÂ£6, 750,000 per annum. I want to see the Braddon section done away with, and the bookkeeping entries abolished. If the Commonwealth wants to raise one pound in taxation, I do not want to see it compelled to impose taxes to the amount of Â£4., in order that it may return 7 5 per cent, to the States. If a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grant were made to the States - and I suppose that it would be something like 25s. per head- it would allow both the Commonwealth and the States to expand together. As population increased their revenues would increase and the system would be fair, both to the Commonwealth and to the States. </para>

                            <para>- I notice in the paragraph in the Ministerial statement, in regard to the Post and Telegraph Office, that there is to be a new departure. It does not sav what the new departure is. If it means borrowing money, I say that is perfectly legitimate for reproductive public works. It is not possible for us to carry out all the works which the Commonwealth will require without raising money bv way of loan, and there is no harm in that system- provided the works themselves are reproductive. I wonder how Australia would have got on if the system of paying for everything out of revenue had been adopted from the commencement in the States. Wc have 16,212 miles of railway, and the cost of building and equipment was Â£139,988,015. I venture to say that if the railways of the States were sold, what they realized would practically wipe out the debts of the States. But if the States had -said, " We will not build a railway until we have the revenue to pay for it," how many miles would have been built? Take the waterworks and the water conservation works that have been carried out. Suppose the States had said, " We will not do a stroke of this necessary work until we can pay for it out of revenue." How much should we have done? Progress would have been practically impossible.- The same may be said with regard to sewerage and sanitation works. If the States had waited until revenue accumulated, they would have had to wait a very long time. Take industrial operations. Nearly 249,000 people are employed in our industries. The wages paid per annum amount to over Â£18,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- No, but suppose that business men had said, "We will not launch out until our accumulated profits enable us to start new works. We will not borrow money to enable us to buy new plant and erect new buildings," to what extent would our industries have increased? Does not a business man, if he has any enterprise, and sees a good opening for business, go at once to his banker and borrow the necessary money ? As his business develops he pays interest at .5 per cent., or whatever the rate may be, and if he makes five or ten per cent, for himself, he is very well satisfied. A great deal of claptrap is talked with regard to a non-borrowing policy. It will be found eventually to be impossible to carry it out. I do not believe in indiscriminate borrowing. I say distinctly that money ought only to be borrowed for reproductive works. If that is done it is a logical policy. If we are going to erect buildings which will last 50 years or more, why should not those who come after bear some portion of the extra expenditure? They will reap their share of the benefit. I said at the commencement that I should have been glad if the Ministerial statement had been more definite in its terms. I shall have to ' wait until the various measures are introduced to determine whether they will receive my absolute support. I hope that we will soon get to business, and that measures will be introduced which will be for the benefit of. the country. I am prepared to judge the Government from their measures. If they are not worth supporting, we will throw them out. If they cannot introduce measures that ought to be passed, they must make way for others who can. But we cannot make up our minds on that point until we have disposed of this preliminary business, and given the Government the opportunity to bring forward their Bills. Upon their measures we shall judge them. I trust that they will be such as will commend them to the support of the Senate generally. </para>
