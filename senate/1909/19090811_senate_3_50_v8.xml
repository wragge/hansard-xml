                        <para>- I wish to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council if he will make inquiries, and communicate the results to me to-morrow, as to the action taken by the Minister of Defence in relation to the case of the man MacDonnell, who was injured in the Murrurundi railway accident. The Minister stated that action was being taken, and I should like to be informed of what is going on. Might I explain that I put the question because I have not had an opportunity since arriving in Melbourne to consult with the Vice-President of the Executive Council on the subject privately. </para>

                    <para class="block">This Bill is designed to assimilate to a very substantial extent Commonwealth legislation with British legislation on the subject of patents. Valuable as such assimilation undoubtedly is, we have a more important object in submitting this measure, and that is to give protection to the Commonwealth against the abuses of patents issued in regard to inventions, which have become so flagrant in connexion with their working elsewhere. The main features of the Bill refer to the compulsory working of patents in certain circumstances, and in connexion with this to the issue of compulsory licences in regard to them, and the making null and void, and otherwise dealing with certain restrictive and repressive conditions which have been inserted in contracts in regard to patented inventions. When I speak of the. leading feature of the Bill as the compulsory working of patents, in circumstances which I shall afterwards explain, I wish honorable senators to understand that this measure proposes no harshness, nor, indeed, will it impose any hardship, but it provides that patentees are to be called upon to carry out what are recognised obligations at common law - to carry out in connexion with their patents .those undertakings which they were expected to carry out as a matter of course so soon as their patents were granted. The underlying principle of this legislation, involved in clauses to which I shall direct attention, is set out in a very succinct manner in a famous passage which I take from the report of a well-known case. This case lays down the legal and economic basis upon which patents were issued. The case referred to is that of <inline font-style="italic">Darcy</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Allin,</inline> and I ask honorable senators to carefully note the principles therein laid down-1- </para>

                    <para class="block">That still further emphasizes the principle to which I have already referred. All went well so long as patents were granted only to Britishers. But in the beginning of the nineteenth century patents were granted to Britishers and! foreigners alike, and as a result there gradually grew up an extraordinary abuse. The two main reasons for exempting this particular class of monopoly from the Statute of Monopolies were, first, consideration for the disclosure of the invention, and, secondly, a desire to encourage local trade and industry. If honorable senators will bear these two main reasons in mind they will readily understand the character of the abuse which subsequently became established. The outcome of the grant, indifferently to foreigners and Britishers, of these patents, which were really a protection and privilege granted by  His  Majesty the King, was that they were ultimately used as a weapon for the encouragement of foreign trade and the discouragement of British trade. The process or method &#39;adopted was this : A British patent would be taken put in the usual way, the effect of which would be to hold the market so&#39; far as the products of that particular invention were concerned. But instead of that patent being worked in the Mother Country, thus establishing British industries, it would be worked in a foreign country - chiefly in Germany or America. Consequently, millions of capital, were invested in industries in other countries, and the products of those industries were placed upon the British market, which the patentee held by reason of the monopoly which Had been granted to him, within the United Kingdom. The patentee in the United&#39; Kingdom, therefore, by manufacturing in the cheapest foreign market, had the power to nominate the prices which he . would charge for foreign goods thus introduced. He was able to charge the British consumer whatever he thought proper for those products. Thus, . it came about that the British workman - who had a right to. expect to participate in the employment afforded by those industries - had no work provided for him in connexion with them, and, in many cases, was thus largely deprived of an opportunity to earn a livelihood*. He had no chance of acquiring knowledge or experience of these, new inventions,, and when the patent rights expired, markets for their products had already been permanently established in foreign countries. So colossal were the abuses which were thus established that at the time the Amending Patents Bill was submitted to the Imperial Parliament in  1907,  it was estimated that the British public had lost something like  ^600,000,000  in capital and wages in connexion with patents which had been issued in, but worked outside, the realm. It was also stated that there . were something like  70,000  foreign patents unworked within the United Kingdom. Under such circumstances the Chancellor of the Exchequer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George,</inline> introduced a Bill into the House of Commons in  1907,  for the purpose of putting an end to these abuses. The measure was passed in August of that year. It contained practically the provisions which we have copied in the Commonwealth, and which are now embodied in a consolidated measure known as the Patent and Designs Act of  1907.  Honorable senators can scarcely credit the colossal results which have followed British legislation on the subject. These can best be appreciated by reference to an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Electrical World</inline> of ,  1.0th  October,  1908.  That article appeared only a few months after the expiry of the twelve months of grace provided for in the Act. One section of that measure provides that,, in the future, any patent issued in the United Kingdom shall be worked there within four years of its grant, but in the case of those patents which were granted prior to the Act becoming operative, twelve months&#39; grace is given within which they are to be worked there. Within a few weeks of the expiration of that twelve months&#39; grace, an extraordinary result followed. -In the first place foreign manufacturers in leading industries were obliged, in order to retain their trade in the Mother Country, to establish manufactures in the United Kingdom.

                    <para class="block">British subjects (including British-Colonials) received from America 1,622 patents, and from Germany 883. It will thus be seen that the British Government has been in the habit of issuing more patents to American and German inventors than the authorities of either of these countries are of issuing to people domiciled in England. Taking the figures for 1907, it is to be observed that in 1907, out of a total of 16,272 persons holding patents issued in the United Kingdom, 2,792 were resident in the United States of America&#39;, and 2,608 in Germany. </para>

                            <para>-- I am coming to that point. The result of this legislation in the United Kingdom was an outcry in Germany and the United States,, and to some extent in France. The Germans in particular said it was an outrageous piece of legislation, designed for the aggrandisement of British manufacturers. Indeed all sorts of threats were indulged in. This seems the more extraordinary when it is remembered that the provisions of the British Act are practically a  reproduction  of legislation enacted by other nations. In nearly every other important nation in the world, except the United States, there is such a law. Especially is that the case with Germany, where the eleventh section of the Patents Act distinctly provides that articles referred to must be manufactured in Germany itself. In other countries also, such as Canada, to which we might rightly refer, it is made an actual condition of a patent that it must be worked&#39; in the country. It may be recollected that we discussed this subject in connexion with the original Patents Bill, in which was included a much stronger provision than that to which I am now alluding. The clause was rejected by the Senate. ; Ihope,however, to make clear the distinction between the two proposals. Clause 83 of the Patents Bill of 1903 provided as follows:- </para>

But a distinction must be made between that and the provision contained in this Bill.

As a matter of fact only two or three patents have been granted there, and the rights of patentees are properly conserved.

Clause 9 refers to patents of addition. Honorable senators are, no doubt, aware that from time to time a patentee finds it necessary to alter his patent or make certain improvements in connexion with it. In this clause provision is made for the taking out of what is known as an additional patent in regard to such alterations, modifications, or improvements. This question is dealt with in section 85 of the principal Act, but this clause is an improvement upon that provision. The chief alteration sought to be effected by this clause is that no fee shall be payable for renewal, and it is provided in sub-clause 4 that - </para>

                    <para class="block">Those are the two main alterations contained in this important provision. Clause 10 deals with the restoration of lapsed patents. It is a new provision, establishing simple and inexpensive machinery for securing the restoration of a patent where, through some unintentional failure on the part of the patentee, the prescribed fee has not been paid, or where there ha.s been some neglect on his part. When he applies for a restoration, it will be necessary for him to prove that the act was unintentional, and that no undue delay has occurred. The Commissioner is granted full power to hear the application, and to make such order as he, in the circumstances, may deem necessary. But, in the meantime, a protection is given to those who may have infringed the patent between the date of its lapsing and the date of its restoration, and any aggrieved party has the right to appeal to the High Court. Clause 11 proposes an important amendment of section 86 of the principal Act. This section provides for. the revocation of patents on petition to the High Court, and sets forth the grounds on which a revocation can be made. Sub- section 9 says - </para>

                    <para class="block">For that sub-section, clause 11 substitutes :t provision, following the terms of the English Act. The main feature of it is that the new .patent is to bear the date of the original patent, and not the date of the revocation. The object is, of course, to prevent the patentee&#39;s right being defeated by some persons who, through design, and for other reasons, intervened in the meantime. Clause 12 proposes a new section with regard to the surrender of patents. It provides a simple and inexpensive process for carrying out the surrender of a patent, and gets rid of certain difficulties. It also provides for proper supervision where an infringement has been made in the meantime, or any proceeding is pending. In a case of that kind, the patentee cannot surrender except by leave of the Court, or by consent of the parties to the action or proceeding. Clause 13 proposes a very important alteration of part V. of the principal Act, dealing with the working of patents and compulsory licences. It was contemplated when the provisions of the part were inserted in the English Acts of, I think, 1883 and 1902.. that they would largely insure the compulsory working of patents ; but they have failed considerably in that respect, and mainly because of the cumbrous and expensive character of the proceedings which had to be resorted to for the purpose of obtaining a compulsory licence. Amongst other things it was necessary that the matter should be referred to the Privy Council, and serious obligations were cast upon the petitioner which should not have been cast upon him. In fact, the position of affairs was reversed, because the burden of proving the necessity of working was. left upon the petitioner, instead of, as is now the case.-  the patentee being required to show that he had absolved himself from working. The Act contains certain other provisions of an oppressive and unreasonable character. In order to bring our law up to and in line with British legislation, subsections 5 and! 6 of section 87 are proposed to be repealed, and a new subsection 6 substituted.

The Commissioner shall consider the application, and if, after inquiry, he is satisfied that the patented article or process is manufactured or carried on exclusively or mainly outside the Commonwealth, then, subject to the provisions of this section, and unless the patentee proves that the article or process is manufactured or carried on to an adequate extent in the Commonwealth, or gives satisfactory reasons why the article or process is not so manufactured or carried on, the Commissioner may make an order revoking the patent either -  &#34;(b)  at the expiration of such reasonable time as may be specified in the order, unless in the meantime it is shown to his satisfaction that the patented article or process is manufactured or carried on within the Commonwealth to an adequate extent : </para>

Honorable senators have discussed at length certain arbitrary and restrictive conditions which attach to certain patents of invention, mainly, I think, American inventions in regard to certain machinery. We have had an opportunity of learning how oppressively the rights of patentees can be exercised in connexion with the American boot manufacturing machinery to which I have referred. We found manufacturers bound hand and foot by the terms of the contracts which they were obliged to enter into in&#39; order to continue to carry on their business. They were compelled to observe certain conditions under their contracts, not only during the term of the patent, but for years beyond the date at which it would expire. The manufacturers in this. case had really to surrender their industrial freedom. Honorable senators will doubtless remember that, amongst the terms insisted on, the manufacturers had to agree that no other machine would be used in their factories. No operations were to take place in regard to goods other than the goods produced by those interested in the patent. I shall say nothing as to the royalties charged ; but in some instances the manufacturers were compelled to purchase goods from the owner of the machines, or from some one nominated by him, at prices in excess of their value. By these means, the astute American inventors have been able to largely control the markets, not only in Australia, but even in the United Kingdom. The object of certain provisions of this Bill is to put an end to this dangerous weapon, which has proved so disastrous, not only to our own industries, but to the industries of other communities. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think there can be any doubt about the matter, because our powers in this respect under the Constitution are very wide. The other clauses of the Bill are more or less of a formal character. There is one which settles the law as regards devolution of patents, and the last clause provides for improperly describing any office as a patent office, and prescribes a penalty for so doing. I have referred to the main features of the Bill, and I think, as I claimed for it in my opening remarks, it will be found to be a substantial advance towards bringing Commonwealth legislation into line with British legislation; also that it will result in a very substantial improvement on existing conditions, and provide a remedy for evils which have been notorious throughout the Commonwealth, as well as in other parts of the British Dominions. </para>

                    <para class="block">In order to take over the post-offices, telegraphs, and telephones, and naval and military defence, we adopted the system of proclamation mentioned in the section, but in regard to quarantine, for reasons which were fully stated, we adopted, as is proposed in this case, the plan of introducing legislation <inline font-style="italic">to take over the</inline> services referred to. This matter of the taking over by the Federal authority of the lighthouses of the Commonwealth has been the subject of much consideration, and of resolutions passed by Conferences of the. Premiers in 1906, 1907, and 1908. The request made to the Federal Government is that coastal lighthouses should be taken over. It has been urged, amongst other reasons, why this should be done, that although in several of the States certain lighthouses have been urgently needed, the State Governments have not cared! to proceed with their construction, pending the taking over of lighthouses by the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but we are dealing here with a somewhat more difficult subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will see that recognised Postal Departments were established in all the States. It can hardly be said that they have recognised lighthouses in the same way. The lighthouses have been managed by certain sub-departments, and there are little difficulties in connexion with them which we are trying to avoid by the legislation now proposed. The request has been made that we should take over the coastal lighthouses. That is to say, that for the present we should not interfere with harbor lights. We have some  8,000  or  9,000  miles of coast line, and it is proposed that we should take over about  120  lighthouses thereon. A tentative arrangement has been entered into with the States Governments as to the lighthouses to be taken over. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston</inline> was sent some time ago to the several States to discuss the matter with the States Governments. He came to a tentative arrangement with them as to the lighthouses which it is desirable that the Commonwealth should take over. The upkeep of these lighthouses involves an expenditure of something like  &#163;60,000  a year. It is proposed that the staffs employed in connexion with them shall lie taken over with the lighthouses. As I have said, the harbor lights, which are difficult to define, and which are established in many instances at some distance from the entrances to estuaries and rivers, are to be left, for the present, in the hands of the State Governments. Of course, it will be competent at any time to take over the control of those lights. </para>

I do not know whether the lightships to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> refers are regarded as coastal lights, but if they are, they will be brought under this Bill. I shall be able on reference to the list, of lighthouses to be taken over to say whether the lightships to which the honorable senator refers are included in the list. The Bill provides for entering into a definite agreement in regard to these. And in that agreement a reference to the particular lighthouses we shall take over will be inserted. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I have said that a tentative arrangement has been arrived at with the State Governments with respect to the lighthouses it is intended that the Commonwealth shall take over. Provision is made for entering into agreements having reference to those special lighthouses. Altogether we propose taking over120 lighthouses, the upkeep of which will cost approximately  &#163;60,000  annually. We propose also to take over the staffs associated with the working of those lighthouses. </para>

                            <para>- Directly with the States. A great number of requests have been made from time to time for the erection of additional lighthouses along our coast. In Queensland there are four lights urgently required, in Western Australia there are a similar number, in Tasmania there is one, in South Australia one, and in Victoria one. Altogether it is recognised that there are twelve urgently required lights, the construction of which should be proceeded with with the least possible delay. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say, but I shall be glad to get the information for my honorable friend. 1 know that a little time ago some of the States informed us that certain lighthouses were urgently required. In reply we said, in effect, &#34; Proceed with the construction of the lights which you say are of an urgent character, and we shall endeavour to take them over on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis instead of burdening you with their full cost.&#34; To adopt the latter course would be most unreasonable. </para>

                            <para>- We do not seek to make a profit on .their transfer. In this Bill we take power to levy light dues by regulation, and those dues are intended to cover the cost of the maintenance of lighthouses and interest, and the provision of a sinking fund. Of course, the States will be correspondingly relieved, and obviously it will be their duty to remit the amount of taxation in light dues. They will, however, retain the power to levy necessary dues so far as harbor lights are concerned, and also in regard to the lighting of channels, buildings, sheds, wharfs, &#38;c. But the design of this Bill is that we shall have power to levy by way of tonnage or light dues the least possible amount so as not to unduly burden shipping - in short, that we shall levy only such charges as are necessary to cover the expenses which I have already enumerated. I think that the measure will commend itself to honorable senators. It is proposed that these lighthouses shall be worked by their present staffs assisted by the Customs staff wherever that is possible. It is contemplated that the passing of the Bill will only involve the appointment of a superintending engineer and two or three clerks so far as the central administration is concerned. </para>

                    <para>It has been the practice of the Treasury Department ever since the time of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner to remit to the Old Country from time to time moneys connected with appropriations which have been made by Parliament Let us suppose, for example, that  &#163;50,000  had been duly appropriated for the purchase of guns. The practice of the Treasury has been either before or after the placing of the order to remit certain sums of money to London for the purpose of meeting that expenditure. That practice was established for the reason that as we had to return surplus balances to the States monthly, it was necessary- in order to avoid heavy expenditure coming suddenly upon the Commonwealth - that provision should be made in the manner to which I have referred. Consequently when an order was actually given in accordance with an appropriation or when it was contemplated, remittances were made from time to time to meet our obligations. At the end of the year it thus happened that considerable sums of money remained unexpended, although they had been duly remitted. The Auditor-General has taken exception to this practice of the Treasury Department; hence the necessity for this amending legislation. The existing practice is necessary -to enable us to . meet our obligations in the Old Country; and I am sure therefore that the Bill will commend itself to honorable senators. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I dc not like the idea of subjecting a man to imprisonment for six months for such an offence as might be committed under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> of proposed new section 65 (j). It is easy to imagine that an officious officer might make out that he had been subjected to obstruction. An officer might enter an office where one of the machines authorized under this Bill was in use, for the purpose of examining it. An employe might say, &#34;I am busy just now ; I have some invoices which I wish to stamp; you cannot look at the machine until I have finished.&#34; Thereupon the officer might say, &#34;I must look at the machine now.&#34; If the employe refused to permit the officer to do so, he might say that he had been wilfully obstructed in the execution of his duty, and the employe might be imprisoned for six months. I quite agree that the penalty for tampering with a machine ought to be severe. </para>

I do not wish to subject men to the risk of imprisonment at the caprice of some magistrate on the complaint of an officious officer for a trifling offence. I do not think that the punishment of imprisonment should apply in the case of obstruction. </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has given way to a request to add the penalty of imprisonment to the monetary penalty proposed by the Bill. . I can conceive of an offence being technically committed for which the offender certainly would not deserve the punishment of imprisonment, but which, on the other hand, might be deserving of a small fine. </para>

                    <para>.- The machines referred to would be used only to a limited extent. There might be a thousand or more of them in the whole Commonwealth. They would be used only, in very large offices, where it may be presumed that none but responsible persons would be in charge of them. If a responsible person in charge of such a machine is guilty of any offence set out in the clause, the penalty prescribed would not be too severe. On the other hand, if a merely technical offence is committed the magistrate would have power to inflict a fine of five shillings, of one shilling, or even of one penny. We are trying to safeguard the Commonwealth against being defrauded. If these machines were tampered with the Commonwealth could be defrauded of enormous sums, and the effect might be to drive the machines out of use altogether. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has suggested that the ordinary criminal law of a State would be sufficient to provide against a serious offence under the Bill. But offences might be committed that&#39; would  not be offences under a State law. Furthermore, under the criminal law of a State intention would Have to be proved, and that is usually extremely difficult. These machines are to be the property of, and under the supervision of, the Commonwealth ; and it is essential, if their use is to be safeguarded, that no one, except a Commonwealth officer, should be allowed under any pretence to interfere with them. Interference with such a machine is not, moreover, an offence under the law of any State. It is, therefore, necessary that such an act should be made an offence. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a fear that injustice or hardship might occur from prescribing the alternative punishment of imprisonment. But if the sentence inflicted by a magistrate were too severe, there would always be a power of appeal to the Executive, which, if the punishment of imprisonment had been wrongly inflicted, might remit the sentence. It is a common thing for the Executive to reverse the decisions of magistrates. </para>

The clause, with the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> will give them ample latitude.

                        <para>- No j but if an ordinary man steals a pound he is very rarely let off with a fine. It is only in extreme cases that a fine is imposed. Usually the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. It appears to me that the fact which is operating in the minds of honorable senators is that these machines will be used only by commercial firms of high standing. They seem to think that it would be a terrible thing to expose such firms to a term of imprisonment for six months, or a fine of ,&#163;50. </para>

                        <para>- A theft is a theft whether it is committed by the poorest man in the community or by the richest one, and&#39; it ought to be punished in exactly the same fashion. So far as we can, we ought to take steps to insure that every one shall be equal before the law. If the user of a-  machine deliberately attempts to cheat, and succeeds in cheating, the Commonwealth, then the infliction of a fine is not a proper punishment for such an offence. </para>

I have not heard a single, argument to induce me to vote against the amendment. On the motion for the second reading, I said that the Department was exposing itself to the possibility of loss of revenue by allowing the machines to be used. Holding that view, I think that the Department ought to be safeguarded in every possible fashion. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, the clause is not a bit too severe. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> objects to the punishment which is provided for a person who obstructs an officer. It may. happen that, at a particular moment, inspection is necessary to detect fraudulent tampering with the machine, but if an employe is encouraged to set up any excuse for delay, that may enable him to cover up an attempt to defraud. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> assumes, and I admit that sometimes there is justification for assuming, that an officer may be unduly officious or offensive in his manner, and there mav be sufficient provocation for a person to get angry with him, and say, &#34; Go to &#34; ; but we have to remember that this Bill provides a convenience. Persons will not be compelled to use the machine, but- if they do, they take the risk involved for their own convenience. In my opinion, the . contingencies which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> suggested are not likely to happen. We ought to surround&#39; the use of the machine with&#39; every possible safeguard. Its use may have possibilities of which we know nothing at present. For instance, an employe may remove some screws, or take the machine to pieces out of scientific curiosity. He may have tampered with the machine, and prevented it from registering properly. The inspector may have a suspicion that it has been tampered with, and the only way in which he can find out the truth is by entering the premises and seeing the machine at work. If an employe could claim that he had thousands of invoices to stamp, and therefore refused to allow the officer to see the machine until that work had been done, it might enable a fraud to be covered up. An inspector ought to (be empowered at any moment, no matter how many invoices may have to be stamped, to request the employe to leave the machine, and allow him to look at it. No one should have the right to say, for any reason, that the officer shall not make an inspection at a particular moment. Imprisonment will not be inflicted upon a man without sufficient reason. If there is a case of petty larceny, the offender can be proceeded against under the existing law, but there are some things which could be done to a machine of that character with a view to fraud, but which, until fraud was proven, would not be an offence against the ordinary, law. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to make it quite clear to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that my amendment has not been submitted solely as the result of an opinion expressed here. Since the Bill was first brought before the Senate, I have given to this clause as much thought as I could. Minor offences, such as those to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> referred, might be committed under this clause, and the penalty proposed would meet them. On the other hand, it is admitted that offences might be committed under the clause for which a penalty of six months&#39; imprisonment would not be too severe. The penalty provided for is so elastic as to range from a fine of one penny to six months&#39; imprisonment. I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> urging that the penalty might in many cases be too severe, and interjecting, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was speaking, that the offence might be dealt with under a State law, under which the penalty might be very much more severe. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is now objecting that the term of imprisonment provided for is not long enough. I do not know that I would strenuously oppose an amendment to make it twelve months instead of six months. If a man is convicted of having tampered with a machine, with the deliberate intention of committing fraud, six months&#39; imprisonment might be an insufficient punishment for his offence. It was thought desirable to place some limit on the action of magistrates, and that is why the amendment was proposed. A longer term of imprisonment would involve proceedings on indictment. There might be many offences committed under the clause in connexion with which it would be unnecessary to proceed by the more cumbrous method of indictment, and in such cases summary proceedings would have much to commend them. I have not heard a single argument against the amendment but that used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> which would be equally applicable to any provision in our law under which discretion is left to a magistrate. </para>

                    <para>-  I should like to say, sir, that I have not heard one word you have said since the division took place. I think that you might wait until honorable senators have resumed their seats before putting further questions to the Committee. You may, or may not, have put an important question, but I will venture to say that no member of the Committee has heard what you have said. About twenty-three honorable senators have had to change their places as the result of the division, and in the circumstances I would ask you, sir, if you have put any questions to the Committee to be good enough to put them again. </para>

But if the questions put had involved some matter in connexion with which there was some strong feeling in the Committee, it would have been quite impossible for any honorable senator to know that they were being put. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct the attention of the Committee to the definition of &#34;seaman.&#34; I brought under the notice of the Minister the fact that there might be people on the ship who would be beyond the jurisdiction of their State, and so would have no chance of obtaining compensation under a State law, and who: would also be unable to obtain compensation under this Bill. I take the case of men engaged in salvage work. They would be outside the jurisdiction of their own State. Not very long ago, the <inline font-style="italic">Elingamite</inline> foundered somewhere off the New Zealand coast. There was a quantity of gold on board, and a corps was subsequently engaged in Sydney to salvage the vessel. But under this definition, only those persons who are engaged in the actual working of a ship - only those who perform duties connected with its navigation - will come under the operation of the Bill. Divers and members of a salvage corps will not. </para>

If he should be injured in the course of his employment while within the jurisdiction of that State, he would be entitled to compensation. But, on the other hand, the members of a salvage corps who proceed to another State, not as members of the crew of the vessel on board of which they are, but as passengers, do not occupy a similar position. Should they be injured in the course of their employment, they would not be entitled to compensation. </para>

                        <para>- No. But in the case which I have cited, the members of a salvage corps would be passengers only for a particular purpose. They would be on their way to another State for the purpose of salvaging a vessel. They would not be seamen, although they might be employed by the same firm as the crew of the vessel which carried them to their destination. </para>

                        has raised a very interesting point. I presume he means that if ship A has been wrecked somewhere, and ship B has been sent to salvage her, the latter will be manned by ordinary seamen, and will also carry a certain number of persons who will afterwards be employed in salvaging operations.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline>
                        contends that should any of the latter be injured in the course of their employment, they will have no claim to compensation. My answer is that they will come under the clause which refers to persons connected with the working of a ship. If ten or twenty men are engaged in salvaging a ship, obviously they are there for the purpose of working that ship.- It seems to me that the clause covers the whole position which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline>

                    <para>. - I am rather inclined to the view entertained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> because I find that in the draftsmanship of this measure there has been a departure from the Imperial Act in more instances than one. Let us suppose that a ship meets with an accident, as the result of which a large number of lumpers are taken from the wharfs. If they are injured in the course of their employment, so long as they are within the jurisdiction of the State, they are entitled to compensation ; but if, whilst engaged in a most dangerous avocation beyond the territorial limit, they have the misfortune to be injured, they can claim no compensation. Under the Imperial Act, they would not be regarded as seamen, because all seamen must be on the ship&#39;s articles. These men would not be upon those articles. Their cases are not covered either by the Bill or by any State Act with which I am acquainted. I think that we ought to make provision for them in a definite way. I do not think the words &#34; or other person&#34; are sufficiently definite to cover the case I have mentioned. </para>

I know, however, that persons engaged on other than Government trawlers, from the master to &#34; Jimmy Ducks &#34; are required to sign articles.

The latter would be employed on special work, and a difficulty will be created if we apply principles which rightly attach to one class of work to another. </para>

                    <para>. - I have to remind the Committee that there are constitutional limitations to be considered in dealing with this Bill. At the second-reading stage I expressed my desire to make it as wide in its operation as we could. I repeat that desire now. . But it does seem necessary to remind honorable senators that the constitutional limitations exist; and, however desirous we may be of making the Bill apply to other workmen, we have to bear in mind that we can exercise no Federal jurisdiction over other workmen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> has indorsed a suggestion to strike out the words referring to the working of a ship. If we did that the effect would be to bring under the Bill all wharf labourers and others who might temporarily be engaged upon a vessel. But we have no jurisdiction over them. If we were to carry out that suggestion we should make this not a Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill, but a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Bill. We cannot do that, so far as I understand the Constitution, and so far as our legal advisers inform me. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to make lt clear that striking out the words to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> objects would not have the effect of making this Bill apply to all workmen engaged on a vessel, no matter how, when, and where. Let me indicate what are the constitutional limits which&#39; surround us. It will be seen, in dealing with the next clause, that this Bill is net drafted under the trade and commerce section of the Constitution, because if so, we should be limited to those seamen who pass from one State to another, and who are engaged in the Inter-State trade. What those responsible for drafting the Bill have done is to seek to proceed under the enlarged powers given by the navigation laws. To do that it is necessary that we should confine this Bill to those who are &#39;engaged in navigation, and who may truly be called seamen. However desirable it may be to bring in other classes, we have to ask ourselves the question whether they can be brought in as seamen and covered by the power implied in the navigation laws. The full effect of the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> suggests would be to make certain persons on a ship passengers&#39; from the. port to the scene of their occupation. But so far as I understand the difficulty, those men would not be &#34;under Federal jurisdiction. I am willing and anxious to make this Bill as wide as possible, but I ask my honorable friends opposite not to press an amendment of this definition at the present time. I give the promise to the Committee that I will look into this matter and see to what extent we can extend the operation of the Bill. I have not yet been able to see a way in which to do it. If honorable senators will accept the assurance of my anxiety to meet their wishes as far as it is possible to do so, leaving the clause as it stands for the present, I shall willingly consider any suggestion which may be  made to widen the scope of the Bill, and shall also consult those constitutional authorities, to whom I have referred. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to put the point to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that if an accident occurred to a seaman outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, he would not, under this Bill, be entitled to compensation. We have power under this Constitution to deal with seamen who are on a ship&#39;s articles. But we cannot extend the benefits of our legislation to any person who is not on the ship&#39;s articles, although he may be employed otherwise on the ship.

                <para class="block">The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is that an accident may occur while a ship is not engaged in navigation. The definition of the Imperial Act would cover every man on a ship, no matter in what capacity he was engaged. Ruegg uses the phrase &#34;subject to his being a workman.&#34; It is well known that the crew of a salving vessel is very small. &#39;Certain working men are engaged. on shore, and put on a salving vessel absolutely as lumpers or stevedores. As soon as the vessel, which is generally small, has managed to salve a cargo, it is sent off with a number of the lumpers to the nearest place at which to land the goods. Suppose that an accident happens to a man who is not a member of the crew of the vessel ; his case will not be covered by the Bill in its present form. The whole object of this legislation is to provide a remedy for men who may be injured at sea. I hope that the Minister will see that all men who are engaged on salving work are, covered. Of course, such men are not salvors in the strict sense of that word, but are men employed by the salvors, and work for daily, wages. I regret that this measure, unlike the English Act, does not include pilots in its definition clause. I do not know whether the Minister holds the view that they are covered by the words &#39; &#39; other person.&#34; In Australia we find different kinds of pilots. In Melbourne a pilot is compulsorily engaged by a ship and receives the fee. But in other ports of Australia the pilot is a public servant. A Torres Straits pilot is simply a licensed man who takes a ship for a long distance, and at an extremely small rate. He Virtually becomes a member of the ship&#39;s crew. He gives advice to the master of a ship going up the northern coast. Similar conditions are to be found right round the coast. Why such men should be excluded from this Bill I cannot understand. There is no constitutional reason for their exclusion. The English Act is very definite, because it includes all pilots. </para>

                    <para>- - Usually, after listening attentively to the two sides of an argument, one has very little difficulty in arriving at a conclusion ; but on this occasion I candidly admit that I have considerable difficulty in determining how to vote. I have had no experience of sailors except in crossing the Australian Bight a few times with them. I do not profess to be conversant with their calling. But even those who have had experience of sailors are not clear as to what their position under this clause would be. Senators Guthrie and Turley want the Bill to include men other than seamen who are engaged in salving operations. The Minister has somewhat impressed me by his statement that this is a Bill which provides for compensation to seamen alone. I know that some Compensation Acts relate to special callings, while other Compensation Acts have a general application. In Western Australia we have a Mines Regulation Act which provides for compensation to everybody engaged in coal-mining. We also have a Compensation Act of a general character which includes the gold-miner, the ploughman, the carter, the factory hand, in fact every description of shore labour. Salving, I take it, is an operation which is not carried on daily, but only occasionally, say once in twelve months or five years. The salvors, I suppose, would be employed by a contractor from the shore. Would a Compensation Act which applies to the employment of men on shore apply to these men who, though engaged on shore, might be working on a ship which was lying some distance out? </para>

                        <para>- I understand now that my honorable friends want 10 provide for the man who is between the devil and the deep sea. I desire to give a reasonable vote. I am afraid that if we interfere with the definition of seamen we shall cut out a good deal of the special provision which is intended to be made by the measure. If it is desired to deal with cases arising outside the territorial limit, I think it will be necessary either to insert a new clause or to make a specific addition to the definition clause. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether the Minister has given any consideration to the case of the men to whom I have referred on the articles of vessels engaged in the South Sea Islands trade, who work cargo on lighters and ashore, and who are sometimes engaged ashore in repairing ship&#39;s equipment.I suggest that to meet the case of these men we should amend the definition of &#34; seamen &#34;by adding the words &#34;or its cargo or equipment off or on such ship.&#34; That would enable the administrator of the Act to follow the seaman after he leaves his ship to work on a lighter or on shore in repairing the equipment of the vessel. Our trade with the South Sea Islands is now of no inconsiderable dimensions, and I think that the men engaged in it should be given protection under this measure. </para>

If a man employed as a seaman on a snip is told to get into a boat for the&#34; purpose of doing something around the ship he is regarded as being employed upon the vessel. If he is sent from the ship into port with a boat to bring out rations he is still regarded as employed on the vessel. The Bill covers the case of the men to whom Senator Lynch has referred, and in the circumstances the clause might be allowed to pass. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that this clause should be left out altogether. It is proposed that if the average weekly earnings of a seaman exceed &#163;$, he shall not be entitled to compensation. In moving the second reading of the Bill, the Minister said that such persons could make better provision for themselves outside of this measure. But that has nothing to do with it. We have included in the definition of &#34; seaman,&#34; &#34; master, officer, apprentice, or other person,&#34; and then in this clause we are asked to say that if the master of a vessel receives more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per week he shall be denied the benefits of this legislation. Every person engaged on board a ship should be entitled to compensation. The man next to the master might be receiving a few shillings less than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per week, and he would be entitled to compensation. So far as the right to compensation is concerned, it should not matter whether the seaman received <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5, &#163;6,</inline> or ^7 per week. I could understand the inclusion of such a provision in the English Act, as in Great Britain very few masters of vessels trading between ports of the United Kingdom get more than &#163;18 or ;&#163;ig a month. In Australia, wages are much higher, and many masters and engineers get more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per week. The argument that men receiving more than <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;5</inline> per week can make provision for accident outside this Bill might be applied to every person who will be entitled to compensation under it. The object of the Bill is to provide compensation for seamen, and the insurance a seaman effects outside of its provisions is a matter for himself. It should not be permitted to interfere with the compensation which he is entitled to claim under the Bill. Of course, I can understand paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> being included in the Imperial Act, because upon the motion for the second reading of this measure I pointed out that in the Old Country quite a large number of men who are engaged in the fishing industry earn a livelihood bv appropriating a proportion of the proceeds realized by their catch. Their earnings are rarely more than the equivalent of a wage- </para>

                    may be very much less than a wage. Out of a crew of four, three may be engaged in working a vessel. They usually have an apprentice who is bound to them for three or four years. He receives not merely what he is entitled to under his indentures, but also a proportion of the catch, which is sold in the open market. This is a system which has been prevalent in the Old &#39;Country for years. But no such system obtains in the Commonwealth. Of course, I know that there may be two or three individuals jointly interested in the ownership of a fishing craft. They may agree to divide the proceeds of their catch.

                        <para>- It seems to me that it would be employment. I think that this provision has been copied from the Imperial Act without any thought having been bestowed upon its application to local conditions. Take the case of a man who owns a vessel, and who hires it out to three or four others upon the understanding that they are to be paid with a proportion of their catch. </para>

                        <para>- Where in Australia have we anything of this kind to legislate for?. I repeat that this provision has been taken from the Imperial Act without regard to our local circumstances. Here, if men are employed by the owner of a vessel to engage in fishing they are usually paid a wage in addition to a bonus in the event of their catch proving unusually large. But there are very few who are entirely dependent on the catch. In my opinion it is unfair to exclude from the operation of this Bill any man who is engaged upon the sea. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. If I hire a man to drive a dray for me, he is entitled to the benefits of the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act. But if he hires the dray from me, and drives it himself, I am not liable. That is an exact parallel. In the one case the fishermen go out and pay the boat-owner in kind ; in the other case, the owner of the dray is paid in cash. There is no difference. These little cooperative ventures are quite common in New South Wales, and I should not be surprised to learn that they were also common in a place like Geelong. If there were a danger of a large corporation, owning a considerable number of boats, engaging in business here, and being paid for the boats by taking a share of the fishermen&#39;s catch, as is the case in England, I should be inclined to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> in what he desires to do. </para>

                        <para>- Well, Parliament is going to be continuous, and if such a practice should grow up, future Parliaments would be able to deal with it. At present the practice does not exist. On the other hand, the real difficulty, to which I have referred, does exist. Quite a number of men are in the habit of joining together in co-operative parties for fishing purposes, and paying the owners of their boats by means of part of the catch. If paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> were struck out, the owner of a boat, when&#39; approached by such men, would say : &#34; I cannot let you have my boat, because if I did, responsibility .would be thrown on me under the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act.&#34; I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> to remember that I am as keen a friend of this Bill as he is. I can assure him that if any such danger arose as he has pointed out, 1 should be very anxious to provide against it. But, on the other hand, I do not wish to put an end to a practice which I know to be common in New South Wales, bv putting on the shoulders of the owners of boats the obligations attaching to shipowners under this Bill. </para>

A considerable number of them work on the share system. Indeed, I am inclined to think that all the boats work on the share system. A fixed wage of a very small amount is paid to the remainder of the crew, the major part of the remuneration being a share of the pearls and the shell obtained during the season. I trust that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will see the inconsistency of inserting a clause that would give an advantage to the employers of black labour in the pearling industry that is not extended to any other employers in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- They are owned by British owners, who are supposed to be Australians, but they employ principally Japanese, Malays, and other men from the East. The industry is not very profitable to Australia, because the wages earned by the men are principally taken to the East. In the meantime, our waters are being depleted of a very valuable asset. The industry is of scarcely any value to Australia as at present conducted. Under these circumstances, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> make an exception in favour of employers of such labour would be a great mistake. Viewing the matter from that aspect, I should like the Vice-President of the Executive Council to postpone the clause if he is not inclined at once to accede to the suggestion to omit it. It would be as unfair to make an exception in the case of men working at sea as in the case of men working on shore. Take the case of coal miners, who. are paid according to value of the coal produced. It is a well-established principle in the coal trade. </para>

                        <para>- Wages are generally understood to mean the payment received for labour. The case of a miner being paid so much per ton when the coal which he brings forth is sold at a certain figure is on all fours with the case of men who hire a boat and give the owner a share in their catch. The Vice-President of the Executive Council should take time to consider the clause. No good can come of it as far as I can see. It will not assist the best class of employers. It can only assist those employers of black labour in Torres Straits and in Northern Australia, who are conducting an industry that. is of no value  to the rest of the Commonwealth. I should be very sorry to see the employers of black labour receive under this measure any advantage which we are not prepared to extend to the employers of white labour. In my opinion, it would be a great mistake to make any difference which would have the effect of bestowing an advantage upon the former. </para>

                    <para>. - It has been argued that with respect to the. Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act the conditions of workmen in Australia differ in some respects from the conditions of workmen in Great Britain. I question that view, because some of the Australian Acts were distinctly framed on the lines of the Imperial Act of 1897. In sub-section 1 of section 1 of that Act, it is provided that- </para>

                <para>If in any employment to which this Act applies personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to a workman, his employer shall, subject as hereinafter mentioned, be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the first schedule to this Act. </para>
                <para class="block">Under that provision, first, there had to be the relation of employer and employe in an employment, and when once that relationship was established, and an accident happened in the course of employment, the employer <inline font-style="italic">prima facie,</inline> and almost conclusively by reason of that fact, was liable to compensate the employe. Under that Act, which defines first employment, and still more closely the relation between employer and employe, a question arose with regard to the working of a mine, just as a case may arise here with regard to the working of a mine, or the cultivation of land on the share system. In England, a case arose in 1 905 as to whether or not an employer was liable to pay compensation. It is the case of <inline font-style="italic">Ellis</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Joseph Ellis and Company,</inline> and the headnote reads - </para>
                <para>A member of a partnership formed for the purpose of working a mine, by arrangement with his co-partners, worked in the mine as a working foreman, and received weekly wages out of the profits of the business. While working in the mine, he met with an accident which caused his death, and his widow thereupon claimed compensation under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act 1897, from the surviving partners :  - <inline font-style="italic">field,</inline> that the case contemplated by the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act 1897, was that of a workman employed by some other person or persons; that, the deceased having been himself one of the partners in the firm for which he was working, he could not be said to have been employed by them ; and therefore that the case was not within the Act, and the applicant was not entitled to compensation. </para>
                <para class="block">I may here remark that our recent Compensation Acts have been framed substantially on the Imperial Act of 1897, and embody the principle that <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> an employer is liable for any injury done to an employe during the course of his employment. By the most impartial and competent tribunal in the Empire - that is the Court of Appeal - a close distinction has been drawn by reason of the Compensation Act between an employe and a co-partner. </para>

                        <para>- The point is that once a co-partnership is established under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act of 1897, a co-partner cannot claim compensation.

                </continue>
                <para>When one looks at the provisions of the Act, they do not appear to be applicable to a case like the present. The supposition that the deceased man was &#34; employed &#34; within the meaning of that term as used in the Act, would appear to involve that he, as one of the partners, must be looked upon as occupying the position of being one of his own employers. It seems to me that, when one comes to analyze an arrangement of this kind, namely, one by which a partner himself works, and receives sums which are called wages, it really does not create the relation of employers and employed, but is, in <inline font-style="italic">truth,</inline> a mode of adjusting the amount that must be taken to have been contributed to the partnership assets by a partner who has made what is really a contribution in kind, and does not affect his relation to the other partners, which is that of co-adventurer and not employe. Such a partner cannot put himself in the position of not being a partner when he is one, or of being a workman employed, when that position would involve that he would be both employer and employ. The definition of a &#34;workman&#34; given in the Act might cover a person in such a position, apart from the difficulty that arises from the consideration that he would be his own employer ; but that is not conclusive, because the applicability of the Act appears to depend not merely on the question whether the injured man was a workman within the definition given by the Act, but also on the existence of the relation of employer and workman. </para>

                        <para>- I think that there is. Fishermen who might not have boats might be benefited very much if they could go to the owners of a boat, and say, &#34;Hire this boat to us. We frill take what we can get, and pay you so much out of the proceeds.&#34; In his judgment, Lord Collins points out that if the men are paid from, the proceeds of their joint enterprise they are their own employers, and therefore cannot be employes. In Great Britain, where a great number of seamen were engaged, they had before them a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, and apparently it was acceptable to the Legislature, and, possibly, to the seamen, that where (here was not the distinct relation of employer and employe&#39; existing, it would be against the principle of such legislation to include such persons. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. By way of insurance. If my honorable friends carry their point they will only deter the formation of co-operative companies.. Let it be distinctly understood that what they are practically asking is that a man may be an employer so far as his share of the profits is concerned, and that he may change his relationship whenever an accident happens, and call himself an employe. In such circumstances no owner will consent to allow small adventurers to use his land or his machinery or his boat. In view of the fact that the fishing industry has received an impetus from our legislation, it will be well for us to follow the example of the Imperial legislation, and see what will be the effect of it. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> pointed out, fishing ventures are managed in such a way that the fishermen are exposed by hirers of boats to unfair risks or dangers, then we can intervene. It is now admitted on the other side that no such&#34; conditions exist amongst owners and) fishermen. .What we practically say to a fisherman is, &#34; If you are an employe&#34; in a boat, so long as the relationship of employe and employer re mains you are sure to get certain compensation.&#34; But what my honorable friends are now asking for is that the owners of boats shall hire their boats to co-partners and be made liable for compensation under the conditions of this clause. It is admitted on the other side that there is nothing of this kind taking place in our industry, and consequently no injury could be done under this clause. If we find later, as the result of our experience, and the development of our fisheries, that sea: men are employed on unseaworthy boats, and given rotten tackle, and are thus exposed to the danger of accident,  Ave  can deal with the matter in the light of the experience gained. It is clear, from the decision of the Appeal Court, that it  was never  contemplated that a co-partner in a business should be regarded as a  workman. </para>

The conclusions of Lord Collins, quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, strengthen the argument of those  who  are opposed to this provision. For the life of me I cannot see  why Ave  should insert a clause in this Bill to say that it shall not apply in these cases: The Bill is intended to provide for compensation to seamen, and if a quarryman sought compensation under it, he  gould  not get it. It is not intended under this Bill to compensate the  owner  of a  vessel.  hut seamen employed by him. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that there is a difference between the position of the members of an ordinary business partnership and that of the owner of a vessel and seamen who lease it, and endeavour to earn a livelihood under a form of co-operation. A gross injustice would be inflicted upon the owner of a vessel if he were -to be held liable to compensate a seaman for an accident which might occur when the vessel was not under his control&#34; in any way. I understand that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has agreed to leave out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> and J think paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> might also be left out. The proof that any man is interested in the profits of any vessel must be established in a Court of law. That should in itself be a sufficient reason for leaving out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> If a man who has met with&#39; an accident believes that he has a case for compensation against some one connected with the vessel, whom he regards as his employer, it must be clear that, even if he is given no right to sue for compensation under this Bill, he will have the right under some other Act. In all such cases as are sought to be covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> there is some agreement between those engaged in fishing under a form of co-operation. A man leases his boat, and gets so much for the use of it. When the fish are caught, one-half of the catch goes to the owner, and the balance is divided in equal or varying proportions amongst the men engaged in the actual fishing operations, and, in nine cases out of ten, the owner&#34; of the boat is one of them. </para>

                    <para>- - I was very pleased to hear the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> because they were so entirely contradictory of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> The latter led us to believe that the cooperative fishing ventures in the Old Country, into which so many men willingly enter, are of a most one-sided character. He practically urged that the fishermen, instead of joining those undertakings upon a co-operative basis really enter them as men who are in receipt of wages. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with that question. The fact is that so far as the fishing industry is concerned, the share system is operative throughout the United Kingdom. I believe that there are more owners of fishing smacks who have been seamen, and who have saved the money with which to purchase their vessels whilst fulfilling co-operative agreements, than there are successful men in any other industry in the Old Country. If we can bring about a similar system here by inducing seamen to become co-partners in fishing ventures, it will be better for themselves and better for the industry generally. To suggest that the fishermen in the Old Country do not know what they are doing, is so much moonshine. The owners of these fishing vessels have no control over them after they leave port, and how, therefore, can it be argued that they should be held liable in case of accident? Let us suppose that three men approach a fourth individual and say to him: &#34; We want you to hire us three horses and carts. We have entered into a contract to remove certain goods within a certain time and at a specified price. Will you do it?&#34; The owner of the horses may acquiesce in the proposal. Now, if one of those men is injured whilst engaged upon the contract, how can it be urged that the owner should be liable to pay compensation? </para>

                        <para>- That entirely depends upon circumstances. Manifestly, it would be unfair to penalize them for accidents which occur upon their vessels whilst those vessels are beyond their control.

                    <para>.- I should be in entire accord with honorable senators opposite if I believed that the adoption of this proposal would benefit those who are engaged in the fishing industry. But I happen to know a good many of those persons, and I have talked over this subject with them. Many of them follow some other occupation during a portion of the year, and if they had no means of hiring a fishing craft upon the share system, they would be unemployed during the remainder of the year. I think that in all our legislative acts it behoves us to be careful that we do not create any unemployment which might be avoided. These fishermen do not enter into arrangements with the owners of fishing vessels with their eves shut. As a matter of fact they thoroughly realize what they are doing. At the present time, fish may be regarded as a luxury in Australia, and if effect be given to the suggestion which has been made, the result will not be a cheapening of the supply, but practically the abolition of the industry. Would any honorable senator pay&#163;250 for a fishing boat to let upon the share system if he knew that should an accident occur upon it when it was beyond his control, he would be bound to pay compensation up to&#163;300 ? I hope to see the fishing industry expand to such dimensions that fish, instead of being procurable only by the wealthy classes, will become the food of the working classes. But at present the latter cannot procure it on account of its prohibitive price. They can only obtain barracouta. </para>

                        <para>- There is something in what the honorable senator says, but the fact remains that fish is at present beyond the means of ordinary people. I should be sorry to see anything done that would have the effect of increasing the price. I have recently talked to many men engaged in the fishing industry. They seem perfectly satisfied with their condition, except that they cannot sell their fish at a good price. </para>

                        <para>- An attempt has been made in that direction, in Brisbane. I know a man who obtained his fish direct from the fishermen, bought a cart, and took fish round to private houses. But he was followed by Armenians, who control the fish trade in Brisbane. They sent a cart in front of him and another behind him; and if he sold fish at  3d.  per lb. they would sell for  2d.  or1d. Ultimately they ruined him. No man would go into the fishing industry under the conditions sought to be laid down. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> were the owner of a boat and knew that he ran the risk of having to pay&#163;300 in case of accident to a man who hired it from him, he would not be willing to let. He is too level-headed&#39; and sensible a man to embark in an industry under such conditions. It seems to me that what the Opposition propose would ruin the fishing industry. I dare say that a means would be found of getting over the difficulty, but I should like honorable members to explain how it would be overcome. Instead of trying to prevent men from entering into these partnership arrangements we should offer them inducements. I know of cases where the owner of a boat gets a third of the catch, and the members of the partnership who go out to sea share the remainder amongst them. I think that is a fair proportion. </para>

                        <para>- In many cases the owner of the boat, as a member of the partnership, takes his share in the fishing, and his life is as precious to him as is that of any other member of the company. Whatever argument is brought to bear upon a question from this side of the Chamber, we always have a laugh of decision from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> just as if he possessed a monopoly of human feeling. I take it that those who are in favour of the clause under discussion are just as much actuated by feelings of humanity as he is. From my inquiries into the fishing industry I feel satisfied that the fishermen themselves do not want such a provision as honorable senators opposite favour. They know that it would injure them in their employment and prospects. In Tasmania a large number of men are engaged for six weeks or three months in the year on the wharfs in connexion with the fruit trade. They work very long hours and get good wages. I have known them to work for thirty-six hours at a stretch. I do not think they should be allowed to work so long. When the fruit season is over, a number of them rent boats, and for six or seven months earn their living by fishing. If such a provision were made as honorable senators opposite support, and the owner of a boat were made liable to a claim of&#163;300 in case of accident or loss of life, these men would not be able to hire boats. An honorable senator near me interjects that they would be able to get any number, but I venture to say that if he were a boat-owner he would not be willing to take such a risk. </para>

I am satisfied that what honorable senators opposite propose would injure the fishing industry and increase the price of fish. Therefore I hope that the clause objected to will be retained. </para>

                    <para>. - I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has recently been living amongst men engaged in the fishing industry, and I have no doubt that, as he has told us, he has made inquiries amongst them. But he has not gone far enough. He knows very well that the Bill does apply to men engaged in small ketches carrying a crew of three, four, and five. Compensation has to be paid on account of injury in such cases. Are we going to handicap the owners who are carrying on business in such boats around the coast of Australia, whilst we leave the fishermen unprovided for? If three men agree to work together as partners in fishing and one of the three is injured, the other two would naturally make provision for him during his illness. </para>

Recently, when we were dealing with another matter, the &#34; poor owner&#34; did not receive much consideration from honorable senators opposite. He was made responsible for his ship and everything she carried. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> was interested in shipping he did not go to sea in his own vessels. He stayed at home in bed, when hurricanes were blowing  outside.

                            Sutherland does not go to sea in a P. and O. boat, nor do the shareholders. My contention is that if three or four men are engaged in a partnership they ought to be compelled under this measure to make provision for each other in the case ot an accident occurring.

I am prepared to exempt co-partners who have not an equal share in the gross profits. Take the case of a man who is remunerated by a share of the profits. Will the honorable senator agree to exempt such men ? The authority I have already quoted says - </para>

                        <para>- It is a consolidating Act, and one section applies the principle to seamen. If a man is remunerated by a share, that share may be nothing.  Every  one can understand that if the wages of fishermen were <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> a month an employer might say, &#34; I will give you a month  and 5 per cent. on the value of the fish that you catch,&#34; and so evade the provisions of the law. If three or four men are going to sea, each of them should be made to insure against accident to the others in fishing. The fundamental principle of this legislation is that each industry shall bear the cost of accidents &#39;occurring therein. Without some protective legislation a poor man who got hurt on a boat would have no nurse or doctor to attend to him. </para>

                    <para>. - I admit that of this question I do not know very much. I feel that I am amongst experts. I have listened attentively, to the speeches from each side, and come to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is in the right. Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley, Senator Guthrie,</inline> and. myself decided to go fishing in a boat belonging to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#34;Gray,</inline> and that one of the conditions was that he should accompany us and get a share of. the catch, and that he acceded to our request. If we did not succeed in getting a haul there would be nothing to divide, but if we got a good haul there would be a lot to divide. But in the meantime would it be fair or businesslike for any one of us to say to the honorable senator, &#34; If I strain my ankle  or  hurt my arm or get my head bruised 1 shall look to you for compensation.&#34; It would be  absurd  to make such a proposition ; but that is what the clause would allow, I think. I like to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> in these matters when I can. I know more about land matters, and, perhaps, the  Chairman  will bear with me while I give an illustration. In South Australia an employer once said to his man, who was married, &#34; Jim, I cannot afford to keen you another year on account of the red rust in the crop, but if you will agree to serve me as you are now doing and take a seventh of the crop at the end of the year, you can go on.&#34; The man agreed to the proposition. It turned out to be a good season, and he got  127  bags of wheat, there a law in the country which would interfere with an arrangement of that kind ? It was an &#34; honorable understanding.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- It would meet a case of that kind. I do not know much about the fishing industry, but I have given close attention to the discussion, and have come to the conclusion that what is proposed is the right thing to do. I have the fullest sympathy with seamen, but under this clause we are dealing with men who are not paid wages, but who are parties to an agreement under which they accept certain risks. They may make a big haul and a big profit, and they may get little or nothing. For the reasons I have stated, I intend in this instance to support the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - Senators Gray and Sayers have had a good deal to say on this clause. They have dealt with co-operation, and copartnership, and have tried to prove that it is necessary to retain this clause in order to preserve the beneficent forms of cooperation and co-partnership which exist in the fishing industry. I trust that the clause will not be modified in any way, but will be struck out altogether, as it is opposed to the principle on which this legislation is rightly based. There is no true cooperation and co-partnership in the fishing industry at the present time. The cooperation to which Senators Gray and Sayers have referred is like that between the owner of a cab, who lets it out for  10s.  a day, and the cab-driver who hires it at that price, because he is too poor to own a cab himself . The driver may make  12s.  per day by the use of the cab, and he has then  2s.  on which to keep himself and his family, and the owner has what he considers a reasonable return on his capital. The principle  on which this legislation is based is that the tax necessary to provide compensation for injury should rest on the industry in which the injured person is employed, and not upon the employer as an employer. For instance, under this Bill, the fishing boat, whether it is worth, &#163;10 or ^10,000, should be regarded as in the same position in relation to the law that a factory, whether it contains one room or fifty, is in relation to a workmen&#39;s compensation law. The necessary provision for insurance against accident should be regarded as part and parcel of the liabilities of the industry. It should be regarded as a direct tax upon the industry and not upon individuals. </para>

                        <para>- It is the boat as representing the capital employed in the industry that should bear the tax, and not the owner of the boat as an employer. I can give one or two illustrations to show the kind of co-operation and co-partnership which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> would have us believe is so beneficent in its effects. It represents merely the task and. sweating system in its worst possible form. We have in Melbourne a system of building under small contracts. A builder undertakes the  building of two or three houses. He supplies the timber and plant, and lets a tender for the building at a certain sum. He must in such a case assume the responsibility under the Employers&#39; Liability Act. He is in exactly the same position as the boat-owner should be under this Bill. The boat-owner provides the capital and plant to carry on the industry, and poor men who do not possess a boat themselves are driven by competition to offer their services to the boat-owner for a particular trip on the lowest possible terms. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> describes as co-operation and copartnership. Under a similar system of cooperation in the building trade in Melbourne men are entering into co-partnership with contractors to build houses for less than the labour cost. It is only another form of sweating. </para>

                        <para>- I regret to say that it is very general in Melbourne to-day. I can quote another and a very dangerous industry as affording an illustration of this kind of co-partnership. What do honorable senators think goes on in the quarrying &#39; industry? The owner of the land does not work the quarry as owner of the land ; he charges 7s. 6d. per man per week for the right to quarry stone from his land. The men engaged in the work use  rackarock,  dynamite, and other explosives. They may. be said to be co-partners with the owner of the quarry, who is the representative of the industry. But this is not co-operation; it is, really the task system. We are being asked to exempt some persons from liability, under this Bill, because they are owners of boats. </para>

                        <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> was speaking of the beneficent operation of co-partnership in the fishing industry in the Old Country, he should have mentioned the actual conditions, and should have stated what the fishermen actually receive. In most cases the boat -owner takes 50 per cent, of the haul. Why does he do that? It is because he has a certain amount of capital embarked in the trip, and he must be compensated in proportion to the amount of the capital he has invested. I repeat that the basis of this legislation is not to consider individuals, but to provide that the industry, as an industry, shall be responsible for the compensation of those who may meet with accidents in it. If that principle were followed in the application of this legislation to the fishing industry, the owners of boats for whom some honorable senators have pleaded, could overcome &#39;the difficulty by charging a slightly higher rate for the use of their boats. </para>

                    <para>. - One reason which has been very strongly urged in support of the clause is that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley&#39;s</inline> suggestion were adopted it would increase the cost of the supply of fish food in the Commonwealth. If those who hold that view will recall what is happening in the large centres of population, they will admit that what is responsible for the dearness of fish is the presence of the middleman, and the faulty system of distribution which obtains in the industry. A fish supply can be placed upon the wharfs to-day at a price which is almost startling, and if we compel companies or firms to insure themselves against accidents to their employes, the cost of that supply will be enhanced only in an infinitesimal degree. </para>

                        <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> made the most fuss about it. Regarding the merits of the proposal, I recognise that the Bill is a slavish copy of the English Act. If the clause be retained in its present form, the owners of fishing vessels around our coast will soon band themselves together, and contract themselves out of their liabilities under this Bill. Quite a number of employers, whenever they feel that legislation is about to compel them to discharge their obligations to their employes, combine for the purpose of contracting themselves out of that legislation. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot accept that excuse from the Vice-President of the Executive Council. He is too cute not to perceive that under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley&#39;s</inline> proposal it will be impossible for the owners of fishing vessels to contract themselves out of their liabilities. Let us take the case of the owner of a fishing vessel. He has two courses open to him, if he wishes to make his vessel profitable. He can either employ a master and crew&#39;, and send them out fishing, or he can hire the craft out to a party upon the understanding that they will share with him in the proceeds realized from their catch. I submit that in both cases a contract is made. </para>

Allen,</inline> in their work upon <inline font-style="italic">The Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act</inline> 1906,  concur in the belief that the real essence of distinction between a case such as is contemplated by the clause in this Bill - that is to say, between men who are sharers in the profits of an industry - and men who are engaged in ordinary day work, is the power of the employer to supervise their work. In order to clinch my argument, I may. perhaps, be permitted to cite a few English authorities. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Dutdop</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">McCready -</inline> a member of a gang employed upon piece-work and themselves employing helpers, received his pay through the leader of the gang, who divided the amount amongst its members.

                        <para>- That question would have to be decided by a legal tribunal. Personally, I think that the Court would hold that these profit sharers were co-partners, and not employes. The cases which have been cited to-day support that view. Where three or four men join together in a fishing venture, it is idle to contend that they are anything but partners. I come to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> which clearly has in view that class of man who may be rewarded both by wages and by a share in the profits. It is doubtless desirable to make an amendment, but unless we keep the clause in the Bill, it may be possible for a man paid partly in wages and partly by a share, to be held by some Court to be a partner in the concern. So long as he receives any remuneration in wages, he ought to be entitled to the compensation. For this purpose, 1 propose to introduce the word &#34; wholly &#34; after the word &#34;remunerated.&#34; The effect would be to include within the scope of the measure all those who in any shape or form receive a proportion of their remuneration in wages. On the other hand, it would exclude from the Bill those who can only be regarded as joint partners in a venture. I now formally move - </para>

                    <para>.- Earlier in the evening, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> became quite eloquent in his endeavour to show the marked improvement that has been made in the condition of fishermen in waters outside Australia. He tried to make us believe that private enterprise in the fishing industry has been superseded by the great and just principle of co-operation. In his anxiety to show what kind of cooperation existed, he told us that the boats, nets, and accessories in connexion with the fishing industry were so extensive and costly that the fishermen themselves could not purchase them, and consequently rented them from owners. </para>

                        <para>- It has been asserted that if we do not pass the clause as it stands, the proprietors of boats will not allow their vessels to be rented by fishermen, and that, therefore, the fishing industry will be ruined. That shows that the fishermen do not own the boats, and that there is no true principle of cooperation amongst them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> asserted distinctly that if we made the owner who hired a boat responsible, the handicap upon the fishing industry would be so heavy that no fish would be caught in Australian waters, and we should have a fish famine. Personally, I do not like the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> The result of it would be that fishermen in receipt of wages would not be paid by the week or month, but would be engaged on the share principle. Now, the share principle in respect of fishing in some parts of Australia leads to sweating of the worst kind. Another evil effect would be that we should leave a loophole for the proprietors of boats to escape their responsibility, whilst offering no protection to the men who follow a hazardous occupation. I am strongly of the belief that many fishermen to-day are unable to become the proprietors of the boats they use, but are compelled to work on the share system. In my view, the fishermen of Australia need a better kind of protection than is offered to them under the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - I confess that I do not know very much about the fishing industry, but I take it that the same principle applies to it as to other industries. Take the case of a man who has land which he cannot cultivate. Suppose that he says to other men, &#34; You have horses and implements, and can cultivate this land; we will share equally in the result.&#34; In such a case if an accident happens to one of the men working the implements, should the owner of the land pay compensation ? In the same way, if a man has a boat, and two other men agree to use it for fishing purposes, and share results, there is no reason for making the owner pay compensation if one of the men be injured. I consider that the amendment proposed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council would largely cover the cases referred to by some honorable senators. A man who is a partner in such a venture, taking his share of the reward, but being paid partly in wages, should be able to obtain compensation in proportion to the risk which he is taking. But where no wages are paid, the case of the agricultural industry, which I have cited, offers in exact, parallel to the case of men hiring boats for fishing. I shall support the amendment, which, I think, goes a long way to meet the objections which have been urged against the clause as it stands. </para>

He should consult the draftsman with a view to embody, what I think the Committee desires to secure. There is a general wish that we should not associate responsibility with people who are not really responsible. Take the case of a man who lets out a boat for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i</inline> a week to a number of fishermen.

                        <para>- The owner of a boat may find that it does not suit the people to whom he lets it to pay him in cash, and he. may agree  to  share some  portion  of their risk  by  accepting a share of their haul  in  payment. If such a man assumes  no  responsibility for the venture except the letting of the boat.  Ave  should not attempt to lay any responsibility upon him. The clause as drafted seems to  me  to attempt too much or too little. It would  relieve  every man employed upon a sailing vessel under the old system of payment for  whaling  from obtaining any compensation  whatever.  Some honorable senators know  what  that old method  of  payment on whaling vessels  was -  that the crew obtained  what was  called a &#34;lay &#34; - that  is to  say, they obtained an eightieth or ninetieth share  of  the general haul of oil. This clause would absolutely put such men out of Court. The question is  whether  the  word  &#34; wholly &#34; will sufficiently do  what we Avant to  da If there  is  a legitimate partnership  in  which the responsibility of each man  is  the same,  Ave  have  no  right to attempt  to  fasten upon one man the  whole  responsibility. But  if  there is not a legitimate partnership, and the relation of employer and employe&#34; exists,  it  is only right that  Ave  should put upon the employer the responsibility  which  belongs to him. It seems to  me  that the clause ought  to  be redrafted  to  give effect  to  that understanding. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the Vice-President  of  the Executive Council  was wise in  putting forward this amendment, because the clause, as  it  originally stood,  would  undoubtedly  hav(  led  to  serious abuse. It  would  practically  have  permitted the owners of fishing boats - not merely ordinary fishing boats, but also pearl fishing boats - to give  to  their employes a share of the profits,  and  thus evade the  law.  In the pearl fishery  it is  a common practice for the  owner  of a boat to gave his men wages, and a &#34; lay &#34;  in  the take  of  shell. In  my  opinion, the amendment is a distinct  improvement on  the clause. At the same time I consider that a good case can be made out for including those  who  adopt even the complete share system. It should be remembered that, as a rule, accidents occur through the  tackle  being  in  bad order,  or  not being sufficient  in  quantity and quality. The man who  is  responsible for that state of things, and  who  alone can rectify  it, is  the  owner of  the boat. To him a certain amount of responsibility should attach, because he is responsible for sending the boat  to  sea  Avith  improper tackle. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt, in the clays before Plimsoll, seamen possessed superior knowledge in these matters. But, nevertheless, seamen were found ready to take the risk, which- men always have to take, in the labour market. They were found ready to go to sea although they knew&#39; they were practically going to their grave. Under this clause as it stands, that risk will still be taken in the case of fishing boats. The class of boats which are likely to come under the Bill are not the small boats which are hired by a party on the share system, but boats like pearling luggers and vessels, which, probably, will take up deep-sea fishing, and be owned by wealthy men or companies ; and in order to evade the provisions of the law, if the clause, as amended, is adopted, the men will be taken on board entirely on the share system. A good deal has been attempted to be made out of the injustice which would accrue to the owner of a boat. But I remind honorable senators that that argument was used against the ordinary Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, in the expectation that the owner would take the responsibility of all risks. But actual practice has shown us that such is not the case. Workmen&#39;s Compensation Acts really bring about a system of workmen&#39;s insurance. The employer does not payt he money ; he simply deducts from the workmen&#39;s wages a certain amount, insures them with an insurance company, and adds that amount to the expenses of his business. There are very few employers, especially large employers, who personally take the risk under an Employers&#39; Liability Act, or a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act. That is exactly what would happen if this clause were omitted. If we put fishermen, no matter whether they are employed on the share or on the wages system, on exactly the same footing as all other seamen, what would happen? If a man had a. boat, which he wished to let out on the share system, one condition of the agreement would be that every man should be insured under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act. Who would take the responsibility? Nominally, the owner would, but actually it would be the insurance company. </para>

                        <para>- The case I am putting occurs whether a man is employed regularly or temporarily. As a matter of fact, a number of contractors employ men casually, and yet pay to an insurance company a regular sum per week, although sometimes they have not the number of employes for whom they pay. Take the point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and which, I admit, has to be looked at. He says that if we take out the clause, the Court might hold that if a man were employed on a profit-sharing basis, he was not an employe, but a partner. But, in my opinion, the English cases quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> furnish the best reply to that contention. </para>

I admit that the point raised by the Minister is an entirely legal point, but I certainly think that we ought to make some provision whereby employes, although nominally part owners, will still be able to take advantage of the law; otherwise, I am afraid that we shall be offering a premium to persons to get outside the law, so far as the fishing industry is concerned, by increasing the number of men employed on the share system, and decreasing the number of those employed on wages. </para>

                    <para>. -I, too, am astonished at the action of the Government in proposing an adjournment at this early hour, seeing that Ministers are storming up and down the country and accusing the Opposition of wickedly wasting the time of the people. If there is any wickedness in the air we have a very fine example of it here to-night. We are told on the one hand that there is urgent business to be put through, while on the other we are informed that it is intended to take a holiday for a week or a fortnight. The Government are guilty of most flagrant hypocrisy. Their press representatives are circulating throughout the Commonwealth the statement that the time of Parliament is being  deliberately wasted by the Opposition. We are told that the Opposition are blocking business and obstructing measures of the greatest importance to the people. Not a single measure of any consequence has been, brought before the Senate during the present session. There has been no business in any measure submitted to us. </para>

What has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> to say about the bargain entered into between those who voted for high duties and the last Deakin Government, that accompanying the Protectionist policy ample Protection would be afforded to the working people of Australia? Is nothing to be done in connexion with that question during the present session? As we are likely to have a. general election early next year, I do not expect that this session will be unduly prolonged. If I am right the Government must be exceedingly hopeful that they will be able to rush a great deal of business through in September and October. I can see no earthly reason for this early adjournment. Why should we not have finished the measure which was before us to-night, and so have prepared the way for other business to-morrow ? We should try to make some decent show of doing the work which the Government profess must be done. If the Government had submitted a measure in the House of Representatives, or here, dealing with the new Protection, we might have completed its consideration before now. We were promised an Inter-State Commission, that was to be invested with most comprehensive powers. </para>

                        <para>- I shall certainly do nothing of the kind. I wish to get on with the business of the country. There . are Tariff anomalies which must be dealt with. When I use the word &#34; must &#34; I forget that we have a hybrid Government in power that is neither fish, fowl, nor good red herring. It is a blend of Protectionists and Free Traders ; a political mule, so to speak, from which no good results are likely to spring. We are told in certain circles that the country welcomes the &#34;Fusion,&#34; but when the people begin to understand the kind of animal the fusion is, what a jibber it is in the traces, and that it will only kick, buck, and fight, they will get very tired of it. The Fusion Government dare not deal with the Tariff. One half of the team is pulling forward, whilst the other half are sitting back on the breeching. Although the Minister of Trade and Customs only a short time ago said in dulcet tones that the interests of the workmen must be looked after, a colleague of his in the Government criticised the new Protection as a madcap idea. As one who believes in the old and in the new Protection, I was willing by means of the Tariff to establish industries in Australia on the understanding that the Protection afforded to local manufacturers would be extended to the workmen employed in the various industries established. I want to know whether the Government are. going to do anything in this matter. If we adjourn at this earl\ hour, and on Friday adjourn our sittings altogether for a week or a fortnight we shall not be able to accomplish much business during this session. I have heard it hinted) that the Government have a rod in pickle for the Opposition, when we resume after the proposed adjournment. I understand that they will then be seized with a sudden spasm of energy, and that the &#34;gag&#34; will be freely applied to push Government measures through, without honorable senators being afforded reasonable opportunity for discussion. </para>

We were told that the Capital site question would be settled. Where is the Capital site, and when is the question to be settled? On this question again the Government speak with two voices. New South Wales is pulling one way and Victoria another, and the consequence is that there is not the slightest hope that the Capital site question will be settled during the present session. The present Prime Minister travelled throughout the eastern portion of the continent crying out about th( necessity for populating the empty North, He was panting to acquire the Northern Territory for the Commonwealth that he might people it with thousands and tens of thousands of defenders from Europe. What anxiety is shown about that question now? </para>

                        <para>- That is about all that can be said for it. There is no business in it. It is now proposed that we shall adjourn for nearly a fortnight. We shall be kicking our heels in Melbourne doing nothing for ten days, in order that representatives of the Government may meet a certain number of electors of the Commonwealth, and discuss with them the financial position &#39; as between the States and the Commonwealth. The Government which propose to do that sort of thing are deliberately insulting the Commonwealth Parliament. Why was this Parliament instituted? Was it not to deal with the affairs of the Federation ? Why, then, should ordinary electors of the various States - even if they do happen to be Premiers for the time being - be allowed te come between the Government and Parliament? Yet the Government propose this foolish waste of time for purpose? which cannot be fruitful, seeing that the ultimate settlement of all the questions  which will be dealt with by the Con-&#34; ference rests with the people of the Commonwealth and with this Parliament. I appeal to the Vice-President of the Executive Council to push business through a little faster, and not to hide himself behind the excuse that the Labour party is endeavouring to block business. We have had no serious business presented to us during the present session. There is not a single measure on the notice-paper which is not more or less of a stop-gap. </para>

For hours I sat in my seat patiently listening to tweedledum and tweedledee, hoping that every moment would bring a division. But instead of a division we have a motion for an adjournment. It has become very clear to me that the Government do not intend to do much this session. They intend to throw the blame for a barren session on the shoulders of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- Why, the honorable senator has made about a hundred speeches to-night. There is no more constant interjector. The pity is that his interjections are so rarely intelligible. Nobody can tell what he is driving at. If he would just bottle them up, and fire them off in the form of a speech, they would be very much more edifying to this Chamber. I do not wish to say any more, but I could not allow the opportunity to pass without protesting against this wicked waste of time on the part of the Government. </para>

When he moved to report progress on the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill only a few minutes ago, I was just about to speak, but I waived my right to do so. Little did I think that he intended to follow up his motion to report progress with another motion for the adjournment of the Senate. A few moments ago he interjected that he had submitted the latter proposal by arrangement with honorable members upon this side of the Chamber. </para>

In that measure we have a very hardy annual. It has confronted me ever since I became a member of the Senate. But that is no reason why it should not be tackled and disposed of.

                <para class="block">Telegraph Bill, the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill, and the Navigation Bill, there is no more important measure than the last. For years our seamen have been crying out for legislation affecting their position, and for years this Parliament has been attempting to deal with it. Last session the Minister of Trade and Customs was evidently very anxious to push forward! this measure. Why then do we find it the sixth order of the day, instead of the first? I think that the .remaining portion of this evening ought to have been devoted to consideration of clause 18 of the Navigation Bill, with a view to advancing it another stage, and to showing the people of the Commonwealth that we are sincere in our determination to give Australian seamen that modicum of justice which has been so long denied them. I do hope that before the session closes this Bill will have become a Statute. With the assistance of another place, it could be made the most advanced piece of legislation of its kind in the British Dominions. Further, our seamen are waiting for it. Under these circumstances, I fail to understand why we should be asked to adjourn at half-past 9 o&#39;clock. To my mind it is quite evident that there is another reason at the bottom of this motion for adjournment. I understand that  to-morrow  night in another place the Budget is to be delivered. It is common knowledge that the Prime Minister will afterwards ask the House of Representatives to adjourn for a week. The reason that he will advance in favour of the adoption of that course will be that a Conference of Premiers is about to be held in Melbourne. T believe that such Conferences ought to be held. It is right that the head&#39;s of the various States should occasionally confer together, with a view to determining upon certain lines of action. But whilst I hold that view I do not see any reason why this Parliament should adjourn merely to consult their convenience. It was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> the Premier of Western Australia, that the Leaders of the Opposition in the various State Parliaments should also be admitted! to the forthcoming Premiers&#39; Conference. The Leader of the Labour party of Western Australia was about to leave for Melbourne as a delegate to the Premiers&#39; Conference, when - lo, and behold ! - the Premiers of the Eastern States said : &#34;No; we will not have the Leaders of Oppositions as delegates.&#34; It is a remarkable fact that the Leaders of the Opposition in the six State  </para>
                <para>Parliaments, and in the National Parliament of Australia, are also Leaders of the Labour party. Another striking fact is that in Tasmania, Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia, there has been a fusion of all kinds of parties against the Labour party. On that ground, the Premiers of the Eastern States object to the State Oppositions being represented at the Conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> the Premier of Western Aus.tralia, was quite willing that the Leaders of the Oppositions should be present, but he had to bow to the majority. The Prime Minister will, doubtless, say to-morrow that the reason why he asks the Federal Parliament to adjourn for a week is that one or two members of his Ministry must be present at the Premiers&#39; Conference. But I see no reason why the business of this Parliament should not proceed. Surely the other four Ministers in another place, and one of the two Ministers in the Senate could take charge. The Labour party in both branches of the- Legislature has been accused of a wicked waste of time. When the Fisher Government was dispossessed of office, the Deakin Ministry asked for a three weeks&#39; adjournment. To-morrow  they will ask for another week. This means that one month of the present short session has been consumed in adjournments. Probably by the end of November, or the beginning of December, the session will end. Ministers will then go to the people, and proclaim from the house-tops that the  Labour party has been responsible for a waste of time. I wish to place the amount of time occupied in debate by the Labour party in the scale against these adjournments. Surely it would have been better for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to proceed with the next Order of . the Day, rather than ask for an adjournment at half-past 9. </para>

                    <para>. - Had I dreamt for a moment that the Vice-President of the Executive Council intended to move the adjournment, I should have taken up precisely the same attitude as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has indicated. The clause of the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill which we were discussing was evidently of a complicated character. It was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that the further consideration of the clause might be postponed, with the object of proceeding with the remainder of the Bill. The Vice-President of the Executive Council did not adopt that suggestion, because he had no intention of proceeding further with the measure tonight. There were several precedents for the course which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie suggested. Several times clauses of Bills have been postponed, until other clauses were dealt with. Why the same course was not adopted as to the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill is, to me, incomprehensible. The only inference I can dra\&#62; is that the action of the Prime Minister in accusing the Labour party of waste of time was simply an act of hypocrisy, because neither he nor his colleagues in the Government have any sincerity about business whatever. They constantly say that the cruel Labour Party have wickedly wasted the time of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The Government have so far done nothing, though I admit that they have proposed a good many things. They intend to do nothing, and as an evidence of that intention here we are face to face with this singular position. The Bill with which we have been dealing to-night is undoubtedly an important one. It was being dealt with as fairly as such a complicated question could be dealt with. We had arrived at a position when I think the Minister, like every other honorable senator, was satisfied that he was not on absolutely sure ground. When a suggestion was made that the consideration of the provision should be postponed with a view to proceeding with the consideration of other important clauses in the measure, surely the representative of the Government, if he had been desirous of proceeding with business, would have proceeded with the Bill in the ordinary course, and when we had finished, although there might have been more contentious matters to deal with, we could have arrived at some agreement regarding the matter about which we are all evidently in disagreement for the time being. I candidly confess that the clause under consideration is one about which I had no complaint to make other than this- </para>

                        <para>- The action of the Minister shows clearly that the Government are not sincere in their profession of a desire to get on with the business of the country. When they go out to tell the people of Australia fairy tales such as those they tell through the medium of Lord Mayors&#39; banquets they ought to be prepared to come back to the Senate with a policy and to go forward all the time. They ought not to trot down to Swanston-street, tell their little fairy tale, come back to the Senate and say at half-past nine o&#39;clock, &#34; We have done with this business for to-night, and in the course of a few more hours we shall be asking you to dispense with all other business for a week or a fortnight,&#34; in order, I suppose, that the Government may quietly bring down and dispose of their Budget, deal with the business before the Senate, and finally close the session with no work done. On this occasion I am prepared to enter my protest by voting against the motion for adjournment. </para>

I proposed an adjournment this evening after what has been admitted by honorable senators to have been a debate on a complicated question, and after suggestions had been made to me from all round the chamber, both openly and privately, to adjourn with a view to get the draftsman to see whether means could not be devised to meet the obvious wish of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I moved the adjournment of the Senate at the request of more senators on the Opposition side than on this side. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> was the only senator on this side who asked me to adjourn, but several honorable senators on the other side made the request. When I find the  di3-   cussion on the motion taking this turn it is an indication to me of how much sincerity, honesty, and truth I must expect to find in the requests which in future come from the other side. </para>

I was referring to the treatment which has been meted out to me. . After taking a step which I thought was consonant with the wishes of the honorable senators on the Opposition side, as conveyed !by their request to me, with .1 view to try to solve a problem which is puzzling us all, I have reasonable ground for protesting against their conduct to-night. </para>

                        <para>- That is perfectly true, but in all parliamentary proceedings carried on by decent men there is an understanding that when a number of men from one side seek lo solve a problem which is common to all, and put forward a request for an adjournment of the question, it is not always regarded as an offence for the Leader of the Chamber . to try to meet them. I decided to ask the Senate to adjourn when I was brought face to face with a problem which I was not prepared on the spur of the moment to solve, and which nobody else was prepared to solve, in the hope that I might have time, with the help of the law officers, to see if a scheme could not be devised which would meet the view pressed upon me from all round the chamber. Jn the future I shall be compelled to view with the utmost suspicion any requests or suggestions which come from the Opposition. </para>
