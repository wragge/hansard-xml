Is  it  a fact that in the event of tea being included in parcels without a permit having been obtained, the parcels are opened and the tea extracted ? Can the Minister also say whether the tea that is extracted in those circumstances is  Bent  back to the sender? </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of the actual procedure. I do notknow whether the authorities take statutory declarations concerning the contents of parcels, dr whether the assurance of the sender that such parcels do not contain tea is accepted. However, I think that all honorable senators will agree that, as the Australian Government pays more than £7,000,000 a year, or approximately 2s. 6d. per lb., by way of subsidy on tea, in the interests of the Australian people it should ensure that tea which is heavily subsidized in Australia is not exported for consumption outside the country. Exactly what precautions are taken .in order to see that- tea is not exported in food parcel?, I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- I am well aware of the excellent quality of the farming machinery that is produced by Chamberlain Industries Limited in Western Australia. That company is really doing a most magnificent job. It is rendering a .great service, not only to Western Australia, but to Australian industry generally. Only this morning I discussed with officers of my department the matter that has been raised by the honorable senator. It is causing us grave concern. The falling off of orders lodged with Chamberlain Industries Limited has not been due to an unbalance of importations from the United States of America. There has been a general falling off of orders, due to credit restrictions or to some other circumstances. The matter is being investigated. I assure the honorable senator that Australian industry -will not be swamped or prejudiced by an undue inflow of farming- machinery and other equipment. </para>

Secondly, Senator Morrow stated in this chamber that the objective of the Australian Labour party, of which he was a  member, was to bring about socialism, and as an illustration of the great benefit that would accrue therefrom he mentioned the conditions that now obtain in Russia. Can the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has repudiated that statement? </para>

If so, can he say whether the press report is well founded? If it is, can he say whether this Mrs. Street is the same person to whom Senator Morrow referred in the Senate on Wednesday last as a "most reputable person " who had written to him a letter, which he read in the Senate, that contained extremely eulogistic references to Communist Russia ? </para>

                    <para>- On Wednesday evening in this chamber I heard Senator Morrow use words to the effect of those quoted by the honorable senator in asking his question that the United Nations forces, including the Australian forces, were illegally fighting in Korea. Whether that statement has yet been broadcast to Moscow I do not know, but a similar statement made by Senator Morrow previously in this chamber was very quickly thereafter broadcast to and from Moscow. I think the world knows that the sentiments expressed by Senator Morrow in this chamber in no way reflect the overwhelming opinion of the Australian people, and I wish that the Australian Labour party would dissociate itself from those utterances.' </para>

                        <para>- Owing to the opposition to the recent referendum by the Australian Labour party, assisted by the Communist party, the Government is not in a position to deal with Communists as such. The precise circumstances in which the passport was issued to Mr. Elliott are not known to me, but I do know that had the recent referendum been carried and the Government's legislation, validated, the Government would have been in a very strong position to refuse the passport. That is just one instance. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry that the Opposition has become somewhat ruffled about this matter. I do not think that any record is kept of the political, religions, or other associations of applicants for passports. To endeavour to make such a classification might cause serious injustice. Some one who was proud to be a Communist might resent being left off the list of Communists, or, conversely, a non-Communist might be included in the list of Communists. We on this side of the chamber are very careful not to besmirch the reputations of individuals. </para>

There are many times when one is certain that a man has committed a certain act, but cannot prove it by sworn testimony. If Senator Armstrong really believes that there is no sabotage or subversion in this country, I am amazed. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, there appears to be abroad the mistaken idea that the scarcity of dollars lias eased considerably. I remind the honorable senator that Australia's dollar earnings are not available for the exclusive use of this country, any more than dollar earnings of- the United Kingdom are for the exclusive use of that country. Australia relies for its dollar credits upon the sterling area dollar pool, which, unfortunately, was reduced by approximately 600,000,000 dollars during the three months ended the 30th September. Honorable senators have probably read in the press that a strong British delegation will visit the United States of America with the object of securing a greater flow of dollars and, of course, dollar goods to the sterling area. The Australian Government has always placed earth-moving machinery, farming machinery and developmental equipment high on the priority list of dollar imports, and I think that the importation of those machines has now almost reached the limit of availability. The honorable senator may rest assured that the Government appreciates the paramount need to increase primary production and therefore views the requirements of the man on the land most sympathetically. </para>

                            <para>- The figures concerning our dollar resources are published regularly. The last time I saw them, I believe that the total was approximately 3,300,000,000 dollars, but I do not wish the honorable senator to accept that figure as authoritative. I shall ascertain the information and let him have it. Whether Australia obtained a fair share of the available dollars is purely a matter of opinion. Every country wants more than it is strictly entitled to receive, and the question of a fair share depends on the opinions of thoseconcerned. The Australian Government considers that it is not being unfairly dealt with in that respect. The honorable senator may be aware that a conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers will? shortly be held in London, at which such matters will be discussed. </para>

TheCommonwealth, particularly the Department of Trade and Customs, has no jurisdiction whatever in regard to the merchandising and offering for sale of commodities made in this country. Any imported material that in any way resembles wool, even though it may have no wool content, is subject to a terrifically high rate of duty. As I have mentioned" previously in this chamber, it must bear a substitute notice, and it cannot compete in Australia with genuine woollen material. The Commonwealth has been in negotiation with the various State governments and industries concerned for some time, with a view to achieving uniformity of textile  labelling  regulations. We desire that the Commonwealth regulations dealing with imported materials shall be identical with the State regulations in relation to commodities that are made within the respective States. </para>

Is it a fact that the only reason why certain persons advocate the return of Japanese divers to the pearling industry is that such persons will thus be given an opportunity to " dummy " far the Japanese? In view of the statements to which I have referred, will the Minister assure the Senate that there is no possibility of the Government permitting Japanese divers to operate again in the industry?

                        <para>- Does the Minister for Shipping and Transport appreciate the disastrous position of coastal shipping in Australia to-day? Is he aware that consignors of goods to other States are being compelled to pay enormous freight costs? Has he seen recent press reports to the effect that steel and other products have been transported by road from New South "Wales to Western Australia at a freight cost of between £50 and £60 a ton? Does the Government appreciate the effect which such costly freight charges will have on the inflationary tendency, and do the supporters of the Government propose to do anything else but lie down like dumb cattle and bellow about communism and production? </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to amend section 5 of the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act to permit of increases in the salaries and sitting fees of the  chairman  and members of the commission. When the government of the day established the Commonwealth Grants Commission in 1933, to inquire into and report upon all matters relating to requests from States for financial assistance under section 96 of the Constitution, the salaries of the  chairman  and members were fixed at £300 and £200 respectively. Provision was also made for a sitting fee of £5 5s. a day for the  chairman  and members. </para>
                    <para>Since 1933, the relations between Commonwealth and States have become increasingly complex, particularly in the realm of finance. The work of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has on this account grown considerably, both in scope and importance. War-time and post-war conditions have caused considerable disturbance to Australia's economy, and the work of the commission to-day is further complicated by factors arising from the huge expansion of social services, the developmental and defence works on which the nation is engaged and other elementswhich are present in our economy. Although the responsibilities of the commission have increased, there has been no corresponding increase in the salaries paid to the  chairman  and members of the commission. This bill provides for increases in the salaries of the  chairman  and the members to £600 and £400 respectively, and an increase in the sitting fee of the  chairman  to £6 6s. a day.I commend the bill to honorable senators as a timely recognition of the increased responsibilities of the commission. </para>

                        <para>.- -It is seldom that I feel the urge to commend the Government, but on this occasion I congratulate it upon having brought down the Cotton Bounty Bill, which I have much pleasure in supporting. In his second-reading speech on the bill, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> said that the purpose of the measure was to give effect to the Government's decision to assist the Australian cotton-growing industry by guaranteeing for five years, commencing from the 1st January, 1951, an average annual return of 9½d.  per lb. for seed cotton. Actually, this is not really a bounty bill, because it will not involve the Government in any financial outlay - for the time being, at any rate. At present, the overseas price of cotton is nearly double the amount of the guarantee </para>

                            <para>- That, of course, is another matter. In 1949, representatives of the cotton industry approached the Labour Government with a request that it should guarantee a- price of 9-jd. per lb. I thought that the claim might have been granted, but it was not. That was three years ago, and as honorable senators know, costs have increased considerably since then. Therefore, the proposed guarantee of  9½d.  per lb. now is not over-generous, although in normal times it would have been sufficient. In 1949, the Government did not grant the request of the industry because it believed that the overseas price would, for a number of years, continue to be higher than the guaranteed price sought. At any rate, that was the excuse offered. However, the Labour Government did relieve the industry of an overdraft of £170,000. </para>

                    <para>Many years ago cotton production in Australia was twenty times greater than it is to-day. The drift of rural labour to the cities, and general man-power problems, forced many cotton-growers  to let their cottonproducing land go back to pasture. Their returns were not sufficiently attractive to induce them to carry on. At the beginning of the war, in 1939 and early in 1940, the government of the day, having no true appreciation of the value of our rural industries, permitted the military authorities to recruit rural labour for enlistment in the fighting forces. Country men eagerly responded to the call for recruits and soon the country areas were denuded of man-power. "When I complained to the military authorities, I said, " These men are good farmers ". They said, " They will make good soldiers ". The set-back suffered by rural industries at that period has never been overcome. Many farmers and rural workers who joined the fighting services did not go back to the land after the war ended. Some of our most efficient rural labour was absorbed by secondary industries in the cities. The cotton and tobacco growing industries were perhaps hardest hit by that calamity. </para>
                    <para>The decision of the. Government to guarantee the price of cotton for five years will give a fillip to the industry. Cotton-growers will know that for at least five years they will receive a sufficient return for their labours to justify their continuance in the industry. I commend the Government for having introduced the bill. </para>
                    <para>The cotton, tobacco and dairying industries of Queensland are capable of great development. I realize that I should not be in order if I referred at any great length to the tobacco-growing industry, but as its future is so closely allied to that of the cotton-growing industry, perhaps I may be permitted to discuss it briefly. The tobacco-growing industry was established in Queensland nearly a quarter of a century ago, but, because of the shortsighted policy of successive Liberal and Country party governments, it was practically destroyed. For many years Australian tobacco manufacturers said that Australia could produce only tobacco of very inferior grade. Within the last few years their attitude has completely changed. Australian tobacco-growers will eventually supply all the needs of Australia if they are given sufficient encouragement and a reasonable measure of protection against imports. To-day, there is a great shortage of tobacco because imports from dollar countries have been severely restricted and Australian tobacco manufacturers now realize the true value of the Australian product. In the interests of national development the cotton and tobacco growing industries of Queensland should be fostered. They provide opportunities for decentralization and the building up of the population in scarcely settled districts. </para>
                    <para>From inquiries I have instituted, it seems likely that, if conditions are favorable, the number of cotton-growers will he increased from 7,000 to 14,000 this year. Some honorable senators opposite contend that the encouragement of cotton-growing is a State matter. I do not agree with them. The Commonwealth, in consultation with the States and their expert officers, should evolve a common policy for the development of that industry and of other primary industries. In these days great emphasis is placed on the need for defence preparations. Of what use are defence preparations if we have not a sufficiently large population adequately to defend this country? We can best increase our population by attracting immigrants of the best type to come to Australia. If the Commonwealth does not take the initiative in the development of our natural resources, how will we be able to cater for the needs of a greatly expanded population? The previous Government, in conjunction with the Government of Queensland, undertook to expend no less than £29,000,000 on one great developmental project alone. </para>
                    <para>Many honorable senators opposite owe their presence in this chamber to the fact that they made grandiose promises to the people that, if the parties to which they belong were elected, great developmental works would be undertaken immediately. Those promises have already been repudiated. The Government has claimed that the exigencies of defence will not permit it to undertake a great many of the developmental projects about which it spoke so glowingly not many monthsago. The potential resources of Queensland must be developed if we are to absorb 180,000 immigrants a year. Where are we going to place those people? </para>

                            <para>- I will not willingly offend. I believe that the Government is prompted by a desire to develop an industry which will be of considerable value to the nation. Am I to discuss only whether9½d. per lb. is sufficient for the cotton industry? I would like to see close co-ordination between, the Commonwealth and State governments in the development of this industry.. I believe that the Government is not running any great, financial risk with this bounty. In the United States of America and other countries where cotton could be produced cheaply at one time, a great change has taken place. Cost of production has risen. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider sympathetically the cotton industry's needs in relation to mechanization. Many efficient modern machines are available although their purchase involves dollar expenditure. Cotton picking is tedious even at9½. per lb. The Queensland Government is undertaking some responsibility in this matter and is willing to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in the general advancement of the industry. I suggest that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization  should apply itself intensively to research which will assist the cotton industry, particularly in pest control and plant selection. There has been too much talk about development and about defence and war. Talk alone will not solve the problem. There is no substitute for work. I resent the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> in this chamber recently that the Australian Labour party has been planning for scarcity and controls. Before the Labour party was in office primary production was in a desperate state. </para>

                        <para>. - The Opposition completely supports the proposed bounty. The tragedy is that there has been such great difficulty in Australia in starting industries that are fundamentally important to the nation. All governments have been responsible in some degree for the fact that the cotton industry is not flourishing. In 1934, production of cotton in Australia was 17,000 bales. It dropped as low as 500 bales in the year before last and last year production was only 800 bales. </para>

                            <para>- There are many other reasons also why the industry, which looked like taking its proper place in primary production, has almost gone out of existence. My only query is whether the Government is doing enough. In this bill it is making a handsome effort surpassing anything that has been done in the past but the task must be a gradual one. This bounty will take the price of raw cotton to approximately 30d. per lb. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Previously it was 15d. per lb. The substantial increase will give cottonfarmers encouragement to produce more. As I have said, the rehabilitation of our cotton-growing land is a gradual process. Throughout the world, the cotton industry was established in cheap-labour countries but, with changing world conditions that, too, has changed. One of the greatest difficulties that we encountered in establishing cotton-growing in this country originally was severe competition from overseas. Nevertheless, cotton is a fundamental necessity, particularly in wartime. Apparently, to ensure success, cotton -growing in this country will have to be carried out in irrigated land. Already good results are being obtained in the Burdekin valley. At last we seem to be setting off in the right direction. However, the development of irrigation areas is slow and expensive, and I completely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> that Commonwealth assistance will be necessary. We have seen tragedies in other industries. Not many years ago, tobacco-growing flourished in northern New South Wales, particularly around Tamworth and Inverell. Suddenly, the industry disappeared. Mareeba, in Queensland, had a similar experience although to-day, Mareeba is producing tobacco of high quality by -world standards. The market for good quality Australian-grown tobacco is almost unlimited, and we all hope that this industry has now been established firmly in the soil of the Atherton Tableland. The future of the tobacco industry in this country is limitless, provided the enterprise is competently managed. Importations of tobacco are involving us in huge dollar commitments. Cotton, too, is a dollar spender. If tobacco and cotton can be produced here in reasonable quantities, we shall at last be malting progress in our attack upon our dollar deficit. That brings me back to my argument that the Commonwealth must play its part in the development of those industries. Since the introduction of the uniform tax system, many developmental projects have been placed beyond the financial means of the States. Therefore, Commonwealth and State co-operation is essential. The solution of the problem of producing cotton economically in a high-wage economy such as ours is the mechanization of the industry. I am not suggesting that the cotton industry should have a counterpart of the Joint Coal Board, but I believe that the Commonwealth and State governments should get together to provide a pool of mechanized equipment so that cotton growers may have the benefit of the latest picking machines and other mechanical aids. Commonwealth assistance on these lines has already been given in other industries. I have mentioned the Joint Coal Board. There is also a Commonwealth cargo handling equipment pool, which has enabled stevedoring organizations to move cargo rapidly. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the honorable senator's mental grasp is failing. If the cotton-growers themselves are unable to establish their industry on an economic basis they must have assistance. They are not wealthy farmers, and consequently they are unable to purchase mechanized equipment themselves. I see no reason, therefore, why a machinery pool should not be established, at least for the time being. The pool could be provided with the very latest equipment which could be hired out to the cotton-growers. </para>

                    <para>I cannot overstress the importance <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> cotton-growing to this country. Just before World War II., the industry had reached the stage of producing 17,000 bales of cotton a year, and I believe that had sufficient encouragement been given, despite the problems of war, Australian-grown cotton would to-day be saving us millions of dollars. Because of dollar restrictions, Australia has been forced to import cotton piece goods from South America and Japan, and as we have no option but to buy cotton from those countries, they keep increasing their prices. Some time ago, in this chamber, I drew the attention of honorable senators to the effect of that policy. The latest basic wage increase of 14s. a week represents an extra .7d. per lb. on the price of cotton. The necessity to buy cotton on the dearest market overseas means an increase of 34d. per lb. It is important, therefore, that the Government should be taking this step to rehabilitate the cotton-growing industry in this country. I am glad to have the opportunity to say these few words in support of the bill. The virtual extinction of cotton-growing in this country at a time when the industry appeared to be nourishing, has always been a mystery to me. Once more, cotton-growers will be able to look forward to making a substantial contribution to the stability of the Australian economy. </para>

My second-reading speech on the measure was free of propaganda. No mention was made in that speech of the fact that the Chifley Government had refused the bounty that will be paid under this measure.  I  pointed out, too, that whilst the Labour Government had refused to pay a bounty, it had given the cotton industry the benefit of more than £68,000. I also mentioned that no immediate financial obligation was expected to be thrown upon the Government under the bounty scheme, but that the purpose of the plan was to give security to the industry over a number of  year3. </para>

                            <para>- Let us consider the facts. The story of rural development in Queensland since 1915 is a very sad one. During the whole of that period, with the exception of three years from 1929 to 1931, a Labour Government has been in office in that State. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> professes to love the land, he has not displayed much intelligence in connexion with this matter. He made the very ineloquent and false statement that this Government is greasing the fat pig. Does he call the Queensland sugar-growers "fat pigs " ? I remind him that it was this Government that gave them an extra ltd per lb. for their sugar. Why did not the previous Labour Government grant them an increased price? It is this Government that has given the cotton industry a leg along, and under its protection and encouragement the Queensland tobacco industry has developed. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> say that the tobacco-growers, the sugar-cane growers, and the cotton growers of Queensland are fat pigs ? If he does, I entirely disagree with him. </para>

                        was a member of the former Labour Government that refused to provide a bounty on the production of cotton seed. Yet, in his affable and charming way, he has now asserted that this Government is not doing enough for the cotton-growers. I refer the honorable senator to a report that was published recently on the pastoral industry in Queensland. I almost said that it refers to pastoral development in that State. However, it reveals a retrogression of vital Queensland primary industries, which, in the scheme of things, it is not within the province of the Commonwealth to encourage and protect. Those that were properly within the province of the Commonwealth to encourage and protect are now the strongest in Queensland. I commend the bill to honorable senators.

I suggest that it is possible for a person to make a misleading statement without intending to mislead. Primary producers, in common with every one else, are apt to make mistakes. Would the presiding judge or magistrate take into account the fact that no misrepresentation was intended and decline to impose a penalty or impose a. much lighter one? Can the Minister inform me whether the prescribed penalty is the maximum penalty? </para>

                        <para>.- The effect of this bill will be to increase the cost of listeners' licence - fees to those who can least afford to bear it. At the present time, if a person is fortunate enough to possess three or four radio sets, he is required to pay £1 for the first set and 10s. each for the others. This legislation provides that the fee will be £2, regardless of the number of sets concerned. The result is that the worker who can afford to own only one radio set will be obliged to pay an additional £1, although the entertainment that is provided at the present time is of a much lower standard than it was in 1939. Badio programmes have not improved. The people of this country have been denied the benefits of frequency modulation and television, although the requisite antennae have been' erected by the Government in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. Although there has been a great deal of talk about television, nothing has been done to make it a reality. If television and frequency modulation had been made available to the people, I could understand the reason for increasing the cost of wireless licences. I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>
