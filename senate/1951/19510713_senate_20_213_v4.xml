                        <para>The matter of tinplate is causing the Government a good deal of concern, due partly to the rising demand for it, and partly to the recent action of the American authorities in curtailing our quota for the remainder of this year. At the end of this week, members of the executive of the Tinplate Advisory Committee will meet in Canberra, and I propose to discuss the position with them in an endeavour to work out ways and means of rationalizing the available supplies during this period of shortage. The honorable senator may be sure that we shall do all that we can in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of the circumstances mentioned by the honorable senator, and, in any event, the Commonwealth has no power to legislate in such matters, which come exclusively within the province of State parliaments. I suggest, therefore, that the honorable senator bring the subject-matter of his question to the notice of State governments, and if the circumstances are as the honorable senator suggests, it is quite possible that corrective action will be taken by them. - </para>

Is he also aware that there is no branch of the Commonwealth Bank at Mukinbudin? Will the Minister consider establishing an official post office at this centre Which is required and warranted ? </para>

                        <para>Whilst it is true that the post office  at  Mukinbudin is of non-official  status,  my inquiries show that it is conducted efficiently in separate accommodation in a good type of building, and is staffed to provide full-time postal service throughout the normal office hours. There is no branch of the Commonwealth Bank in the township, but money order and Commonwealth Savings Bank facilities are available  at  the post office. The question of establishing an official post office has been examined but, unfortunately, the general volume of business transacted has remained more or less stationary during recent yean and is insufficient to justify such a step at this stage. The honorable senator may be assured, however, that the matter will be kept under notice and reviewed from time to time in the light of any change in the local conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago, the Minister for Shipping and Transport, replying to a question that I asked in the chamber, showed his keen personal interest in the problem of overcoming break-of-gauge delays in our railway system. Has he read a further report on the front page of to-day's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> about the remarkable breakofgauge device now' in use on the Franco.Spanish frontier? Has the Minister yet received a report on this device, which is claimed to reduce to one-thirtieth part the time of unloading and reloading goods at break-of -gauge points? As the report discloses that the New South Wales Agent-General is seeking authority to send Australian engineers from London to investigate the device on the spot, can * the Commonwealth expedite the matter particularly in view of the fact that it introduces into South Australia two lines of railway with gauges different from that of the main railway system of that State ? </para>

Will the Government examine our immigration scheme with a view to restating its aims and objectives, so that the people of Australia may be assured that the present flow of immigrants is not beyond our absorptive capacity, and that, in spite of the wholesale exodus of migrants from Europe, we are still setting immigrants of a suitable type? Does the Government consider that there should be a lessening of the flow of immigrants, or what might be called an immigration holiday, to ease the strain on Australia's economy ? </para>

                        <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Army. For some time the Government has been seeking by advertisements in the press to obtain 600 recruits for the Australian force in Korea. That appeal has failed. Last night another appeal for recruits to volunteer for service in Korea was broadcast by the Minister for the Army. If that appeal, also, fails to attract the number of recruits necessary, will the Government consider enlisting the aid of the Labour party, in order to ensure that relief shall be provided for the Australian troops in Korea, and that men who have been wounded on more than one occasion during the Korean campaign, shall not be required to return to the combat area? </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to learn from the honorable senator's question that there is a possibility of the Government receiving some aid from the Labour party in connexion with this important matter. This is the first occasion on which I have noticed a sense of national responsibility on the part of the Labour party in connexion with the important subject of defence preparation in Australia. Although I do not want to create any wrong impression, when, at long last, there is a possibility of a commonsense approach to this matter by the Labour party, I point out that it is quite wrong for the honorable senator to say that the programme of enlisting the required number of reinforcements for the Australian force in Korea is failing. That is not so. The reinforcements are being obtained at a reasonable rate, and I am quite sure that nobody would expect that the young men of this country would not respond. It is not the usual custom of Australian youths to stand back in the breeching and let others do the fighting for them. I am quite sure that the Korean force will receive the reinforcements required: </para>

It is not within the authority of the Commonwealth to alter this position. It can only be altered by the six States passing legislation to enable them to change the price of wheat or definitely to authorize the Commonwealth to do so. </para>

I make this suggestion because recent events show how danger spots rapidly move from one part of the world to another and because every effort should be made by Australia to assist in the settlement of differences between other units of the British Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I understand the honorable senator suggests that the Minister for External Affairs should extend his visit overseas to India and Pakistan with a view to assisting, if he can, in the settlement of the Kashmir dispute. I am unable to say whether such an extension is possible. It may. well be that the Minister's itinerary has already been decided upon and that during his absence, abroad he will be very fully occupied. I can assure the honorable senator that no government in the world would be happier than we ourselves to see the* dispute amicably settled. Members of the Government have played a considerable part in attempts to achieve that end. When the history of the dispute is written, the part played by Australia, through the services of Sir Owen Dixon, as well as the Prime Minister, will occupy an honorable page. </para>

                            <para>For the financial year 1940-47 the Australian National Airlines Commission was paid for mails carried on its regular services at 025d. per lb. per mile and, in addition, some mails were carried on special flights under charter arrangement. For subsequent years the arrangements have been for the payment of lump sum amounts determined bv the Government, in return for which the Airlines Commission was required to carry all mails tendered, including any emergency mails which are  normally sent by surface means. In addition, during 1947-48 and 1948-49, the commission was recouped its losses on developmental services in accordance with the principle embodied in section 25 of the Airlines Act. All these payments were made by the Department of Civil Aviation, as contracts with airline operators are normally made and administered by the Department of Civil Aviation. The total payments made to the Airlines Commission and the resultant average rate per lb. per mile (ascertained by dividing that total payment by the total quantity of mails carried, including emergency mails) for each of the relevant years were as follows: - </para>

I have just received a telephone message from Dr. Uther to the effect that the honorable senator is making a good recovery, is quite conscious and the outlook is good. He will probably be kept in hospital for about ten days, after which period he should be able to leave. On behalf of honorable senators I extend our thanks to Dr. Uther for his courtesy. </para>

                    <para>. - I oppose the motion on a number of grounds that I shall mention, not necessarily in their order of importance. I oppose it in the first place because of the ruthless gagging of debate that has taken place at the instance of the Government, not only in this chamber, but also in the House of Representatives, and I need some assurance from the Government that the measure now before the Senate will not be subjected to the same procedure. In the next place I oppose the motion because, although officially we have no knowledge of the contents of the measure, we are all aware- </para>

                        <para>- Our unofficial knowledge of the contents of the bill  extends far beyond the information supplied by the press, and we know that this measure is the most far reaching and important one that has been introduced to the Parliament in the last ten years. It seeks to vest in the Executive the most complete power over every phase of manufacture and production and, indeed, over every private activity in the community. I put it to the Government that it should demonstrate to the people that it is not in any undue haste to have the measure passed, and that it should allow all its implications to be properly considered and discussed. The Opposition does not want a repetition of what has taken place in this chamber in recent weeks. We all know that the Government has consistently obtained the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to rush measures through to the second reading stage and compel debate to take place on them immediately. The Opposition insists that it be given ample opportunity to study the contents of this measure and to consider its implications at leisure. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I put it to the Government that this is a measure that should not be rushed through this chamber. The Opposition has a duty to perform and it is not concerned whether the Senate has to sit next week or even during the following week. The Opposition wants the fullest opportunity to debate this measure, and it will record a most emphatic protest if that opportunity is not provided. This is the most important bill that has -come before the Senate in the last decade, and there should be no hasty consideration of it. If the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> is prepared to assure the Senate . that the debate will be adjourned after the motion for the second reading has been moved so that the bill may be fully examined over the weekend, the Opposition will not oppose this motion, but, in the absence of such an assurance, the motion will certainly be opposed. </para>

                    <para>think, most members of the public, are aware of the delaying tactics that were adopted by the Labour Opposition in this Senate for eighteen months. Those delays, and the forthcoming referendum, make it imperative that the Government should get on with the job without delay. Clearly the minds of honorable senators opposite are made up, and even if the Senate were to sit for another three weeks, they would not change their attitude. Their opposition to this motion is purely political propaganda. Our potential enemy will not wait for us to get our defences in order. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for the honorable senator to say that, but I have vivid recollections of Labour's efforts to prevent the then Government from preparing our defences prior to the last war, although since then, they have not stopped telling the people about how they won the war. The problems that lie ahead are serious, and the Government will not tolerate the delaying tactics of the Labour party which, as I have said, are mere political propaganda. </para>

                    <para>.- Had it not been for the amazing speech of the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> I should have remained silent on this motion. Does the Minister seriously suggest that events during the eighteen months between the  1949  elections and the elections this year have anything to do with this bill ? We have been waiting for eighteen months for some action on the part of the Government, but now we are confronted with a bill which does not even tell the people of this country what the Government intends to do. The measure will confer blanket powers upon the Commonwealth. Honorable senators opposite want the Parliament to go into recess so that they may place the administration of this measure in the hands of the bureaucrats who, in some extraordinary manner, are supposed now to have disappeared from public life. Instead of being " bureaucrats " they have become " our departmental advisers ". The Government will hand the bill over to them and then turn its back upon its own responsibility, hoping that its " departmental advisers " will have the courage of which it has shown a complete lack in the past eighteen months. </para>

I am afraid of placing in the hands of this Government the wide authority that it seeks under this bill, and therefore I oppose the motion. </para>

The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> completely lack sincerity.

                <para class="block">The object of this bill is to clothe the Commonwealth with a wide range of power which the Government needs to deal with the extraordinary problems and circumstances arising out of the difficult and unsettled days through which we are passing. The temporary and emergency nature of the powers sought by the bill is evidenced by the provision that they shall expire not later than the 31st December, 1953, or earlier if world and domestic conditions so permit. The suggestion has been made by members of the Labour Opposition in another place and will probably be repeated parrot-like in this chamber, that the real design behind this bill is a sinister and ruthless bid for power which properly should not be entrusted to a democratic government. That assertion is entirely without foundation. </para>

                    <para>- Order ! I have never before, in my experience in this chamber, known honorable senators to be so touchy. I have frequently heard members of the Opposition make statements to which supporters of the Government could have taken exception, but they have not done so. However, when the position has been reversed, the Opposition has taken most violent exception, and has claimed that the remarks are quite unjustified. I rule that the Minister's remarks were in order, and that there has been no reflection on the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I realize, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that I should ignore interjections. However, if a bird has webbed feet, associates with ducks, quacks like a duck, and swims like a duck; any one can be pardoned for thinking that it is a duck. Although it is evident that the Opposition does not want me to proceed with this measure, I intend to proceed. In this, as in many other matters, the Opposition is a victim of what might be called reciprocal projection. It pretends to see in the Government all those evils which are so characteristic of itself, such as class hatred, sectional interests, and contempt of the natural and fundamental rights of the Australian people. I must emphasize that there are in the Government parties men whose forebears, through many generations, have made, perhaps humble, but. really magnificent contributions to the development and growth of this country's material, spiritual and political institutions. Our roots are deep in this country. </para>

The Government is pledged to the service of Australia, and this measure has been introduced to provide  for the defence and protection of this country. It has been said in another place, and I have no doubt that honorable senators opposite also will assert, that the bill is designed to clothe the Government with a power that it does not need, and which will be used ruthlessly. I am merely anticipating objections that will be raised by the Opposition, and I am trying to show that the Government should be entrusted with the powers sought in this measure. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to order. I submit that the Minister, in making his second-reading speech, is anticipating comments on this measure that may be made by honorable senators on this side of the chamber. The Minister is suggesting also that to assist them in making such comments honorable senators will read speeches that have been made by members of the House of Representatives. I wish to hear the proposals of the Government under this legislation and I suggest that the Minister should deal with the relevant provisions of the bill now before the Senate. </para>

As honorable senators are aware, this bill was not initiated in this chamber. It left the House of Representatives at approximately three o'clock this morning and it would be unfair if, in anticipation of that bill being passed by the House of Representatives, I had prepared a second^ reading speech without regard to the comments and criticisms that have been made by both Government and Opposition members iri that place. Foa- that reason, the speech which I am now endeavouring to make is not one which was prepared a week ago.

                    <para>Meanwhile, my Government proposes to introduce a Defence Preparations Bill designed to facilitate national organization for defence by co-operative action where possible, but where necessary by positive and compulsory provisions. One of the incidents of national preparation for defence is that civil goods and services may run short because of increasing diversion of men and materials. When such shortages are, as they must be, accompanied by rapidly increasing defence expenditure the upward pressure of prices becomes more and and more acute. Insofar as the checks upon this process are to be found in administrative, financial and economic measures, they require legislative authority and therefore constitutional power. </para>

                <para class="block">Par from seeking to grasp power for power's sake, we are pursuing a line that was endorsed by the people in 1949 and re-endorsed by them in April, 1951. Naturally, we hope that the mere fact that we have power to impose controls will render their imposition unnecessary. We look to the robust decency of the Australian people to save us from the necessity for imposing them. We believe  chat when the people have been told that this measure has been placed upon the statute-book, they will realize the urgent necessity for the Government to push ahead with its defence preparations and will assist it to do so in every possible way. "We look forward with confidence to their co-operation knowing that they realize that the fate of this country affects every person who lives in it. I look forward with confidence to the wholehearted co-operation of employers and employees alike, not as separate sections of the community, but as Australians, whose sole interest is the welfare and security of their country. </para>
                <para>I have no desire to deal with this subject although full details of the proposals in this bill were given in the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister a week ago. They have been published in the press, and accordingly there is no need for me to repeat them. I propose merely to give a brief summary of what is envisaged. First of all, there is involved in defence preparation the increasing of the trained strength of the armed forces so that effective forces will be available for instant use in the event of war. There is also involved in it that training and other facilities shall be available at a time to produce further forces because one does not get ready for war, and for the impact of war, by merely having mobilization strength. We must have training facilities in advance, accommodation and a supply of equipment. En addition to providing trained forces and equipping them, we must strengthen the whole national economy to meet wartime and war preparation demands. It  i3  basically wrong to think that the problems associated with defence preparation, the development of basic industries and new resources, and the stabilization of currency are separate and distinct. Onn cannot be accomplished without th.i others. We cannot have sufficient munitions production unless we have coal, iron and steel, industrial plant, buildings and skilled man-power. Apart from other weighty causes, we cannot have enough of these things for munitions if less  essential or non-essential trades are competing for them and getting them on an inflationary market. We cannot defeat inflation while there is a large unsatisfied demand for labour and basic materials side by side with growing competition from less essential or non-essential industries. Inflation is really the product of over-competition by a superfluity of money for a scarcity of goods. There is more money than there are goods upon which to spend it. </para>

                        <para>- It is the fault of our enemies. We cannot develop coal and hydro-electric power, as we must, without doing what we can to concentrate men, plant and materials to that end. In short, if we try to do all the things that we are trying to do to-day, and have no effective organization for putting first things first, we shall _ not have defence preparations, development or stability, but we shall have delays, waste, rising costs, rising prices, inadequate real production and a disintegrating economy. A moment ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> asked whose fault is it that there is more money than there are goods upon which to spend it? The honorable senator is well aware that if we use labour for defence preparations, and spend money on the purchase of aero: planes and implements of war, there must be a shortage of consumer goods. We are asking for these powers so that we may be in a position to defend ourselves. Democracy must be armed not only to resist aggression by an outside foe but also to sustain itself against its own weaknesses. Sacrifices must be made by the people, and I am sure that they will be made willingly, gladly and gratefully when they realize that they have a common interest and face a common danger. The greater the powers vested in us the greater are our responsibilities. As a government we share the philosophy that we ourselves are not the authors but the servants of power; that all power comes from Almighty God and that we are answerable to God and to the people for the manner in which we use it. I trust that we shall be false to neither. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. -  I register my emphatic protest against the manner in which this bill has been introduced and at the insistence of the Government that we should debate it forthwith without first having had an opportunity to peruse the second-reading speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan),</inline> who introduced it. To insist upon the debate on an important and far-reaching measure being proceeded with before copies of the Minister's second-reading speech have been circulated and perused by honorable senators is a distinct departure from accepted practice. The Minister has said in his defence that he intended no discourtesy to the Opposition. Although I accept his assurance I remind him that I am at a great disadvantage in contributing to the debate without first having had an opportunity to read his second-reading speech. Perhaps he realizes that copies of his speech would be of little use to us because it contained no information about the controls that the Government proposes to impose under the provisions of this measure. Judging from the number of interjections that punctuated his speech from both sides of the chamber there is uneasiness in the ranks of Government supporters as well as Opposition senators about these proposals. </para>

                <para>The Minister indicated that this measure is somewhat analogous to the Supply and Development Bill which, as Minister for Supply and Development, 1 introduced into the Senate in 1948. Thai statement is completely false. That measure, unlike the bill now before us, set out precisely what was meant by the term " war <inline font-style="italic">materiel</inline> " and the powers which the Labour government of the day sought to exercise. If this Government had the ability and the courage to tell the Parliament exactly what it wants to do under the provisions of this bill, this debate would proceed on an entirely different basis. The Opposition is not prepared to vest in the Government unlimited powers of the kind sought in the measure. The Minister for Trade and Customs quoted from the policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in support of his contention that the reintroduction of controls was justified. Apparently, the Prime Minister was having two " bob " each way. In the policy speech, under the heading of "Desocialization", the Prime Minister mentioned a number of government activities, such as broadcasting, shipbuilding, &amp;c, and then he said - </para>

His record for giving practical effect to his thoughts has not been impressive throughout his political history. The fact is slowly but surely seeping into the minds of the great Australian public that the Leader of the Liberal party, who looks so impressive and speaks so fluently, is not a man of action.

                <para>It is fantastic that this Government, which parades as the champion of free enterprise, is now asking the Parliament to confer upon it the wide powers that are provided in this bill. I remind the Senate that the Government used its superior numbers to force this legislation through the House of Representatives in two days. That time was not sufficient to allow for the proper consideration of the measure. Whether or not the Government forces the bill through this chamber, the fact remains that the people will be the final arbiters on the matter. I warn the Government that, with this kind of legislation, it is preparing a deep political grave for itself. .Surely honorable senators opposite realize that controls are not a substitute for a constructive programme, but are, indeed, a retrograde move. </para>
                <para>Why does this Government not follow the example of the Chifley Labour Government ? The Labour party was in office during the greatest war in history, and was  obliged to control many aspects of our way of life. That task was accomplished in a remarkably effective manner. We used controls when they were needed for the effective prosecution of the war effort. The people were in complete agreement with that policy. The Prime Minister of the day, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> B. Chifley, in his vision, endeavoured to retain a number of those vital controls after the termination of World War II. and he succeeded in doing so, for two years, with the approbation of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. He retained the power to control prices until 1947 because he realized that once that power was relinquished by the Commonwealth, prices would rise rapidly. In that year,  the economy of Australia was unequalled by that of any other country. The increase of the cost of living in the Commonwealth up to 1947 was lower than in any other country. The Australian Â£1 bought more goods in relation to the number of hours of work than the Â£1 or its equivalent in any other part of the world. Surveys which were made at that time by the United Nations revealed that the Australians were the happiest people in the world. Those surveys are most interesting, and I recommend a study of them to honorable senators opposite. The Chifley Labour Government did not relinquish controls until it was confident that the necessity for them had disappeared. That was the fundamental policy of the Labour Government at that time. It desired to be certain that a control, once it had been abolished, would not need to be reintroduced. That is the reason why we moved slowly in respect of abolishing controls. </para>
                <para>The Menzies Government has been in office for approximately eighteen months, and now desires to take powers that are equalled only by the powers that were exercised by the Chifley Government in war-time. The reason which is given by the Government for its decision is that there is a threat of war. Why does not the Government exercise the powers that it already possesses to meet that threat? If that course were adopted, the public would feel that the Government was eager to do its job. The Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> gives the Senate many explanations why this ship or that ship has been held up in port. Almost invariably, when he rises in his place, he makes a speech on that subject, but, in doing so, he merely condemns the Government and himself. What action has the Government taken to solve the shipping problem? I remind the Senate that <inline font-style="italic">Aorangi</inline> was held up in Sydney for more than a month before the Government decided to provide naval ratings to take it to sea. Anyone who was' not completely blind could see that the Communist-controlled Seamen's Union of Australasia was playing a game of draughts with the Minister, and that he was not aware of that fact. <inline font-style="italic">Wanganella</inline> normally plies between Australia and New Zealand. The Communist-controlled Seamen's Union would not provide a crew for it. This  allegedly  strong Government, which is seeking power to impose new controls, said to that organization, " If you will not take the ship to New Zealand, will you please take it to Tasmania?" That is an example of the manner in which the Government handles problems of that kind. Control is not a substitute for a positive programme. </para>

That is the difference between the Labour party on the one hand and the Liberal party and the Australian Country party on the other hand. I recall that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden),</inline> when he was the Prime Minister in 1941, sought to solve the problem of coal production. The method that he used was to give the secretary of the coal miners' federation Â£300 under the lap. Cabinet Ministers and the coal miners' federation were not aware of what was happening. The right honorable gentleman said to that official, in effect, " Use this money to pay taxi fares and keep the boys at work in the mines". That was the method by which a nonLabour Prime Minister hoped to stimulate coal production. This Government does nothing but talk. It has no policy for solving the problems of the country. The Government is on trial not only before the Opposition but also before the </para>

The public wants action from the Government and the passing of a bill in the Parliament is not necessarily the kind of action that will satisfy them. I understood the Ministerfor Trade and Customs to say that these may be no action under this bill. If it is left to the Menzies Government to take action, I aim sure that nothing will happen. The Government wavesvarious political banners with the object of distracting the attention of the public from tragic shortages of primary and secondary products and hopes that the situation will be remedied by talk. </para>

Of course, the Government honoured its pre-election promise to abolish petrol rationing, and I award it full marks for having done so. To the Government, promises no longer have any significance. If there is one thing that the public likes to see in any government, it is political honesty, and the people of Australia are beginning to realize that there is no honesty left in this Government. Its path is strewn withbroken promises.

This Government hassoughtto keepthe Australian people inaconstant state of fear, in thehope that they willnotbeable to examine important issues clearly andcoldly, but will,nevertheless, keepthe Government in office. The party that attacked the bloated Public Service and the allpowerful bureaucrats is now expanding the Public Service at the expenseof private industry. The bureaucrats have vanished. They have become "government advisors " and " departmentalcommittees ". We object strongly to the manner in which this bill has been framed and to its hasty submission to the Senate. Why does the Government not tell us exactly whatcontrols it wants so that we may consider each proposal on its merits? The passage of thismeasure will confer blanket powers under which the Government will be able tocontrol almost every aspect of ourdomestic life. Admittedly total war cannotleaveany section of the communityuntouched,but I see no reason why the Government should be empowered atthis stage to control every phase of oureconomy. The parties that once professed to be against controls are now the control parties. The man in the streetmust have the greatest difficulty in following the machinations of this Government which is asking in this one measure for as many controls as were needed by the Curtin andChifley Administrations to assist in waging the greatest war effort in ourhistory.

He standsbeforemirrors of allkinds, until finally he is confronted "by one which reflectshisimage upside down. When one looks at such a mirror for long enough, one couldbegin tobelieve that people normally appear in this world upside down. Marxists and others trained in their dialecticreach the stage at which every normal consideration that affects human beings is upside down. That belief is manifest in the actions andbehaviour of some Opposition members  in  this chamber  and in  the House of Representatives. Yesterday, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> quoted the present Leader of the Opposition in  the House of Representatives(Dr. Evatt) as having said in 1942, that there was nothing inherently objection- able  in referringlegislative  power, but, inthelastfew days, the right honorable gentleman has been taking exactly the opposite pointofview. That is an exampleof mirror thinking.Such thinking  is  also evidenced  in  the approachof theOpposition to theproblemsofcom- munism andinflation.

                    <para>- As a private citizen and a member of the Senate, I have tried to inform my mind fairly and not by mirror thinking, of exactly what is happening, both inside and outside Australia. It is of no use to shut our eyes to the fact that grave external danger threatens this country. Mirror thinking is practised by the Communists in Russia. Since 1945 they have repeatedly stated publicly that a third world war between capitalism and communism is inevitable. Yet in the councils of the United Nations at Lake Success, they are continually preaching peace. Although they are forcing the free peoples of the world, in sheer desperation to rearm, they are branding them as warmongers. That is mirror thinking. By a similar  process  of thinking, members of the Opposition and their supporters have convinced themselves that there is no external danger to Australia. The existence of those external compulsions, over which we have no control, must be obvious to anybody who is willing to take the trouble to discover them. They menace the safety of Australia and the liberty of our people and the.t must be countered. </para>

                        <para>- I unreservedly withdraw the accusation against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash,</inline> but I point out that the curious inability of members of the Opposition to recognize external danger in 1939 still exists in 1951. It was stated during the debate on international affairs that the danger to Australia's economy as the result of external compulsions was imminent, and honorable senators opposite conceded the point by their silence. Tin and rubber are very difficult to get. I have been assured by authorities on whose opinions I can rely that over 100,000 troops and constabulary are trying to maintain order in Malaya, from which we import supplies of tin and rubber that are vital to our economy. The French are struggling against the Communists in Indo-China, where the whole rice economy of the northern end of that peninsula has been thrown out of gear. Other examples of such disturbances have occurred within the last month. The AngloIranian Oil Company has had its installations seized and, within the last 48 hours, we have suffered the final degradation of having the degenerate descendants of the Pharaohs board a British ship and maltreat its crew. Yugoslavia is under arms and forces are poised at its borders. All of these circumstances are portents of the external dangers that confront Australia. </para>

                <para>Fifth columns have given evidence of their existence in many countries, and in Australia we have learned that internal compulsions are actuated, in the main, by external forces. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> gave a very concise definition of inflation this morning. Inflation occurs if the purchasing power of the people is enormously increased at a time when there are insufficient goods and services to satisfy the demand that arises from that purchasing power. I do not blame the Labour Administration for the swollen purchasing power of the Australian community to-day. It was caused by our expenditure on war. The way to cure inflation is to produce goods and services in sufficient quantities to satisfy the needs of the people. The present Government parties were returned to power in 1949 on the cardinal policy that the only effective way to cure inflation was to increase production. In Great Britain, which has the full system of controls of which members of the Opposition were such ardent supporters when they were in power, inflation is more severe than it is here. Between the 10th December, 1949, and the 29th April, 1951, a majority of members of the Labour party in the Senate agreed tacitly to encourage the development of a situation within Australia that would foster inflationary processes merely in order that they might make political gains. Every attempt that the Government parties have made between 1949 and the present time to deal with the basic cause of inflation has been frustrated. In the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, that is, Russia, since 1945, the production of basic commodities that are needed for war has been doubled. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may study the statistics in the most recent copy 'of <inline font-style="italic">Fortune</inline> in the Parliamentary Library. As I have said, Russia has succeeded in doubling its output of war materials halfway through its second five-year plan. It has solved the problem of man-power shortages by pressing captured labour from overrun countries into service and by placing millions of women in industries. "While that has been happening, the output of every industry in Australia in which members of Communist-controlled trade unions are employed has decreased. That is why we have not been able to increase our production of goods and services. </para>

                        <para>- The unsatisfactory output of rural industries derives from under-production in our secondary industries. Because of the effect of the externa] and internal compulsions that I have mentioned, the Government has been forced to make do with the present meagre rate of production both in preparing for defence and in trying to stabilize the economy. Since the recent general election, the Government has had full control of this Parliament and it is able at last to take steps to straighten out the economy. No honorable senator on this side of the chamber wants controls merely for the sake of controls. The stage that has been reached in the evolution of this nation i3 similar in many respects to the situation that existed in the United States of America prior to the civil war. I do not have to remind honorable senators that that war was the outcome of a secession movement by the southern confederacy. In trying to maintain the economy of the union Congress was faced with a position similar to the position in Australia to-day. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that I had made it clear that the conditions were similar in that there existed disruptive powers inside the United States of America which culminated in that most devastating war. That could have application in some detail to what is happening in Australia to-day. It is an illustration of the force that confronts this Government, which is trying to work out its destiny under a limited Constitution. In July, 1861, that great President. Abraham Lincoln, wrote the following words in a message to Congress : -  . . and this issue embraces here more than the fate of the U.S. It poses to the whole family of man the question: Whether a constitutional republic or a democracy (a government of the people by the same people) can or cannot maintain its . . . integrity against its own domestic foes. It presents the question: Whether discontented individuals, too few in number to control administration (according to organic law, in any case) can always, upon pretences made ... or arbitrarily without any pretence break up this government and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth. It forces us to ask : " Is there in all republics this inherent and fatal weakness ? " Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties of its people or too weak to maintain its own existence? </para>

                <para class="block">That is the situation that we have reached in Australia to-day. We are working under a limited Constitution; we have only limited powers.

                <para>During a debate on another measure in this chamber, Iheard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> make derisive references to liberalism. He asserted that  we  were abdicating the principles of liberalism, and that we were denying the rule  of  law and natural justice. I do not know what that means: But I do know that men must be prepared to surrendera few liberties in order to protect the remainder. A liberal is not a man who is measured and gauged in terms of his. possessionsor wealth.. He is a man  who  possesses a comprehensive mind, and I believe that the concept exists in some of the members of the Opposition. Bu t I deny completely that the members of the Opposition have the sole custody of liberty  and  justice and the welfare of human beings, both those that work with their hands  in  factories and those who labour at their desks in a. managerial capacity. We have responsibilities without connexion. When the brutal system of Marx is. carried to its logical conclusion, man becomes an automaton, a slave. I refuse to accept the pernicious claim of the Opposition that this Government, by this measure, will deny liberty. Indeed, this is the  only  way that the liberty of the Australian people can be preserved. In another place the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> made that quite clear and definite when he introduced this bill. There is no control suggested in the bill before the chamber which willinterfere with a man's personal liberty to work as he wants to work. There only exists an element of control to deal with the Communists whounfortunately direct the activities of some of the trade unions of this country, and exert influence in the field of trade and commerce. These hucksters place their own personal ambitions before the interests of their country. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable senators have not had sufficient time to study fully the provisions of this bill. Although two speeches have been delivered from the Government side we have not heard an explanation of the provisions of this measure. The Minister for Trade andCustoms <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> has not indicated what the Government intends to do if it is given the power sought. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> stated that the bill had been introduced because of grave international danger, and he specifically stated that Russia was responsible for the present tension. Let us consider the views of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> on the matter. When the right honorable gentleman introduced the bill in the House of Representatives, he said - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>For reasons I have previouslystatedtothe House, we believe that there is grave danger of war. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">He then told honorable, members from which quarters he thought the danger emanated, and, in particular, mentioned Korea, Malaya and Indochina. I point out that Korea was engaged in warfare for many years prior to World War II., and the Koreans have been at war since the cessation of hostilities in that world conflict. Therefore, whatever danger is associated with Korea has existed for many years. Australia was committed by the former Labour Government to support any action that may become necessary by the United </para>
                <para class="block">Nations to repel aggression. That Government committed this country to support the cause of peace by joining the United Nations organization. </para>
                <para>There have always been disturbances  in  Malaya. They have gone on ever since the last war ceased. The Government has been in power for eighteen months and has only suddenly realized that there is danger in Malaya. If there is danger in Malaya now it has been there ever since the last war and ever since this Government took office. Therefore the Government did not have to wait eighteen months to take action. The same state of affairs has applied in Indo-China. I claim to be 100 per cent. British and Australian but in  Australia  we claim the right to govern ourselves and to control our own internal affaii-3. There would be trouble if an outside power interfered with what we were attempting to do in this Parliament. "Yet Great Britain and other countries have objected to the Persian Government taking certain action in the interests of Persia. What would have been the attitude of honorable senators if another country had told the Australian Government that it must not attempt to nationalize the banks, a large number  of  whose shares are held by  people  who live abroad? Czechoslovakia had its troubles before the last war and it has had them ever since the cessation of those hostilities. It had them eighteen months ago when the present Australian Government took office. Apparently the Government wishes to close the stable door after the horse has gone. </para>
                <para>The countries  of  the Middle East have always been in a state of turmoil. The Prime Minister has said that that is where the main danger lies. He said that that is the reason why this bill must be passed urgently. He implied that there was not a moment to lose. If the position is so grave why has the Government waited for eighteen months to take this action ? And if such a serious state of affairs exists why has the Government not given honorable senators some details of what it intends to do instead of asking for an open cheque and then closing Parliament? As the elected representatives of the people honorable senators have been sent to this Parliament to discuss the problems of the nation and the bills that come before the House. We have not been sent here to agree to give any Government an open cheque so that it may rule by regulation. In 1939 the Government spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in broadcasting skits over the radio stations about the socialist Government and bureaucrats of Canberra who governed by regulations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was one of the champions who advocated tipping the bureaucrats out. He said that they were not necessary. All honorable senators opposite have said that controls were not necessary. The burden of their speeches until now has been that the reglation of industry or production was not necessary and prices control was not necessary because the States could handle such problems. They have said that the Labour Government was just ham-stringing the people, preventing an increase of production and imperilling our economy. </para>
                <para>The Prime Minister has said that the Australian Â£1 was only worth 10s. in purchasing power when he came to office. Before his Government was elected he said that if the bureaucrats were removed from Canberra and prices control were abolished, value would be restored to the Â£1. He gave a pledge to the people that if his Government was returned it would definitely put value back into the Â£1. Since then the value of the currency has depreciated by 50 per cent. What the Prime Minister called the Laboursocialist Â£1 when he came to office might now be described as the Menzies-fascist Â£1. The Prime Minister who spoke against controls which had been used to stabilize the economy of the country has now asked honorable senators to pass this bill quickly and give him an open cheque to impose new controls on industry and other spheres of life in Australia. The Prime Minister said that this measure was required in order to enable the Government to prepare for defence. He said that it was necessary in order to ensure that effective forces would be available for instant use in the event of war and to ensure that training and other facilities would be available at that time to produce further forces. I agree that such action as that is necessary, but is this bill needed for the accomplishment of that purpose? A bill to provide for compulsory military training has already been passed. Can the armed forces be increased under this bill? If they can,  such  action could only be taken by regulation. But the bill states specifically that it does not authorize such action so the measure can have nothing to do with increasing the strength of the armed forces. </para>
                <para>Going still further the Prime Minister said that the bill was necessary in order to facilitate the equipment of the forces. The power which this bill will give to the Government is required not only for the production and mobilization of equipment for war but also to assist development of a non-military nature. There is nothing in this bill to show how the Government will accomplish those objectives unless by regulation and control. That is the very kind of policy that honorable senators opposite have opposed. They have assured us that the 'Government which they support would not control prices or take any action of that nature. The action which the Government desires to take under this bill has already been provided for in acts of Parliament. In commending the bill the Prime Minister quoted from similar legislation which had been passed in the United Kingdom. He quoted what the United Kingdom Government had done and said that his Government would act on similar lines. Honorable senators must assume, therefore, that he intends to make regulations to enable the Government to do what the Government of the United Kingdom has done. The Prime Minister also stated that the United Kingdom Government in order to carry through its defence programme, will use its existing controls to reduce the consumption of such commodities as clothing, fabrics, radios, domestic utensils, pottery, glassware and other household goods. That Government will also reduce investments in building, cut down export production to some extent, and make an absolute reduction in the average level of civilian consumption. Measures are being adopted to ensure that manufacturers give priority to defence orders and that sufficient raw materials are diverted to defence production. No honorable senator will disagree with the intention of the British Government to give priority to defence orders and to make available sufficient raw materials for defence production, but it is interesting to note that the commodities to which I have just referred are nearly all household items. I suggest that reduction of production of such articles will penalize young men and women who are starting out in married life. All those commodities are essential to the settingup of a home. </para>
                <para>I suggest that in discussing this' measure I cannot do better than to refer to statements that have been made by the Prime Minister. The right honorable gentleman has said that Australia is pledged to support collective action to resist aggression. Surely we do not need legislation of this kind to enable us to do that? The Chifley Government committed Australia to resist aggression when it subscribed to the Charter of the United Nations. I suggest that this legislation is intended to cover certain action that will be taken later. </para>
                <para>The Prime Minister has stated that, there is a state of international emergency requiring special preparedness, and I do not say that such an emergency does not exist. No one would contend that we should not be prepared to meet an emergency, but I consider that the state of emergency to which the right honorable gentleman referred has been in existence for some time. He also said that the first move in defence preparations is to raise, equip and provision our armed forces, and to contribute towards the equipping and provisioning of the forces of countries that will be our allies in the event of war. </para>
                <para>The Prime Minister has stated that an essential part of defence preparedness is the obligation to help our allies to maintain their civil population by means of the provision of food shipments and that the sending of such shipments to a particular area may affect the whole course of the war. "What has this Government done to increase our food production? I remind honorable senators that a question of mine has been on the notice-paper for more than a week and has not yet been answered. That question asked whether it would not be possible to hold a conference of the State and Commonwealth </para>
                <para class="block">Ministers for Agriculture in order to try to devise a plan whereby food production could be increased. If this emergency is as grave as the Government would have us believe it is, and if in the next six or twelve months 700,000 or 800,000 Australians enter the armed forces and essential industries, what will be the position of our food production then? At the moment we have not sufficient essential foods with which to supply our civilian needs. In fact, the position is becoming so grave that vegetables, which are a staple food, are now almost a luxury. If the price of vegetables continues to rise, only those persons on very high incomes will be able, to afford them. The position concerning potatoes illustrates what I have said. The grower of potatoes at present receives approximately Â£20 a ton, whereas the consumers in Sydney must pay Â£75 a ton for them. Yet this Government says that it does not believe in prices control and that such control is not necessary. </para>

                        <para>- That is true. I remind the honorable senator that in 1949 the Prime Minister stated that the States could, control prices more effectively than could the Australian Government. If the honorable senator considers that effective prices control means that the growers of a commodity receive Â£20 a ton while the consumers are obliged to pay Â£?5, I do not agree with him. </para>

                <para>The Prime Minister has said that this Government is bitterly opposed to any form of control, but that it is most essential to have a stable economy if we are <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> prepare <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> defences. He believes that it is essential that one should go with the other. Can any honorable senator opposite tell me how the Australian economy may be stabilized without imposition of drastic controls, including prices control? While honorable senators opposite have been talking prices have been rising, and will continue to rise while they continue to talk. We challenge the Government to tell us how the economy can be stabilized under this measure. In my opinion, all that has come from the Government, during the debate up to this stage is a series of involved utterances that are not connected with the bill. But before continuing with that point I shall paraphrase an item that appeared in one of the tory newspapers. The item in the newspaper is not palatable to honorable senators opposite because it begins with the words, " The fall in the value of the pound ". It goes on to state that prices are rising because of the failure of the Government to carry out its promise to put value into the Â£1 and stop the inflationary trend. It: also states that there are no fewer than 500,000 people in Australia who are affected by rising price* as they have not been affected since the days of the depression. It adds that there are 800,000 families on fixed incomes who are now beginning to know what it is to be short of commodities. Probably those families are also beginning to know what it is to be hungry. We have never known such times as the present since the days of the depression. This year 450,000 pensioners are suffering to a far greater degree than they suffered during the war years, because of the lack of purchasing power in their money. The pension that each of them receives would not pay even the rent of a flat. The Government says that it intends to stabilize the economy by the use of the provisions of this measure. There are thousands of families who would raise their their arms in thanksgiving to-morrow if the Government would tell them that, even by next year it would carry out its pledge to stabilize prices and put some value back into the worthless fascistMenzies Â£1. </para>

                    referred to the queer methods of thinking that he said had been exhibited by honorable members on this side of the chamber. I am glad that he has now returned to the chamber, so that he can hear what we think of the present queer thinking of honorable senators opposite in comparison with what theysaid in 1949. Since the general election campaign in 1949 the Government has made a complete somersault in relation to national and international affairs. If the Government would suggest some way to correct the present disastrous state of affairs and to prevent the even more disastrous state of affairs towards which we are heading it would be doing something to justify itself.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline>
                    also said that the Opposition denied that any dangers faced Australia at present. This Opposition has never denied that there are dangers, because there are always dangers. What we are asking the Government to do is to give us some information about the dangers that face the country. We demand, as representatives of the people, that before we shall give the Government an open cheque, which is what this measure really is, it shall tell us specifically where the danger is that might plunge us into a war tomorrow. Let the Government give us some information to justify the Prime Minister's statement that war will occur within three years. In my opinion the international situation is not as dangerous as it was twelve or eighteen months ago.

Britain and America began to prepare eighteen months ago,but the Australian Government has only now awakened to the need for preparation. The situation is not as dangerous now as it was eighteen months ago, because Britain and America have made great preparations during the last year or so, while the Australian Government has been sitting idly by. The American and British preparations provide a bulwark that did notexist before. Yet the Australian Government has done nothing in that time. </para>

                        <para>- During the eighteen months that this 'Government has 'been in office, it has done nothing to rectify the disastrous position of the primary producers. Immediately after it assumed office it refused to continue to operate the ships that belonged to the Commonwealth. It sold some and chartered others to private shipping companies. What has been the result of that action ? The private shipping companies to which the ships have been chartered do not care whether or not -the vessels leave port with full -cargoes. I have seen ships arrive in  Tasmanian  ports in water ballast. Indeed, one ship arrived in a Tasmanian port not long ago  carrying  no more than 10 tons dead weight of cargo. The Commonwealth has to make good the loss incurred on the operation of those vessels. It is disgraceful that primary producers should be driven out of production because they cannot transport their products from one State to another or to the overseas markets. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> contends we are responsible for the state of chaos into which this country is drifting. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw it. Honorable senators opposite have said that Opposition senators sabotaged legislation introduced by the Government to deal with Communists who are holding up production in this country. We have never sabotaged any legislation, nor have we delayed the passage of legislation. The Government already possesses sufficient power to deal with the Communists and saboteurs but it lacks the courage and initiative to do so. This bill is the most atrocious measure that has come before us since this Government took office. If it is placed on the statute-book the Government will be able to exercise unlimited powers over the men and women of this country. It will be able to force a man to leave his employment and his borne to work elsewhere. It will virtually enable the Government to throw a working man to the wolves. Honorable senators opposite have stated that it does not seek to confer power on the Government to direct labour from one industry to another, but I have no doubt that when this bill has been placed upon the statute-book the Government will resort to indirect means to compel the workers to work in selected industries, and they will have no choice but to obey. If the Government is unable to achieve its objective by one means it will adopt another. It should be honest and say frankly that it favours compulsory conscription of labour to enable it to do what it hopes to be able to do by the coercive provisions of this bill. Honorable senators opposite have labelled Opposition senators as a bunch of socialists who want, to socialize all and sundry, yet they ask us to give to the Government a blank cheque to establish what will virtually be a fascist dictatorship which governs by regulation without consultation with the Parliament. The Government is hastening the Parliament into recess so that it can get on with that task. 1 invite honorable senators opposite to tell us of any plan that the Government has for dealing with the problems that face this country. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the bill because I believe that it will enable the Government to take steps that are necessary for the protection of Australia and its people. I believe that it is best for us to be prepared for war if we want to avoid war. In past generations time was given to lis to prepare after the war broke out, but under present world conditions we must organize our resources and industries now. Many of the remarks made by honorable senators opposite do not call for any reply, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> who has just resumed his seat, constantly harped on the attitude of this Government towards what he called government by regulation. It should be remembered that every regulation which will be made under this legislation must come before the Parliament within fifteen days of the Parliament resuming its sittings. Then, if it is found not to be in th.p interests of the country, it can be disallowed by the Parliament. That answers the charge that the Government intends to govern by regulation. Another suggestion that I want to refute is that this bill has been brought in like a bolt from the blue, and as a surprise to the Parliament. It has been said that it has been introduced without a mandate being held by the Government. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said in the policy-speech that he delivered at Camberwell on the 3rd April - </para>

                <para class="block">Yet honorable senators opposite said  that  they had no indication that this bill would lie brought before the Parliament, and had no chance to study it. They certainly knew that it would be brought forward, but I am sure that they did not study it, judging from some of their speeches. The Opposition says continually that this Government came to power because the Prime Minister said that he would throw out all controls. That is not correct. At no time did he say that. The Government dislikes controls for controls sake, but it has never shirked its duty to impose controls when it has believed that they were in the interests of the people. The present Prime Minister brought the National Security Act before the Australian Parliament in 1939. That was the sire and the dam of all the regulations that were made during the following years. No complaints were made about the administration of that act by the government that introduced it and it was only after a Labour government sought to perpetuate the regulations after the war that we, voicing the desire of the people, advocated the abolition of those that we thought to be unnecessary. To get this bill into proper perspective we must alter our ideas of what modern war means, because new techniques have developed in the last few years  which  indicate that war can be conducted in time of peace. We must organize our political thought to grapple with these new techniques, and this bill, together with those others which have been passed by the Parliament this week, is a genuine and vital attempt to deal with the new technique of war. I have no doubt that this attempt will be successful. </para>
                <para>This country has been attacked from within by agents of a foreign power with the deliberate object of upsetting our economy so that we cannot prepare for war. That foreign power wishes us to be weak when the battle begins. The Liberal and Australian Country parties have never hesitated to take measures to protect the nation. It is galling to honorable senators opposite to realize that this Government is now taking action in the interests of the nation, irrespective of what section of the community may be hurt. The teeth of the Opposition have been pulled by this Government taking measures which will hurt some of the business interests which the Opposition has always said this Government is here to represent. When we take measures for the protection of Australia, we take them without fear or favour. We do not consider ourselves responsible to any pressure group, whether it be a business pressure group or a trade union pressure group. We do what we believe is right. This bill is designed to do the right thing for the protection of the nation. </para>
                <para>There are two ways in which controls may be administered. The Government can either seek the co-operation of the industries which will be affected, or it can hand over the conduct of the controls to government departments. The Government has intimated that the cooperation of industry is to be sought, so that we may have the benefit of its which will be taken when this bill becomes law. I believe that any controls that are instituted under this legislation will be made more effective if we secure the voluntary co-operation of the industries to which they apply. Let us seek the assistance of men who have spent the whole of their adult lives in those industries, and who know them, so to speak, inside out. Let us ask them to give the Government the benefit of their experience. In every industry there are some men who are not big enough to be prepared to sacrifice their personal interests in the interests of the security of the nation. If they know that the Government is not armed with power to ensure that what it wants to do shall be done, they will put their own selfish interests first, but if they know that the Government is in a position to insist upon its plans being put into operation, they will co-operate. The best way in which to exercise the controls envisaged by this bill is to ask the industries to which they apply to make voluntary sacrifices. There is another way in which to exercise them, lt is the one that was used by Labour governments during and after the last war - to hand the administration of the controls to government departments, or bureaucrats. I do not believe that that should be done now, because a great deal of damage was done under the regime of the Labour party by departmental officials who were asked to make decisions that affected industries of which they had no experience. The voluntary system is far better. </para>
                <para>Honorable senators opposite who have asked why this bill was not introduced some months ago have been indulging in confused thinking. During the last eighteen months the Government has had to fight two general elections. No one denies the truth of the statement that during the life of the last Parliament the Senate passed 65 of the 67 measures that were presented to it. It was the length of time that the Senate took to pass them that caused the Government to go to the country again in April of this year. Much of what occurred in this chamber during the last Parliament was an utter waste of time and of public money. In April, the Government parties were returned with a majority in both Houses of the Parliament. During this sessional period, the Government has secured the passage of many measures that it believes will assist in alleviating the present difficult position. No one can accuse the Government now of wasting time. What has been done in this Parliament during this sessional period proves beyond doubt that the Government intends to do a job, and that it is doing it rapidly. </para>
                <para>The debate upon this measure has been interesting, and it is probable that it will continue for some time. It has been suggested that the Government intends to gag the debate, but the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> 0'Sullvan  has given an unqualified assurance that that will not be done. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber are willing for the debate to continue until every member of the Opposition who wishes to speak upon the measure has done so. There are not many  Opposition  senators here now, and there will be fewer of them here to-morrow. </para>
                <para>Although I have been a strong opponent of unnecessary controls, I believe that, by introducing this bill, the Government acted in the best interests of the people. Governments have sources of information about developments and trends overseas that are not available to private citizens. This Government, having considered the information at its disposal, has decided that this measure- is necessary for the protection of the Australian people. It has been introduced in good faith and will be administered in good faith. I support it.- </para>

                <para>The recitals in the preamble to the bill, although they read very well, are not necessarily based, on fact. I am not prepared to accept any statement unless I am reasonably certain that those who have made it have a knowledge of all the relevant facts. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber do not accept the recitals, as the Government evidently expects them to do. I remind the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> that we are not dependent mentally upon highly placed persons. We claim the right to think and judge for ourselves. It does not follow that, because a man holds high office in a court of law or some other public institution, the opinions that he expresses cannot be challenged. I am not impressed by either the political theatricalism or the exhibitionism of members of the Government. The Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> would have us believe that the enemy is at our very door. The emotionalism or hysteria in which Ministers have indulged so frequently in this chamber does not impress me. It is a sign that they are not certain of their facts, and are relying upon their imaginations to convince the people. ITo good reasons have been advanced in support of the bill. The alleged reasons are mere generalizations which cannot be accepted <inline font-style="italic">ex cathedra.</inline> In view of what has happened in the past, one is entitled to put one's own construction on those reasons. My belief is that the Government is seeking to govern by regulation in the interests of monopolies. I have bad some experience of government by regulation. In April, 1941, I was a member of a regulations committee, and on one occasion more than 500 regulations were passed <inline font-style="italic">en</inline><inline font-style="italic">bloc,</inline> proving to me that the Government was prepared to allow those regulations to go into force without being properly considered. I advocated then that a permanent committee be set up to. examine regulations in conjunction with the acts upon which they were based, and I believe that an independent authority of that kind has now been appointed. </para>
                <para>In my opinion, the Government has deliberately allowed the present state of economic disruption to come about in order to try to justify its economic controls. The Government has made no attempt to deal with inflation. In the 1949 election campaign, and since, members of the present Government declared emphatically that it was their policy to restore value to the Â£1, meaning that the currency was to be deflated so that the purchasing power of the people's money would be increased. Instead of honouring that promise, the Government has allowed inflation to continue, until to-day the Â£1 is worth hardly 5s. as compared with the Â£1 before the war of 1914-18. The Government has not even tried to honour its promises. In the election campaign of 1949, and again in the campaign of 1951 spokesmen for the present Government parties said that if they were returned to power action would be taken against certain persons whom they described as Communists, but nothing has been done or even attempted, notwithstanding the fact that action could have been taken under any one of three acts. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline>
                    said that certain employers' organizations were protesting vigorously against this legislation. ITo doubt they can see clearly that the Government intends to put many small business men and manufacturers out of action on the ground that their undertakings are uneconomic, or that the goods they are producing are not essential. To the extent that small business men and small manufacturers are put out of action the power of the great monopolies will grow. Wars accelerate economic tendencies, and one of the effects of two world wars has been to strengthen monopoly control of goods and services. When this legislation is put into operation, as I have no doubt it will be, hundreds of thousands of small businesses will be closed on the ground that danger threatens us from outside, and that the economic needs of the country demand the sacrifice. The displaced owners will be told that the materials and labour that were used in their businesses can 'be much more advantageously employed by great concerns like the Broken Hill Proporietary  Company Limited. That is the
                    <inline font-style="italic">modus operandi</inline>
                    that has been employed in other countries and, to some extent, in this country also.
                </para>
                <para>I believe that the Government intends to give big military contracts to monopoly undertakings which have the biggest plant, and we may rest assured that for all practical purposes, the monopolies will obtain the contracts on their own terms. If the Government closes down the Glen Davis project, as it proposes to do, I assume that it will place tie plant on the market. There will be very few competitors and if a sale is not effected an offer will be made by some concern to take over the plant for a mere song. That practice has been followed by governments in the past in the United States of America and Great Britain and it was followed in this country by non-Labour governments after World War I. The only section of the community that will benefit under this measure will be the leading monopolies, which honorable senators opposite so eloquently defend. We shall thus have a state of affairs in which, behind the scenes, the leading monopolies will control the economy of the nation through the medium of the Government that now asks for a blank cheque to enable it to implement the proposals contained in the bill. </para>
                <para>Honorable senators opposite have complained about strikes. During my long experience in the industrial sphere I have taken part in many negotiations for the settlement of strikes. I know that nine out of every ten strikes have their origin in either deliberate provocation by employers or incompetent management. If the economy of this country were managed as it could, and should, be managed in the interests of the workers, very few strikes or industrial disputes would occur, because in such circumstances the workers would have very little to strike for. If the economy were controlled to give to the workers a fair share of the wealth that they produce their position would be  immensely  improved. But, to-day, the reverse is the case. Every increase of prices reduces the purchasing power of wages. That is a prolific cause of industrial disputes. Yet supporters of the Government declare that disputes are inspired by Communists, whereas they actually are caused by unbalanced economic conditions and the low standard of living of the workers. The stand that thu workers take in such circumstances is their inevitable reaction to such a state of affairs. Not one honorable senator opposite so far has made an intelligent approach to this problem. Instead, all supporters of the Government attribute ulterior motives to the workers whom they condemn, or indulge in fits of hysteria such as we witnessed on the part of the Minister for Shipping and Transport in this chamber yesterday. He referred to the existence of what he called a system of organized sabotage in industry.  His  statement may be true, or untrue ; but he did not say to what degree the workers are being sabotaged by the Government as the result of its deliberate policy of inaction. That is sabotage of the worst kind. One has only to read the newspapers to learn of the numerous ways in which persons on the lower ranges of income and pensions are affected by economic conditions that the Government allows to continue. Those sections of the community simply cannot cope with rising prices. Under such conditions it is only to be expected that men and women who are employed in industries that are indispensable to the economy, such as, the coal-mining, waterfront and shipping industries, will take a stand in order to protect themselves. They would not be worthy men or women, or worthy Australians, if they did not do so. However, the Government has not made any attempt to understand the position from the viewpoint of the workers. Honorable senators opposite have simply condemned the workers and implied that all men and women who challenge the existing state of affairs under which .they suffer unjustly are traitors or Communists. Supporters of the Government will not impress the people by adopting that attitude. If the Government hopes to establish a better state of affairs by passing this measure, its supporters will be sadly disillusioned. </para>
                <para>Honorable senators opposite are always talking about Communist leadership of trade unions. I have had nearly 50 years' experience in the trade union movement. I have organized men and women into groups, or unions; and in every instance I have found that the man, or woman, who is selected to represent a group or union, generally has most in common with the majority of the persons who make the selection. The average worker is not concerned about the politics, or religion, of officials of his organization. The rank and file select as their leaders those whom they believe will be able to present their case to the employers intelligently and dispassionately and thus obtain the results that they desire. Members of the Waterside Workers Federation elect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Healy</inline> as their general secretary, not because he is a Communist, but because they consider him to be the most able man for the time being to carry out the duties of that secretary. </para>

                <para>Turning now to what should be done, I say that if the Government really intends to legislate efficiently and economically in the interests of the nation, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> would have us believe, it should at least attempt to do certain things.First, it should regulate and control practically all phases of the national economy and not merely those that relate to defence or war preparations. Secondly, it should maintain the balance between production and consumption on a progressively increasing scale. Thirdly, it should control inflation and prices, because fluctuations in price movements have always prevented the smooth functioning of the nation's economy. The fourth step is to prevent excess production or under production in the different branches of production in order not to dislocate industry as a whole. It should balance the output of capital goods and consumption goods and increase real wages on the basis of the increase in productivity. I mentioned that matter a few minutes ago, and I merely point out now that if wages were increased in accordance with our increased productivity there would be very little industrial trouble to-day. E.ull employment is .also necessary because unemployment reduces .the aggregate purchasing power of the workers. The .seventh thing necessary is to control profits by determining the necessary minimum of profits and restricting profits to .that minimum. The Government should also prevent excessive speculation in commodity and stock markets as well as equalize the distribution of the national income so that income from investments does not accumulate at the expense of consumption income. The tenth requirement is to control investment in its three decisive aspects, by <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> preventing the excessive accumulation of private capital; (6) directing the flow of capital according to planned and balanced industrial requirements; .and ,(c) preventing excessive accumulation of capital in the form of corporate surplus and in the Form of reinvestment by unincorporated business. </para>
                <para>To attain all those ends a planned and regulated economy is .essential. The objectives that I have outlined are interrelated, and I place them before the Government in a sincere endeavour to assist it to cure the many ills that afflict our economy to-day. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that we must all be prepared, in the national interest, to make sacrifices. However, I point out immediately that the vested interests of this country have sacrificed very little, even in the last two world wars. While the workers were being sacrificed on the altar of war big business was increasing its profits, and the workers certainly obtained very little benefit for their sacrifices. Similarly, if this measure is passed the people who will be called upon to make the biggest sacrifices will be the workers, and it is arrant humbug for the Government to speak of " equality of sacrifice ". </para>

However, 1 gathered that he criticized this legislation on the ground that it will favour business monopolists. I remind the honorable senator that the administration of which he was a member governed largely by regulation for eight years, and I point out that some of the controls that the present Government desires to exercisewere -exercised for many years by Labour when it was in office. The honorable senator cannot have it both ways, and I should like to "know, therefore, whether he considers that Labour governed in the interests of monopolists. I cannot resist the feeling that the honorable senator'sargument was addressed to those who may be listening to the broadcast of this debate, but I believe that only a small proportion of his listeners would take any notice of his wearisome contentions. For the benefit of the honorable senator I point out that the purpose of this legislation is to coordinate the requirements of all users of materials, services and other articles that are required for the defence programme of the country. Nobody regrets the necessity for this bill more than I do. </para>

                <para>At first sight, it may appear that the introduction of this measure is a retrograde step, but on second thoughts, I am certain that all thinking people regard it as an essential piece of legislation, even if they  do come to the conclusion that it is Ho'bson's choice. Many criticisms have already been directed at the bill from many sources. I have read the criticisms that have been voiced by the  president  of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, and of many other persons, including tradesmen and private individuals. Many of those criticisms are understandable, and the people who have made them are quite entitled to place their views before the Government, and to publish their opinions. But I deplore the criticisms that have been offered by people who understand the true position. We hear a good deal of criticism from honorable senators opposite, but their criticisms are a shallow piece of political hypocrisy, and a pathetic attempt to gain a few votes. The Labour party knows perfectly well the necessity for this legislation. Incidentally, the provisions of the bill are quite in accordance with the principles of the Labour party, and the assertion by Labour senators that they disagree with the principles of the legislation is mere cant, and evidence of lack of sincerity. This important piece of legislationshould have been treated on its merits by all honorable senators, and should not havo been dragged into the morass of party political discussions; and disputation. This subject of national defence should be above party politics. </para>

It is now necessary that we prepare for war in earnest, and that reason alone is justification for this bill;but in the course of my remarks,. I shall endeavour to show more than a justification for the measure.I shall endeavour to establish that the international situation and our own internal economy demand it, and that the bill is entirely in accordance with the principles of Liberal policy. </para>

Let us recall what has happened since 1949, because that is. important. Soma honorable senators opposite have criticized this bill and have, by implication or quite openly, suggested that the international situation at present is substantially the same as it. was in 1949. No realist can suggest that such is true. In 1949, the security of Australia was not in danger. Not one  Australian  soldier was in the firing line. But what has happened since that year? Early in 1950, the Malayan incident occurred, and members of the Royal Australian Air Force, with heavy bombers and transport aircraft, have been in service in that part of the world ever since. Almost immediately after the outbreak of the Malayan affair, the Korean incident occurred'. Australian troops have been serving in Korea with great distinction ever since. All those developments in the international sphere have occurred since 1949, and nobody can seriously suggest that the international situation has not continued to deteriorate, until now the position is grave. Since that year, Russia has been strenuously preparing for war. </para>

It is now manufacturing the atomicbomb, and has completed the construction of service aerodromes in eastern Europe that are vastly different from the civil aerodromes which had been made there prior to that year. These service aerodromes are now ready for jet fighter and jet bomber aircraft. Those things have happened since 1949, and Opposition senators know it as well as we do. Since 1949 Russia has built a vast submarine fleet, and has the largest army  of  any nation. Does that not mean anything to honorable senators opposite?

                    <para>I am very sorry, indeed, that I should have to ask you to attend at very short notice, because you are all very heavily engaged with your own responsibilities. My reason for doing so is this : In recent weeks - the last month or two - as you know, 1 have had some occasion not only to consider certain international problems on the spot but also to have a series of discussions with other Prime Ministers of the British Commonwealth and to give consideration to certain problems in consultation with the Chiefs of Staff and technical officers in London. I have returned to tell my colleagues in the Commonwealth Government - and I think they support my view - -that the international position is an extremely disturbing one. I shall deem it necessary next week to put this matter to the Commonwealth Parliament in considerable detail, and through the Parliament to the people, because I should like to say at once I believe that we cannot expect to have a popular realization of some nf these things unless a great deal more is put before the people than we have been in the habit of putting before them- in the past. </para>
                    <para>My conclusion is this- - I state it right away - that the possibilities of war are so real and so serious that Australia cannot, with justice to itself or its allies, grant itself a day more than three years in which to get ready". That view is not peculiar to me - and <inline font-style="italic">X</inline> am not regarded by my colleagues, in the Cabinet at any rate, as an excitable person. </para>

                <para>Does any honorable senator suggest that the international situation has not deteriorated since 1949? Does any rational person believe that there is not to-day a grave national emergency which demands immediate action? Our ta.sk is to prepare for a possible war within the next three years. Our defence plans must be related to the various internal problems that face us. Some of those problems are serious. We have not yet finished paying for World War I. Provision was made in the budget for 1950-51 for the payment of Â£24,750,000 on war and repatriation services arising out of World War I.' That was almost Â£3,000,000 more than the sum required for those services in the previous year. We have hardly started to pay for World War II. In the last financial year, war and repatriation services arising out of World War II. cost this country Â£103,900,000, or approximately Â£30,000,000 more than the sum expended in the previous year under the same heading. Obviously those commitments must affect our economy, which is already overstrained by a huge programme of necessary public works. For example, because of the ravages of World War II., Western Australia is faced with an expenditure of Â£23,000,000 on the rehabilitation of its railway system. Then, of course, there are national undertakings such as the Snowy Mountains scheme, which are essential to the development of this country. Our economy is being sorely pressed, too, by the cost of our immigration programme, and who will deny that, at least up to the present, that programme has not been essential to the development of this country? A further serious problem is created by the ever-increasing cost of materials from overseas, and finally, we are faced with the problem of the Communist-planned decrease of  production  in key industries. Those are only some of the factors that contribute to the serious internal situation with which we are confronted. Ontop of all those problems, is superimposed' the far greater problem of preparing for war. That task can be represented very simply in terms of money. It means that this country will have to find Â£500,000,000 for defence in the next three years. The magnitude of that task can be gauged when we realize that, in 1949-50, we expended only Â£50.000,000 on defence, and that in the last financial year, we budgeted for an expenditure of only Â£133,000,000 under that head. Expenditure on defence in the current year will probably reach Â£200,000,000, or more than was expended in 1943 when the problems of World War II. were at their height. In terms of goods, our defence preparations represent an  enormous increase in the nation's requirements of food, coal, steel, and other essentials. In terms of man -power, they represent a requirement of about 150,000 trained men in three years. In World War II., an American heavy bomber cost from Â£55,000 to Â£58,000; to-day it costs approximately Â£2,000,000. Those figures show clearly that the state of war preparedness that we are seeking to achieve will cost somebody a lot of money. How can we prepare for war and at the same time carry out costly developmental programmes and maintain luxury and semi-luxury industries ? It is elementary that we cannot burn the candle at both ends and also in the middle. Long-range developmental programmes will not produce any return in the immediate future. We cannot have motor cars and. plenty of beer and at the same time have guns and butter. We must eliminate non-essentials and co-operate in order to carry out this defence programme because it is of prime importance. </para>
                <para>I shall discuss now the fundamental reason for the introduction of the bill. Some critics contend that the producers of the wealth of the country can cooperate without being subjected to the controls that are envisaged in the bill. 1 personally abhor controls because there are definite weaknesses in every form of control by legislation. Nevertheless, I am forced to admit that only through the agency of such a. measure as we are now discussing can proper co-ordination of our economy be achieved. Let us consider the situation from an international point of view. Australia is suffering from acute shortages of essential defence materials, such as tinplate. According to a. report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> to-day, the Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale),</inline> said yesterday that there would be a world deficiency of about 1,000,000 tons of tinplate a year for the next five years. He warned that the shortage might continue indefinitely in spite of the fact that new tinplate mills were being built in various countries. The United States of America is prepared to supply tinplate to Australia on the condition that we ensure that local supplies shall be diverted from non-essential production to essential war production. How can Australia assure America that the condition will be observed unless we ha.ve legislation of this nature? Let us consider the situation now from a domestic point of view. If, for instance, there are five tinplate manufacturing companies in Australia and only three of them agree to use their stocks for defence purposes, how could the Government carry out its defence programme without using some form of coercion on the two uncooperative companies? The real importance of this bill can be appreciated if that test is applied to every essential commodity, from rubber to steel, that Australia lacks. I am certain that most of the producers of essential commodities will co-operate with the Government. The degree of such co-operation will be reflected in the number of regulations that will be promulgated from time to time. The States have agreed to co-operate with the Government in their public works programmes. Fortified by those assurances, and the powers that will be conferred upon it by the bill, the Government will be able to tackle with confidence the diffcult  programme that it has laid down. </para>
                <para>Critics of the bill have attacked the policy of the Government parties in relation to defence and economic controls. lt must be admitted that the first Menzies Government introduced controls under the National Security Act early in World War II. The policy of the parties that are represented on this side of the chamber always has been to advocate the enforcement of a proper system of controls over industry in times of national emergency. Nobody can truthfully deny that that is a fact. That policy remains unchanged, and it is the policy pursuant to which this bill has been introduced. If it enables Australia to help to avert a third world war, it will be entirely justified. If we are forced into another major war, it will still be justified because, at least, we shall be prepared for the worst. We shall have saved the lives of thousands of young Australians because we shall have trained them to fight. On that ground alone the measure is fully justified. </para>

This is one of the most important measures that has been presented to the Parliament during my experience as a senator.

                <para>The Government claims that it has the right to enact such legislation under its defence power, but I warn it that there will be costly and almost unending litigation to test its validity. Notwithstanding the opinions of the many representives of the legal profession on the Government side of the chamber, many sections of the people will take advantage of every opportunity to protect their rights should the legislation be brought into full operation. The proposal to promulgate restrictive regulations and orders in relation to a wide variety of important matters shows that the Government has turned a complete political somersault. I am sure that the bill is not very palatable to many of its supporters. In fact, it is revolting to some of them. It will dispose of parliamentary government and substitute government by regulation in its place. The most disturbing factor of the Government's conduct is the introduction of the bill at the 11th hour as the Parliament is about to go into recess. The elected representatives of the people will be denied an opportunity to discuss any regulation that may be promulgated in accordance with the provisions of this bill. At all times the Australian Labour party has been prepared to co-operate in the implementation of any measure for the defence of this country. Reference has been made to the threat of war. Honorable senators on this side want to be assured that the dangers of war are real, if their co-operation is wanted in this matter. Why has not the Government informed the people of Australia, and particularly the Parliament, of all the facts? I believe that the threat of war has been magnified in order to screen the failure of the Government to carry out its election promises. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator who continues to interject implies that an unduly hig!! price is being charged in New South Wales for Tasmanian potatoes as a result of the maladministration of prices control by the State. I remind honorable senators that the abolition of the control of prices by the Commonwealth was advocated by the leaders of the present Government when in Opposition during the regime of the former Labour Government. Clearly, there is something wrong with the method of distribution of potatoes. This conservative Government is a government of inaction; its supporters have done little more than talk about the conditions in this country. Honorable senators will remember the famous slogan of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menizes),</inline> " We must put first things first ". I suggest that the Government's first major consideration should have been to provide adequate food for the people of this country. </para>

                <para>On many occasions since this Government assumed office, reference has been made in this chamber to the election pledge of the Prime Minister to restore value to the Australian Â£1. Since this Government took over the reins of office it has made no attempt to arrest the inflationary trend in our economy. On the other hand, honorable senators opposite have complained that sufficient quantities of material, plant and man-power are not available for essential industries because of competition by the less essential industries, which produce goods that are sold on an inflationary market. What a disclosure of ineptitude! The Government now proposes, virtually, to hand over responsibility to the people whom honorable senators opposite described during the 1949 general election campaign as bureaucrats, and whom they promised to destroy. Such a proposal could emanate only from a feeble and spineless government. In my judgment, this bill has been introduced as a smokescreen, in order to save the Government from the wrath and criticism of these people as a result of the inflationary conditions that now exist, and to destroy competition that is adversely affecting the monopolies in this country, which are the masters of the Government. It will also cover the Government's failure to maintain Australia's economic stability, and save the Government from further embarrassment. The Government now proposes to fasten its responsibility on to the National Security Resources Board which was appointed some time ago to make inquiries into the Australian economy and to assist the Government by bringing about an increased production of goods that were in short supply. The Parliament was not consulted in regard to the appointment of that board. There is on the board a number of public servants who have given good service to the country. They have been directed by the Government to make inquiries into certain aspects of agriculture and commerce and to arrange for the rationing of materials that are in short supply whether produced locally or imported. This bill has been drafted for the purpose of overcoming difficulties associated with the shortage of materials. There is ample evidence of the Government's failure to deal effectively with this problem. </para>
                <para>Before his election to office the Prime Minister promised to reduce taxation. Yet when the budget of his Government was introduced it was found that taxation had been increased by Â£20,000,000. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> made provision in hisfirst budget for the expenditure of Â£50,000,000 to stockpile goods that were in short supply and were needed for defence. What happened? The Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> was advised by an advisory committee to purchase rubber when it was 2s. 2d. per lb. So that his vanity would not suffer by reason of acceptance of advice from such a source, he rejected it, with what result? The rubber was not purchased until its price has risen to over 7s. per lb. When a question was addressed to the Minister on this subject he shrugged his shoulders and said that the Government had Â£10,000,000 worth of rubber in a stockpile. He did not state that if he had bought rubber when the price was 2s. 2d. per lb. he would have had Â£30,000,000 worth of rubber in the stockpile and it would have cost only Â£10,000,000. For that reason there should not be an extension of controls and power should not be delegated to committees or boards to deal with matters that are the responsibility of the Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">Those are the four exceptions that have been stated to the provisions of the bill, which applies to every other phase of our lives. The Government has all the power it needs for the imposition of taxation. So the first exception to the provisions of the bill is of little value. The exception with respect to the borrowing of money on public credit is of no value. The exception regarding the compulsory direction of labour is a very important one. The Government  does not favour the maintenance of the present state of full employment, but it has not the courage to alter that state of affairs, which was brought into existence by the Labour Government. In a snide manner, it proposes to except from the regulation-making power of the bill the power to direct labour. It wishes to make provision for the control of finance and materials so that it may indirectly control the flow of labour and do more damage to the industry and economy of the country than it could do by the compulsory direction of labour. </para>
                    <para>Like the average Australian citizen, I lack information in regard to the need for this bill. No more illuminating example of the weakness of the Government's case is needed than the spate of abuse and propaganda to which honorable senators were subjected last night by the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> Some indication of what will take place if the proposed powers are given to the Government was then made evident. Apart from abuse the only statements made by honorable senators opposite have been vague and based upon generalities. They have been characterized by an atmosphere of secrecy more profound than that which prevailed during the most critical stages of World War II. Is there any wonder that the Opposition asks: Where is the danger? Honorable senators on this side of the chamber desire that the Government shall tell them where the danger lies, and if that is done the green light will be given, if necessary. </para>

                        <para>- I maintain that they did. They were dismissed from office because their own supporters had become disgusted with their war effort. I recall how the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Curtin inspired the people of this country and was responsible for the prosecution of a succesful  war effort. This conservative Government has expended hundreds of thousands of pounds on advertisements in the newspapers of the country in an endeavour to recruit men for the armed services. What a lamentable failure that recruiting campaign has been ! I suggest that that is an indication of the increasing lack of confidence in this Government. Not only have huge sums of money been expended on the insertion of advertisements in almost every newspaper in the country, but a campaign has also been waged under the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Herring. The resources of the Commonwealth Bank have been tapped to assist that campaign, but the result of all those efforts has been the recruitment of approximately only 5,000 men. Is not that an indictment of this Government which now seeks additional power to affect the lives, liberty and welfare of the Australian people? </para>

                <para>T consider that the proposed controls will have a more disastrous and more disturbing effect upon the industrial and commercial life of this country than those that were in operation during the worst period of the second world war. After many years of conservative administration, there were no fewer than 250,000 unemployed when that war broke out. Although controls and restrictions operated under Labour governments, they were not so damaging or disturbing as will be the restrictions that the Government now proposes to apply during a period of full employment. I point out that when men are moved from one industry to another there is a distinct possibility of unemployment occurring. </para>

                <para>Abundant evidence exists to prove that the Government has failed to exercise the powers which, it already possesses. Only last week photographs that depicted unlimited waste of man-power and materials on the Snowy Mountains scheme appeared in various newspapers. When asked a question in this chamber concerning that matter, the responsible Minister stated that inquiries would be made. Those pictures showed many thousands of pounds' worth of material and plant covered by snow and deteriorating. Surely that was sufficient evidence to warrant the taking of immediate action? Such waste of man-power, finance and material resources will not condition the Australian people to extend additional powers to a government that is prepared to stand idly by and allow it to occur. </para>
                <para>Last week, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, in its annual report, disclosed that 9,000,000 man-hours had been lost on the waterfront during the period under review. Only two days ago shipping companies released 6S waterside workers before they had worked their full time. That indicates how man-hours are lost. Men are allowed to play two-up and cards on the job and to go fishing and stay away from their employment for other reasons while still being paid. That is the kind of thing that this Government allows to go on, yet it is seeking greater powers to control the lives and the welfare of the people of Australia. </para>

During the war years, when Labour was in power and when the demand for tinplate was much greater than it is to-day, we made ample provision for supplies of that commodity. One of the reasons why tinplate is in short supply to-day is that, it is being hoarded by the big monopolies to the detriment of small producers. This bill will help those monopolies to hold on to those supplies. Not only will it help them to do so, but it will also help them to destroy eventually the competition of small businesses. </para>

The Minister for Shipping and Transport yesterday went to a great deal of trouble to explain the shipping position to us. He had had a great deal of information compiled for him before he made his speech. He has been in charge of the shipping portfolio for nearly two years, and I want to know what action he has taken in that time to improve the shipping position. None whatever ! Constant inquiries have been made by honorable senators from Tasmania about shipping services to that State. Why has the Minister not been able to arrange for the shipment of potatoes from Tasmania to the mainland, and to ensure that the Tasmanians shall receive sufficient wheat from the mainland? I understand that wheat is now so short in Tasmania that the people cannot get enough to make damper, far less bread. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> has said, this Government is destroying the only source of petrol that we have in this country by closing down the Glen Davis refinery. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like at the start to express my pleasure that this debate has not been and is not to be curtailed, because the Government has seen fit to grant to the Opposition all the time it could wish to have to discuss this measure. There is therefore, no question of guillotining this bill through the Parliament and it. cannot be claimed that the Opposition is not being given proper opportunity for a full consideration of it. I should have thought that that concession by the Government, which was requested so forcefully by the Opposition, would have brought into this chamber rather more than the ten or eleven scattered supporters of the Opposition, at least one of whom appears to have gone to sleep during the last speech - for which I cannot blame him - that are now in the chamber. They sit gloomily on their benches. </para>

                        <para>- Whatever else <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> may have said in his speech he absolved us of the charge of being dominated by big business. It is a matter of great gratification to all of us that that truth has at last penetrated the mind of an honorable senator, who, in the past, has been so prone to voice the catch-cry that this Government is dominated by big business. We have shown that whatever pressure may be brought to bear on us by organized business, we act only in the best interests of all the people of Australia. It must be apparent to any student of politics that opposition by the Labour party to a measure of this kind cannot be anything but completely hollow. Opposition members favour the sort of legislation which permits government by regulation. When they were in office they resorted to that system of government very extensively. </para>

                <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna),</inline> when he sought to give effect to his abortive medical scheme, introduced merely an enabling bill, and left the whole of the rest of the field to be governed by regulation. As far as I am aware the constitution of the Australian Labour party still includes a plank which proposes the establishment of a supreme economic council to function outside the Parliament and to be charged with the responsibility of regulating the economic affairs of Australia. Having that particular predilection, and subscribing to that plank in the platform of their party honorable senators opposite are still prepared to put up a sham opposition to ;i. measure which in every respect must meet with their approval. I do not base my advocacy of the measure on the fact that it should meet with the approval of the Australian Labour party. Far from it ; indeed, that very fact makes me suspicious of the bill; but at least it contains the safeguard that any regulations made under it, unlike regulations which might have been made by a supreme economic council, if such a body had been established, are subject to disallowance by the Parliament. That great safeguard must be prominently in our minds when we discuss this measure. </para>
                <para>If the Opposition is genuine in its hostility to the bill, if it is not merely putting up a hypocritical sham fight against it, its adherence to the proposal for the establishment of a supreme economic council must be categorized as weak and pusillanimous. Members of the Opposition must abandon that proposal or they cannot conscientiously oppose this measure. "What a contrast if, is to have the Labour Opposition in the Australian Parliament putting up a fight against this bill when the Labour Oppositions in other parts of the British Commonwealth have supported measures of a similar kind. In Canada, representatives of the organized Labour unions  approached  the Canadian Prime Minister and asked him to introduce a bill such as this so that the country would be able to deal with enemies which the Labour Opposition had enough perspicacity to see were threatening the safety of the country. </para>
                <para>This measure can be justified only by the urgent need to put the defences of this country in a proper state. If thai need did not exist, there would be no justification for the bill and it could not bc accepted. We were asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley,</inline> in one of the lucid moments of his speech, what need there was for legislation of this kind and why we needed power to control materials. It must be obvious that if we are to embark upon a programme of adequate defence preparation we must take from civil consumption rubber for tyres for military transports, clothing for uniforms for the troops, copper, lead and other metals for munition of war, motor transport and trucks, building materials and many other things which the people urgently need for their own purposes. The withdrawal of those commodities from civilian consumption will result in a greatly increased demand upon what is left. The former Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley,</inline> has said in this chamber that the great monopolies of Australia have been cornering those materials. If that is so, there is great justification for a bill which will enable the Government to see that what i3 left after defence needs have been met is spread equitably over the whole field of industry. The honorable senator has told us that when he was in a position of authority he was obliged to provide .tinplate in the appropriate proportions to appropriate users. When he did that he acted on authority given to him by the provisions of a measure such as this. In that instance, he relied upon the authority given to him in the National Security Regulations which were promulgated under the National Security Act. If that is so, what is his justification for opposing the granting to this Government of similar powers for a similar object? The sole purpose of this bill is to ensure that materials in short supply shall be equitably spread over the country and that they are diverted to those industries that have a defence potential instead of to those which Professor Copland has described as encouraging a " milk bar " economy. </para>
                <para>If there is need for defence preparations, there is need for this bill. That is the test by which it must stand or fall.  1 do not suggest that if we accept that proposition we can necessarily overlook the dangers' that are inherent in the bill. There is always danger in a measure which authorizes government by regulation. I am not at all sure that the Acts Interpretation Act should not be amended so that regulations made under this measure or any other measure will lapse within a certain period if they are not actively approved by the Parliament. That, however, is a matter which arises out of the bill rather than something that is definitely included in it. I do not believe that in the situation which I have tried to describe, and which I believe exists, this bill and the actions which it envisages will in themselves be enough to ensure either our defence preparations or to counter the inflationary effect on our economy which those preparations will entail. I think that the Government having received these powers, the duration of which is limited to two years unless they are again agreed to by this Parliament, should take further steps against inflation. For instance, a conference is being held for the purpose of deciding upon an equitable allocation of international materials to avoid such happenings as the United States of America bidding against itself in our wool market or in overseas rubber markets. If we are to press for an international allocation of materials, it is obvious that we must have the power which will be given by this bill to allocate internally the materials that we shall thereby get. I hope that we shall eventually see some sort of an arrangement such as was made during the last war for a wage freeze in this country. In saying that I am not talking of the cost of living adjustment. If that does occur, it is possible that we shall need some system of price fixing in Australia. </para>
                <para>I hope that together with this programme we shall examine the immigration policy to see whether it should be pushed on as fast and as far in the future as it has been in the past. I hope that our public works will be rationalized so that priority will be given to works of the greatest importance in order that they may be finished first. I hope that expenditure, not directly connected -with defence. will be slashed, but that is an uninformed opinion. It is not the opinion of one who is in the centre of government, who knows all the factors that have to be taken into consideration. I. am sure that those who do know the factors and who are responsible will use a <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> least some of the measures that I have outlined to-night. As a part of the general programme that I have outlined for the defence of this country, this bill is absolutely essential. It has been reluctantly asked for by the Government. It has been reluctantly granted by another place. I think, if I may anticipate, that it will be reluctantly granted by this chamber. We shall jealously watch the use that is made of the powers that it will convey. 1 suggest that the safeguards implicit in the bill are sufficient to ensure that the Parliament will be in no way superseded. With those safeguards, the bill provides one of the best possible measures for the defence of this country against an outside enemy. The Government should be given by the people powers such as are sought by this bill which after all are to operate for a limited time unless the danger still exists at the end of that time in which case the powers will need to be renewed. Whether they will or will not need to be renewed, we cannot tell. Whether the danger will still exist in two years time we cannot tell, but I am as sure that if this bill is passed we shall run less risk of finding danger still in existence in two years' time. Therefore I support the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - During these dying hours of the first period of the first session of the Twentieth' Parliament, a great mass of legislation is being rushed towards its inevitable conclusion. Honorable senators have recently considered several measures, all of which have, if not a common intent, at least certain common qualities.. Under the Standing Orders I cannot comment in detail on the provisions of the Constitution Alteration (Powers to deal with Communists and Communism) Bill, nor on the Conciliation and Arbitration (No. 2) Bill, but it cannot be disputed that whether or not the bills were justified, both of them certainly interfered with particular liberties which  up to now have been traditional in our community. Whether or not that interference is justified is not a. matter for discussion now, but the bill under consideration is of a similar  naturt  in that in its intent and content it, too, purports to interfere with liberties which have been traditional in this country. This bill represents the zenith of the trend towards interference with age-old liberties. It will give immense power to the Government to legislate by regulation, and those regulations will intrude into every sphere aud every corner of our national life. They will intrude into the small shop, the small factory and even into the domestic kitchen. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>We are considering whether or not this bill is justified. While the bills that I have mentioned were passing through this chamber, certain other liberties were gradually trickling away from the people like grains of sand would trickle through the hands of Ministers. They are the social and economic liberties of the Australian people which are trickling away as the result of inflation, which is gradually robbing the people of their assets and security. While the Government purports to deal with liberty it is closing its eyes to the loss of liberty in many other ways. I mention inflation because this bill is virtually an economic mobilization measure, and if we are going to mobilize this nation economically we must consider the impact of that mobilization on the present condition of the country. Therefore, if I discuss our present economic position, it is because this measure will affect that position and, conversely, will be affected by it. </para>
                <para>Our present economic condition causes everybody grave concern. Our troubles have continued during a protracted period, and have given members of my party cause for grave concern. My disturbance arises not because the Government is not looking after the present position, but because it is not even looking at it. I am perturbed not because the position is out of hand, but because it is out of sight. I am perturbed not only because our economic position is of great concern to 8,000,000 Australians, but also because it appears to be of little or no concern to the 80-odd members of the Government parties in this Parliament. This measure and the others to which I have referred have been received with, one might say, suspicion. They have been closely scrutinized. We feel, and our feeling is shared by others, that they have not been introduced in good faith. People associated with industries and occupations with which the measures purport to deal have said that the legislation will not, and cannot, be effective, but, despite that opinion, the Government has proceeded with it. Those persons have expressed serious doubts about the good faith of the Government. Those doubts have also been evident in the reception of this bill. </para>
                <para>During the last nineteen months, inflation in this country has increased to such a degree that it is now virtually uncontrollable. We have passed from controlled inflation to uncontrolled inflation. To handle the situation would be to handle political dynamite. Is it not possible for the Government to deal with it by what I shall call ordinary civilian means? The Government, having taken the advice of economists who. doubtless would suggest complex remedies, could grapple with the complex economic problem with which we are confronted. The Opposition suspects strongly that, in introducing this bill, the Government has not acted in good faith because, during the last nineteen months, it has not used the weapons and means that have been at its disposal to deal with the economic situation. I believe that the bill has been introduced, not with the object of achieving the purpose for which it purports to be designed, but for the purpose of enabling the Government, under the pretense of acting in the interests of national defence, to do something that it could have done with the ordinary weapons that are available to it. Let me read to the Senate one of the many recitals in the preamble to the bill. They are a prominent feature of legislation introduced by this Government. The recital states, in part - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>And whereas the defence preparations mentioned in the preceding paragraphs cannot be carried out to the necessary extent . . . unless at the same time measures are undertaken for adjusting the economy of Australia to meet the threat of war and for avoiding or reducing economic dislocation or instability caused by, or impeding, defence preparations. </para>
                    <para class="block">Undoubtedly, the present economic situation is impeding defence preparations. Under the terms of this measure, an attempt will be made by the Government to cure the inflation that is disrupting our economic life. That is made clear in the preamble to the bill. It is bad for the Government to introduce legislation that purports to be designed for one purpose and to use it for another. That will breed mistrust in the minds of the people about the objects of legislation and cause a grave lack of faith in the National Parliament. </para>
                    <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> that the important question that we have to consider is whether there is any justification for this measure. I believe that I am expressing the opinion of all honorable senators on this side of the chamber when I say I agree that, in certain circumstances, the liberties of individuals and of groups of individuals must be sacrificed to the national interest. We have to decide whether those circumstances exist now. The present situation has been described by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> and other members of the Government- in one way, but the bill describes it in other terms. Therefore, the Australian people are confused. They are unable to assess the gravity or otherwise of the situation. </para>
                    <para>The Government must secure the cooperation of the people. The bill, in effect, asks for their co-operation, but it also threatens that if they do not cooperate with the Government, compulsion will be used. Can the Government reasonably expect the co-operation of the nation unless it issues an authoritative statement describing the circumstances that have compelled it to introduce this measure ? A spate of contradictions, halfstatements and summaries of the position has confused the people. In a speech that I delivered in this chamber recently, I appealed to the Government to take the people into its confidence, but it has not yet done so. We are still wading in a morass of vague statements, not one of which is conclusive and not one of which inspires confidence. Hanging over our heads like the sword of Damocles is a threat of compulsion if we do not co-operate with the Government. The Government is asking for the nation's cooperation, but it has failed to tell the people the reasons why that co-operation should be given. </para>
                    <para>How grave is the threat to this country ? Are we to assume that in the past few months there has been a great deterioration of the international situation which is known to the Government, but perhaps not even to the rank and file members of the Government parties or to every member of the Cabinet? Is not the Government under an obligation to take the National Parliament into its confidence? If we must always manage our national affairs under the threat of external danger, whether it be near or remote, great or small, what will be the future of this country? We shall remain, as would any other country in similar circumstances, in a state of suspense. National development will cease, individual careers will be halted, and individual hopes will be frustrated. The Government must make an authoritative statement about the position, and take the people into its confidence. </para>
                    <para>I read in the press recently that a Government supporter in the House of Representatives had said that while troops from this country were engaged in military activities in any part of the world, the right to strike should be denied to all organizations in the community. The workers of this country have always been loyal. The great body of Australian trade unionists made no threat to take direct action during the whole of the last war. If the principle enunciated by that member of the House of Representatives were taken a step further, as this bill proposes to take it, all the natural and fundamental rights of individuals and of groups of individuals in the community would be suspended, because of a vague threat of war, undetermined and undisclosed, or an alleged need to make preparations to defend ourselves against a form of aggression that has never been put clearly and starkly before the people. I appeal to the Government to take us into its confidence. During the war, secret sessions of the National Parliament were held, and members were given facts which were withheld from the public. If the position is such that the community must accept war measures in time of peace, surely their elected representatives are entitled to the same courtesy from the Government as was extended to them by a Labour Prime Minister during the war. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, but it was certainly taken in Australia. We approach this bill with suspicion, and we wonder what it is really all about. A doubt arises whether it .will ever be enforced at all. Only the other day the Prime Minister, when answering protests against the legislation, denied that the Government intended to issue a spate of regulations. Nevertheless, in his second-reading speech on the bill, the Prime Minister said - </para>

                    <para>Some one may ask why it is necessary to take power to make regulations for this purpose. I can answer that question briefly. In the first place, it may be necessary to move quickly iti circumstances that are not sufficiently grave to warrant a calling of a  special  session of the Parliament. It is not always practicable to call a session suddenly, as we know from experience. Circumstances might arise which would require instant executive action that could not be deferred until a special meeting of the Parliament was called. Indeed, the circumstances might not of their own nature, be sufficiently important to justify the convening of a special session. In the second place, as honorable senators will understand, the measures that would be necessary are likely to be rather detailed in character, and more appropriate, therefore, to become the subject of regulations than of an act of Parliament. </para>

We are forced to wonder whether the Government is serious. If it is not intended to enforce this legislation, why was it introduced? Was it in order to give an appearance of  activity by the Government which, for nearly two years, has been completely inactive; or does the Prime Minister recognize that, in order to deal with the present situation, he must retrace his steps, and give effect to suggestions that have been advanced by the Opposition? If the </para>
                <para class="block">Government does not intend to put the measure into force, but is merely making a pretence of action, it is playing a shabby trick on the public. </para>
                <para>For my part, I believe that the Government really intends to implement .thislegislation, and that it will become, in fact, a real threat to the rights of the people. It is a threat to private property, and is in conflict with the principle of the wide distribution of property among the population. In time of war, individuals willingly surrender some of their property rights. There is upon them a moral obligation to do so, which most of them willingly accept. A national economy which is based on monopolies is capable of quick economic mobilization. On the other hand, an economy based upon the wide distribution of property is not so easily mobilized. This legislation, if enforced, must result in the displacement of many small proprietors, and the concentration of property and techniques in the hands of a few. The -bill is designed, therefore, to change our economy into that of the complete capitalist state, and to destroy the system of property distribution which renders a society safe and stable. The Government must be careful that, in its efforts to secure the defences of the nation, it does not undermine the very foundations upon which they rest. National liberty is the sum of the liberty of the individuals that make up the nation. If individual liberty is destroyed national liberty cannot survive. </para>
                <para>We oppose the bill because the Government has failed to show us that it is necessary; because it is authoritarian in concept and in method; and because it demands the co-operation of a nation that has not been taken into the Government's confidence. We oppose it because, were it enforced, it would leave disfiguring and ineffaceable marks on the body of our society. </para>

I shall not weary honorable senators with a review of world affairs. I need only remind them that conditions to-day in </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Persia and the Near East contain the makings of a third world war. None of us should be blind to that fact. Wo know only too well that at any time the other side might choose we could become involved in another conflagration. Therefore, having regard to the international situation, it is wise for us to assess our preparedness to meet possible hostilities. There can be no doubt that in the event of the outbreak of a third world war we shall have very little time to get ready. In these circumstances we should urgently examine the state of our national defences. We should survey conditions to ascertain how best we can intensify our defence preparedness without materially interfering with our internal economy. That will involve a considerable amount of organization. Of necessity, we must divert materials into right channels and ensure that the most effective use shall be made of those materials. It is to be regretted that we are confronted with this task, but the present situation is so serious that we have no alternative but to tackle it. </para>
                <para>I remind members of the Opposition that they have not a mortgage upon love of freedom or upon the desire to fight in defence of it. Supporters of the Government have just as high a regard - indeed, a higher regard - for the freedom of the subject. We must also remember that the people of Australia have twice reposed their trust in the Government parties within the last two years. There can be no doubt that at present our basic industries are not producing sufficient of the commodities that are so urgently needed in the interests of the national economy. During the last few years we have, up to a point, permitted industry to direct its forces into the manufacture of luxury, or semiluxury, goods. In our present serious situation we must take stock of our resources and rectify that defect. If we are to enable our industries to function to their fullest degree we must ensure that they receive adequate supplies of basic materials, such as coal. </para>
                <para>An important factor that has not been stressed sufficiently in the course of this debate is what may be described as our fourth branch of defence. I refer to food production which ranks in importance with the other three branches of our defence organization - the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. Unfortunately, the production of many important primary products has declined to a serious degree owing to the fact that our f arming community has not been able to obtain adequate supplies of materials that it urgently requires. Primary production has been hampered because of the shortage of machinery that is required for the manufacture of materials that are indispensable to efficient farming. I refer, for instance, to wire netting and fencing wire which are needed to combat the rabbit pest, and galvanized iron which is required for housing. Those deficiencies are most important, particularly as Australia may be called upon to make a substantial contribution to world food supplies. Our primary industries have been labouring under great difficulties. That fact is reflected in the drift of population from the country to the cities. In turn, that drift has been caused to some degree by our failure to carry out a planned programme of production. Another factor that has tended to decrease the labour pool available for primary production is the programme of public works that is being carried out in the various States. Nothing can be said, in principle, against the undertaking of public works. But we are now faced with the problem of whether our overall labour pool is sufficient to enable us to carry on public works without, at the same time, depriving essential industries of adequate manpower. I am pleased to learn that the Government intends to review current works programmes with a view to diverting labour that can be spared from that sphere to more important industries. </para>

The Government will be enabled to apply remedies under this measure pursuant to which it will impose controls for that purpose. I am not influenced in any way by the outcry in the newspapers that various organizations such as chambers of manufactures and chambers of commerce have raised in protest against this measure. Those protests do not interest me in the slightest. Such organizations are doing a good job but they are naturally influenced by a sectional viewpoint. On the other hand it is the duty of the Government to take an overall view of the picture in order that the greatest good shall be done and the least injury shall be caused to our national economy as a whole. I say to those organizations that have been exerting such pressure during the last few days that they acted unwisely in condemning this measure without having investigated it fully and ascertaining the good that it could accomplish in the interests of the nation. Similar legislation is in operation in the United States of America and Great Britain and it has worked very effectively in those countries. </para>
                <para>I regret very much, possibly because I have only recently been elected to the Senate, to notice a certain tendency in this chamber. I refer to the practice of many senators of relying upon statements that their opponents made many years ago, merely in order to score debating points. Surely we can view the current situation in the light of present-day realities and not with our eyes on the past. International relations and even internal conditions in overseas countries are changing from day to day, and it seems hardly worth while to worry about what  hapened  ten years ago and still less about what happened in the dark days of the depression. If we can take a general view of the situation as it exists to-day, including the dangers that confront us,if we can realize our own strength and the potentialities of this country, and if we can work together as members of a single community, I am sure that we can all be much happier. </para>
                <para>The present Government has a clear mandate to implement this legislation, and I have complete confidence in the members of the Ministry, who are men drawn from many walks of life. They are, therefore, truly representative of the people of this country. I have no doubt that before they agreed to the introduction of this legislation they carefully investigated every aspect of the problems that confront us and had in mind all the dangers that are allegedly inherent in it. The Opposition contends, of course, that the passage of this bill will whittle away our traditional liberties, and it alleges that the Ministry proposes to delegate to the Public Service its duty to govern the country. Members of the Opposition profess to be terrified at the prospect of entrusting authority to public servants. I remind them that the great majority of the members of the present Ministry have had a good deal of experience of government and administration, and because they certainly love this country as much as do members of the Opposition, I am convinced that they would not do anything that might harm it. In reply to the criticism of the Public Service that was implied in the speeches of many members of the Opposition, I remind our political opponents that Australia has every reason to be proud of its public servants, who discharge very efficiently their complex administrative duties. </para>
                <para>Once the need for the introduction of this measure is properly understood, and the provisions of the bill are viewed from that standpoint, I think that we may regard the consequences of its implementation with confidence. Apart from considerations of national defence, our economy is menaced by a number of factors, including inflation, and strong action is needed to correct that- situation. However, before a government can take strong action it must be fortified with adequate legislative powers, and that is why the Government has introduced this measure. I repeat that if the bill is viewed fairly and in the light of our present dangers and difficulties, we need have no cause for anxiety about it. Furthermore, I am convinced that when it is implemented many of the fears  voiced by members of the Opposition and others will disappear. I wholeheartedly support the bill. </para>

                    <para>. -  I oppose the bill. When I took part in the debate on the Constitution Alteration (Powers to Deal with Communists and Communism) Bill 1951 last night, I characterized it as " No. 4 " of the series of anti-democratic and repressive measures that the present Government is seeking to foist upon us. The bill now before us is " No. 5 " of that series. If the measure has any purpose at all, it is to organize society in such a way as to allow monopoly capital to obtain complete control. Of course, that will inevitably lead to unemployment, and the incidence of unemployment may become as high as 10 per cent., which is, I think, the objective enunciated by Professor Hytten. </para>

                <para>Although I have been a member of the National Parliamentand of the Parliament of New South Wales for some years, in all my parliamentary experience I have never heard a second-reading speech delivered by a Minister in circumstances such as those that surrounded the speech made by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan),</inline> who introduced this bill this morning. Nobody seemed to know what the bill was about. The Government did not even provide us with a copy of the Minister's speech or give us any warning about it. Of course, the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> assured us that it was a most important measure, and begged us because of that fact not to waste too much time in passing it. The lack of logic in his statement lies in the implication that the more important a measure is, the less consideration it should receive from the Parliament. </para>
                <para>I have pointed out all along that untrammelled inflation must inevitably lead to chaos, and for a long time I have advocated the introduction of necessary economic controls. I believe in revaluing the Â£1, which the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> also advocates, and I believe in increasing the interest rate on government loans, a contention which, strangely enough, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> also urges. Some reference was made to the present inflation by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McMullin,</inline> who is, I believe, a grazier and doubtless represents the views of graziers. If there is one factor which is responsible more than any other for the present inflation it is the high price of wool-- </para>

                <para>The average grazier in New South "Wales occupies quite a social position in the life of his country town. When the graziers received their huge wool cheques they all wanted to buy expensive English Jaguar motor cars, and they almost gave away the used motor cars that, they already had. They invaded our capital cities and thought nothing of paying Â£10,000 or Â£15,000 for a house. Those who did not choose to buy houses built them. They got bricklayers to work for them by paying them any wage at all that the bricklayers demanded. If a bricklayer wanted an extra Â£1 a day, <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> grazier would pay him that amount willingly. They sent their wives and daughters to London for the social round, and expense simply did not matter to them. They created such a shortage of goods and services in the cities that it became almost impossible for the ordinary working man or woman to exist. That situation led, in turn, to successive demands for increases of the basic wage, and the continued increases of that wage have had a very direct effect on the present inflationary trend. When I mentioned these matters some months ago one honorable senator opposite said that I was talking nonsense and that wc should allow the law of supply and demand to operate without restraint. That comment was typical of the attitude of Government supporters at that time, and I want to know what has happened since to cause them to change their minds so completely and to induce them to support such a measure as the one before us. </para>
                <para>This bill is most remarkable for a variety of reasons. Excluding the Communist Party .Dissolution Act, it has the longest preamble that I have ever read. Under the provisions of the measure, power is given to certain individuals to do in peace-time what they would not bc able to do in war-time. I am inclined to  change  my mind about a conclusion that T have reached. I thought that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> desired this bill to be put into operation, but I arn satisfied now that he introduced this legislation for the purpose of window-dressing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> has already mentioned that possibility. He delivered a wonderful speech, of which the Government should take cognizance. If a state of emergency exists, we should know about it..

                <para>If a state of national emergency existshow is it that only yesterday the Senatewas considering legislation the purpose of which was to ask the people, by way of referendum, to grant to this Parliament power to dissolve the Communist party? Seemingly, various Ministers who aremembers of the legal profession, from the Prime Minister down, have been incapable of drafting a bill, or a series of bills, to enable the Government to deal expeditiously with those persons whom, it asserts, are traitors and saboteurs. We are told that this is a period of emergency. How does the Government propose to deal with the Communists who are said to hp  sabotaging production? The Government proposes to hold the referendum about six months hence. The appeal to the people has been made necessary because the High Court of Australia has ruled that the Communist Party Dissolution Act is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the Constitution. Apparently Ministers have no confidence in their legal ability, and are reluctant to run the risk of drafting a bill, or a series of bills, which the Leader of the Opposition iÂ»i the House of Representatives, the learned <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> may knock into a cocked hat. Therefore, the Government proposes to seek the authority of the people to incorporate verbatim in the Constitution all the provisions of the Communist Party Dissolution Act. I contend that if such a state of emergency exists that this bill must be passed, the Government should deal with the Communists now. I do not know anything about the law- </para>

                <para class="block">Court ruled that the defence power of the Commonwealth could not support the Communist Party Dissolution Act. Some of the more conservative elements retired from the bench a few years ago, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JusticeFullagar</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Kitto were appointed in their stead. The justices of the High Court have expressed the opinion that the Communist Party Dissolution Act is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the Constitution, because the conditions do not justify the conclusion that this country is in a state of war. How in the name of goodness, then, can the High Court fail to declare that this bill isultra <inline font-style="italic">vires</inline> when Industries are interfered with by the bureaucrats? A few years ago, honorable senators opposite used to criticize the activities of the bureaucrats. They have executed an extraordinary <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline> on this bill. They used to declare that they would not brook interference with private industry. During the general election campaign in 1949, the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eric J. Harrison),</inline> who is now the Minister for Defence Production, ridiculed the Chifley Labour Government for having retained controls. He said, " Leave controls to the States. Let the law of supply and demand operate, and conditions will be balanced eventually." It is extraordinary that a Government which has held such views should present this bill to the Parliament. </para>
                <para>This measure will permit an oligarchy to do anything with the exception of four things, or perhaps only three things. The Government claims that Labour cannot be conscripted under this legislation. But if various industries are to be closed down, the persons who are employed in them must pack their belongings and seek jobs in other industries. The Government thinks that this bill will arrest inflation. What will happen to the small entrepreneur, the " little fellow ", who will struggle to get some raw materials on the black market, and finding it impossible to carry on, will be driven to the wall? When industries are closed in that way, the employees will lose their jobs. The Government claims that there will not be physical conscription in the sense that workers will be forced to take employment in other industries, but I emphasize that there will be economic conscription. For that reason, we may say that this bill will permit an oligarchy to do anything except three things. The fact that three things that the Government cannot do are mentioned leads me to suppose that it will be able to do everything else under the sun. </para>
                <para>We are told that we are fighting to preserve our way of life, and for free enterprise. What will happen is that government control will be replaced by control by a bureaucracy. Regulations will be promulgated while the Parliament is in recess, and the bureaucrats will be able to do arbitrarily anything that they like. I do not object to the closure of certain luxury industries in war-time if that will be in the interests of the country ; but this bill will give greater powers in peace-time to the Government than it possessed in war-time. I have examined some of the powers that were taken by the Government during World War II. Credit restriction was introduced by the Liberal party, alias the Nationalist party, alias the United Australia party, alias the conservatives. There were also capital issues control, rationalization of industry, materials control, interest control, export and import control, censorship, rationing, prices control and wages control. Those powers were taken in wartime. The Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> has stated in the House of Representatives that there is no doubt that under this bill, such things as rayon, nylon and tinplate will be rationed. I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will tell us in his reply to this debate the reason for the Government's <inline font-style="italic">volte face.</inline> What has happened in the world ? Are the Russians going to attack Persia? If so, let us know about it. If there is to be a war, Labour will give every possible assistance to the Government, but surely honorable senators opposite do not expect us to support the granting of almost unlimited powers to the Government in the present circumstances. The preamble to the bill states - </para>

                <para class="block">No attempt has been made to back up that statement. Under this measure, the Government will be able to close up any industry at will, without indicating to any one how or when it is to be done. I am confident that Government supporters have no more information than we have about the Government's intentions. When the federal executive of the Labour party decided that the Labour Opposition in the Senate should oppose the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, we were described as " yes-men ". Are Government supporters mere " yes-men " to-day? If not let them get up and tell us what the bill is all about. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite were " Yes-men " at one time ; now they are " No-men " ; and they are in no man's land, which is the proper place for them. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Padden)</inline> may know what this bill is all about, but honorable senators opposite do not know what it means. They speak of an oligarchy ruling the Labour party, but they are controlled by one man. If I am wrong, let any honorable senator opposite rise and say, " Here is the information that you want. We shall tell you why this is necessary". Not so long ago the Prime Minister said : " We do not want any socialist controls. We want free enterprise".  His  supporters immediately prshoed his words, and they have been repeating them for two years, but now apparently, it is a case of, " When father says turn we all turn ". The Prime Minister says that things are different. He cannot tell us why, but the mere fact that he says they are different is sufficient to convince his followers. If there is in fact a state of emergency in this country, why is the Parliament to go into recess? Why is it not to meet next week, the week a fter, and the week after that if necessary? There would then be no need to confer this wide power on the bureaucrats. Presumably, while the Parliament is in recess, should members of the Government consider this or that action to be necessary, they will take it by regulation. We shall not bo able to do anything about it except to move for the dis allowance of the regulation when the Parliament reassembles, and in the meantime, misery may have been caused to thousands of people. I am assuming, of course, that the Prime Minister really wants to bring the measure into operation. I have not a very high opinion of the right honorable gentleman's legal acumen, but I should be sorry to think he really believes this measure to be constitutional. I do not think anybody in this Parliament seriously considers that the bill would survive a challenge in the courts. If that is so, then what is the object of the bill ? I am inclined to believe that it has been introduced only so that the Prime Minister will be able to say to the people : " I put the measure on the statute-book, but it was declared to be invalid by the High Court". Already he has said to the people, " I tried to deal with the Communists. At first the Labour party would not allow me, but, of course, members of that party are allied with the Communists ". Presumably the right honorable gentleman does not suggest that the High Court, too, has Communist affiliations. If it is not his object to have this bill declared invalid by the High Court, he hopes to organize the whole of our economic resources and place them in the hands of a group of individuals. That is what has happened in the United States of America. According to a newspaper report that I read a couple of days ago, one of America's leading finance administrators said he was ashamed that a coterie of Americans had been able to corner the market in tin and so make a profit of Â£200,000,000 sterling in a few weeks at the expense of the great mass of the people of the United States of America. That is what will happen here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> has been accused of defending the Chamber of Manufactures, but have the manufacturers of this country not as much right as any one else to be defended? They are Australian citizens. How would any honorable senator opposite who is a business man engaged in the manufacture of some commodity, like some government official to say to him, " The production of these goods must stop. Your men are to be transferred ". </para>

                        <para>- They would be starved into going. I have too high a regard for some members of the Government to believe for one moment that they consider this legislation to he democratic. It could, if it became operative, lead to an increase of working hours. It could certainly enable the pegging of wages and it could result in the wiping out of small business men. Is the present state of our economy really a surprise to any member  of  this chamber? I have frequently warned the Senate that if the price of wool continued to rise, and our currency "was not revalued, the stability of our economy would be wrecked. What has happened? One of the main reasons why <inline font-style="italic">there</inline> is not enough milk to-day is that the man who grows the feed for the cows that produce the milk has found it more profitable to turn his attention to sheepraising. Why .should primary producers grow food when they can more profitably own a few sheep? I warned the Senate again and again that this would happen, but nobody would support me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> said, "Do not worry. The price of wool is falling". But it would not matter if the price of wool fell to nothing now, because graziers could sell their sheep and still finish with a profit. Government supporters must declare whether or not they have been converted to the doctrine of economic controls. Even the capitalist press, which has supported the Government parties consistently in the past, has attacked it on this issue. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> are reminding the people that members of the Government and their friends formerly asserted that private enterprise was infinitely preferable to bureaucratic control. If ever a bill was designed for the purpose of strangling private enterprise, it is this measure. </para>

                <para>This measure will have a terrific impact upon the business and manufacturing sections of the community. The manufacturers have been very shortsighted in their attitude to the Government's policy against revaluation of the Â£1. I know that many Australians, including some honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber whose names I shall not mention because they have discussed the subject with me privately, believe in the revaluation of the Â£1. Manufacturers would wholeheartedly support revaluation if they were not blind to their own interests. Why did they not realize that an alteration of the exchange rate would have enabled them to import raw materials more cheaply and would have intensified competition so that workers would have had to work harder ? Primary producers also failed to realize that they would benefit from revaluation because it would have enabled them to import agricultural machinery and other equipment at lower costs. They have neglected their own interests, and now they find that the very principles which they have espoused so faithfully are to be strangled. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, but at least honorable senators on this side of the chamber belong to a united political party. Every honorable senator and member of the House of Representatives, with the possible exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> knows very well that a great majority of members of the Liberal party was in favour of revaluation. But the political power of the Australian Country party was so strong that the Liberal party was not allowed to do as it wished. The tail wagged the dog. The value of Australian currency in relation to other currencies was already at a ridiculously low level when the Government considered the idea of revaluing the Â£1, and now it seems that it will be depreciated still further as the result of the establishment of a war economy under this measure. </para>

                <para>Provided that the Government is fair dinkum, the ultimate result of the operation of this legislation will be economic disaster. There is nothing to show that the prices of foodstuffs will be controlled by the Government under its terms. Therefore, the people will be able to buy less and less with their pegged incomes, the standard of living will decline, surplus stocks of unconsumed goods will be accumulated, unemployment will ensue,  and we shall find ourselves rushing along the road to depression. Personally, I do not believe that the Prime Minister imagines for a moment that this legislation, which will become an act very soon, will withstand a test in the High Court for even a quarter of an hour. It is a sham measure in exactly the same way as was the Communist Party Dissolution Act. The truth is that the Prime Minister did not want to fight the Communists, and  he  fully expected the Communist Party Dissolution Act to be declared invalid. If we had no Communists we should have no Liberals. That is  why  the Liberal party does not want to destroy communism. We  have  been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McMullin</inline> that a state of international crisis exists, that our situation is desperate and that, therefore, this bill must be enacted at once. I believe that the honorable gentleman is absolutely sincere. However, the Government maintains that nothing can be done about the Communists, who are intimately linked with the supposed crisis, until a referendum has been conducted. The Government cannot have it.  both  ways, and I suggest that the Minister for Trade and  Customs  should discard all subterfuges and tell the Senate what it really has in mind. If we cannot be trusted, it is an insult to us to entrust bureaucrats and members of the Executive with the whole security of the nation. Under the terms of the bill, such persons will be empowered to do as they like. </para>
                <para>I am opposed to the measure, lock, stock and barrel. It will not stem the tide of inflation, but in fact, will increase the  flood.  The Government has produced no plan to combat inflation, and it will get nowhere by trying to plug leaks in our economy here and there while the floodgates are open. In any case, it has delayed action too long, as I predicted that it would do a year ago. There is an old Scottish saying, "You're aye a day ahin' the fair ", which means, " You're always a day late in bringing your eggs to market ". That is true of the Government. A year ago I said that the inflationary trend was so great that Australia even then needed a war economy and war regulations to pull itself out of the mess. I still hold that belief, but I want to know exactly what sort of regulations will be promulgated. My objection to the bill is not that I am opposed to controls. I merely want to know categorically what those controls will be. As a democratically elected representative of the people, I refuse to bow myself out of this Parliament to-night without having raised my voice inprotest, because we shall probably re-assemble next October to find that the bureaucrats, whom honorable senators opposite have so often bitterly criticized, havedone incalculable and irreparable damage to the economy. </para>
                <para>Government supporters have said that the Opposition is dominated by an oligarchy. I hope that they will not allow themselves to be dominated now and will join with usin saying, "If a state of national emergency does exist, we want to know exactly what the Government proposes to do about it". If the Government can prove to methat Russia is so dangerous to the rest of the world that we need controls for the benefit of the nation, I shall be the first to support itsproposals. But, in the absence of any information about its plans and without knowing who will direct them, which industries will be closed and what men will he dismissed from their jobs, I cannot vote for a measure such as the bill that we are now considering. It has neither beginning nor end. It is the " open sesame ", which will permit bureaucrats to do as they wish, with or without the approval of the democratically elected representatives of the people. </para>

                    <para>. -  I shall be brief because it is inevitable that, as a debate on a bill of this nature progresses, speeches must become increasingly repetitive. I shall content myself with trying to proveto the Opposition that there is a need for this measure. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> that the Government's proposals should be considered most carefully. Having examined it thoroughly, I am of opinion that it is not only necessary but also long overdue. The Government is responsible for ensuring that Australia shall be ready to go to war if, unfortunately, the necessity to fight should be forced upon us.  If  the decision to wage war  rested with us, of course there would be no need for this bill. But such decisions will be made, not in Australia, but on the other side of the world. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> has already pointed out, acute tension exists in Persia to-day. if, unfortunately, some person committed an irresponsible act in that country, such as shooting a Persian national, the whole world may be plunged into war within a short period. Must we wait until the world is precipitated into another conflict before we prepare this country's defences ? I venture to say that at the present time Australia is illprepared. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> asserted that this bill is a smoke-screen, designed to divert the attention of the people of this country from other subjects. I should like to remind the honorable senator that it is not so long ago that an act of aggression far more serious than could be any act of Parliament was perpetrated. I wonder whether the people in the United States of America thought on the night before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour that by breakfast time next morning the American nation would be at war with Japan. Can we not derive a lesson from what happened on that occasion? Must we wait until an enemy power bombs one of our cities before we take steps to gear this country for war? Has the honorable senator forgotten the morning when the people of Australia were stung by the news that <inline font-style="italic">Prince of Wales</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Repulse</inline> had been sunk? Although I have not been consulted about my view on this matter, I firmly believe that it is the recollection of those tragic happenings that has prompted the Government to bring down this measure, in order to obtain from the Parliament power to do certain things to place this country on a wai- footing. </para>

                <para>I shall endeavour to prove the truth of my contention that we are ill-prepared for war. I was closely connected with the transport industry in Western Australia during my association with the Western Australian Government. When the McLarty-Watts Government came to office in that State in February, 1947, I recommended to that Government that it should appoint a royal commission to inquire into various aspects of the Western Australian Government Rail- ways. A royal commission was appointed towards the end of 1947. It found that the railways service of Western Australia was. on the verge of a total breakdown. Despite strenuous efforts by the Railways Commissioner and the Western Australian Government it was not possible to rectify the position, principally because steel rails were unobtainable. Orders were placed for additional locomotives and railway wagons- </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator who has just interjected does not mind, I should prefer to make my own speech. Efforts were made unsuccessfully to obtain steel rails from abroad. I mention these facts in order to show that unless the Australian Government is given power to direct steel manufacturers to roll rails, it will be impossible to repair our neglected rail systems to make them serviceable for war-time traffic and carriage of goods. For that reason alone the introduction of this bill is justified. Although I shall not refer to the difficulties confronting the railway systems in other States, it is well known that there has been a tremendous increase of transportation by road in recent years. The deficiencies in our railway systems could not be rectified in a day or two. It may interest honorable senators opposite to learn that in order to make good a certain section of a railway line in Western Australia, it became necessary to pull up a section of lightly used track elsewhere  in  order to obtain the necessary rails. </para>

                <para>Little difficulty arises in connexion with the production of coal in Western Australia. Recently, the production of the Collie coal-fields has been increased, and a minimum of trouble is experienced by the management. About 5 miles of track is needed to provide new shuntingyards, but efforts for the last three years to obtain the steel rails have been unsuccessful. When this measure becomes law, the Government will have the power to direct the turning out of the urgently needed steel rails. </para>
                <para>Several honorable senators of the Opposition have asked what the Government is doing to .increase our food production. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> rightly stated that food supplies are vital to defence. The authorities in Western Australia have been trying more or less unsuccessfully to increase the production of food in that State. At present, an area of about 1,000,000 acres of land is being cleared in Western Australia for the purpose of establishing about 2,000 dairy farms. However, difficulties have been encountered. It will not be possible to bring those farms, into production until adequate supplies of superphosphate are available and wire fences erected. In addition, galvanized piping will be needed for the installation of water services, and a considerable quantity of farm machinery will be required. The Government of Western Australia has been unable to obtain any appreciable quantity of those commodities. The principal reason for the shortages of wire, galvanized piping, and farm implements is that the works of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited arÂ° operating at only 60 per cent, capacity because of the Communist influence in the coal industry. It is entirely true to say that the Communists are also holding up food production in this country. In addition to being unable to obtain new materials for the purpose that I have already mentioned, difficulty is being experienced in obtaining supplies to maintain existing food-producing installations. </para>
                <para>When I was addressing the Senate during the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply I mentioned that two ploughs had been sold in Western Australia for Â£600 each; the new price is Â£200. So desperate are the needs of the farmers, and so eager are they to increase production, that fantastic prices are being paid for almost any type of farming machinery available. The establishment of an additional 2,000 dairy farms in Western Australia must ultimately reduce the cost of dairy produce. Furthermore, the inability of farmers at present engaged in the industry to obtain supplies of commodities essential for the maintenance of extensions has been responsible for a tremendous increase of prices. </para>
                <para>No  doubt honorable senators have read such statements in the newspapers recently as, " Owing to the decline of dairying we may have to stop the export of butter to Great Britain ". What a shocking state of affairs! We should hang our heads in shame when we realize that, through our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of the commodities that I have mentioned, we may have to curtail or even suspend entirely the export of foodstuffs to Great Britain to ease the burdens of the noble people of that country who suffered untold agonies during World War II. I emphasize again that the Government requires the power sought in order to be able to direct the manufacturers of steel to produce commodities  urgently needed to prosecute our war effort. Honorable senators opposite may ask why it is not possible for the Government to obtain from Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited sufficient quantities of the commodities to which I have referred. I point out that the company has a moral obligation to meet thedemands of individual clients who have been good customers. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited has always done its best to meet the requirements of Western Australia. But it is necessary to have an authority which can determine the most important industries and supply them with what materials are available. When this bill is passed the Government will be able to take that action. It will be able to take charge of the situation and direct the steel to those industries that are vital to our war needs. </para>
                <para>The supply of water is another matter about which Western Australia is vitally concerned. During the last war, when it seemed possible that the enemy would try to land on the coast of Australia, a hurried survey was made of the southwest portion of Western Australia between the Darling Range and the coast in order to ascertain whether the people who inhabited that region could be moved away from the coast if a landing took place there. It was found that if those people had been moved inland there would only have been sufficient water for 30 per cent, of them. The State Government is now in the process of laying down two big water schemes in order to bring water from the coastal hill areas to the inland towns. About 20 miles of pipe have been laid from each end of one scheme and. about another 50 miles have to be laid. But the government cannot obtain pipes. Lt obtained a certain amount of steel from Japan at Â£97 a ton. Australian steel, which was the best and cheapest on the market before the war, costs about Â£25 a ton. At the mention of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited every Australian should hold his head high. It is one of the finest companies in the world. Is it not time that the Government had authority to direct the requirements of war industries into the proper channels ? </para>

                <para>Some honorable members in another  place  have taken a great dislike to the issue of regulations. I am not very keen on that principle myself but some special action is required in a matter of this kind. If Parliament should be in recess when an emergency arises should the Government wait to call Parliament together before it takes any action ? I should like it to be possible for regulations to be withheld until sanctioned by Parliament but such a course would not be possible. The Government must have power to bring regulations into effect immediately it considers them to be necessary. I recollect that some years ago the Leader of the Labour party in another place introduced a measure which provided for the issue of regulations which did not have to be submitted for parliamentary approval. They merely had to be circulated. Regulations issued under this bill can be disallowed in the usual way when Parliament meets if it should not be in session when the regulations are issued. </para>
                <para>I congratulate the Government on this bill. I arn perfectly certain that the Government recognizes its responsibilities and I. aru also certain that it will .not issue a whole sheaf of regulations, as honorable senators opposite have suggested, in order to bring every industry under control. It will be necessary to control supplies of steel and it will be necessary to take action in. regard to superphosphate works. Because American supplies of sulphur are becoming exhausted Australia cannot obtain supplies from that country. If Western Australia is not able to obtain superphosphate ite agricultural production will come to an. end. It will be necessary for the Government to take action in relation to supplies of steel and sulphur as quickly as possible. If Australia, has to depend on overseas supplies of materials such as these it may find itself without them in the event of war. I have much pleasure in supporting the bill and I hope that it will not be long before the necessary directions will be given to divert essential materials into the channels in which they are most needed. </para>

                        twitted honorable senators on this side of the House with supporting big business because they had spoken against Ibis bill. The bill will create in Australia the cartels that are known in countries such as America and will operate to the detriment of smaller businesses. That is the objection of the Opposition to the bill. The honorable senator mentioned that Labour organizations have asked for a bill similar to this, but he failed to mention that they asked for definite powers, whereas the bill before the Senate is a nebulous affair. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber do not know what will happen if it becomes law. That is another ground nf objection to the measure.

                <para>An honorable senator on the opposite side of the chamber mentioned production during the course of this debate. I am of the opinion that distribution plays just as important a part in the economy of this country as production does. Yet the present Government is not trying to improve distribution in any way. If it desires power to do certain things, why does it not include the direction of shipping? When honorable senators on this side of the chamber ask questions concerning the shortage of shipping facilities, they arn told by the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> that the Government proposes to sell the Commonwealth line of ships. Would it not lie hotter to direct those ships into avenues where they can be used to improve the distribution of essential commodities? If some of them were transferred to the Tas- manian  run, that State could supply products which would be very welcome on the mainland. </para>
                <para>The bill before the Senate is a somewhat ridiculous one and I have no doubt that it has produced heartburnings on the part of some, honorable senators opposite.. </para>

                        <para>- I can see by their faces that honorable senators opposite are happy, but are they happy when their leader gives a command and they are obliged to spring to attention? The Government parties are pledged to a policy of no control of private enterprise, except, of course, when such control is beneficial to private enterprise. Socialization i.= supposed to be a word that is hateful to them. Yet, no sooner are they in office than they introduce more socialist legislation than was dreamed of by the Labour governments. I admit that the socialist measures introduced by this Government spring from political motives and are designed to assist private enterprise. The Government hopes that their introduction will not lead in the end to a socialist state. Every time a measure such a3 this is introduced, particularly when introduced by this Government, I am reminded of the history that I once learnt and of Disraeli's " leap in the dark " when he introduced legislation that was designed to placate his supporters and to enable his government to remain in power. I suggest that that is what this Government is doing at the present time. It is leaping about in the dark in the hope that a! least one of its pieces of legislation will 3ee the light of day. It has no objective. Its outlook is confined to the <inline font-style="italic">status quo.</inline> It dodges hither and thither trying to fool the people so that it will be permitted to remain in office. </para>

                        <para>- My reply to the honorable senator is that it is also getting better for the forces in Korea. Copies of a draft Japanese peace -treaty have been circulated in this chamber to-day, and I remind honorable senators that negotiations for peace in Korea are taking place. If any statesmanship is shown during those negotiations and the militaristic outlook is dropped, peace will be assured in that unfortunate country. World conditions are brightening, and I hope that effective action by the United Nations will mean that they will continue to do so. The militaristic outlook that is so often displayed reminds me of small boys playing with guns : sooner or later they will fire them. Why does the Opposition oppose this bill? </para>

                        <para>- I shall enlighten the honorable senator if he will listen to what I have to say. First, the members of the Opposition object to the form of blanket control which the Government seeks. The Government apparently cannot make up its mind what it is that it really wants. If it can, it should state specifically the matters that it wishes to control. Those matters have not been disclosed, but the Government still wishes the Opposition to trust it. One of the reasons why the Opposition does not trust the Government is that the Government parties are subject to a dictatorship. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has stated, those parties are controlled by one man. The individual members do not have any voice in the policy of those parties. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will find that conscription of labour "is a very real fear in the minds of the people. Another reason why we oppose this bill is that it will mean a new black market enterprise in companies. Another reason is that there will be so much lobbying in the precincts of this chamber that the Senate bells will have to be rung at least ten minutes before the meeting time each day so as to enable honorable senators to force their way through the lobbyists who will be in the passageways. The Prime Minister has stifled the criticism of his followers, except the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bland).</inline> I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> will not be similarly stifled. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> stifled criticism by saying that he would use " very sparingly " the powers that are to be given to him under the measure. Why does the Government want these powers if it intends to use them "very sparingly". If the <inline font-style="italic">bill</inline> is justified by the present international position, then this is no time for using its powers sparingly. But the Prime Minister told his supporters that only in order .to placate them. Should a state of emergency arise the Government already has powers that it can use. But if the Government intends to fiddle with defence preparations and not go all-out in the war emergency which it claims now exists, then the bill is unnecessary. If the bill is really necessary, then, I repeat, the Government should go full steam ahead. The Prime Minister has assured his followers that there will be very little interference with private enterprise and so has regained their confidence. Many Government supporters were strongly opposed to the bill when it was introduced but the Prime Minister won them to his side by that assurance. Under this bill we shall see economic conscription of labour. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> has claimed that the Government is the champion of labour, we all know that its whole attitude to both manual and white collar workers is one of hostility and suppression. </para>

But we have the numbers to provide a tremendous air force. It would be to the benefit of Australia if we concentrated on our air defences and developed a mobile air force that could be used around Australia at short notice, and could also be developed to tremendous proportions. Instead of that we fool about, building a couple of ships that will not be of much value, although when I make that statement I do not intend to speak  derogatively  of the men who man our naval vessels. In time of war, warships are not of great value to us, and we could expend the money that is used to build them to better effect on a great air force. </para>

The Government must make sure that it uses the correct factories to produce the goods that are needed. The powers sought in this bill will be of little value to the Government in its plans for strengthening our defences because Government supporters generally are not wholly behind the proposal and will not allow the controls to operate to the detriment of those who have elected them to this Parliament. Honorable senators opposite are afraid of government by regulation, and they fear the effects of this measure upon the vested interests that sent them here.

During the discussions  that ensued many questions were asked and satisfactorily answered and honorable members and senators left the meeting perfectly satisfied that it should be placed upon the statute-book without delay so as to enable tha Government to prepare the defences of this country against the contingency of war. Do honorable senators opposite suggest that we should sit back and allow the Communists to take "control of this country? The Government is aware of its responsibilities; it, docs not like to impose controls, but in the circumstances that now exist it has no option but to do so. </para>

                    has stated that this bill will empower the Government to direct labour at will. That is not so. Clause 4 (3.) specifically precludes the making of regulations for or in relation to the compulsory direction of labour. If, as the result of unpreparedness, this country were overrun by  an enemy, honorable senators opposite would say, " We knew that this would happen as a result of the administration of a 'do nothing' Government ". This measure will be passed by the Senate after Opposition senators have talked themselves dry. The strengthening of the defences of this country will be costly and the expenditure of money for that purpose must inevitably have an inflationary effect. If we expend a large sum of money and employ large numbers of men on the production of commodities essential to war preparations we must have power to divert those commodities into the proper channels. The bill specifically states that we must increase our production of food, as well as our production of armaments.
                </para>
                <para>Because Communists control some of our major industries, the farmers are not getting supplies of materials that they need in order to keep up our food production. For instance, wire netting is almost unavailable, and what there is of it has to be imported. Because the countries from which such supplies are now imported are putting into effect their own defence preparations plans, such sources of materials are gradually being closed to us. Therefore, we must increase our own production. If the Government were to expend millions on defence preparations without providing some sort of control, inflation and luxury spending would be come worse. Therefore, much as this Government dislikes to do so, it mast institute some controls so that certain manufacturers may be made to realize that they cannot continue the manufacture of luxury articles and will have to swing their factories into the production of essential goods. That will mean that a priority system will have to be evolved which will divert into certain channels goods that are necessary for the defence production of the country.

Under the provisions of this measure it will be possible for supplies of steel to be withheld from the manufacture of luxury goods and diverted to the manufacture of motors, armaments and other defence items. The people must be conditioned to this measure. When introduced, the bill had a hostile reception from many quarters including the Opposition.

                <para>It has been interesting to listen to the arguments advanced in support of the Government's contention that the defences of this country must be strengthened.

But that Government, in making preparations for defence, did not disrupt our economy. It was entrusted with the task of building an army and a navy, and later an air force, for the defence of Australia, but it did not introduce legislation of this kind, by which the economy of the nation is threatened. When this bill becomes law, no Australian industry will have any hope for the future or any assurance that it will not be forced out of existence. The bureaucrats who will administer the measure will have, so to speak, power of life or death over the nation's economy while the Parliament is not sitting. When the Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was called upon to establish an adequate defence system in Australia, it performed that task in an ordered manner. </para>

                <para>Despite the ridicule to which it was subjected by the1 anti-Labour parties, which were then the Opposition in this Parliament, it raised an army and built ships. Its task was much more difficult than is that of the present Government. </para>
                <para>The Prime Minister, in the course of the speech upon this bill that he delivered in the House of Representatives, said that steps had already been taken to increase the size of our army. This Government sponsored the legislation under which the defence of Australia will be entrusted to lads of eighteen years of age. Mere lads are to be called to the Colours. The Government has stressed the necessity to develop Australian industries, but I read in to-day's press that apprentices and other young employees in our most vital industries will be called to the Colours under the national training scheme. Is that the way in which to organize our  economy for the defence of the nation? Does the Government realize the difficulties that lie in the way of establishing an adequate system of defence in a country of approximately 8,000,000 people? The Government deplores the fact that it is almost impossible to obtain labour for some essential industries, yet it proposes to take from those industries a great labour potential by calling up young workers. I cannot understand its attitude. It has introduced measures designed to thwart the activities of Communists in this country, but the brand of communism or totalitarianism is imprinted on this measure. That is clear to anybody who has studied the development of the Russian economy from the time of the revolution to the present day. The Government proposes, through regulations administered by bureaucrats, to push the people about. The Prime Minister has said that industries cannot be developed, or national works undertaken, without the permission of the Government. Is that not what the Russian Government did? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> pointed out that the Russians had transported thousands of men and women from the satellite States into the heart of Russia to use them as slave labour. Now, this Government, which is loud in its protestations against communism, is proposing to direct labour in the same way as the Russians have done. If there are Soviet agents and saboteurs in Australia they must be gratified to see that a government, which is supposed to be the champion of free enterprise, is busy preparing the people to live under totalitarian conditions. Nothing of the kind has ever before happened in a democratic country. </para>
                <para>The Government's proposals will come as a rude shock to those persons who, not so long ago, assembled in Melbourne and decided to contribute thousands of pounds to a fund to bring about the defeat of the Labour Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley.</inline> I know that many of the manufacturers resented being called upon to contribute, but they were told that if the economy of the country was to expand as it should, it was necessary that the Labour Government be defeated. </para>
                <para>Before the war, many Australian industries were being pushed to the wall, but under the sympathetic administration of a Labour government their fortunes were restored. Therefore, the men in control of them were reluctant to contribute to Liberal party funds for the defeat of Labour, but under pressure from the organization they did so. They were told, and came to believe, that the present Government would remove economic controls. They looked forward to the opening up of new markets, and to opportunities to exploit the national prosperity that had been made possible because of full employment under a Labour government. </para>
                <para>Now, this Government is reversing its policy, and proposes to restore economic controls, but it is doing so in peace-time. The Labour Government introduced controls, but that was in war-time when controls were necessary. During the election campaign of 1949, the antiLabour parties told the people that if they were returned to power trade would be freed from restrictions, and private enterprise, given free play, would bring about a reduction of prices, thus restoring value to the Â£1. This afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> spoke of full production as a panacea for all our economic ills, but will it be possible to obtain full production under the system of controls which the Government proposes to institute? All of us are aware that inflation is caused when goods arc in short supply and, at the same time, there is a superabundance of purchasing power in the community. Does the Government propose to increase production under this measure and to make available to the people consumer goods that are in short supply ? Certainly not. Under the bill the Government will place into the hands of a small section, the bureaucrats whom honorable senators opposite so roundly condemn, power to decide what commodities shall be produced, who shall produce them and where they shall be produced. </para>
                <para>During the general election campaign in 1949 supporters of the Government parties talked about the direction of labour and claimed that Labour stood for the conscription o* labour. They urged the people to return a non-Labour Government in order that the worker would enjoy freedom to choose his job. It was as a result of the administration of the Curtin and Chifley Labour Governments that the workers were enabled for the first time in the history of this country to select their own jobs. To-day, in spite of the fact that a non-Labour government was returned to office in 1949, the workers still enjoy that right; but they do so solely because of the wonderful development that was achieved in Australia under Labour governments. If the truth were told it would be shown that the Government has introduced this measure for the purpose of regimenting the workers once again. </para>

                        <para>- The main purpose of the measure is to enable the Government to direct labour into certain channels because a good deal of resentment is felt against the workers who are now enjoying the fruits of Labour administration, including the right to select their own jobs. I am fortified in that belief by the three principal measures that have come before the Senate during the current week. I point ou t to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that if the Government, by regulations which it will be empowered to make under this measure, closes down certain industries, the workers employed in such industries will be obliged to seek employment in other industries. Although the Prime Minister contends that the Government does not propose under this measure to conscript labour for industry or for the Army, or to raise compulsory loans, the fact remains that once the bill has been passed and regulations have been issued under it to close down certain industries, the Government will have imposed conscription of labour indirectly. </para>

                <para>The manufacturers must view this measure with apprehension. I am not astonished that the Director of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures has expressed grave doubts about the advisability of the Parliament passing it. Such doubts are shared by eminent men in the community. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bland),</inline> who is a member of the Liberal party, has expressed grave- suspicions about the measure. I believe that leading nien in all walks of life in the community secretly entertain similar suspicions and are hoping that after it becomes law it will be successfully challenged in the High Court. If the Government really believes that these proposals are necessary, one naturally concludes that it will submit them to the people at a referendum in order to have the measure written into the Constitution. However, the Government is hardly likely to do that sort of thing because it must realize that it would not be able on such  an issue to work u p fears . of some foreign power as it obviously hopes to do when it submits its proposal to ban the Communist party to the people at the referendum that is to be held in the near future. </para>
                <para>I believe that if this measure fails to withstand challenge in the High Court, the Government will drop it. </para>
                <para class="block">Therefore, in view of the importance that the Government attributes to the bill, I should like to know what it intends to do in such circumstances. Has it any alternative proposition, to place before the Parliament on the ground that Australia is in danger of invasion, that some foreign power is lurking in the shadows close to our shores? We have heard nothing from honorable senators opposite about such an alternative. At present, they are obsessed with the desire to obtain power to coerce the people and to bend them to the will of the Government. Members of the anti-Labour parties accuse us of being socialists, but I warn them that the passage of this bill will bring great joy to the hearts of the ardentsocialists, because it will do everything that Labour has been accused of wanting to do. Under the bill the Government will be able to direct labour and to exercise all the controls that are necessary to planned economy. Could anything be more totalitarian than this measure? Talk about commissars and about bureaucracy ! </para>

                and other organs of the capitalist press to the effect that the Government proposes to obtain from the Governor-General in Adelaide next Monday assent to certain bills, including this measure and another measure to increase the number of Ministers. It was inferred that the measure to increase the membership of the Ministry was to be passed by the Parliament and then taken to Adelaide. However, another report stated that the Government might keep the Senate in session until next Tuesday. Unfortunately, I do not know which report is correct.

                    <para>- The Opposition is so concerned about this measure that it may well prove to be necessary, if it passed, for the Government to take it to Perth to receive the Royal assent because we are prepared to do everything possible to prevent it from being passed. Why do we adopt that attitude, and why are we still meeting in this chamber at this hour to-night? I shall tell honorable senators opposite why. The reason is that this bill vests total power in the Executive and in minor officials, and that  it can interfere greatly with the whole of our economic activities. No section of the community is likely to escape the meshes of this legislation. All property rights will disappear under the powers that are to be conferred upon the Executive. Businesses may be destroyed by the issue of regulations. Capital that has been invested in businesses established since the last war may be quickly lost. The .primary producers will not be immune from the reach of this legislation. Because we detest such powers as are implied in this bill we have decided to fight the measure to the very last and it will not matter to us whether we sit tonight, to-morrow night, or next week. We assert that this bill should not become law at the present time and that if thu Government had the will and the desire to do the right thing it could deal with economic problems and prepare our defences as the Labour Government did without introducing a new law that will only strengthen the authority of the bureaucrats. We shall oppose this bill with all our might. I believe that when the people understand its provisions they will realize the great wrong that they did and the great mistake that they made in 1949 and again a few months ago by succumbing to a fear complex and by voting against Labour and placing in office an administration that has proved itself to be incapable of directing this country along the right road. </para>

                    TATE  (New South Wales)  1  11.13 ). - J was interested to hear
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline>
                    say that, until

                    say that there was likely to be a war. That statement of the honorable senator astonished me greatly because in between a number of irrelevant references he mentioned some historical events.  His  knowledge of history should have taught him that there is always a possibility of war. In fact, Clauswitz said that the period of peace between wars was merely a period in which to make preparation for war. I regret that such is the case. That is not my opinion, it is the verdict of history. Time has proved that that is what hap pens. We believe that the period between World War II. and the next world war will be shorter than was the period between World War I. and World War II. Our chance of averting a third world war lies in several courses of action. There is a possibility that the United Nations, if it is properly supported, will be able to give effect to the desire of the ordinary people of the world for peace. Until this objective has been achieved the strengthening of the war potention of the nations ou this side of the Iron Curtain is essential.

                    has said that we arepreparing our defences although war is not a reality. I remind the honorable senator that war does not commence at a given date in these modern times. International tension works up to a point at which armed clashes occur. War docs not begin spontaneously but commencesslowly. If any honorable senator requiresan assurance that all the portents of war are not already visible, he does not read the newspapers or the reports of the proceedings of the United Nations. He does not take notice of attempts between the nations to get together on the highest levels, and he ignores facts that are known to schoolboys.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline>
                    complained that the Government, by exercising its authority under this bill, will be able to close some industries and that workers will be obliged to seek other ' jobs. I point out that men move continuously from one industry to another. I ask him whether he imagines that there will be only one industry after this legislation has been in operation for some time. Even if some power is exercised in the interests of the country, there will be thousands of industries and many thousands of jobs. Employment conditionswill be much the same as they are at present. The idea that there will be only one employer is quite absurd. In any event, such a condition in the form in which he suggested is precluded by the provisions of the bill, which are most specific.
                </para>
                <para>The world is divided into two campsAustralia is allied with the United States of America and the members of the British Commonwealth, all of whom are taking steps to prepare their defences. They are exchanging views,  technical personnel, materials, equipment, and  know-how on the military, commercial and manufacturing levels. Action which we are taking is similar to action that has already been taken by our friends. One. of the recitals in the preamble of the bill reads as follows: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>And whereas, in the opinion of the Parliament and of the Government of the Commonwealth, there exists a state of international emergency. . . . </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Even allowing that newspapers may colour the situation a little, one no doubt that an international emergency exists. I do not think that any sane member of the community, and certainly not the honorable senator if he consults his soul, can say, " I do not believe that an international crisis exists ". A state of tension certainly exists throughout the world. War is in progress now. It is only a question of degree. The Government has come to the conclusion, with very sound reasons, that the degree of war that has been reached warrants thorough defence preparations. Who wants to be caught in a defenceless condition? Preparations for modern war take time. They cannot be completed overnight. Time is the greatest factor. All those who have studied military strategy agree that the element of surprise yields the most advantage, if it can be used successfully. We do not propose to leave Australia in a condition in which it can be surprised on the naval, military, air or civilian fronts. To-day, there are four services that fight in a war. There is a civilian front as well as a fighting front, and on neither of those fronts should we be caught unprepared. </para>
                <para class="block">The preamble of the bill also states - </para>

                <para class="block">This country has known droughts. Surely the lesson of a drought is that we must prepare for droughts. Other countries suffer from blizzards, and must be prepared for them. The droughts and blizzards of war will strike at the civil population and completely disrupt our war effort unless we are prepared. It has been said by no less an authority than Field-Marshal <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bernard</inline></para>
                <para class="block">Montgomery that the role of the army in any future war will largely be to care for the civil population. An army in these days does not consist merely of a few mercenaries fighting at a front line. A total war is a battle between nations. Care of the civil population in war-time mattered little 150 years ago as long as the soldiers at the front were adequately fed. Napoleon truly said, " An army marches on its stomach ". So too, a nation marches and fights on its stomach. One .purpose of this measure is to ensure that the people of this country should be fed and cared for should war come. </para>

                    <para>And whereas in present circumstances the defence preparations mentioned in the preceding paragraphs cannot bc carried out without the diversion of certain of the resources of Australia (including money, materials and facilities) for use in, or in connexion with, defence preparations : </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">It is necessary that our resources should be used in proper priority, and that first things should be done first. That will be possible under the provisions of this bill. Reference is made later in the preamble to the avoidance or reduction of economic dislocation or instability caused by or impeding defence preparations. We hear much talk to-day about inflation. We should realize that, everywhere in the world, prices are rising because of preparations for war. That problem is much in evidence in this country, and we must do as our friends are doing in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. We must so order our community life as to ensure that available materials will bc used where they are most needed. By that means we can assist to check rising prices but I am afraid that as long as the pressure of war preparations continues, world prices will continue to rise. Inflation is a world problem. Australia is merely a segment of the circle, and the problem must be attacked in the whole circle, but it will not be solved completely until the pressure of war has been relieved either by the coming of war itself or by the arbitrament of the United Nations. </para>
                <para>This measure has been described as an authority to govern by regulation. I say without hesitation that any regulations under this measure will be scrutinized thoroughly by honorable senators on this side of the chamber. We are not committed to the acceptance of any specific regulation. This measure may be regarded as an insurance for the protection of the people. It will enable the Government, in certain circumstances, to promulgate regulations. We owe that to our allies who are taking the democratic path with us. I hate controls as every other man and woman in this country hates them, and I shall watch all regulations closely and judge each on its merits. Government by regulation is often convenient, but it should not be permitted unless there is a necessity for it. The onus will be on the Government to show that necessity exists for any regulations that it issues.

                <para class="block">The committee is authorized to obtain legal assistance and such assistance is given, not by departmental legal advisers, but by outside legal authorities chosen by the committee itself. For that purpose funds are provided to the committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> said that the bill would usher ina marvellous era of prosperity for monopolies, which would get all the big contracts. That is absolute nonsense. During World War II. I had a great deal to do with defence contracts and I can assure the Senate that they were not allocated to monopolies but were distributed equitably amongst firms both large and small. In any case, it would be impossible for a government to favour the monopolies. What are these monopolies about which the honorable senator talked so loosely? I wish that they could be named so that we could test his allegation. The Government is not concerned about the welfare of monopolies. Its sole interests are the welfare of the people and the preservation of the nation. Those are the subjects that monopolize its attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> as usual, delivered a homily on the management of men. One would think that honorable senators on this side of the chamber had never dealt with the workers. I have had dealings with every trade union that is associated with constructional work in Australia, and I have met thousands of unionists. I had the privilege to assist in the establishment of the Institute of Industrial Management, the purpose of which was to foster good relationships between employers and employees. 1 am connected with organizations that employ thousands of men but have never had a strike amongst their workers. We are not blind to the legitimate needs of the workers, and the honorable senator's attempt to lecture us was sheer effrontery. </para>
                <para>The strength of this bill lies in the fact that it gives the Government power to bring together all parties associated with the industries that are vital to our defence preparations. The trade unions, which have always played an important part in the defence of the nation, will not be excluded. Good results can be achieved by means of voluntary co-operative effort. Our experiences during World War II. proved that fact. Although the National Security Act and the regulations and orders that were issued under it provided war-time governments with sweeping  powers, it was often found unnecessary to invoke those powers. I always pin ray faith on co-operation in preference to coercion. This bill obviously foreshadows the necessity for deciding on priorities in industry. Fortunately, we can be guided by our experiences during World War II. We should know where we are going! Great care must be exercised in determining which industries should be relegated to the lowest categories in the order of priority. It would be easy to decide, for instance, that lipstick and face powder were not essential. But those items are of great importance to the morale of women, and that fact should not he ignored because morale is of the greatest importance. Therefore, we must ensure that the powers shall be exercised sympathetically. The Government has no intention of clumsily applying the axe to various sections of our economy. All the problems that are involved in the organization of the country for defence will be approached with the greatest possible care. </para>
                <para>The strongest arguments in favour of the bill have been adduced by members of the Opposition. I can only thank honorable senators opposite for providing the Government with the weapons with which to flay them. They "have talked continually about the declarations against the use of controls that were made on behalf of the present Government parties during the election campaign of  1949.  The clearest proof of the necessity for the enactment of this bill lies in the fact that the political parties which most abhor controls now believe that, in the light of the international situation, controls should be imposed for the good of the country. It is obvious that the Government would not make use of controls except under the greatest provocation. The Government, by virtue of its office, has a more intimate knowledge of the present international situation than has any other body in Australia. Therefore, it must be trusted. The operation of controls is fraught with difficulty, and honorable senators opposite may rest assured, that only the minimum number of restrictive measures will be applied. No widespread system of controls is envisaged. As each regulation is promulgated, the Government will sub mit to the Parliament ample evidence of the necessity for promulgating it. The bill provides an insurance policy against disaster. Time forgives none of us for its misuse. We do not want to be <inline font-style="italic">too</inline> late with too little again but, if we adopt the suggestions of the Opposition, we shall be too late and do nothing. I hope that as soon as possible after this measure becomes law we shall be able to get ready to meet the threat of war, although I trust that the overall application of powers provided in this bill will not become necessary. I am sure that we all hope that the parleys now taking place will result in international differences being resolved. However, until positive assurances and guarantees have been exchanged we must continue to develop the defences of this country. Our armed forces must be backed fully by a civil effort. This is necessary in obedience to the first law of life, which is self-preservation. The powers sought in this bill will be safe in the hands of this Government, which is to be congratulated for bringing down this measure. </para>

                    <para>, - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> has advanced reasons why the Opposition should agree to this measure. It is an amazing piece of legislation, having as its objective the placing of Australia on a war footing at a time of peace. The Government does not require defence powers additional to those provided in the Constitution. If it has not utilized those powers to the full it has been recreant to its duty and responsibility to the nation. Although Labour relinquished office at the end of  1949,  the anti-Labour Government has only now brought forward this measure. I have considerable doubt about the genuineness of its proposals. At the same time  .1  point out that the Labour party is second to none in matters relating to defence. Proof of this assertion lies in the fact that the majority of defence projects in this country have been launched during periods that Labour Governments have been in office. </para>

                    has pointed out that the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and other countries, are preparing for defence. Every country has   ti legitimate right to provide for the defence of its people, and it is the responsibility of the Australian Government to see that adequate preparation is made for (lie. defence of this country. But I remind the honorable senator that the countries to which he has referred have not altered their constitutions in order to do so. This bill seeks to alter the defence powers of the Commonwealth in a snide way. "We are not at war; in fact I understand that the peace treaty with Japan now awaits ratification by the Parliament. "We were Told several days ago that we are now at peace with both Germany and Italy. Every speech that has been made from Hie other side has been based on supposition. We all know that a prospective attacker is not concerned about niceties. "He does not wait until his victim has prepared his defences. I emphasize that it is the duty of the Government to see that Australia is adequately prepared for defence, within the limits of the existing defence power. It should not attempt to put this country on a totalitarian war footing at this stage. The Government i=i seeking power more complete than the  power  that was exercised by  Labour  governments during the period of World War II.
                </para>
                <para>I do not think it can be disputed that the Government is seeking in this bill to abrogate the authority of the Parliament and to remove from the elected representatives of the people responsibility for making decisions. Power is sought to enable somebody outside of the Parliament to issue regulations and determine what shall be done. In addition to trying to get round the existing defence laws, the Government is attempting to take away from the Parliament the authority with which it has been invested by the Constitution. The bill provides that a Minister may delegate authority to any person in any part of the Commonwealth of Australia in relation to the defence of this country and of other countries associated with Australia. In 1949, when the supporters of the present Government were in Opposition they definitely opposed the introduction of controls. They sought to gain the confidence of the people of this country by telling them that they would abolish bureaucracy by getting rid of the officials who were telling people what time they should go to bed and get up, and what sort of work they should do. What a remarkable change of front has taken place ! The opponents of Labour promised that they would relieve the overloaded Public Service, but they have failed to redeem that promise. This is a proposal to have the Parliament carry on its operations by proxy. That is a much worse state of affairs than that which applied during the war. Yet government by regulation is a principle which honorable gentlemen opposite said was anathema to them when they sought the suffrages of the people in 1949. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> indicated that there has been some change of opinion since 1949. The Government has not given any indication of any such change of opinion. It has not given this chamber any definite evidence that the country is approaching a state of war. Honorable senators were told some time ago that it will only be three years before a war will eventuate. Subsequently, they were told by somebody else that it was only a matter of two years. Nobody has said with whom the war will take place. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> said that Russia is our enemy. I should like him to state what authority he has for that assertion. 1 consider that this bill provides for the creation of bureaucrats and planners in excess- </para>

                        <para>- This bill provides for bureaucracy and planning <inline font-style="italic">in excelsis.</inline> Never before in the history of federation has any government, in peace-time, introduced legislation such as this. The bill provides that the Governor-General may make regulations for defence purposes. The Opposition does not object  to the Governor-General making regulations. That is a common-sense procedure. But the bill provides that the scope of the regulations shall be unlimited. It authorizes the issuing of regulations without limitation to effect the expansion of the capacity of industry to produce or manufacture goods, or to provide services for defence preparations, or to enable the economy of Australia to meet probable demands upon it in the event of war. That is a wide ambit of authority. What type of regulations will be made under this bill? What opinions have the members of the parties which support the Government expressed concering these unlimited powers? Honorable senators opposite have lauded this proposal. I do not think that many of them know what the bill contains. The issue of regulations in respect of the production of goods or the provision of services will involve the direction of labour despite the fact that it has been stated that such a power is beyond the scope of the bill. Secondary industry has expanded tremendously in recent years. Labour-saving machinery for housewives has been manufactured to a much greater extent than ever before. Refrigerators have been made available to the people. Are they essential or nonessential commodities? The authority which the Minister may delegate to any person under this bill will make it possible to close down an industry and that might result in many thousands of people losing their jobs. The cessation ofnon-essential production would result in considerable unemployment. </para>

                <para>There is no provision in this bill to make other work available to men who lose their jobs in an industry that has been closed down. Employees generally live in areas adjacent to the industry in which they work. If industries are closed down it will be necessary for workers to secure employment in industries that have been allowed to carry on, and those industries may be a considerable distance away from where the workers live. The bill provides that to meet probable demands upon our economy in the event of war, regulations may be made to divert and control resources including money, materials and facilities. That proposal will result in the control and direction of capital for invest ment. Perhaps the Commonwealth Bank Board, when it has been established, will decide the destiny of large and small industries. It could tell an industry that it cannot be financially accommodated any longer because it is not essential. Such a procedure could only result in the control and direction of capital for investment and the control and direction of essential housing materials.
