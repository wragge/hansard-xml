                    <quote>
                        <para>Can the Minister make available to the Senate a report on the progress made in the introduction of new methods of treatment of ex -servicemen suffering from war neurosis, and also inform the Senate what action has been taken to .transfer ex-servicemen who are patients in civil mental institutions to special repatriation hospitals? I need hardly remind the Minister that that is a matter in which I have been keenly interested for some time.  : At the time, I informed the honorable senator that I would inquire into the matter and supply an answer to him later. I now desire to state that there are two' phases of the honorable senator's question. The first is related to the progress made in the introduction of what the honorable senator refers to as new methods of treatment of ex-servicemen suffering from war neurosis. All estab lished world-wide methods of treatment are being applied to Repatriation Commission psychiatric patients. These include physical therapies, such as the various forms of shock therapy, and prefrontal leucotomy, which is a surgical operation for the relief of more serious types of mental disturbance. Various analytical procedures are also used, with or without the aid of special drugs, and hypnosis is also applied where indicated. Occupational therapy is employed and a scheme of educational therapy, designed to fit the patient for a more useful role in life, is also in operation. A social work department is available to help to ameliorate these pressures in the outside world which either mitigate against the patient's recovery or help to produce relapses. A follow-up system for handling psychiatric patients on discharge is available through out-patient clinics, which exist in every capita! city. The Repatriation Commission has encouraged the post-graduate training of doctors employed in a full time capacity within the repatriation medical service. The second phase is the action taken to transfer  ex-servicemen  who are patients in civil mental institutions, to special repatriation hospitals. The housing and treatment of all cases of certifiable neurosis not accepted as due to war service is the responsibility of the -State governments, and the Repatriation Commission has no say in or control of their treatment. Therefore, it is not proposed that the Australian Government should secure premises for their housing and treatment. This brings me to the housing and treatment of those men who are cared for by the Repatriation Commission because their incapacity is regarded as war-related. Most of the repatriation patients who are not now in repatriation blocks are housed in their present locations because their relative? desire them to be within reach so that they may visit them, or need closer restraint because of the nature of their' disabilities. However, there is a need fo: some additional accommodation which 1 should be glad to see provided, but this is a difficult .problem because of the necessity for the Government to restrict structural works seeing that the emphasis must, of necessity, be on domestic housing and defence undertakings. </para>

To a degree, this has been due to the reduced volume, and decline of value, of our exports of primary produce. The coming critical, internal, economic and food crisis will be the result of the Government's failure to put value back in to the £1. Will the Minister undertake that the Government shall direct its most vigorous and earnest attention to the launching of a call to the primary producers to put value into the ground? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think  that  the question can be answered in general terms. As the honorable senator knows, the total amount involved is between £9,000,000 and £10,000,000, which covers a great  number  of separate items of equipment. In my opinion, it would not be possible to lay down a general rule concerning valuation, because a great deal turns upon the condition of the particular item of plant and the amount of use which it has had. I have discussed the matter with the Joint Coal Board, which is confident that, by and large, the items of plant to be sold will realize more than they originally cost the Government. Appreciation of values has occurred, and much of the plant which has been bought is difficult to replace. Cabinet has decided to appoint a committee, consisting of representatives of the Joint Coal Board, the Department of National Development and of the Treasury, to lay down principles to govern the sales. The committee will keep in touch with the sales, and make such adjustment as are found necessary. It should be remembered that there will be a great number of . transactions, which will necessarily be spread over a period of a year or so. It is not practicable merely to ring a gong, and sell plant to the value of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000. There will be a whole series of transactions which will cover many items, some of them of considerable value. Each transaction will have to be carefully considered, bearing in mind the scarcity of such plant in this country, its availability from other sources, and the best place in which to use it in the national interest. Above all, it has to be borne in mind that the plant must be retained in the coal-mining industry, and used in the industry to the best advantage. </para>

                            <para>- In addition to plant for open-cut mining, some of the plant purchased for underground mining may be sold. I am sure that the Joint Coal Board will be glad to receive any advice and help which the Government of New South Wales may care to offer. It is not fair criticism to say that the State Government has not been consulted in tbis matter. It was not consulted when the plant was purchased. The Joint Coal Board decided what plant was wanted., and approached the Commonwealth Government for the necessary finance. Now, the procedure is being reversed. The Joint Coal Board believes that the time has come when contractors and proprietors may reasonably be expected to relieve the Commonwealth of its responsibility, and we are retracing our steps. Any assistance which the State Government or any one else can give to the Joint Coal Board will be appreciated, but the circumstances do not especially call for consultation with the State Government. </para>

Is it a fact that the quotas allotted to the various centres were under-subscribed by more than 50 per cent? Did the Government have to appeal to the insurance companies to fill the loan, or is a portion of the Government's expected surplus as provided in the budget to be used for that purpose, despite the fact that of the whole of the proceeds of the loan £27,000,000 is intended to be used for redemption purposes, leaving only £13,000,000 in new money? Is the instruction by the Government to the loan organization not to furnish information to members of the Parliament in regard to the loan, indicative of the Government's desire to cover up its loss of prestige and of the confidence of the people made apparent by the failure of the people to subscribe to the loan? Is the Government aware that the failure of the people to invest in the loan, and the provision of the major portion of the loan by financial institutions, will make a further contribution to the inflationary spiral that is destroying the Australian economy ? </para>

                            <para>During last summer, bean seed was scarce in Australia and prices rose to such high levels that some bean-growers in Victoria elected to save their crops for seed rather than to sell them as green beans. The season was favorable and hence a good crop was obtained. One firm bought approximately 5,000 bushels at a price which proved higher than the current market value and this firm's inability to sell at a profit has created the illusion that there is a surplus. As the demand for bean seed for autumn 1052 sowing in Queensland and northern New South Wales becomes felt, this apparent surplus will disappear and withintwelve months beans seed will once more' ba in short supply. </para>

                <para class="block">This protocol has been signed in London by representatives of the Governments of the Union of South 'Africa, Commonwealth of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, French Republic, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Hayti, Republic of the United States of Indonesia, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Republic of the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, United States of America, and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. This protocol is similar to that signed on the 31st August, 1950, and extends the International Sugar Agreement, which initially operated for five years from the 1st September, 1937, for a further period of one year to the 31st August, 1952. The protocol provides that certain articles of the original agreement, particularly those relating to export quotas, shall be inoperative. An important feature of the protocol is that countries signing it agree that revision of the original agreement is necessary, and should be undertaken as soon as the time appears opportune. The original agreement is to be taken as the starting point in any discussions of such revision. Discussions have been taking place between representatives of countries interested in recent months regarding the terms of a new agreement and further meetings are scheduled for the near future. </para>

                    <para class="block">Apart from amendments made in 1945 which provided a new system of promotions appeals and introduced employee representation at certain points in service administration, no substantial changes have been effected since 1922 in the machinery of control provided under the Public Service Act. Changed conditions, and especially the increased size and complexity of the Service, have confronted the Public Service Board with problems which cannot be handled satisfactorily under existing legislation. Pending the completion of a comprehensive review of the act, which will take some time, certain immediate amendments are necessary. Those amendments have the general purpose of better equipping the board to discharge its managerial functions. </para>
                    <para>The most importantamendments proposed are those relating to section 29, which deals with the creation and abolition of offices and the determination of salary classifications for those offices. Thebill does not change the present procedure for the creation and abolition of offices which are approved by the Governor-General, but will permit the board, after obtaining a report from the permanent head of the department concerned, to vary the salary classifications of offices as required. This will relieve the Executive Councilofa considerable volume of purely formal business and will place the board in the same position as other wage-fixing authorities in the Commonwealth. Thesecond amendment to this section will enable all positions of similar designation and classification , to be reclassified without requiring the positions to be declared vacant and the occupants to he individually promoted to them. The sections of the Public Service Act relating to payment of salaries 'have been simplified and consolidated. A new section is proposed to permit the board to determine, by notice published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> the conditions of advancement in certain categories of employment. At present those conditions are prescribed  in a schedule to the Public Service Regulations, but as they require frequent amendment and. affect only those officers in the positions concerned, it is considered that a more simple procedure is desirable. A similar change is proposed in the section dealing with advancement examinations. </para>
                    <para>Amendments proposed to the sections of the act dealing with leave of absence, other than annual recreation leave, will give the hoard more adequate powers in those matters. The provisions for leave of absence for defence service have been extended. A concession on furlough is proposed forofficers who are retiring with at least twenty years service. At present, furlough is granted only in respect of completed periods of five years' service but the new provision will enable service of more than twenty years to be calculated on an annual basis instead of on the five-yearly basis. A further amendment will permit the granting of recreation leave according to the period of actual service rendered during the year or years when furlough is taken. </para>
                    <para>Thebill proposes an amendment to section 84 to enable the board to make permanent appointmentsof ex-servicemen so long as it is satisfied, after medical examination, as to their state ofhealth. At presentthe decision as to appointment restsonthecertificateofthe medical practitioner and the amendmentwill give the board the same discretion italreadyhas in regard to entrants to the Service who are not ex-servicemen. All other suggestedamendments are intended to promote administrative efficiency in the managementof the Service. They will have no adverse effects on officers rights, but are found necessary in the course ofdealing with particular problems. Section 8a,for instance, will clarify , the board's power to exempt staff from the provisions of the Public Service Act, and to determineconditionsof employment for exempted staff. An amendment of section 21 will relieve the board of its impossible task of publishing a comprehensive staff list every year; instead, the board will publish lists as it thinks necessary, or whenever directed by the Prime Minister to do so. Provision is also made for additional promotions appeal committees to be created as need arises. A full explanation of all the amendments will be given at the committee stage. </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to remove certain anomalies which arise in the grantingof furlough to Commonwealth employees who have completed at least twenty years' continuous service and who  are not covered by the Public Service Act. A corresponding provision, relating to permanent officers of the Public Service is included in the Public Service Bill which has just been introduced into the Senate. Under existing conditions, a Commonwealth employee who has been employed continuously for at least twenty years may be granted furlough only in respect of each completed period of five years' .service. Thus an employee who has completed, say 24 years' service receives no greater benefit in furlough than -an employee who has completed only twenty years. The bill is designed to overcome these anomalies by providing instead for the grant of furlough in respect of each completed year of service, where the service exceeds twenty years. This "will ensure that the employee with service in excess of twenty years will receive a furlough benefit more appropriate to his length o'f service. The maximum entitlement of twelve months' furlough on full salary or its equivalent as provided in the act will still he maintained. The matter lias been under consideration for some time and it has been decided that -the new basis will have effect from the 1st January, 1951. The proposal is most reasonable and 1 commend the "bill to honorable senators. </para>

                <para class="block">This bill will amend the Customs Act L9O1-1950 so as to remove doubts of the validity of certain sections .and the regulations issued thereunder. </para>
                <para>Section 5 of -the act provides -that penalties referred to at the foot of sections indicate that any contravention of the section shall be an offence against the act. Since the legislation was enacted, references 'to penalties have "been included, in certain instances, at the f oot of sub-sections. As there is a doubt whether section 5 is 'applicable to these cases, it is proposed to amend the .section to provide for its application also to penalties -at the foot '©f Bulb-sections. This will 'bring -the section into line with section 41 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901-1950. </para>
                <para>The form of seal to be used by tile customs is specified in section 13 of the act, and was included in the original legislation of 1901. At that time -the seat of government was located in Melbourne. The seat of government was subsequently transferred to -Canberra, but the act makes no provision for a seal for use by the Comptroller-General of Customs at Canberra. The proposed amendment provides for a seal for the  Comptroller-General.  Consideration 'has been given to the advisability -of replacing the Royal arms on the seal by the Australian  coat-of-arms,  -which was proclaimed and gazetted in 1913. In view of the fact that the Australian Boatofarms w.as  instituted  foi- use on .all official occasions calling for the use of such a symbol, and that the Royal arms is changed on the accession of a new sovereign, thus rendering invalid all seals in use by the Department of Trade and Customs, it is appropriate -that the Australian coat-.of-arms should appear on all seals used ,by that department. </para>
                <para>An important amendment proposed in the bill relates to section 112, which authorizes the prohibition of exportation of goods from Australia. Certain regulations which provide for exportation contingent on the approval of either the Minister or a department were based on sub-sections of section 112, which at present require the exercise of an opinion expressed by the Governor-General. The Crown Law authorities feel that some regulations made under the section, as at present constituted, may be invalid. It is essential that the exportation of goods vital to the Australian economy should not be permitted to the detriment of our defence requirements and national economy. It is advisable, therefore, that the exportation of such .goods should be subject to either ministerial or departmental approval, as the case may be. </para>
                <para class="block">Accordingly, it is proposed to amend section 112 to provide for the prohibition by regulation of the exportation of goods. This is parallel with the provision which already exists in section 52 in relation to imported goods. As some time would elapse before new regulations could be prescribed under the proposed amendment, a clause has been included in the bill rendering valid all existing regulations which prohibit the exportation of goods from Australia. </para>
                <para>Section 112a imposes restrictions on the movement interstate of goods which are prohibited exports. The Crown Law authorities doubt whether regulations made under this section could be enforced, in view of the possible infringement of Section 92 of the Constitution. As regulations under section 112a have not, and will not be made, it is desirable that the section be repealed. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to give the force of law for a further year to a small number of surviving National Security Regulations and Orders, the operation of which, by virtue of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1946-50, would otherwise cease on the 31st December, 1951. While most of these regulations would no longer be needed except for transitional or winding-up purposes, the new exigencies of this period in connexion with the " cold war " and rearmament will, in some instances, make it undesirable to dispense at present with the surviving war-time provisions. This aspect of the bill finds expression in the third recital in the preamble. The majority of the regulations and orders that will be continued in force under this bill must eventually be placed permanently on the statute-book, and it is the intention of the Government to proceed progressively with this task. Some have been already dealt with during this year. It is hoped that certain bills which have been, or will be introduced during the present sessional period will remove the necessity for the continuance of other regulations and orders, which will thenbe repealed by Executive action. </para>
                    <para>The substance of the National Security (Industrial Property) Regulations will be incorporated in the revised Patents and Trade Marks legislation, on which the committee that was appointed by the Government is still working. It is essential, however, until permanent legislation is enacted to replace the regulations in this first category, that they should be continued in force so as to maintain the efficacy of action that was taken under them during the war period. For example, the National Security (War Deaths) Regulations provided a special procedure for presuming the death of a person who was missing as a result of enemy action. Those regulations will be continued, so that certificates that have been given under them in the past shall remain in full force and effect. Some other regulations will be continued for precisely the same reason. </para>
                    <para>As honorable senators know, the degree of control that was exercised over the civilian community during the war was extensive. There is still a residue of administrative business to be completed in connexion with some of those controls. Some regulations are being continued to enable small caretaker staffs to continue to dispose of matters which still arise as the result of war-time activities. For some years, the National Security (Apple and Pear Acquisition) Regulations have not permitted any new acquisition of fruit. However, until every claim in respect of the war-time acquisitions for compensation by fruit-growers in each of the six States has been determined, it will be necessary to continue the regulations in force. Only a small residue of claims still requires any administrative action, but the regulations must be continued in force so that those claims may be properly dealt with. The continuance of the activities of the Apple and Pear Board in relation to war-time marketing will also require the National Security (Staff of War-time Authorities) Regulations to be kept in force, as some of the small staff that is still employed on the administrative work of the board are employed in accordance with those regulations. </para>
                    <para>I should like to mention especially the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations, which relate to interest rates. Our expanding defence programme makes the control of interest rates essential, and those regulations are being continued in force not so much for the purpose of winding up affairs connected with the war, as for the purpose of dealing with a new and ever-increasing emergency. lL have mentioned certain regulations specifically, because they are exceptional. Perhaps in the same class could be placed the Jute Goods Order. On the whole, and subject to the exceptions to which I have referred, the regulations are being kept in force solely for the purpose of maintaining the force and effect of acts done during the war, and to regularize the residue of administrative work still to be done in connexion with the winding up of intense war-time activities. No new powers or provisions are sought, or are in issue. Insofar as the regulations and orders continued in force require to be embodied in permanent statutory form, the Government will push on with its task as quickly as possible. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Public Works Committee Act 1913-1947 to provide that members of the committee shall receive such allowances as are prescribed. At present the emoluments payable are fixed under the act. The disadvantage of this procedure is that when changing circumstances warrant an adjustment of the rate of allowance it is necessary to amend the act. In view of the difficulty in obtaining the passage of an amending bill on every occasion when an adjustment of the rates becomes necessary, the Government considers that the act should be amended to provide for payment of allowances at rates to be prescribed. </para>
                    <para>As it is expected that increases will be effected in the rates currently payable, it will be necessary to increase the annual appropriation. The limit of expenditure in any one year has, therefore, been increased from £3,500 to £5,000. I am sure that honorable senators will agree that prevailing conditions make the amendment necessary, and I commend the measure for their favorable consideration. </para>

                    <para class="block">The more important income tax proposals of the Government have already been discussed in this chamber in connexion with the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Bill which passed the second-reading stage a couple of weeks ago. That bill imposed the rates of tax and determined the general level of taxation for the current financial year 1951-52. The bill which I now present also deals with income tax, but is concerned with the basis of assessing the amount of income subject, to tax rather than with the' amount of tax payable on that income-. Ma'ny of the- provisions of the bill are complementary to the rates bill previously considered. Other provisions affect  the  basis of taxation of income derived from certain industries. </para>
                    <para>One important series of amendments is concerned with the basis of taxation of the mining industries in this country, particularly coal-mining. For many years, mining industries have been allowed deductions for capital' expended on necessary mining, plant and' the development of mining properties. Such allowances' are justified by the special circumstances s ut rmm ding the industries. The broad objective1 of this arrangement is to levy taxation, in the ultimate,- only on profits which are earned' over- and above thecapital invested and the working expenses. Although this objective has always been accepted as sound in principle, in actual practice it has been found' that in many instances the taxation machinery has not achieved' the desired ends.. </para>
                    <para>In order that an equitable basis of taxation of the mining industries might be designed, this subject was referred for examination by the Commonwealth Committee on- Taxation. In a valuable report which the committee has submitted and which was recently tabled in the House of Representatives, the committee has recommended several adjustments of the basis of taxation of mining industries. I do not propose, at this stage, to deal with all of the committee's recommendations, but there are two or three that I  should  specially mention. </para>
                    <para>Perhaps the most important of the committee's recommendations is that the coal-mining industry should be entitled to the same deductions- for capital expenditure as are other branches of the mining industries-. It' is an unexplained feature of our income tax law that capital invested <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> coal-mining has not been accorded the same treatment as is capital invested in- other forms1 of mining activity rn' this- country. Until the last year or so-, coal-owners have not pressed for this allowance but, in more recent times, projects for modernization of methods and for expansion of production, involving heavy expenditure of capital, have stressed, the need for an appropriate income tax deduction.. Honorable senators will appreciate,, on reading the reports, that the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation exhaustively examined this matter before coming to the conclusion: that there should be no discriminatory taxation treatment between, coalmining and other forms of mining. </para>
                    <para>These amendments will implement a recommendation made by the committee that the income tax deductions should be extended to capital expended on necessary plant and <inline font-style="italic">tm</inline> development of coal-mining properties.. This deduction, will not apply to past expenditure of capital in  coal mining.  It will commence to apply te capital expended in the current income year 1951-52. </para>
                    <para>Another important recommendation made by the committee relates to- capital expended on housing and) welfare of employees in the mining industries, and foi their dependants. The committee has- recognized,, and I. am sure' that honorable senators; will agree, that, as a general rule', capital expenditure on housing and amenities on. or adjacent, to mining areas is lost when the' mineral deposit is&gt; exhausted. Far the moat part, mining areas are remote from the1 cities and major towns-. If  labour  is to be. attracted to and retained in the mining industries, adequate accommodation and amenities must be provided for employees and their families. On- modern- standards, expenditure- of this nature is an inescapable commitment if the mining industries, including the coalmining industry, are to be conducted efficiently and if production is to be expanded. The deduction for this type of capital expenditure will be allowed in annual instalments over the estimated life of the mine'.. If, however, the estimated life of a mine is longer than 25 years,, the expenditure deduction will, be based on a maximum life of 25 years. </para>
                    <para>Several other adjustments of the basis of taxation of the mining industries arc being made, but- they are- essentially of a technical character and involve no alteration of taxation principles. </para>
                    <para>Associated with the provisions relating to the taxation of the mining industry is a proposal -to exempt from taxation income derived by Australian gold producers from sales of gold on overseas markets for industrial purposes. This decision follows an announcement by the International Monetary Fund of a new policy which, in effect, gave members freedom to determine their own policy in relation to these sales. Since the announcement, a number of countries which had not previously permitted such sales have announced that their producers will in future be permitted to sell gold for industrial use on markets where premium prices are obtainable. The countries concerned include Canada, South Rhodesia and the gold-producing British colonies. South African gold producers had for some time previously been selling a portion of their output on premium markets. </para>
                    <para>Under the existing provisions of the income tax law, income derived from the working of a mining property in Australia or the Territory of New Guinea principally for the purpose of obtaining gold is exempt from income tax and social services contribution. The exemption also applies in some circumstances where both gold and copper are produced. A taxpayer entitled to this exemption would not be  liable  to taxation on income derived from sales of gold made on a premium market. </para>
                    <para>However, the amount of gold which will he saleable at a premium on overseas markets during any given period cannot be accurately foreseen, and the proposal of the industry, which the Government has approved, is to form an association open to all producers for the purpose of arranging sales of gold overseas. The procedure proposed is that individual producers should as at present sell their output to the Commonwealth Bank at the official price. The Producers' Association will then purchase gold from the bank from time to time, and arrange for its sale abroad in an approved form. The income derived from these premium sales will be distributed periodically among the association members in such a way as to ensure that all producers receive an equitable share of the proceeds. As the. association would not itself be engaged in the working of a mining property the income derived from premium sales would, under the existing law, be liable to taxation. </para>
                    <para>It is considered appropriate to grant to gold producers who derive income as a result of sales made by the association on premium markets, the same exemption as they would have enjoyed if the gold had been sold directly by them on those markets. The amendment now proposed will give effect to this principle, and will also extend to shareholders of gold-mining companies the exemption which would have applied in respect of dividends received -by them had the gold-mining companies sold the gold on a premium market. No extension of the principle underlying the existing exemptions is proposed. These amendments will apply for the income year ending on the 30th June, 1952, and subsequent years. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to refer to amendments which are complementary to the modification of the averaging system applicable to the assessments of primary producers. The operation of that system and of the proposed modifications has already been explained in connexion with the rates bill, and need not be repeated here. It is proposed, in the first place, to grant primary producers the right to withdraw from the averaging system. Any primary producer, by making an election to this effect, may ensure that he will pay no more income tax, in a year of reduced income, than any other taxpayer in receipt of an equivalent income. </para>
                    <para>In proposing this amendment, the Government has given consideration to representations by some primary producers' organizations that the averaging system should not apply in periods of declining incomes. The right to withdraw from the averaging system may be exercised in regard to income derived during the current income year which commenced on the 1st July, 1951, or in regard to the income of any later year. Once such an election is made, it will be irrevocable. </para>
                    <para>The other amendment associated with the modification of the averaging provisions relates to the taxation of the proceeds of the sale of live-stock disposed of at walk-in-walk-out or -clearing sales, when a primary producer is going out of business. When these sales are made, the primary producer is faced with an income tax liability, not only on the normal income of the year, but also on the additional profit from the clearing sale. This combined normal income and realization profit falling into one income year attracts an abnormally high rate to the whole of the taxable income. Particularly in cases where the primary producer has valued the natural increase of his live-stock at cost price, and has selected the minimum price per head permitted for such valuation, the income which is subject to tax in consequence of such abnormal sales may be very high. </para>
                    <para>Up to the present time, the averaging provisions have cushioned the taxation burden of a primary producer who disposes of his business. However, under the modified averaging provisions, the benefits derived by some primary producers from the averaging system will be wholly or partly withdrawn. By the amendment, it is proposed to preserve the benefits of the former averaging provisions, in so far as income from walkinwalkout or clearing sales of live-stock is concerned. The proposed relief takes the form of a rebate of tax, equal in amount to the difference between the tax calculated on a concessional basis and the tax which would otherwise be payable. </para>
                    <para>In effect, the net tax payable by a primary producer who received abnormal income from the disposal sale of livestock will be the sum of the following amounts :  - </para>
                    <list type="lowerroman">
                        <item label="(i)">
                            <para>Tax on the abnormal income, calculated by applying to that income the rate ascertained by reference to the taxpayer's actual average income, according to the procedure adopted prior to the modified averaging provisions; and </para>

                            <para>Tax on the normal income, calculated on the basis that that income is the taxpayer's only taxable income, and that the rate of tax is ascertained, subject to the modified averaging provisions, by reference to his actual average income. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>I remind honorable senators that, where the primary producer's taxable income and average income are both below £4,000, the averaging provisions will continue to apply to his income unless he exercises the right I have mentioned to withdraw permanently from averaging. In the cases under £4,000, therefore, there is no necessity to make special provision for the continuance of averaging in the event of a clearing sale. In other cases, the rebate of tax will apply where the clearing sale took place during the year ended the 30th June, 1951, and will continue to apply to those sales in future years, thus coinciding with the application of the modified averaging provisions. </para>
                    <para>Another group of amendments in the present bill relates to the taxation of private companies. These amendments give effect to recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation in regard to this particularly complicated part of our taxation laws. The amendments concerning private companies have the immediate objective of frustrating schemes for tax avoidance. Honorable senators will find a detailed explanation of these proposals, and of other provisions in the bill, in the memorandum which has been supplied by the Treasurer. For the present, it is sufficient to indicate that the private company amendments are designed to defeat efforts which have been made in recent years to avoid the equitable taxation of such companies and their shareholders. </para>
                    <para>The bill contains other provisions of less importance, and I suggest that they may be more appropriately explained and discussed in committee. I invite attention, however, to those provisions which confer complete freedom from taxation upon certain classes of income. I refer particularly to the proposed exemption of the pay and allowances of servicemen in and around Korea and Malaya. Another provision will exempt, as from the 1st July, 1951, scholarships received by full-time students. </para>

                        <para>. - When the debate on this measure was adjourned on Friday last, I had explained that under the provisions of this bill a person who resides in zone 1 may operate two or more broadcast receiving sets - he may have twenty - for the single licence-fee of £2, but that the worker who owns only one receiving get and who formerly paid £1 a year for a listener's licence to operate it is called upon to pay £2. This bill proposes to confer a benefit on the wealthy sections of the community at the expense of .the workers. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> in his second-reading speech said - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The reason for the proposed increase is that revenue from listeners' licences now falls far short of the amount required to meet the cost of the national broadcasting service. In the early years of the service, the revenue derived from licence-fees was sufficient to cover the cost, but with the progressive development of the service, involving the establishment of new stations, the extension of hours of transmission and the provision of more comprehensive programmes, a stage was reached some time ago when expenditure commenced to exceed the income from licence-fees. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I regret that the Minister is not present in the chamber because I should like him to indicate what new stations have been established. Does he contend that it is the function of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to finance the establishment of new stations from the proceeds of listeners' licences? New stations should be built with funds provided by the Treasury. I should also like the Minister to explain what he means by his statement about the provision of "more comprehensive programmes ". The programmes how broadcast over the national stations are substantially the same as those to which we have become accustomed to listen for many years. Very little improvement has been made in programme matter or the quality of the programmes. In a later part of his speech, the Minister said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Id order that honorable senators may be aware of the developments which have taken place it is appropriate to mention that in 1935 there were only 12 national stations, operating for a total of 53,927 hours per annum. To-day, there are 51 stations whose hours of operation aggregate 286,045 per annum. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">To whom does the Minister think he is telling a story of that kind? As far as </para>
                    <para class="block">I am aware, all but one of the additional stations to which he has referred are regional stations which transmit programmes broadcast initially from a national station. The only new national station that has been built in recent years was provided at Port Moresby. In New South Wales, programmes originating from national stations 2FC and 2BL are relayed through a network of regional stations. The Minister's statement about the increase of the number of hours of operation of the national stations is therefore completely misleading. Obviously, it was made with a view to covering up the Government's intention to impose an added burden on the working people of the community to enable wealthy people to operate a number of wireless broadcast receivers, in their motor cars and in their homes, without having to pay additional fees. This change is not in the interests of the people and will not help to promote contentment among the workers which is so desirable to-day. </para>
                    <para>The Government has ignored the rights of the people in this bill as it has in other respects in relation to broadcasting. Section 72 of the Australian Broadcasting Act reads as follows: - (1.) As soon as conveniently practicable after the commencement of this Act, and thereafter at the commencement of the first session of every Parliament, a Joint Committee of nine members of the Parliament, to be called the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting (in this Part referred to as "the Committee"), shall be appointed according to the practice of the Parliament with reference to the appointment of member? to serve on Joint Select Committees of both Houses of the Parliament. (2.) Three of the members of the Committee shall be members of and appointed by the Senate, and six of the members of the Committee shall be members of and appointed by the House of Representatives. </para>
                    <para class="block">Although the provisions of that section are still in force the Government has not attempted to give effect to them. It has steadfastly refused to reconstitute the Parliamentary^ Standing Committee on Broadcasting. The committee should be reconstituted and proposals to vary listeners' licence-fees should be referred to it for examination and report. </para>
                    <para>The Government has also failed to meet the demand of the people for frequency modulation broadcasts. The Australian Broadcasting Commission, with the assistance of the technical officers of the Postmaster-General's Department, has erected antennae for frequency modulation broadcasts at Jolimont, in Victoria ; Mount Lofty, in South Australia; and Worth Sydney, in New South Wales. I understand that frequency modulation broadcasts are being made on an experimental basis for quite a. number of hours each day but the service has not yet been made available to the people. What action has the Australian. Broadcasting Control Board taken to make frequency modulation broadcasts available to the listeners of Australia? What is the position in relation to television? If the people were getting television or broadcasting by frequency modulation there would be no quibble from honorable senators on this side of the chamber or from the trade unions, but nothing has been done. In radio broadcasting, Australia has gone backwards. Progress would' have been better with a standing committee of the Parliament. </para>
                    <para>Frequency .modulation and television are playing an important part in the lives of the people of the world. Television is vital in defence and when the Government fails to include television in its defence plans it is falling below the standards- of other countries. When the British submarine <inline font-style="italic">Affray</inline> was lost, it was found at a depth too great for human divers by a television camera drawn across the bed of the sea. Many countries have progressed with television, but Australians have been denied that branch of broadcasting. I wonder what considerations prevent the introduction of television? The talking motion picture was an accomplished fact thirteen or fourteen years before it was shown to the public. It was delayed by silent picture interests. Are the theatrical entrepreneurs or the commercial broadcasting' interests preventing television from being introduced for selfish reasons ? Some sinister influence must be at work or television would have been introduced into Australia long ago. Broadcasting is so important in the life of the nation that there should be a director of broadcasting, because the only authority with power to introduce television successfully is- the Australian Government. </para>
                    <para>I wish to make a plea on behalf of the composers of music who are so poorly paid by the national and commercial radio stations that they are able only to eke out an existence. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board should give this question some attention with a view to increasing the remuneration that those people receive. I suggest that the board should discuss the question with the national and commercial stations and the Australasian Performing Right Association Limited. The commercial stations have increased their rates for advertising and they should be able to pay more to the composers of music. Broadcasting is too important and has- too many aspects to make it worthwhile to bring down legislation merely to increase the price for the licences without providing for any improvement in the- programmes-. Moreover, the increased licence-fee will benefit those who can best bear the cost but will hit the workers at a time when the spiralling cost of living is taking food off their tables. I ask honorable senators on the Government side to join with the Opposition, in opposing this bill until there has been a thorough investigation of all aspects of radio broadcasting. </para>

I think that the arrangement for a household to pay £2  a  year for a radio licence, even if there is-  more than one radio in the house, is quite reasonable. The argument that the provision will benefit the rich and not the poor has no substance. The comparatively poor man, for there are no really poor In Australia, will feel the most benefit. In a small household this arrangement will be quite satisfactory when the boy or girl of the family wants to take his or her personal radio into another room away from the rest of the family. </para>

                    <para>I am not saying that this hill is better than others or that it is worse. I am dealing with its main provision and justifying the increase in licence-fees. In doing so, I wish to defend the broadcasting services and particularly those of the Australian Broadcasting Commission against the completely baseless attacks by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour.</inline> For many years the system of broadcasting in Australia has given a good service to the public and has shown that it is superior to the services provided in Great Britain and the United States of America. The British Government has insisted that there shall be nothing but a national programme. It has not permitted commercial broadcasting. The Americans have not permitted any kind of national broadcasting. Australia has done both and I think that it was wise to do so. The functions of the two services are not identical. The main function of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to set a high standard in education and entertainment. The purpose of the commercial stations is to give the people what they want. I do not believe that it is the function of the Government to tell the public generally what they should listen to, but rather that its function is to set high standards so that the people will want to listen to what is good. For that purpose, I believe that the Australian Broadcasting Commission should continue. Over the years it has carried out that function very well. I am not necessarily agreeing with everything that has been said by honorable senators on this side of the chamber. 1 have heard criticism of the Australian Broadcasting Commission from all quarters. It is good that there should be criticism and that the commission should take notice of it and amend any faults that may be revealed, but few interests in this country have given better service to the public on the whole. In the first place the commission has provided good music and has raised the standard of musical taste. Anybody who listens intelligently and regularly to the radio programmes will know that good music may be heard every day from one or all of the national stations. In addition to that daily service, the commission has maintained a symphony orchestra which has raised the music appreciation of all who care to listen. It has brought to Australia a large number of artists, including some of the greatest in the world. In addition to broadcasting over the air, they have given performances in concert halls which the public has been able to attend. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has provided lectures on almost every subject on which instruction could be desired. Some of the lectures on literature are among the best that I have ever heard. It has provided lectures on all the arts, and we have had lectures on popular science, which, I believe, have been of inestimable value. Technical services, too, have been provided. I have heard from farmers that broadcast talks on rural topics are well worth listening to and have a real practical value. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that I shall be allowed to continue my speech in my own way. I am speaking now of the Australian Broadcasting Commission ; I shall deal with the private stations later. I believe that the commission's news service is open to a degree of criticism, but such criticism as I have to make I shall write in a letter to the commission. I have always found members and officials of the commission open to receive suggestions aimed at improving the national broadcasting service. Whilst I consider that the news service is open to some criticism, over the years it has served the purpose for which it is intended. I can speak on news reviews with a degree of authority. I consider that they have helped the listening public to follow and to interpret the news. In the main, they have been objective and impartial. Impartiality is not easy to achieve. Commentators have opinions of their own, but they must endeavour to interpret the news without laying themselves open to the accusations of impartiality and partisanship. I have been accused of every kind of partiality and partisanship. I have been accused of attempting, at various times, to further completely opposite political ideologies. Sometimes the Australian Broadcasting Commission is unjustly criticized by a person who has heard put forward in a news commentary a particular point of view with which he disagrees, whereas, had he listened carefully to other commentaries, he probably would have heard that point of view contradicted by other analysts. I believe that, considering the limited number of people available to provide this service, the commission has done its best to provide objective and impartial guidance. I say most emphatically - and I say it because the opposite view has been put forward in the House of Representatives - that control of our national broadcasting service by a commission should be- retained. I should oppose any attempt to bring the service under the control of a Minister or a single director. The commission system has been tried and is working very well. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it is a similar authority. Members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission are not all of the same persuasion, politically, or on any other controversial matter. At least one member of the commission was formerly a member of the Australian Labour party and, I believe, a member of the South Australian Parliament. Others may have been Liberals. I do not know; but, so far as I am aware, most of them have had no political affiliations whatever. If an impartial service is to be provided, and partisanship avoided in political or other comments, it is essential that the national broadcasting service should be controlled by a commission which is ultimately responsible to the Parliament, and not to the Executive. </para>

I am not discussing this matter in a partisan manner. J am putting the point of view of the community.

Such interference would be intensified if those controlling the national broadcasting service felt that the government of the day was behind attempts to force or persuade commentators to take a partisan attitude. </para>

                            <para>- If the partisan intention foreshadowed in the House of Representatives were given effect, and the Australian Broadcasting Commission were placed under the control of the Ministry, the way would be open for the domination of public opinion by the government of the day. In almost every country where a democracy has been replaced by a dictatorship, the radio has been one of the chief instruments by which the dictator has retained power. In contrast to that, I place the record of the Australian Broadcasting Commission during that long period when the night of tyranny seemed to be descending on the democracies. The commission stood firmly on the principle that political influence should not be permitted to compel a broadcaster to say what he did not want to . say, or to restrain him from expressing his true opinions. A staunch stand on that matter was taken by both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boyer</inline> as successive chairmen of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>

                    <para>The commercial stations, too, give a good service ot the people of this country. I listen only to a limited number of commercial broadcasts, but I know that some sessions are worth hearing, and I do in fact listen to them. The commercial stations broadcast programmes which I do not think it would be right for the Australian Broadcasting Commission to provide, but which, nevertheless, are demanded by the public. The Australian Broadcasting Commission can attempt to raise the cultural taste of the community, but obviously all broadcasting cannot be devoted to those whose taste is already high. There is a demand for certain forms of entertainment which some of us find boring, but which some of our fellow citizens appreciate. It is a good thing, therefore, that we have stations which, in order to make money, will provide the cheaper form of entertainment, and thus leave the Australian Broadcasting Commission to cater for other tastes. Some time ago, it was stated that more people listen to the commercial stations than to the national stations. I do not know whether that is true of the listening public to-day, but even if it were true, it would not be a reflection on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The aim of the commission is to raise the cultural standard of the community, and therefore, even though its programmes appeal only to a limited section of the public, the taste of those people is improving, and they in turn are raising the standard of others. It is no reflection on a great artist that his art does not appeal to everybody. It is no reflection on a great painting that it is not appreciated by everybody; and it is no reflection on the Australian Broadcasting Commission that some of its programmes have not a large listening audience. I should like to see the Australian Broadcasting Commission provide <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> third programme similar to that provided by the British Broadcasting Corporation, although I am afraid that, in view of defence exigencies, such a service could not be provided at this juncture. The British Broadcasting Corporation's third programme, which appeals only to a very limited audience, is criticized by some people who consider that money should not be provided for broadcasts of that type, but I do not agree with that criticism. The community as a whole reaps the benefit from that service in indirect ways, and I believe, therefore, that the service should be maintained. The increase of the licence-fee proposed in this measure is fully justified in view of the rising costs. </para>
                    <para class="block">The proposed concessions, too, are justified. Therefore there can be little objection to the bill and I hope that it will be passed. </para>

                        <para>. - The main purpose of this bill is to increase the listeners' fee from £1 to £2 a year. The reason given by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> for the increase is that rising price levels in recent years have increased the cost of the commission's activities and that the deficit in its finances will probably exceed £2,000,000 in' the current year. That is only a half truth. It is true that prices have risen, but it is equally true that rising prices are attributable mainly to the inaction of this Government, which promised in 1949 to put value back into the £1. The restoration of the purchasing power of our currency would, of course, have the effect of reducing prices. That is well within the bounds of practical politics, but the Government has taken no action whatever and an estimated deficit of £2,000,000 in the finances of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is the result. As I have explained previously, there has been no increase of what may be called the economic price of any commodity or service, but there has been a substantial increase of the monetary - or fictitious price of all goods and services. The Government, instead of shouldering the responsibility for its failure to implement its 1949 promise to restore the purchasing value of our currency is, to use a colloquialism, "passing the buck" on to the wireless listeners. It is assisting in every way possible to reduce the purchasing power of the workers' savings bank deposits, which are now estimated at £800,000,000. I repeat that real prices have not increased. When we compare the economic or real cost with the fictitious cost, which is more or less inflated by the private banks in conjunction with the Treasury, that is shown to be absolutely true. I contend that the owner of a wireless receiving set should not be required to pay a licence-fee. When I was Postmaster-General in the former Labour Government I was very reluctant to prosecute persons for operating unlicensed wireless receiving sets. However, I was bound by the legislation. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Large staffs have to he maintained in. every State to issue licences, and many inspectors are employed by the Postal Department to detect offenders. The cost of prosecutions against people for operating unlicensed wireless receiving sets is considerable. If wireless licence-fees were abolished overhead costs would be reduced and the labour force thus released could be used more advantageously in the interests of the nation. This fee can be likened to a tax that was imposed in mediaeval times. When the innovation of windows in houses was introduced, the owners of houses with windows were taxed on the sunlight that entered the rooms, In due course, however,, the more intelligent members of the community realized the stupidity of that tax, and brought pressure to bear to have it reduced and ultimately abolished. </para>
                    <para>Another important aspect of this matter is that if wireless licence-fees were abolished the cost of providing this national service would be defrayed from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That would be in accordance with the principle that those members of the community who are most able to pay the greater proportion should do so. I am convinced that ultimately there will be a more intelligent approach to this subject, and that the cost of providing the national broadcasting service will be defrayed from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. In effect, the wireless licence-fee constitutes a flat tax; the lowest paid workers in the community pay at the same rate as do the wealthy members. Yet' this Government has the audacity to say that it is democratic and does the best it can for the community as a whole ! That is deliberate misrepresentation. This Government is doing its very best for the wealthy sections of the community, and its very worst for the poorer sections. The proposal to increase the licence-fee by <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> a year is outrageous. The fee should be abolished altogether. </para>
                    <para>I agree with what other honorable senators have said about the efficiency of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I am sure that the present, high standard of programmes that are broadcast by the commercial broadcasting stations would not have been reached if the Australian Broadcasting Commis-sion had not been established. The com: mission broadcasts excellent programmes, and it should be supported to a greater degree by this Government. By increasing the licence-fee the Government will be condoning increases of prices. Ultimately there will be a crash, and, doubtless, the Government will make excuses, which many people may be disposed to accept. However, I emphasize that the crash will occur as a result of various actions by the Government in some directions, and inaction in other directions. Honorable senators opposite cannot claim to be democratic and at the: same time seek to justify the proposed iniquitous fee of £2 a year for a wireless licence. Although the Government does not propose to raise the fee paid by pensioners, the great bulk of the poorer members of the community will be required to pay the increased fee. The Government has adopted this policy because it exists to advance the interests of monopolies rather than those of the ordinary members of the community. It has an obligation, both direct and indirect, to the community as a whole, and in time it will have to accept responsibility for its actions. I remind supporters of the Government that action and reaction are equals as well as opposites, and ultimately the Government will experience the reaction of the proposed iniquitous increase of the wireless licence-fee. </para>

                            <para>-Since 1940 the wireless licence-fee has not been increased, despite a general increase of prices and charges. Although the fee is to be increased by 100 per cent., it will still represent a payment of less than ls. a week. Surely this is the cheapest  charge for entertainment to-day. A wireless receiving set is installed in almost every home in this country, and all members of a household may listen to the programmes for the one fee. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron's</inline> assertion that the Government is playing to the wealthy, is disproved. I do not believe that the average member of the community will object to paying a licence-fee of £2 a year.

                    <para>Many of the people in the 40 per cent, group that I have mentioned live in Western Australia. I was very pleased to learn recently that the Australian Broadcasting Commission had inquired into the reason for some of the difficulties that are encountered in connexion with broad cast reception in Western Australia, because I had mentioned that matter in this chamber during the last sessional period. The commission has agreed to install additional regional stations in that State when the necessary funds, labour and equipment are available. The commission has also agreed to additional commercial broadcasting stations being established there. Reception is very bad in the south-west and lower Great Southern, between Albany and Bridgetown, where in " blanketed " areas, it is possible to receive broadcasts by only one station at certain times of the day. The additional revenue that will be derived as a result of the increased licence-fee will enable improvements to be effected in Western Australia. I am sure that the people in the areas that I have mentioned will not object to the proposed increase, provided they get good reception and good programmes. </para>

Large expenditures are required on our telephone and broadcasting systems. Let us profit from the experience gained by those countries which have pioneered television. I remind honorable senators that when radio first started in this country it was necessary for people to almost crawl into a loudspeaker in order to hear the broadcasts. Since that time, a great deal of money has been spent on improvement of radio equipment, and the Australian people have received the benefit of that expenditure. I have bought only one wireless set in my life. I waited until, in my opinion, wireless sets were worth buying. T. suggest that it will not hurt the Australian people to wait for television. They have much more important things to worry about at the present time. </para>

                        <para>. -  In my opinion, the service provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, with one or two exceptions, is reasonably good. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> is very sensitive about broadcasting because, some years ago, whilst acting as commentator during an election campaign, the honorable senator stated that the result would be a draw, whereas in fact the Australian Labour party was 100 yards in front. In consequence, he became the laughing stock of the whole country. During the broadcasts of the results of the last general election and the previous one, the Australian Broadcasting Commission commentators, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> D. Black, did an exceedingly good job. I regret that Professor Macmahon Ball is now heard only every second Sunday. Previously he broadcast every Sunday and presented to us a different point of .view from that of the commentators who speak every day of the week. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>If this Government is genuine in its desire to prevent inflation, I do not know why it tolerates the state of affairs which exists in the radio world to-day. Every night of the week hundreds of pounds are given away during radio programmes. I wish to refer to a gentleman by the name of Bob Dyer, who, in my opinion, is not worth two " bob ". When I say so, I do not wish to take advantage of the fact that I am speaking in the Parliament. I have seen the gentleman at the Tivoli Theatre, in Sydney, and I have searched in vain for evidence to justify his salary of £33,000 a year. It is of no avail to plead that much of that sum is absorbed by taxes. I point out that the shaving cream which he advertises has increased in price from ls. 2d. to 2s. Any one who uses it will agree that less and less soap is received for the money paid and that more and more water is required to make it lather. I suggest to the Government that if it wishes to keep the cost of living down it should take action to curb this lavish expenditure on radio advertising. I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> has to say about this matter, because the honorable senator has a peculiar facility for leaving the chamber as soon as he has spoken. However, he made the statement that the people should be given what they want. I contend that if we give the people what they want they will not advance very far. In my opinion they can only advance if intelligent people more or less thrust upon them broadcasts of a certain kind. Ignorance is everywhere and is almost invincible. It is the function of radio to educate as well as to entertain the people. </para>
                    <para>With the system of capitalism which operates in this country, advertising is inevitable, but to my mind it is atrocious that one individual should be paid £33,000 a year for radio advertising work and that the racket which is being practised at the present time, night after night, should be allowed to continue. I remind honorable senators that if a person is sufficiently unfortunate to have a loved one in hospital the deduction which is allowed from income tax liability is only £100. Yet Colgate Palmolive Proprietary Limited is permitted to reduce its tax liability by paying Bob Dyer £33.000 a year. Jack Davey appears to have a finger in many pies, but he is a clever entertainer. He is at least humorous and witty. </para>
                    <para>I believe that, to a degree, the taste of the people must be catered for, but it seems to me that many people do not appreciate that the costs of the programmes to which I have referred drastically affect the cost of living. No doubt most people listen to such programmes in the hope that they or some one near to them will win a prize, but they do not understand that the whole thing is a racket. To my mind the " Quiz Kids " programme and other broadcasts of that kind are lowering the standards of education in this country. The fact that Professor Osborne, of Victoria, should be prepared to advertise a certain make of motor car for the sake of a few pounds is an insult to the universities of Australia. A programme such as the "brains trust" in England, is a different matter altogether. </para>

                        referred to a third programme. I assume that he meant a programme similar to that broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation, the details of which are published in the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Listener</inline>
                        every week. It is not often that I agree with the honorable senator, but I do so on this occasion. I consider that such a programme would be worthwhile.
                    </para>
                    <para>Although I have nothing against the Australian Broadcasting Commission, I am nevertheless of the opinion that the attempt to re-enact the Sturt expedition, which was staged as part of the jubilee celebrations, was the most nonsensical and idiotic affair since Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden. Generally speaking, the standard of intelligence displayed in the jubilee year celebrations has been very low. A lack of perspective and also a lack of understanding of the matters that are important to the country has been displayed. I listen to the programmes broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission much more frequently than I listen tothose broadcast by commercial stations. On Sunday nights especially, it is most irritating when commercial radio stations advertise a brand of soap in the middle of a symphony or a play. </para>
                    <para>Prizes are not given away on radio programmes for nothing. The public pays in the long run. To my mind there should be a limit to such advertising. If manufacturers wish to advertise, let them, do so in a straightforward manner. When I was in the United States of America, I remember being in one of the underground stations in New York. The blare of broadcast advertisements was so great that if you asked a man where to go to catch a train to Chicago, before you arrived at the right platform you had forgotten the directions you had been given. I understand that even in the United States of America radio broadcasting has now been curtailed. It seems to me that enormous sums of money are being paid to certain individuals in order that manufacturers may escape their tax liability. I do not suppose that the Minister for Repatriation will take any action in the matter, but I hope that he will refer it to his colleague, the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony).</inline> I know that some people wish to listen to radio artists such as Bob Dyer- </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware of the radio programmes to which the honor able senator listens. I am glad that he has now given me some indication. I appreciate that it is very difficult to arrest inflation, but I suggest that a step in the right direction would be taken if the Government curtailed the extensive radio advertising which is indulged in at present. During a time when commodities are very scarce, it should not be possible for large quantities of articles to be given away on radio programmes. As honorable senators know a radio announcer will advertise a certain brand of wine as the best that may be bought. A few minutes later he will advertise another brand of wine as the best. I do not suppose that that kind of advertising could be stopped. </para>

I maintain that the forms of advertising to which I have referred represent nothing more than subterfuges to escape tax. Other people who make large sums of money have no such opportunity to dodge their tax liability. I hope that the Minister for Repatriation will discuss the matter with his Cabinet colleagues. </para>

                        <para>.- Approximately 2,000,000 people in Australia to-day buy wireless listeners' licences. Of those people, approximately 255,000 own more than one wireless set. Therefore, we can say that approximately 1,500,000 workers own only one radio set. A wealthy householder may have several receiving sets, one in the living room, one in his bedroom, another in the kitchen, and almost certainly another in his motor car; yet for all those sets he will be required to pay a licence fee of only £2, the same as the worker pays for his single set. That is another example of how the Government's taxation proposals discriminate unfairly against the workers. Young married couples, who are trying to furnish their homes on the time payment system, will find the increased listeners' fee an added burden, whereas the wealthy person, who owns many receiving sets, may actually pay less in future than he paid in the past. </para>

I am sure that most people in Australia would prefer to be given the Australian news first, unless some thing of unusual importance had occurred overseas. At present, we have to listen to a lot of news from abroad before hearing anything of what has happened in Australia, even news of great bush fires, or other tragedies. </para>

The price of petrol was recently increased, and we. have been told that another increase is due; yet the oil companies continue to spend enormous amounts of money on advertising, including, radio programmes in which large sums of money, and goods, of considerable value, are given away. We know that in these times of inflation price increases are to be expected, but firms that can afford, to expend such large amounts on advertising should be expected to pay their fair share of taxation. </para>

                        <para>. -  Speeches delivered by members of the Opposition give evidence of a good deal of muddled thinking, and it is time that somebody clarified the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> drew an extraordinary analogy between the tax placed on people in the middle ages for having windows in their houses through which to admit the sunlight, and the listeners' fee charged to people who own radio receiving sets. He forgot to point out that sunlight is distributed free of cost to every one. whereas it costs a considerable amount of money to provide radio programmes. The honorable senator also said that the unfortunate workers were being hit unfairly by the increased listening fee, and that the Australian Broadcasting Commission service should be paid for out of Consolidated Revenue. That would cost £10,000,000 or £12,000,000, and the extra money would have to be found by taxation. Well, almost every day some one reminds us in the Senate that all taxation is borne ultimately by the workers. </para>

The fee of £2 a year represents only about lid. a day, which is a very moderate charge for the service given by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Indeed, it is by far the cheapest entertainment that any of us have ever enjoyed. </para>

                        gave us a long discourse on the iniquity of advertising. Let me first correct his statement that Bob Dyer receives £33,000 a year. It is true that he is paid £33,000 a year,, but out of that he must himself bear the cost of running the shows that he puts on.  His  net income is considerably less than £33,000. I am not in his confidence, but that would seem to be the position. However,, even if he receives a net income of £33,000, the Commonwealth Treasurer may be relied upon to take care of a good share of it for him. If the oil companies and other big firms did not spend their advertising allocation on radio programmes, they would spend it on newspaper advertising, or in putting up placards on hoardings, or on advertising in railway carriages and tram-cars. Who would be so bold as to advocate that advertising should be abolished?
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline>
                        complained about the " Quiz Kids " session. Perhaps he has more intelligence than I have, but I assure him that I, in common with a great many others, have learned a good deal from the &lt;( Quiz Kids ", and I have enjoyed many happy hours listening to them.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Grant</inline>
                        also complained about a man named Osborne, who advertised, a motor car. If he did not advertise the car some one else would have done so. Most firms allocate a certain amount of money for advertising.

                        said that it was unfair to the workers to allow a person to have two radio receiving sets in has house for the same licence-fee as he would pay for only one. I cannot see anything unfair in it. We know that a great many young men take pleasure in making receiving sets, and I am fairly confident that, on an average, there are just as many receiving sets to be found in the homes of the workers as in the homes of other people.

                    <para>I cannot endorse what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> said about the news service. I believe that the people of Australia should take more interest in overseas news, because what is happening overseas is of paramount importance to Australia. It is more important to the people of Australia to learn what is happening in Korea and Malaya than to hear about a small bush fire somewhere in the country. If honorable senators opposite were to listen more intently to overseas news they would be able to make more knowledgeable contributions to debates. </para>

                    <para>The number of wireless listeners' licences issued in Australia has grown tremendously since wireless broadcasting was first instituted. In 1925 approximately sixty thousand listeners' licences were issued. Even in those very early years of  wireless  broadcasting in Australia those engaged in the broadcasting of wireless programmes rendered an. excellent service to the people. By 1938, the number of listeners' licences had increased to 300,000, and by 1950 it increased to 1,000,000. I understand that the number is now almost 2,000,000. The improvements that have been effected in national programmes since the inception of wireless broadcasting have not been commensurate with the tremendously increased volume of revenue derived from listeners' licence fees. How honorable senators opposite, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall,</inline> can have the audacity to attempt to justify the  proposal  to double the wireless listeners' licence fees is beyond my comprehension, particularly in view of their  statements prior to the general election of 1949 that,' if they were returned to office, they would reduce taxes. </para>

                            <para>- I still have the faith that I always had in the policy of the greatest leader the Australian Labour party has ever had, the great war-time Prime Minister, the lata Ben Chifley, who told the people in 1949, not that he would reduce taxes, but that as economic conditions permitted he would grant such taxation remissions as were possible in the light of the circumstances then existing. None knew better than he did that the specious appeals made by the non-Labour parties would appeal to unthinking people, but he was an honest man and, realizing that the country was passing through a difficult period, he made no false promises in order to gain popularity. That is my answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Seward's</inline> interjection. I observe that the honorable senator smiles. What I have said is the incontrovertible truth. Eager to occupy the treasury bench at any cost, the nonLabour parties made extravagant promises to the people, knowing very well that there was little likelihood that they could be honoured. </para>

                    <para>An honorable senator opposite has said that young people make a hobby of constructing wireless receivers and that consequently a set is to be found in almost every room in an average home. That is far from true. Reference to the files in the wireless section of the Postmaster-General's Department will show that most working people possess only one wireless receiver. Until now, workers who live in zone 1 have been able to obtain a wireless listeners' licence for £1 per annum. Those who were fortunate enough to possess more than one wireless receiver were called upon to pay an additional licence fee of 10s. for each additional instrument. They are now to be relieved of the obligation to pay the extra impost for each additional receiver, and to offset the loss of revenue involved those who own only one receiver are to be called upon to meet a 100 per cent, increase in the cost of the licence. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper),</inline> who is in charge of the bill, can explain the Government's reason for this decision as best he may. </para>
                    <para>Representations have been made to me regarding the method adopted by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in utilizing the services of live artists in the national broadcasting service. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> understand that section 88 of the Broadcasting Act requires that a certain percentage of live artist entertainment shall be provided in all national broadcasts. The provisions of that section are not being enforced. Instead, recorded items of all kinds are foisted on the listening public and young people of superior musical and theatrical talent are being discouraged. I have been informed by the trade union that enrols musicians that it has advised young persons who desire to earn their living as musicians not to look to a musical profession as a means of livelihood. As a result of the practice adopted by the commission many budding musicians are being discouraged from continuing their studies. Indications point to the likelihood that, within two years or so, all broadcast entertainment will be of the " canned " variety. The Govern  ment should direct the commission to adhere to the provisions of the section to which I have referred, especially if it hopes to justify this proposal to increase the cost of listeners' licence-fees. </para>
                    <para>I pay a tribute to the excellent work done by the officers of the Postmaster-General's Department in providing the requisite technical assistance to enable the commission to present its programmes to the people. I do not know the charges, if any, that are made for such services. I should like the Minister to deal with that aspect of the subject when he is replying to this debate. </para>
                    <para>Grave complaints have been made by many people regarding the exclusion of items of great news value from news sessions broadcast over the national stations. In Victoria, a couple of weeks ago, a very important function, associated with the jubilee celebrations, which was attended by 100,000 persons, was not even mentioned in the news broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Later, on the following Sunday, another function, which was also associated with  the jubilee celebrations and which was attended by  80,000  persons, was ignored in the news session broadcast by the commission. </para>
                    <para>Complaints have also been made about the vast sums of money that are permitted as allowable deductions for income tax purposes expended by Australian manufacturers in radio advertising. A radio session which is very popular among the listeners is called "Pick a Box". It is conducted by the radio compere, Bob Dyer, who, I understand, receives no less than  £33,000  a year from a manufacturer of tooth paste to conduct weekly broadcast programmes. Under the arrangement with his sponsor he may have to meet the cost of certain prizes. That does not concern me so much as does the fact that in times of scarcity of commodities manufacturers should be permitted to claim tax deductions in respect of large sums of money spent on radio advertising. In these days when motor cars are sold at a premium, imagine a motor car firm being permitted to escape liability for taxation in respect of expenses incurred on advertising motor cars ! The Government should limit the amount in respect of which companies and individuals may claim tax deductions. Any additional taxes collected as the result of such limitation could well be used for improving the facilities provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>
                    <para>This is yet another measure to increase taxes. Indeed, almost every measure introduced by this Government has had for its purpose an increase of taxes. I hope that this bill will be rejected and that before long the people will reject this Government which promised to reduce taxes, to abolish controls and to restore value to the  £1,  but which has blindly gone on increasing tax after tax, imposing still greater controls and conveniently forgetting about its promise to restore value to the  £1.  I oppose the bill. </para>

                        <para>. -  There are certain features of this bill to which I also take exception. The principal one is the proposal to increase the cost of wireless listeners' licences. I regard wireless broadcasting as a very important and essential service which is in much the same category as is education. It is of the utmost value to the people outback, who receive their newspapers days after they have been issued. Many days elapse before newspapers reach the settlers in the far north-west of Western Australia but the national broadcasting service and pedal wireless sets enable them to keep abreast of the times. I do not know whether any special provision is made in this bill for the pedal wireless sets. They are a necessary adjunct to the flying doctor. They have helped to make the lives of pioneer women in the outback much more secure and have given them a few of the amenities that city dwellers regard as their right. For that reason I regret that the Government has increased the cost of licences to those to whom the pedal wireless gives such a necessary service. I would prefer to see the charge increased on the second, third and fourth sets rather than have the fee for a single set doubled. People who can afford to have two or three wireless sets in the home are able to pay an extra charge. When there is only one wireless set in a home it is an essential service and the licence-fee should not be doubled. Many country children who have been receiving their education by correspondence now listen to new educational radio broadcasts. Mothers who have had to supervise the correspondence courses of their children have found that the lessons by wireless are a great boon, but the cost of that amenity is to be doubled. I hope that the Minister will try to do something for the country dwellers whose children are receiving lessons by radio with the object of reducing the licence-fee. </para>

                    <para>With other honorable senators, I believe that the huge prizes that are given in radio competitions constitute a form of illegal gambling. Betting on the racecourses is controlled but many of the quizzes on the air are not even games of skill. Recently a house valued at from  £4,000  to  £5,000  was given for an incorrect answer. It would not matter so much perhaps if the answers of the winners were correct. Extremely high salaries are paid to people in radio work who are not producing anything. Honorable senators have been told that there must be more production, yet people are attracted into radio jobs  for which they are paid as high as £33,000 a year. Even the Prime Minister does not get a quarter of that sum despite his heavy responsibilities. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is not immune from this charge. A few months ago an Australian artist was brought from London to give a series of broadcasts and I do not think that they were any better than those of Australian artists who were already resident in this country. Honorable senators should be told how much is spent on items of that kind. </para>
                    <para>I should like to know whether any record is kept of the prize money that has been given by all firms in the past five years through radio quizzes. It would be very enlighteningto know how much has been spent on advertising in that way. It is really only a method of defrauding the Commonwealth Treasurer. In many cases the money is spent to advertise goods that are not worth advertising. The advertisements are designed directly to get people to buy tubes of tooth paste and cakes of soap that they do not require. In some cases, in an endeavour to win a prize, people buy the articles after the competitions have closed. It is about time something was done to regulate this expenditure. Honorable senators know that some patent medicines which are advertised widely consist simply of coloured water. An investigation was made some years ago into the various patent medicines that were on the market. This revealed that medicines which were being sold for 15s. to 16s. a bottle contained ingredients worth only a few pence. Medicines of that kind are being advertised by radio. Listeners hear pink pills for pale people and indigestion powders advertised in conjunction with symphonies. It is enough to make the composers of classical music turn in their graves. I do not know whether their families are paid any royalty. Sometimes one advertisement will contradict another. </para>
                    <para>It is refreshing to be able to listen to programmes in New Zealand and Great Britain without the constant interruptions from advertisements. If a person is to be charged £2 a year for a listener's licence he should not have to listen to advertisements, many of which are not even true. A committee should be set up to inquire into the truth or otherwise of the advertisements that are broadcast by radio because many of them can do untold harm. Goods which are advertised are not true to the description or to the claims that are made for them. Some of the tablets and powders that are advertised are guaranteed to cure everything from corns to cancer. This exploitation of the foibles of the people should be rigorously suppressed by the Government. I repeat that the doubling of the licence-fee is wrong and that some consideration should be given to holders of single licences in the country areas where the wireless set is a life-line. I know that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> who is in charge of the bill in the Senate has a great deal of sympathy with the country people because he was a member of the Social Security Committee, of which I was also a member, when it visited outback areas, where the pedal wireless was an important link with the flying doctor service. I hope that he will be able to persuade the Government to give consideration to the points that I have mentioned. </para>

                        <para>. - In my second-reading speech, I said that this legislation would penalize a majority of radio listeners. I pointed out that there were nearly 2,000,000 wire less licence-holders in this country. The exact figure is 1,991,000. Of that number 255,000 licence-holders have more than one receiving set. It is a fair assumption, therefore, that the remaining 1,738,000 are workers. This measure is another instalment in the Government's plan to impose higher taxes on those members of the community who are least able to bear them. The 255,000 people who have more than one set are well able to pay the extra £1 a year. Some of them may have two sets in their homes and perhaps another one or two in their motor cars, yet they will have to pay only the same annual fee as the man who has only one receiver. In the course of my second-reading speech, an honorable senator on the Government side said by way of interjection that the figures that I had quoted were wrong. I have risen at this stage to emphasize that my figures are correct. I regret that the action of the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> in gagging the second-reading debate prevented his own colleague, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> from answering some of the questions that were asked by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber. I have never known that to happen before in the Senate, and I hope that there will not be a repetition of the Minister's discourtesy to the Opposition. I invite the Minister for Repatriation, even at this late stage, to reply in his usual courteous manner to the various points that have been raised. </para>

                            <para>- It is better than cheap entertainment; it is gift entertainment. The single licence system is not peculiar to Australia. It is in force in almost every  other country except the United States of America. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley,</inline> who was Postmaster-General in a former Labour government, will realize, it has been very difficult to police the provision that a person should hold a licence for every wireless receiving set in his possession at the premises stated in the licence. Accordingly, the Government decided that only one licence need be held by a person in respect of those wireless sets. This is in line with the practice in other countries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> who also was Postmaster-General in a former Labour government, has asserted that wireless licences should be abolished. The effect of his suggestion would be that people who did not desire to own a wireless set in order to listen to broadcast programmes, would have to pay for the entertainment of persons who did. The United States of America is the only country where that system operates to-day. The Government considers that only the people who derive the benefit should be required to pay, as is the case with electricity and water services. </para>

                        <para>. - This measure conflicts with the promises that were given to the people of this country by supporters of the Government during the last two general election campaigns. They told the people that if they were returned to office the war-time controls would be lifted and that it would not be long before the supply of commodities would equal the demand. Labour realized that many people had money with which to buy commodities that have been described by the supporters of the Government as luxury goods, because they had lived in an austere manner during the war period. However, we pointed out that if we were to maintain a sound economy in this country, it would be necessary to retain various forms of control. Although Labour had successfully administered this country during the war period, the people were swayed by the promises of our opponents.

The Treasurer has stated that this is another measure designed to defeat inflation.

This country had been ruined by anti-Labour governments that were in office from 1920 to 1929. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> found, when he assumed office, that the Treasury was empty. There were only three supporters of Labour in this chamber at that time. Because the Commonwealth Bank had refused to make finance available, the hostile Senate refused to pass a measure to provide £12,000,000 for the assistance of primary producers, who were starving, and £6,000,000 to provide work for the unemployed. In order to be able to pay the salaries of public servants and to meet social services commitments, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was then forced to introduce sales tax, which, in fact, Labour detested. </para>

                            <para>- The sales tax yielded £3,000,000 in 1930. The opponents of Labour told the people that if they were returned to office sales tax would be abolished. I recollect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> stating that if the anti-Labour Government was returned to office jobs would be found for all. Unfortunately, the people of this country believed him. In 1931, when the anti-Labour Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> had a majority in both Houses of the Parliament, the yield from sales tax was £8,500,000. By 1939 the amount of revenue received from sales tax had increased to £9,000,000. During those years there were more than 500,000 persons unemployed in Australia. By 1943, the yield from sales tax had increased to £28,000,000. That was the darkest year in the history of this country. The people were prepared to do almost anything and to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> to any length to ensure that the " Nips " would be prevented from invading Australia and molesting our women and children. Sales tax was increased because the government of the day had to obtain additional revenue in order to prosecute the war effort. Labour had to curb the production of luxury commodities because, in effect, that production had enabled our enemies to put bayonets on their rifles. It administered the country until 1949, when sales tax had grown to £39,000,000 per annum. In that year a general election was held. During the election campaign the Prime Minister stated that, if returned to office, the Government parties would review the incidence of indirect taxation. Apparently the electors did not appreciate mat the review would involve doubling the incidence of sales tax. The political wool was pulled over their eyes. This Government has been in office almost two years, and in that time the annual revenue from sales tax has increased from £39,000,000 to £57,173,101 last year. The estimated revenue from sales tax for 1950-51 is £117,000,000. That is the amount of money which this Government will take from Australian families, both rich and poor. Yet, in 1949 the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden),</inline> who apparently would promise anything and give nothing, stated - </para>

                    <para>Sales tax in 1950-51 will bring in revenue to a greater amount than the surplus for which the Treasurer has budgeted. Would it not be honest and also in the interests of national development if the Treasurer honoured his promises to the people, wiped out sales tax, and said, " Let us balance our budget without budgeting for a surplus "? Far from being prepared to do that, he intends to impose an additional sales tax burden upon the people. When the Minister for National Development replies to the debate, I should like him to explain to the Senate why it is necessary to collect £117,000,000 by way of sales tax and at the same time to budget for a surplus of £114,500,000. If he again says that it is necessary in order to stem the tide of inflation, I shall not be prepared to believe him. In my opinion, the present Treasurer is one of the most able accountants in Australia to-day, and I am always prepared to believe his statements. As I have already pointed out, the right honorable gentleman stated that if sales tax is increased inflation will also be increased. </para>
                    <para>Perhaps this Government has other objectives in mind. Honorable senators have heard a great deal about communism, although not much has been heard of fascism. Perhaps this drastic increase of indirect tax represents the first step towards the introduction of fascism in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely using my imagination as honorable senators opposite use theirs when they accuse members of the Opposition of leaning towards communism. Will this additional heavy burden of indirect tax lead to direction of labour in peace-time ? If it will, I contend that it is time that the people of Australia were informed of the fact. Honorable senators opposite should appreciate that the referendum on prices control was defeated because the people were told by the supporters of the present Government that the Labour Government of the day wished to have prices controlled in order to direct labour. No statement could have been further from the truth. At that time, the Labour Government believed that unless the economy could be effectively geared in order to meet the transition from war to peace, the Government would be forced to bring in legislation of a kind that would force it to hide its head in shame. </para>

                    <para>I contend that it is impossible for the legislation now before the Senate to check inflation in any way. Surely the Government does not suggest that the imposition of sales tax on the powder to prevent a baby's rash will stop its mother from buying such powder ? I suggest thai she will deny herself food in order to buy powder for the baby. Surely the Government does not believe that people in the country will do without refrigerators and other articles which are now subject to heavy additional sales tax ? I contend that increased sales tax represents an endeavour to impose conscription of labour on the people of Australia, because certain industries will be obliged to close down and the employees of those industries will be forced to work at the direction of the Government. </para>

The heavy burden of indirect taxes is taking away from the young people of Australia the incentive to get married and to bear children, although for some years the leaders of our nation have said that children are the best immigrants that we can get.

                    <para>For every  £1  that was collected by way of indirect tax in  1943, £2  was collected last year. This year  £4  will be collected. When will this octopus, which is sucking the life-blood of the people, be laid low? When the last war broke out the people of Australia were told that if they went away and fought for this country they would be given a new order when they returned. Was a new order really needed ? I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> nods his head. I say to the honorable senator that all classes in Australia to-day, whether manufacturers, primary producers or workers, are worse off than they were in  1949.  Legislation of the kind which we are now considering has been responsible for the retrenchment of employees in many industries. Surely the Government does not contend that the furnishing industry is a luxury industry, that the beds on which a family sleeps are luxuries, or that the piece of matting which they put under their feet when they get undressed at night is a luxury item? Because of increased sales tax, certain Melbourne furniture firms have been obliged to reduce their staffs because the public cannot afford to buy the furniture which they manufacture. Surely singlets and underclothing are not luxuries, yet sales tax has been imposed on them. The worker finds it harder to buy even those items which are not taxed, because his income is drained away by having to pay tax at the rate of  66$  per cent, on certain other items. Now, in addition to the increased indirect taxation that has been imposed, the Government proposes to place an additional  10  per cent, levy on incomes. </para>
                    <para>The Government must admit that it made false promises to the people. If they were not deliberately false, then the Government must admit that its judgment was at fault, and that circumstances have got beyond it. The only honorable thing to do in the circumstances is to vacate the treasury bench in favour of the Labour party which, from the end of the war in  1945  until  1949,  kept the country on an even financial keel. </para>

He does himself little credit by his cheap, sneering jibes about an ailment that causes me a great deal of inconvenience. The Government should resign in favour of the Labour party, as did the former Menzies Government in  1941.  From the end of the war until  1949,  the Labour Government gave the country full employment, and gradually reduced taxation. Leaders of the antiLabour parties said that the " Chifley  £1  " was worth only  12s.  in  1949  compared with  1939.  If that were so, then it cannot be denied that the economic situation has deteriorated so much since then that the " Menzies  £1  " is now worth only  5s.  compared with  1939. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour Government taxed ordinary soap, but not dog's soap. It taxed baby powder, but not flea powder. In that respect, it was no better than the present Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> said that the working people would bear the brunt of sales tax increases, but that is not so. Every one who buys articles that bear tax will pay the tax, but most of the necessaries of life, including the basic food lines, are not taxed by this Government any more than they were taxed by the Labour Government. By refusing to buy the so-called luxury lines, people may avoid paying sales tax. </para>

                    <para>It is estimated that sales tax increases will yield revenue amounting to 2s. 6d. a week per head of population. It is not hard for a man to save 2s. 6d. a week if he wishes to do so. It represents less than the price of a packet of twenty cigarettes. The sales tax increases imposed in the last budget were intended to check the purchase of certain articles, but, because of the continued prosperity of the nation, the people went on buying those articles, and the tax did not achieve its purpose. Therefore, the rate has been increased. </para>
                    <para>It is not correct to describe as luxuries all the goods that carry sales tax at the higher rates. It may be argued that nothing is a luxury if we can so raise the standard of living as to bring it properly within the reach of every one. However, some articles are less essential than others. The Labour Government imposed excise at the rate of Ss. a gross o:i matches, which represented three farthings a box. That was done, not because the Labour Government believed that matches were a luxury, but because the turnover on matches was rapid, and the tax would, therefore, yield a large revenue. The same may be said of such articles as baby powder and razor blades. </para>
                    <para>Whether we like it or not, sales tax will be with us for many years to come, no matter what changes of government may occur. Sales tax was first imposed by the Scullin Government during the depression, and has been continued by Labour and non-Labour governments from that time until now. Therefore, seeing that the tax is here to stay, we should try to remove some of the features that make it particularly irksome. For instance, all business people resent the fact that there are five different rates of tax, <inline font-style="italic">12i</inline> per cent., 20 per cent., 33-J per cent., 50 per cent, and  665  per cent., a fact which imposes a great deal of extra work on clerical staff in the getting out of invoices. The Government should consider the imposition of a two-rate basis of tax, at 25 per cent, and 50 per cent., or whatever percentage it may deem necessary. The imposition of five separate rates is cumbersome and unwieldy. </para>
                    <para>Many anomalies arise under this legislation which should be remedied without delay. For instance, all biscuits except rice and arrowroot biscuits are subject to tax. For some reason those responsible for the formulation of sales tax schedules appear to be under the mistaken impression that rice and arrowroot biscuits are peculiarly suited as food for babies. Shades of Truby King ! Every modern parent realizes that biscuits are not a healthful food for babies. The stupid exemption of two kinds of biscuits in a long list of such confections is completely unjustified. </para>
                    <para>Some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> very sensibly criticized the imposition of sales tax on ice-blocks made by small shopkeepers as a sideline and sold to children for 1 1/2d. or 2d. each. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> pointed out that it would be impossible for any sales tax inspector to estimate the quantity of ice-blocks made by a small shop-keeper. Ice-blocks are usually made by the wife or the mother of a small shop-keeper as part of her contribution to the business. In very few instances are strict records kept concerning the number made. Small shopkeepers have to pay sales tax on the iceblocks sold by them each month. They are registered and given a sales tax number which they must quote when purchasing the ingredients with which the ice-blocks are made. What a stupid rigmarole for the small amount of revenue derived from sales tax on that commodity 1 Ice-blocks should be exempted from tax. Instead, the appropriate tax should be levied on the material from which they are made on purchase from the wholesaler. </para>
                    <para>Another absurdity in the sales tax legislation is instanced by the imposition of sales tax on certain kinds of small goods made and sold by bakers. The bakers are registered and given sales tax numbers and at the end of each month they have to compute the wholesale value of cakes and buns subject to tax in accordance with a formula worked out by the department. Again, if the ingredients of such cakes and buns were taxed in the hands of the wholesaler much time and expense would be saved and no loss of revenue would be involved. </para>

                    <para class="block">Thus, jars of lemon butter containing not more than 15 oz. are exempt, but a  4-lb.  jar is taxable. The question is: What tax is applicable to a 16-oz. jar? Under this iniquitous system the trader does not allow himself to be caught. He charges the tax if he is uncertain whether it should be charged because if the commodity is subject to the tax he is responsible for its payment. Naturally, he takes no risk, and in cases of doubt adds the tax. Anomalies of that kind which are apparent right throughout the tax schedules could be remedied by the use of a little bit of common sense. Recently, to the gratification of taxpayers generally, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> decided to institute desirable simplifications in income tax returns that had been recommended by the expert committee on taxation. He should consider the desirability of referring these glaring sales tax anomalies to the committee for consideration and report. These stupidities should be ended. </para>

In each case the tax due is dependent upon the quantity of peel and almondsin the package of mixed fruit. Th, Commissioner of Taxation should remember that traders who have to assist the Government in the collection of sales tax revenue are not " Mandrakes " but ordinary human beings. Anomalies of the kind to which I have directed attention should be remedied without delay. . </para>
                    <para>It is entirely unfair to ask one section of the community to act as the unpaid tax collectors of the Government. Sales tax which is collected by registered wholesale houses, is payable on the 21st of each month. Many wholesale houses employ large numbers of clerks to compute the tax and to furnish returns and collections of tax to the Commissioner. For that work they receive no reimbursement whatever. As the number of items on which sales tax is imposed grows larger, the work of computing tax increases. Many wholesale houses are operating under credit restrictions imposed by the central bank. A great deal of the sales tax debited in their customers' accounts is not collected by them for one or two months after it has been paid. Some allowance should be paid to them for this work and the losses involved in it. The Government should consider remedying these injustices in the legislation as soon as possible. </para>
                    <para>I return to the theme upon which 1 commenced my speech. The purpose of increased sales tax is to divert labour and materials from less essential to more essential, industries. The Government has made no bones about that. We must protect those essential and basic industries upon which our defence preparations are founded. If we do not protect our basic industries less essential industries will inevitably go to the wall. I am wholeheartedly in accord with the Government's decision to raise additional revenue from the sales tax, first, to underwrite the loan programmes of the States and, secondly, to divert labour and materials from non-essential to essential industries to enable us to increase our defence potential. </para>

                        <para>. - An examination of all forms of taxation provides a very interesting study. If we follow the course of taxation from the days when the rate of income tax was Id. or 2d. in the £1 up to the present we shall learn very much about the subject. In periods of war the governments of the day had to raise funds to meet the exigencies of war, and income tax and other forms of taxation were introduced. The sales tax was not introduced until August, 1930. It was introduced by the Australian Government in a period when the budgets of all the governments resulted in deficits. In that period there were substantial increases in all forms of taxation and particularly in income tax, customs and excise. That was the atmosphere in which the sales tax was introduced in Australia. The tax was first imposed at the rate of 2-J per cent., but in less than twelve months it was increased to 6 per cent. Honorable senators may deduce from that increase that it was found to be such a promoter of funds that an increase was inevitable. As economic conditions improved, the rate was decreased to 5 per cent, and then to 4 per cent, but in 1938 it rose against to 5 per cent. In 1939 it was 6 per cent, and in 1940 it was raised to 8$ per cent. Late in 1940 the Government adpoted a method of imposing different rates of sales tax according to whether the goods were necessities or luxuries. The maximum rate of sales tax had risen to 15 per cent, in 1940 and then it rose to 20 per cent, in 1941 and to 25 per cent, in 1942. In 1950 the maximum rate was raised to 33$ per cent, but the bill under discussion proposes to lift that maximum to 66$ per cent. That is a brief history of the sales tax in Australia. As a member of the Australian Labour party I believe that the principle underlying the sales tax is a bad one. It is unfair. The policy of the Australian Labour party in respect of the sales tax is in line with abolition. </para>

                            <para>- It is opposed definitely to the sales tax. Its platform provides for the repeal of the tax. The sales tax was introduced in the depression years and was continued through the years of rehabilitation into war-time. When the war had to be financed, the governments of the day found that an increase of sales tax was essential. Their purpose was two-fold. First, they needed funds and secondly they wanted to divert from non-essential industries materials which were required in essential industry. The bad principle of the sales tax is that it entirely disregards ability to pay. The income of the individual is ignored. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> has pointed out, sales tax is related to wholesale values and to prices.. The wholesaler or the manufacturer is required to calculate the sales, tax. For the buying public, that is where the sales tax begins and from that point the price rises. A young girl in her first job who wants to buy a handbag with her small wages has to pay the same rate of sales tax as the wealthiest, woman in the land. That is unfair. Another bad feature is the collection of the tax. In this community the great majority of traders are honest but there are also business adventurers. Is the Government sure that all the sales tax collected in the community is properly accounted for to the Taxation Branch? Frequently the press reports that persons have been fined for neglecting to pay sales tax. The season is always open for business adventurers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> mentioned the hardships imposed on merchants and others who are required to collect sales tax. That is not a. new responsibility. They have carried it for years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> made it appear that the merchants and the manufacturers had to account for sales tax and had to bear the expense of the staff employed to collect and account for it. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> did not ask the Senate to believe that statement in its entirety. Every merchant and manufacturer has a costing system and every cost in the collection of tax has to be written into the price that he will charge for his goods. Finally the  public has to meet that charge. It does not matter whether they are employed privately or by the Taxation Branch. The public pay the wages. Sales tax increases the cost of living whether the item concerned is in the " C " series index or not. The very existence of sales tax means a higher cost of living because all forms of taxation go on to the price that is paid by the public. The second schedule to the bill sets out that a. sales tax of 20 per cent, is applicable to - motor cars designed primarily and principally for the transport of persons, including sedans, coupes, tourers, roadsters, taxi-cabs, station wagons and estate cars but not including panel vans, delivery vans, utilities, hearses, jeeps, trucks, lorries, or motor buses. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Government thought that by inflicting a rate of 20 per cent, sales tax on motor cars, the cost of living would not be affected. Did it disregard entirely the use of cars by commercial travellers and others engaged in the distribution of goods and commodities? Those costs have to be borne by the public. The second schedule to the 'bill also refers to confectionery, including pop-corn, confectionery novelties, crystallized fruit and other items. They all yield a sales tax of 20 per cent. Such a tax may be warranted in certain periods but this is not a time when pop-corn and other sweets should have to bear such a high rate of sales "tax. </para>
                    <para>Visitors from overseas occasionally speak of Australia as a nation that is backward culturally. Recently a lecturer speaking in Brisbane said there was a low level of appreciation of culture in this country. On examining the schedule this bill, honorable senators will find that musical instruments and instruments for hands and orchestras bear a sales tax of 25 per cent. How is culture to be encouraged if it is to be so heavily taxed? The schedule also provides for a sales tax at the rate of 33$ per cent, on watches of various kinds. Some watches are not taxable to that degree but there is little choice of watches on the market to-day and the average purchaser is required to pay sales tax of 33$ per cent. A watch is a necessity. There is scarcely a calling that does not require the use of a watch. </para>
                    <para class="block">Fountain pens and propelling pencils are to attract the same rate of tax. In other words, a taxpayer who needs a new fountain pen to write a cheque to meet his income tax assessment for the current year will have to pay 33$ per cent, sales tax on that pen. Also in the fourth schedule are handbags, evening bags, purses, shopping bags, &amp;c. Earlier in my speech I revealed the unfair incidence of the sales tax. The imposition of a tax of 33$ per cent, on these essential items is an illustration of my argument. Purses surely are necessities for women. Even if a woman is only going for a tram ride she has to take 3s. or 4s. with her in these days of inflation. A similar rate of tax will be payable on yachts, skiffs, dinghies, launches, speedboats, canoes and other watercraft for pleasure, sport or recreation. I remind the Government that many watercraft are used for fishing purposes. By supplementing their larders with fish, boatowners can ease to some degree at least the heavy demand for meat in the country. Some discrimination should have been shown in imposing sales tax on boats, or, better still, boats should have been left out of the schedule altogether. </para>
                    <para>The fourth schedule also includes " equipment, apparatus and accessories of a kind used exclusively or primarily and principally in indoor or outdoor sports and games, gymnastics, athletics and physical culture . . ." The equipment to which the tax will apply includes guns, rifles and ammunition,  surfoplanes,  surf skis and surf boards. Surely the improvement of the physical standards of our younger generation is a matter of some importance to this country. We have special organizations charged with the task of improving national fitness, yet here we have a government that is doing its utmost to prevent the youth of this country from becoming physically fit. ] point out, too, that guns and rifles can also be used to augment the food supply. For that reason they might well have been exempted from the sales tax. I am rather surprised that no protest against the application of such a high rate of sales tax to guns and rifles has been made by members of the Country party on behalf of primary producers who require firearms to exterminate pests. </para>
                    <para class="block">The imposition of sales tax on surf skis and surfboards is hard to understand in view of the need for such equipment for shark patrols and surf rescue work at beaches throughout the Commonwealth. Those items, too, should have been allowed to remain tax free. Item No, 14 in the fourth schedule is " Toys and parts for toys, Christmas stockings and Christmas crackers ". Surely the Government is getting down to the Scrooge level when it inflicts such a high rate of tales tax on those goods. Games and puzzles also are included. All of us remember the pleasure that we had in our childhood days from games such as ludo, snakes and ladders, and draughts. Are the children of to-day to be denied the pleasure of sitting around the fireside on cold nights playing those games? Are they to 'be driven to race-courses or startingprice shops for their recreation? The 834 per cent, rate will apply also to mouth organs, harmonicas, flageolets, or jews' harps and other musical instruments. Such instruments are, of course, used mainly by the children of working people. One seldom sees the child of a wealthy family playing a mouth organ. Such children have pianos. </para>
                    <para>T come now to the fifth schedule, which specifies the goods to which sales tax shall be applied at the rate of 50 per cent. They include toilet and beauty preparations and materials. No one can say that these things are luxuries in 1951. Over the years, womenfolk have become accustomed to using 'them. The average husband would find it very difficult indeed to persuade his wife that beauty preparations were luxuries and should be done without. In hot climates particularly items such as powders, are necessities. In the same schedule we find safety razors and safety razor blades. Does the Government want Australian men to be a hairy race like their prehistoric ancestors? Perhaps honorable senators opposite think that if Australian taxpayers are encouraged to let their hair grow over their eyes they will no longer be able to see what the Government is up to. Finally [ come to the articles which will carry the highest rate of sales tax, namely, 66§ per cent. They include jewellery and fancy goods, including imitation jewellery. I have never had much use for imitation jewellery but there are many young people in the community who like to adorn themselves with it. 1 remember reading some years ago of a woman who appeared in certain bankruptcy proceedings. When she was asked to state what jewellery she had, she said that, as she was known as an extremely wealthy woman she could wear imitation jewellery because everybody thought thai it was real. Many people like to adorn themselves with artificial jewellery but in future such jewellery will carry sales tax at the rate of 66f per cent. The final item with which I wish to deal is Item 3 of the Sixth Schedule, which includes party decorations and party novelties. I am wondering how honorable senators, opposite will appear if they hold a party on some future occasion. What kind of party caps will Ministers choose? One may wear a cap depicting gloom. Another may prefer one symbolizing smugness; but most fitting of all, in view of the provisions of this measure, will be the headdress of buccaneers. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government sales tax proposals were referred to so fully during the debate on the Estimates and budget papers that very little can be added at this stage. To deal with individual items as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> has done i? a waste of time. People can read these things for themselves. In any case, most of the items to which he referred are not necessities and the Australian people can avoid the impositions that those goods carry, if they so wish. I agree with the large number of Australian women who believe that indirect taxes, spread over the whole community, provide an excellent means not only to halt inflation but also to provide the budget surplus that is so desirable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> made the point that the Australian Government had promised to underwrite loans to the States for developmental works, and that that could only be done by means of a budget surplus. Therefore, there is no need for me to enlarge on that point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson,</inline> who was ably supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn,</inline> presented a dismal picture of the downtrodden Australian people, labouring under the burden of the sales tax. Whilst I realize that honorable senators opposite have not a very high opinion of economists generally, I shall quote the views of one authority, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> J. Donath of the faculty of Commerce and Economics of the University of Melbourne. In an article published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun Pictorial</inline> of the 2oth November, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donath</inline> asks the very sensible question, " Are we living better than we were in 1939?".

                        <para>Our intake of energy values in calories per head per day was already, pre-war, one of the highest in the world. Now it is 3,231 calories per day - an increase of nearly 4 per cent. </para>
                        <para>There is no doubt that the number of household aids which used to be considered luxuries has steadily increased; washing machines, vacuum cleaners, refrigerators and radiograms can be seen in far more homes than pre-war. </para>
                        <para>Another indication is the attendance at races, sports meetings and films - which certainly has not gone down. The number of students at the universities has more than doubled, and expensive public schools have long waiting lists, although their .fees have increased very considerably. </para>

                        <para>Nominally our incomes have gone up about 2£ times. There are, of course, large variations within the population. Last year wool-growers earned nearly 15 times as much as in 1939, while farming income as a whole was six-fold. </para>
                        <para>By now you may believe that the Commonwealth Statistician has correctly calculated that the " real " wage of the wage and salary earner has risen by about one-quarter. </para>
                        <para>In other words, we can buy about one quarter of commodities more than in 1939, and it must not be forgotten that this has been gained in spite of the desirable shorter working week. </para>

                        <para>I could add many more indications of our somewhat higher standard of living. Why. then is there such a widely spread feeling of frustration? Why does one hear so often that we were better off before the war? </para>

                    <para class="block">This tax is being spread over the whole community. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> has stated, and as I have said before, people do not need to buy luxury goods. However, I must record my protest once more about the imposition of sales tax on certain items of household goods that have been classed as luxuries. Refrigerators, sewing machines and cleaning machines are not luxuries. As domestic help is practically <inline font-style="italic">non est</inline> in this country, the housewives are entitled to them. They should not be placed beyond the reach of the housewives. I consider that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(.Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> would have been well advised, also, to exclude toilet accessories for men, women, and babies from sales tax. No man likes to go about looking like the great unshaven. He likes to be nice and neat and clean. No woman likes to go about without colour on her cheeks, and no baby likes to be uncomfortable because of the scant use of baby powder. In the interests of the morale of OU: people I hope that the Treasurer will review the incidence of sales tax on these items in due course. I consider that the imposition of sales tax on cultural items, such as musical instruments, photographic equipment and radios will react against the best interests and the education of our people. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> rightly pointed out, we are behind other countries culturally, and this will further aggravate the position.

The tax is not applicable to paper bags or paper wrapping, but would apply to hessian, cardboard or timber. Paper bags and wrapping paper are the only exceptions. The honorable senator has referred to the fact that cement is sold in paper containers. I point out that the cement itself is not taxable. </para>

Formerly, the exemption of educational films  was  confined to those which were imported into Australia and certified by the  Chief  Commonwealth Films Censor as being of an educational nature. Similar  films  are now made in Australia, and  the  object of the amendment is to extend  the  exemption to such films and thereby remove an anomaly. </para>

That addition will have the effect of exempting from sales tax the requirements of private hospitals which are not conducted for profit. The test to determine exemption or otherwise is whether the hospital is conducted for profit or not. If it is a private hospital, which is conducted by the matron or the proprietor for the purpose of making a profit, it must pay sales tax on the goods which it purchases. If, however, it is a hospital conducted by a religious body or a community group, not for the purpose of making a profit, it will receive the same benefit in regard to sales tax as public hospitals receive. </para>

                <para class="block">Cricket is a game in which most Australians participate either as players or spectators. It is our national game, yet it has been singled out by the Government for vicious and discriminatory taxation. I have here a letter written by the South Australian Cricket Association to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> protesting against the increased tax. The letter, which is dated the 2nd November, 1951, is as follows: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The committee of this association for itself, and on behalf of its member clubs, affiliated clubs, and the many thousands of cricketers throughout the State of South Australia, submits a respectful protest against the drastic increase of 25 per cent. in the sales tax on equipment used in connexion with outdoor sports and games generally. This applies particularly to the effect the impost will have upon cricket, which is possibly the hardest hit of all athletic sports in that the cost of cricket equipment (under reasonable trading conditions probably the most expensive of all field games in which the average use of the country participates) is at the present time almost prohibited. </para>
                    <para>Attached is an article taken from Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of November 1st, which emphasises this point. The figures quoted in this article are for top-class material and apply more particularly to the outfitting of an individual at his own expense. Even allowing for the fact that junior clubs use cheaper material and that some measure of relief in the way of discounts is given to such clubs, it will be readily seen what a tremendously increased burden has been imposed upon such bodies already labouring under the handicap of current inflationary prices without having to combat such a substantial increase as that recently imposed through taxation channels in providing the equipment essential to a continuance of their activities. </para>
                    <para>If the .present position is maintained it simply means that cricket and other healthy outdoor sport will languish and the youth of the community unable to afford participation in games which are taxed as " luxuries " and priced beyond their means, will be forced to spend their leisure hours in ways far less conducive to the health-giving and characterforming attributes associated with clean healthy sport. </para>
                    <para>To my committee it seems very regrettable that a government which on one hand gives its blessing and financial assistance to movements having for their object the promotion of the physical fitness of its young people, should on the other hand impose financial hardships to the point of the risk of extinction - upon the activities of the great army of honorary workers who give their time and energies to the cause of physical fitness by the encouragement of participation in healthy recreation by the young men and women of the country. </para>
                    <para>It is earnestly asked that the Commonwealth Government will give this matter its further consideration and that the former 8A per cent, tax levy will not be exceeded. </para>

No doubt that is true, but no one can deny that outdoor games such as cricket have also contributed to the physical and mental improvement of our young people. Therefore, I cannot understand why the Government has, by increasing sales tax on sporting equipment, placed it practically beyond the reach of a great many people. The tax on musical instruments has not been increased, whereas the tax on sporting equipment has been increased by 25 per cent. I hope that the Government will reconsider its decision, and that it will not hamper by unduly high taxation indulgence in healthy and characterbuilding sports. </para>

The increased tax was placed on ice-cream in order to divert milk from ice-cream to milk for making butter. There are two varieties of iceblocks, the one most popularly in demand being made purely of water and fruit juice. Why should sales tax be imposed upon such a confection?  It  seems absurd that the Government should impose a tax on water and fruit juices. </para>

Undoubtedly, the Government desires to extract the utmost from every possible source of revenue. It does not even give the kiddies a chance ! Will the Minister state whether ice-blocks made by the ordinary housewife, simply by freezing water in a refrigerator, and ice-blocks made by shopkeepers consisting of water and fruit juices, are subject to tax? How does the Government propose to ascertain the quantity of iceblocks that are made by small shopkeepers, and how does it propose to collect the tax on them ? Does it intend to appoint a team of inspectors to ascertain how many ice-blocks are made by each small shopkeeper? It should be a little realistic and remove ice-blocks from the schedule altogether. </para>

                    <para>. -  I support the request made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Piesse</inline> for the exemption of ammunition used for the. destruction of vermin. If that item were deleted from the schedule no great loss of revenue would be involved and a considerable benefit would be conferred on primary producers in Western Australia. Western Australia is different from the -closely settled States of New South Wales and Victoria. It has a very lengthy border which must be protected from the entry of vermin particularly of kangaroos, emus and foxes. The only effective way to prevent vermin from entering farms is by shooting. Emus can ruin a crop in one night. Primary producers living near the border protect not only their own properties but also the properties of other primary producers located at some distance from the border. If the Minister can see his way clear to grant this small benefit to Western Australian primary producers he will make a very large contribution to the efforts which they are making to rid the State of vermin. I warmly commend the proposal to his consideration. </para>

The owner of a motor oar is not compelled to carry home his or her purchases in shopping bags. Why should such a differentiation be made, having regard to the fact that shopping bags  are  a necessity for most housewives ? The same remarks apply to knitting hags. Those who travel in public conveyances will see many young persons carrying knitting bags containing articles of attire and the like in the making. Why should  these  two items be subject to such  a  steep increase of tax? " </para>

                    <para>1  11.7] . -  This is  a  set of circumstances in which I am, in truth, an Aunt Sally. It is easy for honorable senators to criticize individual items in the schedules. I remind them that all of those items have been included in the schedules throughout the years and variations have been made in the tax imposed on them from time to time. Honorable senators cannot consider the tax applicable to a specific item without looking at the background of the whole proposal. It is fair for me to say that, even though the ink on the budget is scarcely dry, it has already had a profound effect on the economy of Australia. It has already gone a considerable distance in checking inflation. </para>

                    is obviously a cricket enthusiast. I assure him that despite the increases of sales tax on sporting materials the game of cricket will continue. What he has said about cricket could be said as equally effectively by enthusiasts in other forms of sport for the exemption of the sporting goods in which they are interested. The increase of sales tax on sporting materials from 8$ per cent, to 33;V per cent, brings the rate applied in this country on a parity with that applicable in Great Britain. There was no diminution of cricketing activities in Great Britain as a result of the increase on sales tax on cricketing materials in that country and I am sure that Australian cricketers will not be deterred by this proposal.

                    <para>- When the Labour Government was in power this country was facing the gravest crisis in its history and all our efforts were concentrated on saving the country and the skin of the Minister. In the second schedule, item 1, the Government has given the worst example of class distinction that has come before the Parliament. It has not raised the sales tax on utility vehicles because they are good enough for the worker to use to ride to work or for a man to take his kiddies for a ride. I.f he wants to ride in decent comfort he has to pay sales tax on a. car. In the past the working man found that a tourer was the cheapest form of motor car but even that is not free of the higher sales tax. The working man can have the privilege of riding in a hearse because that is not regarded as a pleasure ride but at the rate inflation is progressing a ride in a hearse will be a pleasure. The Minister has claimed that the budget is anti-inflationary. On the contrary, it has increased the rate of inflation. Every time the sales tax is raised, inflation must become worse. </para>

                        <para>- I inquired about the price of motor cars recently and found that they have gone up by about £1G0. If the honorable senator can tell the committee where a new motor car can be bought at a reduced price, honorable senators would be pleased to get the information. Even if they were cheaper, that does not justify the Government in increasing the sales tax. It even proposes to increase the sales tax on station wagons which cart in produce. Every time the sales tax is increased on such vehicles inflation becomes worse because the price to the consumer is increased. The Government claims that only luxury goods are subject to sales tax. Is preserved ginger a luxury? It is a food used in every kitchen. </para>

                        <para>- There are many things the honorable senator can do without, but he has enough money to enable him to avoid denying himself. He does not care about the person who has no money. I suppose that he will say that, the little kiddies can do without their ice-cream and their ice-blocks. They are the luxuries on which the Government is imposing extra sales tax! It is not content with taxing wealthy men and women who can fight for themselves, and so it deprives the innocent little children, who cannot defend themselves, of ice creams. Can honorable senators imagine anything more miserable? Perhaps contemptible would be the correct word to use. It shows to what depths the Government will go when the Minister states that the budget has had a profound effect already. Of course it has. The poor little child who goes to buy an ice cream knows that. So does the man who buys a motor car. The Government attacks every child who goes to school by taxing school requisites. I worked hard to give my son an education and I know how difficult the struggle is for the working class. This unsympathetic Government virtually says, "We know that you and your wife are going without pleasures so that you can give your children an education but nevertheless we will slap a little more sales tax on the school requisites ". That is "the profound effect" that the budget is having on the community. The Government should adjourn the debate and go through the schedule again to ascertain if some of these goods could not be freed of sales tax. It is no excuse to say that the Government must have money. It has planned for a surplus of £114,500,000. There is no need to tax the kiddies' ice creams and pencils. When the Government taxes fishing requisites it is driving at an industry that the Labour Government did its best to foster. Now this Government is trying to kill the fishing industry. The higher sales tax on fishing equipment will, of course, be passed on by the fishermen, and will be reflected in the higherprices for fish. </para>

                    said that he could not guarantee that there would be any reduction of the sales tax on cricket equipment, and that, despite my protestations the game of cricket would probably continue to be as popular as ever. That reply was typical of the self-assured expressions that enamate  from the ministerial bench in answer to submissions made from this side of the chamber. I should like to know why the taxation eagles have decided that the sales tax on cricket equipment should be raised so drastically from 8$ per cent, to 33$ per cent. Clearly, cricket has been deemed to be a luxury pastime and, consequently, sporting materials used in connexion with cricket, are regarded by the Government as nonessential. I challenge the Government to submit the matter to the test by holding a. referendum. A malicious and vicious attack has been made on this sport. Gear used in connexion with cricket is to be taxed at a higher rate- than gear used in connexion with other sports. The Minister endeavoured to raise a smokescreen by stating that equipment used in connexion with cricket in Great Britain-

                            <para>- I consider that the bill should be rejected because of its iniquitous provisions. Undue hardship will be imposed on the community. Sales tax is to be imposed on many articles that were not included in the previous schedule of articles subject to sales tax. That will force up the cost of living in no uncertain manner. Heavy indirect taxation is to be imposed in relation to many items that are needed by the workers of this country. The rate of sales tax on a number of articles has been increased from 8$ per cent, to 12$ per cent. In 1949 the former Labour Government reduced the general rate of sales tax from 12$ per cent, to 8$ per cent. This Government definitely promised the people that it would reduce indirect taxation. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to mention a matter, even at this late hour, because, according to newspaper reports, it seems that the present sessional period will soon end. I have mentioned the subject to which I now wish to refer many times by means of questions in the Senate. I refer to the payment of Joint Organization funds to primary producers who sold their wool during war-time. I appreciate that the Ministers concerned have answered my questions to the best of their ability, and I am grateful for the information that I have been given. Some three or four months ago the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> stated that legislation would be introduced during the current sessional period to enable the payment of such money to be made to persons who have left the industry. A little more than two years ago, £25,000,000 of this money was distributed to growers whose wool was acquired under the war-time legislation. Shortly after that, legal proceedings were commenced in the High Court of Australia because of the fact that buyers who had bought wool privately, and the growers who had sold their wool to them, contend that that they are entitled to the Joint Organization funds. Until that litigation is concluded and the judgment of the High Court is given, the Government considers that no finality can be reached in the matter. It should be remembered, however, that people who sold their wool under the scheme are leaving the industry month by month. It is no exaggeration to say that many of them could very well do with the money. In many instances, they are people who have retired on account of age. Even farmers do not live for ever. I believe that the Government could do something to assist such people by means of an interim payment. I appreciate that nothing can be done now during the present sittings of the Parliament, but the Cabinet will meet after the Parliament rises and I hope that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture will again consider what can be done to make an interim payment to persons who have left the industry. </para>

                    <para>The Government holds £65,500,000 on behalf of the wool-growers of Australia. The final amount available  for distribution  will,  of course, not be known until the cost of buildings and other installations has been assessed, but I suggest that the Government could easily distribute a portion of that sum. Those who have retired front the industry should be given somepayment, even if only an amount equivalent  to  that which they received previously. I appreciate that some  wool-growers do  not want the money this year because  it will  add  to  their tax liability, but others do. An equivalent payment to  all  wool-growers would account for only about £25,000,000. No doubt some people  will  say that it will not be possible  to  locate many of those who have left the industry. I suggest that if the Government advertises, either over the air or in the newspapers, the fact that a distribution is  to  be made, those who are still living will very soon come forth. The executors of deceased estates will also make application. In my opinion, it would not be difficult for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to ascertain the whereabouts of the persons concerned. </para>
