                        <para>- fis the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture aware that an announcement was made some weeks ago to the effect that it was expected that considerable quantities of North American apples would be imported by the United Kingdom between the 6th December, 1951, and the 12th April, 1952, the end of which period will dangerously coincide with the commencement of the market which Australia expects for its apples in the United Kingdom? My information is that the probable quantity of North American imports will be approxi mately 1,750,000 boxes. Is the Minister in a position to state whether a reply has been forthcoming from the British Ministry of Food to the representations which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture recently made for the protection of Australian interests in the United Kingdom apple market? </para>

                        <para>- I preface a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer by stating that because of the increased costs of commodities of all kinds at the present time, the people of Australia are now obliged to carry with them a greater bulk of money which involves additional work for persons who work behind counters and in banks. I suggest to the Minister that a great deal of time could be  saved  in the counting and sorting of currency if 5s. notes were available. Will the Minister make representations to the Treasurer in order to ascertain whether it is possible for 5s. notes to be printed and issued for circulation throughout the Commonwealth? </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. The day before yesterday, there was published in the press a paragraph which stated that the Ministry for Defence in Great Britain had announced that the total strength of Britain's armed forces at home and overseas on the 1st October last wa3 840,200. _ The question has been asked in this Senate and elsewhere whether Australia is bearing its fair share of the burden of Empire defence. We have embarked upon a very expensive recruiting campaign, and have introduced compulsory military training. It would be of interest to the people to learn just what is being achieved in the way of defence preparations. If we are doing our bit it should be a matter for satisfaction; if we are not, the knowledge might act as a spur to recruiting. Therefore, I ask the Minister what was the total strength of Australian armed forces serving abroad and at home on the 1st October. 1951 ? How many women were serving in the forces? "What was the number of nurses and of civilians directly employed by the armed forces? Will he statu the number of persons, both men and women, serving in the Royal Australian Navy, the Army and the Royal Australian Air Force, respectively? </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General whether it is a fact that a radio programme known as ' " Hawaii Calls ", which is broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission each week, was made and produced in Hawaii? Seeing that the Australian Broadcasting Commission purchased this programme from a private source in Sydney, will the Minister ascertain whether any dollars were allocated for its purchase? Will the Minister also find out whether this programme was cleared by the customs authorities for importation into Australia? Is it a fact that the price paid by the Australian Broadcasting Commission for the programme each week is £30, and seeing that a sum of £100 would have to be paid to Australian artists to put on a similar programme in Australia, will the Minister say whether it is the policy of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to import cheap, culturally useless and inartistic programmes whilst Australian artists are deprived of employment ? </para>

                        <para>- The News and Information Bureau of the Department of the Interior issues an excellent publication, <inline font-style="italic">South-West Pacific,</inline> in very small numbers. Copies are distributed gratis in Australia and overseas to a very small number of persons. If the number issued were increased and the publication were offered for public sale., it seems likely that the estimated printing cost of 3s. could be considerably reduced. The publication is not only of great value as a4 advertising medium, but it would also be of educational value to Australians who are not well informed about conditions in the South-West Pacific. Will the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior consider increasing the circulation of the publication to the extent that would enable it to be "sold to the general public in Australia and overseas? </para>

In view of the coincidence of that announcement with the declaration made by Senator Morrow in this chamber last night that the party of which he is a member has for its objective the establishment of Russian socialism, otherwise communism, I ask- </para>

                        <para>- Order! Senator Morrow may make a personal explanation later. Before Senator Wright proceeds, I ask honorable senators to confine their remarks to questions. Honorable senators are developing a habit of making practically second-reading speeches. If question time is to be utilized to the best advantage every honorable senator should have time to ask his question. The longer individual senators take to preface questions, the shorter the time that is left for other honorable senators to ask questions. I ask honorable senators, therefore, to frame their questions concisely and to the point. </para>

                            <para>- By way of personal explanation I desire to refer to a question that Senator Wright addressed to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) this morning. He said that during my speech last night I had stated that Labour's objective was Russian socialism. That is untrue. What I said last night was that our objective is the socialization of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. I still stand by that. </para>

These supplies are obtained through the detail issues depot of the Department of the Army and are supplied by Army contractors. Supplies for the constructional personnel are arranged by the Department of Works and Housing and there has been some difficulty in obtaining supplies over the last six weeks. However, this shortage has now been overcome and supplies at present are adequate. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949, so as to provide quick and effective machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes and for the making of awards for employees of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric undertaking. Although the principal act provides that nothing in the act shall prevent the making of an. industrial award or agreement under any act in relation to officers or employees of the authority, the circumstances in which the work of the authority is being carried on are such that no suitable Commonwealth or State machinery is at present available for the handling of industrial disputes in which the authority may become involved. The employees of the Snowy Mountains Authority follow a wide variety of callings. Normally, both the employees and the authority, as their employer, would use the facilities of the Commonwealth </para>
                    <para>Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. Although, under the principal act, the authority is not denied approach to the court, such approach cannot be made unless a genuine interstate industrial dispute exists or is pending. The work of the authority is at present completely in New South Wales and at no time will more than a comparatively small part of its work extend across the border into Victoria. More than twenty unions include employees of the authority in their members. Most, but not all, of those unions have federal registration. Any and all of the federal unions may have, or may create, an interstate dispute which affects the classes of workers for which they provide, where they would have access to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for the settlement of such dispute. The authority is not in a position to do that. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator has a statutory jurisdiction wide enough to embrace the employees of the authority, but not the employees of contractors to the authority. Moreover, federal registration is a pre-requisite to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the PublicService Arbitrator. The authority being a body established under a law of the Commonwealth, neither it nor its employees fall within the jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission of New South. Walesor of the wages boards of Victoria. </para>
                    <para>Pending the provision of appropriate industrial machinery, the authority has been observing three Commonwealth awards and seventeen awards of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales, though not bound by them. The main object of the bill, therefore, is to provide for all employees of the authority, and for the authority itself , ready access to one industrial tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes and for the making of awards. The tribunal that has been selected for this purpose is a single judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Honorable senators will remember that this provision is similar to the provision that was made under the Stevedoring Industry Act 1949 for a single judge of the court toexercise jurisdiction in the stevedoring industry. </para>
                    <para>Persons employed by contractors and sub-contractors of the authority work side by side, to a large degree, with employees of the authority. A. considerable amount of construction work will' be carried out by contract. For the sake of industrial harmony, it is very desirable that, in such areas as may be specified where these conditions apply, jurisdiction to settle industrial disputes should be vested in one tribunal. The bill specifies the tribunal to have such jurisdiction. </para>
                    <para>The main purpose of the bill is to be found in clause 7, which provides for the insertion of new Part IVa.  -  Industrial Matters in the principal act. That part defines contractors, sub-contractors and employees, and it also defines the specified area in which a court will have jurisdiction to settle industrial disputes which affect persons employed by contractors and sub-contractors. As I have said, the hill provides for a single judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to exercise the powers of a court under the act. It is proposed that, in exercising the powers of the court, the single judge shall have regard to any order or award of the Full Court in respect of standard hours, basic wages for males and females, annual leave, sick leave and long service leave. The bill provides for application of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to matters arising under the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act in the same manner as the Conciliation and Arbitration Act applies to matters arising under that act. Similar provision is contained in the Stevedoring Industry Act of 1949. The persons employed by the authority comprise officers, temporary officers, and temporary and casual employees. The principal act does not define a temporary officer or a temporary or casual employee. This bill defines a temporary officer and an employee and provides for temporary officers the same privileges of approach to industrial tribunals as are enjoyed by officers. In effect, the bill preserves to officers and temporary officers access to the Public Service Arbitrator, as well as to other industrial tribunals. </para>
                    <para>The fact that those employed under the Snowy Mountains scheme are drawn from so many different industrial unions and work more  or  less side by side in a somewhat isolated area, living,  in  many  instances,  under camp conditions, makes it especially desirable,  in  the Government's view, that industrial relations throughout the scheme should, as far as possible,  be  under the control  of  one authority and prescribed by something  in  the nature of an industrial award. That  is  precisely what the bill sets out  to  accomplish. </para>
                    <para>In introducing the bill, the Government  is  earnestly endeavouring  to  provide for the greatest efficiency and harmony  between  the authority and its employees. The authority has conferred with representatives  of  the Australian Workers Union and the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council. The union representatives with whom the authority conferred urged very strongly the provision  of  appropriate industrial machinery for the Snowy Mountains at the earliest possible  date.  I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill, together with the Wool (Contributory Charge) Bill (No. 1) and the Wool (Contributory Charge) Bill (No. 2) is to exempt certain classes of wool from the contributory charge on wool. As the three bills deal with related matters, I propose to discuss them all in my second-reading speech. Since 1946, a contributory charge has been levied on all wool sold in Australia or exported in order to provide money for the purposes of the United KingdomDominion wool disposals plan and for promoting the use of wool. Previously, money required for wool use promotion wa3 raised by a wool tax imposed by the Wool Tax Act 1936-1945. The wool tax remains in suspense while the contributory charge is in force. </para>
                    <para>The contributory charge was also used in the 1950-51 wool season to raise money to provide growers' capital for a plan of reserve prices for wool in anticipation of wool-growers generally approving the proposed plan. This portion of the contributory charge amounted to <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent. The total charge in 1950-51 was 7-J per cent., the remaining -fc per cent, being for the purposes of the wool disposals plan and wool use promotion. </para>
                    <para>Operations in Australia under the wool disposals plan were virtually completed in the 1950-51 season and, on the 24th August, it was announced that the reserve price plan had been defeated at a referendum of growers. The need for the continuance of the contributory charge was therefore removed as money for wool use promotion could be raised, once again, by the wool tax. However, a sudden changeover from the contributory charge to the woo] tax within a few days of the beginning of the 1951-52 wool selling season, which began on the 27th August, was not practicable. It would also have meant that an estimated £75,000 would not have been collected on wool already in store, as contributory charge is payable when wool is  sold, and wool tax is payable at the time of delivery of wool into store. The Government, therefore, decided that the contributory charge should continue during the  1951-52  wool selling season, but only at such a rate as would yield approximately the same amount as the wool tax, which at the time of its suspension was 2s. a bale. It was estimated that a rate of one-eighth of  1  per cent. would produce this amount. </para>
                    <para>Wool tax applied only to shorn wool, and the Government decided that contributory charge should also apply only to shorn wool, in  1951-52,  although hitherto it has applied to shorn wool, dead wool, skin wool and wool on sheepskins when exported. The Government, therefore, requested the Commissioner of Taxation to grant administrative exemption to dead wool, skin wool and wool on sheepskins until such time as the necessary legislative arrangements could be made. The primary purpose of the three bills to which I have referred is to give legislative authority for those exemptions. This purpose will be achieved by amending the definition of " wool " in the Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Acf so as to exclude such wools from the scope of the charge at its new rate. It is proposed that this amendment, which if included in the Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Bill, should be operative on and from the 27th August,  1951.  the date of commencement of the current wool selling season. Consideration is now being given to the arrangements necessary for a complete change-over from the contributory charge to the wool tax at a convenient time. </para>

                <para class="block">I explained the general purpose of this bill in my second-reading speech on the Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Bill. This measure repeals section 7 of the Wool (Contributory Charge) Acts (No. 1) 1950, which authorized the imposition of a levy on wool sold in Australia and made it part of the contributory charge. The levy was fixed at7½ per cent. and was for the purpose of providing funds for growers' capital in the proposed minimum reserve price plan. Collection of the levy ceased on the 30th June, 1951, and, as the reserve price plan was not approved by growers at the recent referendum, the levy is no longer required. Section 7 contained a definition of " wool " which is not consistent with the definition now proposed in the Wool (Contributory Charge) Assessment Bill. In view of this, it is proposed that that section be repealed with effect from the 27th August, 1951. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to establish an authority to purchase tea abroad, to import it, and to sell it to primary wholesalers. The new authority, which will bc called the Tea Importation Board, will take the place of the present Tea Control Board, which was established under National Security Regulations, and which thus depends for its authority on the defence powers of the Commonwealth. When the Tea Control Board was established it was given much wider powers than are necessary to-day, and although the board dealt primarily with matters of procurement and first distribution, it was indirectly concerned in secondary and retail distribution, the establishment of security stocks, rationing and the fixation of maximum and minimum prices. That board consisted of three representatives of the wholesale tea trade, a representative of retailers, a representative of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, a representative of the Department of Supply and Development, the Director of Rationing, the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner as  deputy chairman,  and the Minister for Trade and Customs, as  chairman.  The functions of the proposed new authority will, as I have mentioned, be confined to the purchase, importation and first distribution of tea. There is now no need for such a large board as the present one, and it is proposed that the new board will consist of a  chairman,  a representative of the wholesale tea trade, a representative of the Treasury, and the Tea Controller. </para>
                    <para>The reasons for the existence of any authority to handle tea are twofold. In the first place, there is an un steadiness in the price of tea in producing countries, and consequential difficulties in maintaining supplies. Australian consumption of tea is about 60,000,000 lb. per annum, which costs approximately £15,000,000, of which the Government contributes slightly more than half in the form of subsidy. In the two years before the war the average importations were 47,000,000 lb. at an average cost of £3,000,000 per annum. It will be seen that there has been a big increase in consumption, as well as in cost. About half of Australia's requirement is purchased on forward contracts at fixed prices, and the remainder at auction, or by private treaty, at current prices. In an unstable market, private enterprise would be hesitant about entering into forward contracts, and there would be a danger of periodical or even continued shortages, or of a lowering of the quality standard. In the absence of forward contracts, the bulk of supplies would be purchased at auction, and the local distributors would be competing with one another and forcing prices up against themselves and against the interests of Australian consumers. Until the tea market settles down, the best interests of Australia will be served by a single purchasing authority. </para>
                    <para>In the second place, tea is heavily subsidized. The present subsidy is about 2s. 6d. per lb. It would not be possible to continue this subsidy and to maintain uniform prices throughout the Commonwealth except by a process of averaging costs. When it is remembered that requirements would be of different types, purchased at different prices, by different people, in different countries, and at different times of the year, the task of averaging would be a practical impossibility. If purchasing were in the hands of various importers, either the uniform price or the uniform subsidy would have to be abandoned. </para>
                    <para>During the present year tea has been sold by the Tea Control Board at a uniform price of 2s. 8id. per lb. Some of that tea has cost as much as 6s. per lb. in the producing country, and some as low as 4s. per lb. A uniform subsidy would result in a payment of a certain sum per lb. on all types of tea imported  and would impose on the State prices authorities the responsibility of continually changing prices in order to reflect changes in costs. On the other hand, the maintenance of a uniform price would necessitate the adoption of a subsidy system, with payments varying with costs and grades, and the establishment of a checking and testing organization at all Australian ports. The Government could not agree to a subsidy system which would involve it in unlimited liability, nor would it favour the establishment in all ports of the checking and testing organization that would be necessary to operate a fluctuating subsidy scheme. The subsidy plan can operate only as long as the Government controls the purchasing of tea. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides machinery for the smooth transfer of control from the Tea Control Board to the Tea Importation Board, and contains the usual provisions for staff and finance. It is the policy of this Government to abandon controls, where such a course is possible, and to vacate the field of tea procurement at the earliest possible moment. As soon  as  conditions become more stable, the tea industry will be asked to take over the task of supplying requirements. For that reason the bill will have a limited life. It will expire on the 30th June, 1952, unless the Governor-General exercises powers embodied in the bill to extend it for periods not exceeding one year at a time. The necessity to continue the control will, therefore, be reviewed periodically so that it may be abandoned as soon as possible. </para>

To ease the cost of tea for the Australian user, the Government is purchasing tea overseas at the normal world price and reselling it at -a lower price within Australia. In effect, a subsidy is thus paid. Tea is exported from Australia mainly as ships' stores and it is not equitable that tea consumed or sold outside the Commonwealth be obtained at concessional prices which are intended only for local consumers. If provision were not made for the recovery of the difference between the domestic price of tea in Australia and the cost to the Tea Importation Board, the result would be that any overseas consumers who obtained tea from Australia would be in receipt of the price subsidy from the Commonwealth Government. The bill is commended to the favorable attention of honorable senators. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators no doubt know that the collection of excise duty on beer is by means of beer duty stamps sold to brewers and by the affixation of stamps of appropriate value to the casks or, in respect of bottled beer, to the covering cart note. The proposed amendment of section 26 will dispose of any doubt which previously may have arisen consequent on an alteration of the tariff and where some beer had been duly stamped  and invoiced, but had not been delivered from the premises of the brewery. By the amendment, statutory authority will be given to the department to operate the changed rates of duty in respect of such undelivered beer, despite the fact that the requisite stamping had already been completed. The amending clause is virtually a drafting measure as current practice is in no way altered. </para>
                    <para>A provision of the act charges various persons, according to the circumstances, with the responsibility for cutting the duty stamps affixed to casks containing beer. This act of cutting must be performed at the time of the opening of the vessel. The administration of the section concerned - section 37 - has brought to light an anomaly which it is now sought to remove. Although the failure to cut beer stamps affixed to casks which had been tapped constituted an offence if the omission were discovered in course of return transit to a brewery, no liability resulted if the failure to cut the stamp were discovered after the vessel had been returned to brewery premises. The amendment removes the anomaly. </para>
                    <para>Another difficulty associated with the cutting of stamps arose in instances where hotelkeepers sold beer to customers by the cask. The sale did not relieve the publican of the responsibility placed on him by the law for any omission to cut the stamp, as required, although the beer at the time of opening might well have been beyond his physical control. The amendment provides for the cutting of the stamp immediately prior to delivery by the hotelkeeper in such cases on condition that appropriate written records are kept by him. </para>
                    <para>Under section 61 of the act it is an offence for beer to be bottled, except in a brewery, for the purpose of sale unless every bottle is labelled as prescribed. Occasionally the department has been handicapped in proceedings taken for failure to attach labels because of the difficulty in proving that the beer had been bottled for sale, despite the obvious intention. The proposal to omit the words, " for the purpose of sale " will ease the difficulty in this connexion. </para>

                    <para>. - The estimated expenditure on the High Commissioner's Office in the United Kingdom for the current financial year represents an increase of more than £18,000 over actual expenditure last year. Are we to believe from those figures that the present High Commissioner is to be £18,000 more expensive than his predecessor? Surely in these times, when taxes on individuals are being raised and some social services payments are being scaled down, an increase of £18,000 in expenditure on the High Commissioner's Office may be regarded as somewhat excessive. </para>

                        <para>- No, but if salaries in Great Britain have increased sufficiently to warrant additional expenditure of £18,000 in the High Commissioner's Office, surely the United Kingdom is headed for a financial crisis much more serious than that existing in this country, and, as we all know, conditions are bad enough here. Perhaps the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> who has just interjected, can tell me whether the additional money sought this year is required solely to meet salary increases, or whether extra staff has been engaged to meet the needs of the present High Commissioner. Is any portion of the increase to be used to provide more amenities for the High Commissioner? I am not talking merely for talking's sake. These are things that the public wants to know. If the additional expenditure can be justified, I shall have no objection to it, but if it cannot be . justified, then we in this chamber have a perfect right to criticize it. </para>

                    <para>. -  The questions that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has asked can be readily answered. There has been no increase of staff at the High Commissioner's Office. However, there has been an all-round increase of wages, varying from 15 per cent, on the lower salaries to 1 per cent, on the higher salaries. The Estimates were prepared prior to the presentation of the Pinner report, which is expected to result in a reduction of staff by 102. A substantial proportion of the increased vote is attributable to the fact that 68 employees whose salaries previously were paid by other departments, are now being paid by the Prime Minister's Department. </para>

                    <para>. -  I should like some information in relation to certain items of expenditure under the vote for the High Commissioner's Office in the United Kingdom. Last year, £27,521 was expended under the heading, "Purchase of leases of official residences, including legals costs and renovations ". This year £4,160 is being allocated for the upkeep of official residences. In addition, an allowance of £2,510 is to be made to the High Commissioner for the expenses of the official residence. I understand that that money is required for the payment of salaries to employees at the residences, but it would appear that an allocation of £4,160 is rather large for the upkeep of residences on which. £27,521 was expended last year. I should like to know whether that £4,160 is likely to be an annual charge? </para>

                    <para>.- The vote for the Prime Minister's  Department  includes the sum of £209,000 for the Commonwealth Office of Education. I should like to know what are the functions of that office? Education is primarily a responsibility of the States, and I have always been opposed to the encroachment of the Commonwealth on fields of State jurisdiction. I should like to know how the sum of £209,0Q0 can usefully be expended on education, when the States are already expending many millions of pounds annually in that field. The vote includes provision for such matters as " General educational and cultural activities ". Such work is already being done by the States. Another item is "Research projects ". That, too. is a State job. Then we have " Publications ". I do not know what kind of publications the Commonwealth Office of Education issues, but already the State is well established in that field. Another item is " Teaching aids " - again a State responsibility. The only items under the heading " Miscellaneous " for which I can see justification so far as the Commonwealth is concerned are " Adult education projects - Northern Territory ", and " United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization - expenses ". The vote includes a substantial sum for salaries and allowances and travelling expenses, and I should like to know just what the Commonwealth hopes to achieve  in  return for this estimated expenditure of £209,000. As I have already said, education is a head of power that is reserved to the States, and I should like to know whether the Commonwealth would be seriously hindered if its expenditure on education were abandoned entirely. </para>

                    <para>. - if  had intended to cover some of the ground that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> has covered. I believe that there is a place for a Commonwealth office of education, but its functions should be specified clearly. In the past there has undoubtedly been some duplication of Commonwealth and State activities in this field. "While I was at the New South' Wales Teachers' College in Sydney we had officials coming to make intelligence tests from the State Department of Education and also from the Commonwealth. I believe that lt is the duty of education directors of both the Commonwealth and of the States to confer with a view to eliminating such duplication. I have had experience of the disabilities that exist because of the lack of a common teacher's certificate. I do not suggest that the Commonwealth authorities should attempt arbitrarily to introduce such a certificate but surely that could be done in collaboration with the education directors in the various States. When I was an examiner in the Department of Education in New South Wales, one of the greatest difficulties that confronted the department was to decide the conditions on which teachers from other States could be admitted to the New South Wales teaching service. I was greatly concerned about the matter, because, after we had laid down certain canons, we found that good teachers in other States bad not acquired qualifications equal to those required by us. There was a time when Victoria had only one year's training, but New South Wales provided for a -second year. I consider that the time has arrived for housecleaning and agreement between the Commonwealth and the authorities in the various States on what may be done. I do not subscribe to the frequently expressed view that the Office of Education should be abolished. Its functions should be clearly defined and the -educational activities of the States co-ordinated in order to obviate duplication, and so that die Commonwealth wil-1 not seek to exercise authority in connexion with the functions of the States. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not consider that there should T)e a reduction of expenditure on the Office of Education. The Commonwealth has a very great responsibility in the sphere of education, which is very important to our national life. This is one 'of the few matters on which there is not a national policy. Children in the various States are being educated to become citizens of States instead of citizens of Australia. </para>

                <para>During the last financial year, £1,121 was expended on adult education projects in the Northern Territory, but there is to be no allocation for that purpose during this financial year. Does that mean that the adults of the Northern Territory have reached saturation point in education, or has the Office of Education given up the job as hopeless ? There must be some reason for the complete wiping out of the financial provision for adult education in the Northern Territory. It is false economy to curtail expenditure on education. Rather should the pruning knife be applied in other directions. </para>
                <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> that it is time that the whole field of education in Australia should be investigated and placed on a proper national footing. There should be a standard between the States in relation to teachers. The position in relation to the professions is ridiculous. There is no reciprocity between the universities .and the training colleges. In some instances professional men who are qualified to practise in one State -may not practise in another. Nurses who are qualified to nurse in one State are not qualified to nurse in another State, while those who begin their training in one State must start all over again if it becomes necessary for them to move to another State. The Office of Education ^should carry out a good deal of research work. Honorable senators could, with advantage, pay more attention to what is being done in the Office of Education in the very limited sphere in which it can work. The proposed vote should be increased considerably. This is one sphere of Commonwealth activity that could be productive of much .good for the community as a whole. Its activities should be widened in order to develop an Australian spirit in education generally. </para>

In the absence of such justification, I submit that we are doing a disservice by interfering with functions that are the preserves of the States. The States are jealous of the jurisdiction which they exercise over educational matters. Whilst education is too often made the plaything of party politics in the States, the people of the States have sufficient sagacity to select their own parliamentarians. I am concerned that the right of the States to control public life and administration within their borders shall be preserved to them.

                <para>What concerns me is that education, whether administered by Labour or nonLabour governments, has not progressed as quickly as it should have done. It is apparent from these estimates that certain functions of the Commonwealth Office of Education are to be curtailed and that expenditure during this financial year will be less than it was in the last financial year. In the light of constantly increasing costs, to my mind that is alarming. I have no objection to economy provided that a real saving is effected. When one turns to the proposed vote for the Commonwealth Office of Education, it will be seen that the estimated expenditure for this financial year for salaries and payments ' in the nature of salary is £171,000, compared with an actual expenditure of £226,735 last year. I point out that the actual expenditure last year exceeded the estimated expenditure by £36,735. It is disturbing to note that salaries and payments in the nature of salary are to be curtailed this year, and I trust that that does not mean that the activities of the office will also be curtailed. </para>
                <para>It is also apparent that the general expenses listed under section b are to be decreased. I  appreciate  that education lends itself to the employment of temporary and casual teachers, and I hope that the Government will appreciate that the salaries of temporary and casual employees will continue to rise. Salaries and payments in the nature of salary to temporary and casual employees last year amounted to £106,318, whereas the estimated expenditure for this financial year is only £64,000. </para>
                <para>I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> in the hope that the educational projects in the Northern Territory will not be prejudiced because the schedule makes no provision for expenditure in that connexion during the present financial year. It is, of course, the duty of the Government to curtail expenditure wherever possible, but it should not do so at the risk of destroying the value of previous efforts to improve educational standards in this country, I say to honorable senators who habitually speak of the rights of the </para>

I support the contention that if we are to have a Commonwealth Office of Education its functions should be limited to coordinating the educational standards which apply in the various States, as far as both the children in the schools and their teachers are concerned. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>If honorable senators turn to the schedule of salaries and allowances at page 144, they will see a list of the positions within the Office of Education. I suggest that they will find it difficult to understand why so many officers should be employed on the simple task of coordination. The officers include a director, two assistant directors - there were three last year - an assistant secretary and six officers in charge. I take it that there is an officer in charge in each of the six States. If that is correct, it is hard to understand why such a staff is necessary in order merely to co-ordinate educational activities in the various States. The list also includes 45 education officers, including a cadet officer, 40 officers designated as accountant and chief clerk, sub-accountant, senior clerk, accountants and clerks, and 35 others who are described as typists, librarian and assistants. It seems to me that there is some ground to support the contention that has been made by some honorable senators that this office is exceeding the functions of co-ordination for which it was established and is engaging in a sphere which should be left to the States. </para>
                <para>Also on page 144, reference is made to allowances to officers performing duties of a higher class, officers on loan from other departments and on unattached list, district allowance, cost of living, United </para>
                <para class="block">Kingdom allowance, and exchange on salary paid abroad. Why this office should need to have an officer stationed in the United Kingdom is difficult to understand. I admit that I speak in ignorance of the matter, and if an explanation can be given concerning the activities of that officer I shall be glad to hear it. </para>
                <para>I hope that no attempt is being made to encroach on the activities of the State Departments of Education which, in my opinion, have successfully performed educational functions in the past and are capable of doing so in the future. </para>

I should be loath at any time to condemn expenditure that is made in the interests of education in Australia. Too little is being done at the present time, and I consider that whatever the Australian Government may be able to do to further education will be worthwhile. Honorable senators have heard the extraordinary statement to-day that this Parliament is trying to make all the children of Australia little citizens of Canberra. I suggest that people who make statements such as that obviously need a great deal more education. I confess that I am not up to date concerning the functions of the Office of Education, but I can visualize the important task that such a body might perform. I am not satisfied that the educational authorities in the various States are so completely aware of all the problems concerning education that the Commonwealth Parliament should not devote a small amount of the proposed vast expenditure for this financial year to the solution of some of those problems. </para>

                <para>I, too, wish to refer to the item concerning adult education projects in the Northern Territory. Last year £6,000 was voted for that purpose, and only £1,121 was expended. I take it that almost £5,000 remains in hand, but I should like to know why. if it was thought that £6^000 could usefully be expended last year and was voted by the Parliament, a much smaller sum was in fact spent. I consider that the Northern Territory is an area in which the Commonwealth might do much more in the way of education than is being done at the present time. </para>

                    <para>. - I believe that the State governments have systematically and consistently financially starved their departments of education. For that reason, I consider it is time that the Australian Government took a stand in the matter. A nation's greatest asset is its trained and educated men and women. When we find that departments of education are being starved by politicians who are only halfeducated at most, we can appreciate the handicap under which those departments labour. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> has said, our education system needs to be revised. The present system is based mainly on deductive reasoning. Our students are not taught to reason inductively in order to ascertain the truth of the problems with which they are confronted and which they are required to solve. The result is that the community has not been educated to the degree that is desirable. That is' why the Chifley Government introduced a scheme to assist students who had matriculated. </para>

If sufficient attention had been paid to education in the States that would not have been necessary. When I was president of the Melbourne Technical College in 1938, I suggested that the thousands of young people who were idling their time away in the streets should be enrolled as technical students, paid the basic wage, and trained for various occupations ; but then, as now, the cry was that the money was not available. Then, when the war broke out, we had to undertake the joh that should have been done before. </para>

                <para>This Government has introduced a depression budget, and proposes to starve education in the interests of wealthy taxpayers. That sort of thing will continue so long as we have in power governments which put the interests of the wealthy before its obligation to the young people growing up. Instead of the grant for education being reduced it should be increased. Unless something is done in that direction we shall be worse off in the event of another war than we were in  1939,  because there will not be available enough trained men and women. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> that we should enlarge our education system. Experts in education should be consulted, and t" them, rather than to governments, should be allotted the task of drawing up curriculums worthy of the name.

                    <para>.- The proposed vote for the Commonwealth Office of Education is not nearly large enough. Apparently, the attitude of the Government is that education should be left to the States. When the Commonwealth Office of Education was established, I hoped that it was merely the forerunner of something bigger and better to come, but my hopes were illfounded. The functions of the office, especially on the financial side, should be centralized. The Commonwealth holds the purse strings and it should appoint a board to ensure that the standard of education in the States is raised. We should develop a certain measure of standardization throughout the whole of the Commonwealth. At. present, the variation of standards as between one State and another is too great. Moreover, those States which expend a large amount of money on education, are liable to be penalized through the operations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and that is one reason why the standard of education in some States is lower than it ought to be. Most people no longer live out their lives in the same village, or even in the same State. With the improvement of transport people move freely from one State to another. Certain standards of education should be prescribed throughout all the States, so that when children move from one State to another they can be easily fitted into their appropriate grades. As things now are, a child moving from one State to another may find that in his new State he is one or two grades behind other children of the same age, and that has a harmful psychological effect on the child himself. </para>

                        <para>- I should say the " three R's I would not suggest that standardization be carried beyond the intermediate grades. Teachers are prone to live within themselves because they are much in contact with children, and for the same reason they tend to become somewhat autocratic. I suggest that there ought to be a standard certificate for teachers that would be recognized in all parts of Australia, so that teachers may move freely from one State to another, and so widen their experience. Such a certificate might be issued through the Commonwealth Office of Education. If teachers were to move about freely as  1  have suggested, they would tend to develop wider vision, something which would be of great value, particularly at this time. </para>

                    <para>. -  Some honorable senators seem to think that because a particular vote labelled "Education" has been reduced, the total vote for education has been reduced, but that is not so. The reduction is mainly for administration services, and whether justified or not, it does not represent a reduction of the total vote for education. Under Division  181,  there is an item of  £1,496,000,  which represents Commonwealth grants to universities. The making of those grants is an important forward step, and indicates the sympathy of the Government with the universities, which are, in a sense, the foundation of education because, if university standards are not high, standards will not be high in primary and secondary schools. Under Miscellaneous Services  £2,215,000  is provided for various education services. It is not necessary to standardize education in order to &lt; bring about various standards in the various States. Indeed, that would be the worst way in which to attempt to  achieve the purpose in view. The danger would be that there might be established a fixed standard that would become the maximum. It might be a good thing to fix a minimum standard, but the State education authorities should be encouraged to improve on that standard. I agree that it would be a good thing to issue transferable certificates, perhaps through the Commonwealth Office of Education, but the Commonwealth should not attempt to impose its will on the State authorities. The States should decentralize their own education offices until ultimately, as the population of the country increases, shires, counties and  municipalities  would participate more and more in education as is the case in Great Britain, the United States of America and Canada. I emphasize the fact that we need co-ordination of education, partly through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Office of Education, and not centralized federal control. </para>

They are set out in section 5 (2.) of the Education Act 1945. The honorable senator also asked for information regarding the vote of £6,000 provided last year for adult education projects in the Northern Territory, of which only £1,121 was expended. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> has pointed out, that vote covered administrative expenses and not the total expenditure on education in the territory.

It is not the function of the Commonwealth Office of Education to superimpose services ou those already provided by the States. It would be the height of folly to "suggest that we should establish schools side by side and in competition with those established by the States.

                    <para>. - I still have not been persuaded by anything that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> has said that he can justify the provision of £209,000 for the Commonwealth Office of Education, which merely duplicates the work of the States. It is gratifying to hear that nearly £1,500,000 is to be provided by the Commonwealth for State universities. I wholly endorse that provision. If the Commonwealth Office of Education were wiped out altogether and the amount now provided for it were set aside over a period of five years, an additional £1,000,000 could be made available to State universities and used to better purpose in the interests of higher education. The amount now spent on the Office of Education should be handed to the States and utilized for the building of schools and the extension of State education over many fields instead of being used to keep a lot of " tall poppies " in good, comfortable jobs in a Commonwealth instrumentality. I cannot see how the Minister can justify the retention in the Commonwealth Office of Education of a large number of highly paid officers. That instrumentality is somewhat analogous to the Portuguese army, which is reputed to be composed mostly of generals. Are we getting value from their employment? I do not think that we are. </para>

It will be observed that the vote for the Commonwealth Office of Education has been reduced from £260,000 last year to £209,000 this year. In the years ahead progressive reductions of the vote will be made as functions performed by it are handed over to the States. There are certain fields of education which the Commonwealth cannot vacate. I assure honorable senators that those functions that can best he performed by the States will be handed over to them. As the years go by, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> will no doubt be gratified to see the vote for the Commonwealth Office of Education progressively reduced while the Commonwealth still continues to expend approximately the same amount on education generally. </para>

                    referred to the vote for the education of immigrants. There seems to be some misunderstanding about that matter. The vote for that purpose is expended on the education, not of immigrant children but immigrant adults, the chief item of which is education in the English language. Money expended for that purpose is very wisely expended. The vote will not be used,  as  some honorable senators seem to think, for the purpose of establishing special schools for immigrants.

                    <para>. - 1 disagree with any honorable senator who contends that, we should have a standardized system of education. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> that what we need is greater co-ordination in the education field than we have achieved in  the  past. For that reason I should like the vote for the Commonwealth Office of Education to be increased. We are a very young country and the existence of a Commonwealth  Office  of Education at Canberra enables the Commonwealth to render a very valuable service in the coordination of education throughout Australia. I favour the issue of standard teachers' certificates, even though it is most unlikely that teachers will transfer from, one State to another unless, of course, extremely high salaries paid in one State result in the mass migration of teachers to that State. A minimum standard of education should be provided for teachers. </para>

                        <para>- That is one of the things I want to find out. The  secretary  is to be given a rise of nearly £500. Is that increase fixed by the Public Service Commissioner or by the Minister ? The typists are to be given another £260. Is that increase to be fixed in the same ratio- as that for the secretary? These are expenses of administration and I want to know if everybody is. to be given the same increase? Honorable senators hear a great deal about the increase in the basic wage and how it reflects o;n, prices, but we hear very little from the Minister about increases such as. this one of £500 to a secretary. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know ' whether the Public Service Board or a competent authority fixed these increases. For the amount of work that these commissions do and the time occupied, is th: expenditure of £9Q0 for typing alone justified? Does the work warrant nearly £2,000 for a secretary? If it does, I say that there are many others in Australia on a much lower salary who are doing more important work and who are entitled, to an increase in wages. How many typists are employed by the three commissars in the Commonwealth Grant* Commission and by the secretary? Are there one or two or are the typists  engaged on a part-time basis? The commissars scrutinize State expenditure so closely that we are entitled to pay just as close attention to their expenditure. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to refer to Division 13, National Library, " collection and publication of Australian historical records, £1,000 The amount budgeted for last year was £1,000, but the vote was exceeded by £2,0S5. Yet the vote for this year is unaltered. Australia is reaching :i position of national development where the preservation of national archives is becoming a great responsibility and should receive tie support of honorable- senators. In times of financial stringency things we would like to do have to go by the board, but I should have thought that the stimulus of jubilee year would have given impetus to this question of the collection of national historical documents. As the expenditure last, year exceeded the vote,. I should' have thought that a greater amount would be provided this year. A great deal of money has been spent on the jubilee of the Commonwealth. I believe that a small sum. could have been given, for half a dozen research scholarships so that competent persons' could travel about Australia with instruments to record the historical reminiscences of some of the great and aged citizens who have been leaders in commerce and industry for the last '50 years. They could have placed on record impressions and recollections which would have been of inestimable value to the nation and otherwise would be lost. </para>

I assure the Senate that the amount spent this year on this item will be more than £1,000. That amount is shown on the schedule because certain reimbursements are received by the respective States for work done on their behalf by this department. Those amounts have not come to hand. They will do so during the currency of the year and not less than the amount expended last year will be spent this year. As to the preservation of records of current events of national importance, the Australian. Broadcasting Commission has recorded and will preserve the records of outstanding speeches and occasions during jubilee year. I understand that the policy of the Government is to arrange that records of outstanding national events will be preserved foa- generations to come. </para>

That is an increase of £223j506 for this department in the appropriation that is now being considered. I do not know how that is made up "and whether it is the result of increased personnel in embassies, legations and high commissions, or whether it is the result of higher salaries. I notice, however, under the heading of embassies the expenditure for Division 18, the embassy in the United States of America, shows an increase of nearly £32,000 over last year's expenditure. In Division 36, Consular Representation abroad, nearly £36,000 more than last year's expenditure is provided. I do not propose to be critical of this expenditure, but in view of the large number of embassies, legations and high commissions representing the Commonwealth overseas, I believe that we should have more information. I should like the Minister to tell the committee the reason for the increased vote for the embassy in the United  States of America and for consular representation abroad. </para>

It is amazing to find that so much has been expended on embassies, legations and high commissions in countries with which Australia has very little to do. I am surprised, for instance, to find that expenditure on an embassy in China is only £12,000, because I regard China as very important to the development of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is what 1 would like to find out. I am surprised that the embassy in Eire is voted only £16,000. Something should be done about that because there are many channels of trade with that country and many people of Irish extraction in Australia. An ambassador to Eire has not been appointed for two years, but Australia is spending £35,000 on the Brazilian legation. I ask the Minister to inform the committee what value is being obtained from Brazil for this expenditure of £35,000. Have we a trade commissioner in Brazil as well as a diplomatic repre sentative? If so, what trade negotiations, if any, are being carried on? </para>

                <para>I believe that our bonds with the sister dominion of South Africa should be strengthened, but I notice that the estimated expenditure on Australian representation in that country is only £25,000. Whilst I do not suggest that value received is necessarily commensurate with expenditure, I believe that everything possible should be done to foster co-operation between Australia and South Africa. If our ties can be strengthened by increasing expenditure on the Australian High Commissioner's office in that country, we should have no hesitation in providing the necessary funds, even at the expense of representation in some other countries. When I visited South Africa a few years ago, I was astonished at the work that was being done there by the Australian High Commissioner in spite of his small staff and limited facilities. Amongst South Africans I found considerable interest in Australia. In a country of the size of South Africa, and with such a decentralization of population, it is difficult for a small staff to accomplish all the work that has to be done at the office of the High Commissioner. I believe, therefore, that this is one phase of the activities of the Department of External Affairs that could well be extended. I should like to hear from the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs some account of what is being accomplished generally by Australian representatives overseas. We are expending approximately £1,500,000 on representation abroad and, of that figure, approximately £450,000 is required for administrative expenses. Representation in the United States of America will cost no less than £204,000. That proportion seems to me to be rather top-heavy. </para>

                    <para>. -  I should like to know something about the proposed expenditure of £6,300 on Australian representation at Geneva. We must realize that our Department of External Affairs grew, mushroom-like, during the war years. I do not protest against that, but I believe that the time has come for a review of the department's activities with the object of establishing a definite principle on which to base Australian representation abroad. Prestige should not be the only consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> mentioned Eire. I think it will be found, that although Eire is an independent republic, much of the business of that country is still done through London. That fact must be taken into account. There may or may not be justification for an Australian embassy in Brazil. I do not know why we have diplomatic representation there. I should like to know. A perusal of the details of expenditure on representation overseas reveals an apparent disproportion in some instances. 1 consider that there should be some liaison between the United Kingdom Foreign Office and the Australian Department of External Affairs in some countries at least. It would be regrettable indeed if in any country there were to be rivalry, or worse still, hostility, between the representatives of members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Surely, in some countries, Australia could be content to have an officer attached to the office of the United Kingdom, at least until such time as trad? and other relations indicated that independent Australian representation was desirable. Certainly we must have an ambassador in the United States of America and in some other countries, but the important point to be borne in mind is that the more we expend on proliferation of activities, the less we can afford to pay our officers. It is more important that our ambassadors and other representatives should be well paid than that we should be represented everywhere in the world. </para>

                    <para>. -  Much of the increased expenditure on Australian representation overseas has been necessitated by a circumstance which members of the Opposition are never prepared to recognize. I refer to the fact that inflation is not confined to Australia but is general throughout the world to-day, with the result that higher salaries have to be paid everywhere. In addition, other charges including the cost of cables, have increased considerably. Cable costs represent a substantial item of expenditure by the Department of External Affairs. Honorable senators should realize, therefore, that, in the circumstances, the increase of estimated expenditure overseas is not extraordinary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> referred particularly to representation in China. We have not an ambassador in that country at present. In the schedule of salaries and allowances, the honorable senator will find set out the normal expenditure for an embassy in China. The total of the items listed is £29,536. and from that sum there is deducted the amount of £25,736, which is the sum " estimated to remain unexpended for positions vacant or subject to approval by competent authority ". By that means, the figure of £3,800 which appears in the Estimates under the heading, " Salaries and payments in the nature of salary", is arrived at. The department has found it necessary to make provision this year to cover approximately three months' expenditure on salaries and general expenses, fares, and removal expenses of members of the staff of the embassy on their transfer to Australia. </para>

Details of expenditure under the heading, Other representation abroad ", to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley</inline> referred, are set out in the schedule of salaries and allowances. For instance, the Australian External Affairs office in London has a counsellor, first, second and third secretaries. Reference has been made to the increased cost of representation in the Soviet Union. That has been necessitated largely by salary increases, higher charges, the exchange rate, and other items of that kind. </para>

                    <para>. -  I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum's</inline> contention that there should be greater liaison between Great Britain and Australia. I consider that Australia has adopted a very weak, approach to the subject of external affairs. Whenever the necessity arises to send a delegation overseas, the question of costs becomes important. Frequently, we find ourselves at a tremendous disadvantage when controversies arise, because we are not as well informed about foreign affairs as we should be. Apropos of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> has stated, I consider that the introduction of Australian passports was a mistake. Irrespective of the fact that the present system was introduced by the former Labour Government, I consider that when a mistake is made it should be admitted. When some young lady friends of mine, who were working girls, visited England not long ago, they took jobs there in order to earn enough money to visit the Continent. In Europe they found that they were at a tremendous disadvantage compared with English girls, whose British passports were accepted universally. Tha Australian girls were forced to work through queues on a number of occasions, as a result of the stupid introduction of the Australian passport. I hope that this Government will seriously consider the desirability of reverting to British passports. When British people who have lived in Australia for a period of years return to England, they are unable to obtain British passports because of the length of time that they have resided in </para>

                <para class="block">Australia, and they cannot obtain Australian passports in England because they are only visitors. That state of affairs should be remedied. </para>
                <para>I shall now address myself to the subject of Australian representation in South Africa, which is one of the most important countries in the world to-day. There may be a flare up there at any moment. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Malan</inline> is likely to seize the British protectorates of Swaziland, Basutoland, and Bechuanaland. In view of the delicate situation there, Australia should be represented in South Africa by the best man that we can obtain. I do not believe that anything good can be obtained cheaply. What is known as the "Cape Coloured " problem is a very vexed matter. Anybody who has studied the problems confronting South Africa knows that the Dutch have been intermingling with the natives for more than 300 years. It is virtually impossible to distinguish some of the so-called coloured people from whites. They are spread over five or six different constituencies in Cape Province. As they hawbeen deprived of the right to vote, it ilikely now that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Malan's</inline> party will win the seats for those constituencies. </para>
                <para>We should also station one of our best men at Natal, where the coloured population is about nine times as large as the' white population. I have some knowledge of conditions in Natal, because' two of my sisters live there. .1 admit that that factor alone would not necessarily result in my knowing a great deal about the subject. </para>

                        <para>- If they are like their brother, they would be wise. There are nine coloured people to every white person in that province. The population of Durban comprises Indians, natives, and whites, in approximately equal numbers. Not long ago, there was a serious riot between the Indians and the coloured people, many of whom were killed in Durban in one night. About 60 per cent, of the white population of South Africa are Boers. Predikants and Boer Brothers go about trying to get all the jobs for the Boers. All of these problems are very important, when linked with other problems concerning the coloured peoples throughout the world. They are very important  to  us. If we had a good man there, who could study the problems of the coloured people on the spot, he could keep the Australian Government well informed. Some people contend that the coloured peoples should be wiped out altogether.  We  are trying to prevent the coloured problem from arising in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the amount of our allowance will be increased before long. However, in all seriousness, I hope that the Government will consider  the  aspect of the matter that I have brought forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> has made a deep study of this subject and he knows, as, indeed, we all do, that South Africa is virtually on the brink of a volcano. Thousands of natives ava employed in various capacities in that country. I understand that it is undesirable for a white man to venture out alone in Johannesburg at night-time, and -quite unsafe for a white woman to do so. </para>

                <para>Brazil is also a tremendously important country. It is not generally realized  that  the area of Brazil is greater than is  the  area of Australia or the United States  of  America. Brazil has not been developed to a great extent, and should  be a  very fertile field for Australian investment. Semi-tropical products that  are  grown in Brazil might grow in the northern parts of Australia, and if we  had  a good man there probably he would  be  able to do some good for us. </para>
                <para>Argentina is the most highly developed country in South America, and we should  not  complain about expending too much money on our representation in that country. I consider that our whole outlook on  the  subject of Australian representation :abroad is parsimonious and parochial. "We have only to look at a map of the world to realize the importance of Australia, from a geographical point of view. As the result of our participation in two world wars, the eyes of the world are upon this country, and we should not object to the expenditure of the money necessary to obtain the services of the best men to represent us abroad. </para>
                <para>I shall conclude by emphasizing that remedial action should be taken in connexion with Australian passports. I do not see why Australians - whether natural-born or by adoption - should be at a disadvantage compared with Canadians, British, Scotch or Irish people. </para>

                    <para>. - For the first time since I have been a member of this chamber, I am entirely in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> I have been astounded at the criticisms of some honorable senators about the amounts that we expend on our diplomatic services. I think that that is a dreadful attitude for this National Parliament to adopt. Although we do not know details of expenditure under this heading, surely we should look at the overall picture. Primarily, the job of a diplomat is to do his best to prevent us from getting into trouble with another country. Bluntly, his job is to prevent war that may be imminent. The proposed vote for Australian representation abroad in this financial year is £1,568,000, and the proposed vote for miscellaneous services connected therewith is £973,000. When we consider that Australia will be expending about £180,000,000 during this financial year on preparations for war, the amount expended for our diplomatic representation abroad could bc regarded as a cheap insurance premium. If our expenditure on such representation will in any way assist to prevent another world war, it is justified. </para>

                    <para>.  - Members of the Opposition are asking for explanations, to which they are justly entitled. They will continue to do so until they receive satisfactory explanations. I have not stated that the proposed expenditure on Australian representation abroad is unwarranted. As I have already pointed out, the vote for salaries and payments in the nature of salary in respect of the Australian Embassy in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for 1950-51 was £56,200, of which only £36,970 was expended. The proposed vote for this financial year is £57,000. 1 should like the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> to say whether the Government expects to effect a similar saving of about £20,000 under this heading during this financial year. </para>

I hope that if similar appropriation is requested next year the Government will be prepared to justify it. </para>

I appreciate that the intensity of commercial or social relations, and perhaps even the geographical position or the military significance of one nation to another, would have some bearing upon the matter. Reason appears to exist for certain countries to be accorded representation on a higher level than has in fact been accorded to them. It may be agreed, on a basis of reciprocity, that if we send an ambassador to a certain country that country will be represented here by an ambassador. I point out that we have firm trade relations with Italy, and that that country has sent many thousands of immigrants to Australia. Will the Minister be good enough to indicate broadly the. basis upon which foreign representation in this country is determined ? </para>

                    <para>. -  Since I had the opportunity to go overseas and meet a number of our diplomatic representatives and their staffs, I have come to the conclusion that the Government should assist those officers to maintain a high standard in order that they will not be at a disadvantage compared with the representatives of other countries. Associated with our diplomats are the diplomatic staffs, who are very often forgotten. I met a number of such officers in the United States of America, Egypt, Eire and the United Kingdom who were affected adversely because their remuneration was not sufficient to meet the cost of living in those countries. Accordingly, they had been impoverished. I have no doubt that because of the worldwide inflationary trend they are still suffering economic hardship. I wish to know whether the Department of External Affairs is in a position to ensure that when the cost-of-living adjustments are made in Australia they shall also be extended to diplomatic staffs who represent this country abroad. </para>

                    (Victoria - Attorney-General) T3.49]. - Having regard to what I have already said, I think that it is apparent that a great deal of the increase shown in the estimated expenditure of the Department of External Affairs is associated with increased salaries and allowances which, as one might expect, are on a scale similar to the salaries and allowances paid to many officers of the Government in this country.
                </para>
                <para>When reference is made to the basis of Australian representation abroad, and the means by which the level of representation is determined, I should not like, without more study of the question, to embark upon a detailed discussion of the matter. I understand, however, that the position is that agreement with the other country concerned has a great deal to do with the basis of representation that is adopted. The nature of the representation arrived at by agreement with the other country will depend very largely upon the closeness of our relationship with that country, its importance in the scheme of things from our point of view, the intensity of our trade relations, and so on. The result is that while our representation in a certain country will be at the level of an embassy, an exchange of high commissioners will -meet the  position as far as other countries are concerned. Those are the matters which enter into the determination of the level of representation to be adopted. I merely state them without laying down hard and fast rules concerning the manner in which such matters are determined. </para>
                <para>Reference has been made to the small increase of estimated expenditure on account of the embassy in Eire. Apparently, some honorable senators consider that the proposed expenditure is not sufficient. The position is that we have never had an ambassador in Eire, although at one time a High Commissioner represented us in that country. Since then, the post has been raised to the level of an embassy, although no ambassador has been appointed. In the present estimates provision is made for salaries and allowances for an ambassador for six months on the assumption that an ambassador will be appointed during the course of this year. Accordingly, the estimate covers salary for only six months. Provision has also been made for the salaries of a charge d'affaires at counsellor range and a first secretary for six months, and for a third secretary and typist for the whole year. At the moment a charge d'affaires is operating at the embassy, and consequently the expenses of that office will not be as high as they would be if the whole establishment were actually operating. </para>
                <para>Something of that kind is also true of South Africa.- There is a vacancy for a High Commissioner in that country at the present time, the former High Commissioner having gone to The Hague. Provision has been made in the estimates for the salary of a High Commissioner, but only for a period of eight months. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has referred to the fact that last year apparently the vote for salaries and payments in the nature of salaries for that embassy exceeded the actual expenditure by £19,230. An attempt has been made to estimate expenditure under that heading for the present financial year, and the figure of £57,000 has been arrived at. Additional costs, including exchange rates, salaries and expenses, will contribute to the increase. All that I can say at the moment is that the estimated expenditure as shown in the Estimates is the estimate which appears appropriate. It has been made bona fide by the Government in the belief that the amount will be necessary to meet current expenditure. Apparently, because of certain circumstances which existed last year, the expenditure on that embassy did not reach the amount which had been estimated. </para>

As I understand the matter, the Legal Service Bureau was a war-time creation of the Chifley Government. I have no doubt that that Government hoped that after it had nationalized the banks and medical services it would also be able to nationalize the legal  profession. It is gratifying to find that expenditure on the service is to be curtailed. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [3.57 J. - An extraordinary item, appears in Division 56 for 1950-51. It is " Peace Officer Guard, salaries and payments in the nature of salary, £7,017 ". Can the Minister state the nature of that expenditure? I take it the duty of the guard is to guard somebody. If that is so, I suggest that he has been paid a very substantial sum of money for performing that duty.

The peace officer guard is a small body of men which undertakes certain duties, such as guarding some of the government offices. The actual expenditure incurred is met by the departments concerned. </para>

I think that it is- true to say that the economy which has been effected in the administration of the bureau has been made possible without any reduction of the legitimate service which returned servicemen have received in the past and which they are entitled to receive under the terms of the Reestablishment a-nd Employment Act.

Although some ill-informed criticism,, which arose very largely from ignorance,, came from one or two quarters, the fact is that up till the present time I have not received any real criticism of thedirective which I then issued, either from returned servicemen's organizations or any one else. I conclude from that fact that the bureau is giving complete satisfaction. </para>

                        <para>- I agree. Tha demand for service will not be so great,, and that was why it was necessary to give some attention to the basis upon, which advice was to be given. I havemade a note of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wedgwood</inline> said about widows of men who served inWorld War I. being refused this serviceThe fact is that the Re-establishment and. Employment Act provided that theservice should be made available to men* who had served in World War II. Without any legislative authority, the provision was extended by my predecessor in, office to men of World War I. That may have created some anomalies, but I have not heard a complaint that widows of World War I. have not been able to get. the same treatment in regard to legal advice as have widows of World War II. However, if the honorable senator will supply me with details of any such cases I shall have them investigated. </para>

                    (Queensland) [4.3 j.. - Last year, the amount made available for the payment of salaries to officers of the bureau was- £19,000, but the actual expenditure was £26,429. This year, the  proposed vote is- again £19,000. It has not been stated that the staff is to be  reduced. There will continue to be a director, and nineteen senior legal officers. It may be presumed' tha't salaries' will  increase during the next year, so that I find it difficult to understand why only the same amount of money is to be provided for salaries this year as for last year, particularly as last year's vote was exceeded by £7,429. It almost seems that some reduction of staff is contemplated.

In the past, those officers were shamefully underpaid, and I know that the chief electoral officers of the States have had great difficulty in manning polling booths with efficient and reliable officers. It is proposed to increase the vote for this purpose from £167,959 to £227,906, and I hope that the increased remuneration will enable the chief electoral officers to get suitable staff. </para>

                <para>I regard electoral reform as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> matter of great urgency to which we should direct very serious attention. On several occasions in this chamber I have asked that a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament should be appointed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> consider electoral reform, but I have always been fobbed off with the stereotyped reply that the matter was being kept in mind. The committee, if appointed, should be asked to consider the method of voting, the number of candidates for which the elector must vote, the form of the ballot-paper, and the distribution of literature on election day. For the election of the Senate we have adopted the system of proportional representation. Having done that, we should go a little farther, and adopt the Hare Clark system in its entirety. Under our present system each elector, in order to record a formal vote, must vote for all the candidates whose names appear on the ballot-paper, even if there are 20, 30 or 40 of them. In the last two general elections in Tasmania, and I suppose in other States as well, voters were compelled to express a preference for candidates in whom they had no confidence at all. I was myself compelled to record a preferential vote for Communist candidates. "Why should I or any other elector be compelled to vote for some one in whom I have no trust or confidence? It is morally wrong for the people to be compelled to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps not, but there may be three Communist candidates, in which case the elector must give a preferential vote for two of them. That was the situation during the last election in Tasmania. The result of such a situation is that electors, to whom communism is anathema, deliberately make their votes informal so that they will not have to vote for a Communist candidate. In the Hare Clark system, the elector is compelled to vote for at least three candidates. He may, of course, vote for all the candidates on the paper, but he is not compelled to do so. To-day, fortunately or unfortunately, most electors have a party allegiance, and under the system which I advocate they would vote for their party candidates and then stop, although they could go on and express their preferences for all the candidates. It will be objected, of course, that under this system there would be a lot of exhausted votes. Of course there would, but it would be better to have exhausted votes than informal votes. The elector would express his preference for three candidates, at least. </para>

                <para>I come now to the form of the ballot-paper. In elections for the House of Representatives there is, under the existing law, a distinct advantage to candidates whose names commence with the letter A, B or O, whilst those whose names begin with the letters at the end of the alphabet are at a serious disadvantage. Many people mark their ballot-papers straight down from top to bottom. The law compels people to vote, and those who ari-  not politically minded comply with the law by marking the ballot-paper straight down from top to bottom. For Senate elections, the parties draw lots to determine the position of their candidates on the ballot-paper. Thus, we leave it to chance to determine their position on the paper. The party that draws Group A position has an advantage over all others, as the electoral officers themselves agree. When a person writes a letter, he starts at the top left-hand corner of the paper and goes on writing until he gets to the bottom. Many people mark their ballot-papers in the same way. The choice of representatives to govern the nation should not be left to chance. It has been suggested that we should have a circular or cart-wheel ballot-paper. Whilst the use of such a paper might remove some anomalies it could, of course, create others, but I believe that the method is worthy of consideration. I have here a sample ballot-paper similar to that in use in Switzerland and in France for municipal elections, prior to World War II. at any rate, and on this the names of the candidates are printed after the manner of signatures on a round robbin. I ask for leave to have the ballot-paper reproduced in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                <para class="block">I believe that the adoption of such a ballot-paper would give general satisfaction in Australia, as it has in other countries where it has been tried. The method of voting and counting would remain unaltered; only the form of the ballot-paper would be changed. With the use of the circular ballot-paper, there would be more likelihood of getting an intelligent vote. After all, those who vote for representativesto govern the nation should have a modi cum of intelligence. The percentage of informal votes might be increased. I think it would, but if an elector has not sufficient intelligence to cast a formal vote on a circular ballot-paper, as is done in other countries, he is not entitled to cast a vote at all. I urge the Minister to place my representations before Cabinet with a view to having a joint committee of the Parliament appointed to consider the matter. </para>
                <para>I believe that " spruiking " or touting <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the vicinity of polling booths on polling-day should be prohibited.

It was undoubtedly supplied to him by his officers. When I directed' the attention of the Chief Electoral Officer to the erroneous information that had been supplied to the Minister, he admitted that a mistake had been made. So that there may be no doubt about this matter, I shall read section 154 (4.) of the Tasmanian Electoral Act. It provides as follows: - </para>

Many electors reach the polling booths in a state of exhaustion after having been embarrassed by convassers who have rushed out to them and thrust into their hands . "How to vote " cards and literature setting out the claims of the respective parties and their candidates. Many elderly people reach the polling booths in a state of hysteria. These practices are probably responsible for the high percentage of informal votes recorded at every general election.

                    <para>. - I wish to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior to a complaint that I received after the last general election. A friend in England, who was particularly interested in the outcome of the election, complained that very little provision had been made at Australia House, London for the posting of the election results. Apparently provision had been made for the posting of the results of the first count of votes, after which the matter appeared to be completely forgotten, if the information conveyed to me by my friend is correct. He told me that he visited Australia House on a number of occasions and looked in vain for up-to-date results of the election count. Progress results should be posted from day to day or from week to week. Very many Australians who are either temporarily or permanently resident in London are interested in election results. Reasonable provision should be made to ensure that up-to-date election information shall be made available to them.

                    <para>.- The vote for Division 66, " Salaries and payments in the nature of salary ", is £1,525,000 this year, compared with an expenditure of £978,782 last year, the comparative figures for temporary and casual employees being £2,405,000 and £2,387,564 respectively. Reference to the schedule at page 151 discloses that the number of assistant directorsgeneral has been increased from two in 1950-51 to three in 1951-52, and that the number of engineers, architects, surveyors, superintendents, inspectors and other technical staff has increased from 566 to 640. On the accounting and administrative side the number of accountants, airport managers, controllers of stores, international relations officers,, liaison and welfare officers, senior clerksand clerks has increased from 311 to 387' and the number of accounting machinists,, assistants, chain-men, communicationsofficers, mechanics, line officers, typists,. &amp;c, has increased from. 1,314 to 1,353. What is the reason for these large increases of staff? In previous years there has been great extravagance in the Department of Civil Aviation. Twelvemonths ago I directed the attention of the then Minister for Civil Aviation tocertain extravagances that were apparent in that department, principally wasteful overtime and unsatisfactory staffing arrangements at airports. I am not sure what results flowed from my representations. I fear that my complaints were glossed over. Later, I wa&lt; informed that my representations werebeing considered. When I observe the great increases of staff revealed' by thoseestimates I wonder what is going on in the department. I am not aware that developments in the field of civil aviation have been so extensive as thesefigures would indicate. I fear that the extravagances of the past are still continuing. I should appreciate an explanation from the Minister of the- need for such large staff increases without any apparent increase of the work performed by the Department. </para>

The staff increases to which the honorable senator has referred are accounted for by the fact that many former temporary officers have been appointed to the permanent staff.

                    <para>, - Can the Minister state whether provision is being made by the. Government for- the- assistance of gliding clubs throughout Australia?' I have asked many questions in the past about the development of gliding because of its importance' in the training of civil pilots'. In Tasmania, in particular, very many energetic and enthusiastic young men are interested in gliding, but they have the greatest -difficulty in financing their activities. At a time when we are expending a very large amount of money on the training of air pilots for military and civil purposes, funds should be made available for the encouragement of gliding clubs. This Government is not fully seised of the importance of elementary flying training in  engineless  aircraft. In other parts of the world, particularly in the Soviet Union, great emphasis is placed on the training of young men in the art of gliding. In Germany before the war, gliding was looked upon, not only as important in training for defence, but as a great hobby. Its value was reflected in the airmen Germany was able to produce in the war. I ask the Minister if provision has been made in the appropriations this year for more generous support, of gliding clubs throughout the Commonwealth and particularly in Tasmania where there is a lack of training aircraft and many young men are eager to get the basic air training which is very important for civil and defence aviation. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to point out that Tasmania is worse, off. than other States in that there are no flying clubs where young men. can obtain the training that they want. A gap would be filled if a special allocation could be made to the gliding clubs in Tasmania because of. their isolation from other States. Tasmania is very air minded as is shown, by its efficient airlines. Young people in Tasmania have much more contact with daily air services than have those in other parts of Australia. If it is not possible- to- make allocations to all gliding clubs in Australia, I ask for special consideration to be given to the Tasmanian gliding clubs, because of the motive of the men behind them who wish to see young men given basic training inflying and because of their enthusiasm. </para>

                    <para>. -  Is the Minister in a position to tell the committee if any advance has been made towards the provision of an air service between Australia and South Africa? These estimates contain £5,000 for contracts to carry, mails between the two countries. Last year no money was spent on that service. This is linked with the thought developed earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> on the importance of South Africa to Australia. It is strange that t wo dominions in the British Commonwealth of Nations have so little in common because of transport problems. Very few ships are moving between the two countries and a traveller who tries to get from Australia to South Africa by air often has to make many transfers. Last year the Government set out to lay the foundation of a commercial airline between Australia and South Africa and £5,000 is provided now for mail contracts between the two countries. Is the Minister in  a  position to say how far the Government has gone towards setting up permament air transport between the two countries? </para>

                    <para>.- Will the Minister state what provision has been made for a civil aerodrome at Newcastle? There is an air force aerodrome at Williamtown and some civil planes are permitted to land there, but it is not a satisfactory arrangement. For a long time there has been an agitation at Newcastle for a civil aerodrome at Hexham. The Minister is aware of the large population of Newcastle, Maitland and the coal-fields and the number of people who would benefit from an aerodrome. Will the Minister state if any provision has been made for the construction of an aerodrome at Newcastle ? </para>

                    <para>.- The Department of Civil Aviation announced three weeks ago that it would not consider the registration of women pilots for commercial  work  in aviation. After my experience over Canberra in an aeroplane recently, I have no wish to be a pilot, but I understand that there are some women in Australia who are highly qualified. Three of them flew machines to Canberra a few weeks ago  to  attend a convention. In these days of equality I see no reason why the  Department  of Civil Aviation should  have  any difficulty in deciding that a woman pilot may be just as fully qualified as a man. </para>

I understand that there is some alliance between the Commonwealth censorship and the State censorship bodies, and that is rightly so, but I think that, the Government and the Minister will admit that because of the trend towards certain types of films that are coming into the country, it is necessary that the Parliament should be as well informed as possible on the censorship powers and how far they are exercised in the censorship of films. Provision is made for £9,000 for salaries and payments. Film censorship is so important that the Parliament should be in a position to know for certain that everything possible is being done to maintain the highest degree of decency in the picture business. </para>

                    <para>. - The department has been congratulated by people from overseas on the efficiency of the film censorship and the high standard that has been achieved. The Department of Trade and Customs exercises great care andvigilance in relation to films that are imported into Australia. By arrangement with the States the Chief Film Censor of the Commonwealth operates on behalf of the States as to the type of film to be exhibited. There are two stages of censorship. First, the Commonwealth censors films as they enter this country. Secondly, the States decide whether or not films shall be exhibited after they have entered the country. Strictly - I speak subject to correction by the Attorney-General - that is entirely a matter for the States, but there is in operation a very efficient  system  under which the Commonwealth Chief Film Censor gives his assistance. As I have said, the censorship activities of the Department of Trade and Customs have been warmly commended. The system employed is most efficient, particularly in comparison with systems operating in other parts of the world. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot do more than elaborate upon my earlier remarks. The Commonwealth is concerned only with censoring films as they enter this -country. "Whether or not films shall be shown .after they have been admitted by the Customs authorities is a matter for the States. However, there is a close liaison between State and Commonwealth authorities. I understand that films are classified by the Commonwealth Chief- Film Censor, but at the request of and in collaboration with, the State authorities. Should a State decide that a -film is unsuitable for exhibition the responsibility for ensuring that it would not be screened would probably rest with the police. The Commonwealth would not have any jurisdiction in that matter. </para>

I think I have made it clear that, technically, the Commonwealth's power ceases once a film has been permitted to enter this country. If a film is made in this country, the States have to decide whether or not they will permit it to be shown. I repeat, however, that the States do use the services of the Commonwealth film censors. In fairness to motion picture exhibitors and distributors I concede that they, too, exercise supervision over standards of decency of the films that they handle. Many films that we see in this country have already been cut as a condition of  their entry. </para>

Allowances for the services of State officers and others, will cost £25,400 or £1,464 more  than  actual expenditure last year. That sum includes provision for payments to the States for the administration of animal and plant quarantine activities. The increase of the vote has been necessitated by high wages, and! increased costs of goods and services. The sum of £o&gt;600 is provided for the overhaul and repair of departmental vessels engaged in quarantine activities. The free, issue of biological products will cost £10,000. Those products include lymph, cholera vaccine- and plague vaccine stocked for quarantine purposes, and calf, lymph, for immunization campaigns. Under the heading " Incidental and other expenditure " the sum of £27,000 is provided to meet expenditure incurred in the administration of the Quarantine Act. The increase is to cover rising costs of fumigants &amp;c.. and the changed procedure under which receipts, reimbursing the cost of fumigation of vessels &amp;c, will be credited to revenue, instead of to this vote as in previous years. </para>

The cost of providing the milk will be borne by the National Welfare Fund. The object of the free milk scheme is to improve nutritional standards. The Commonwealth has reached agreement with all States, except Queensland, to meet the cost of supplying up to half a pint of milk a day to every child under twelve years of age, attending a school or kindergarten, and also to defray half the cost of special equipment required by the States- to implement this, scheme. This vote of £15,000 is for the provision of that special equipment. The sum of £1^500,000 is to be appropriated from the National Welfare Fund for the free milk scheme. </para>

Very important work has been carried out by these officers, but much investigational work still remains to be done. In Queensland and New South Wales last year there were very heavy losses of cattle through blackleg. The serum that was being, used proved ineffective, because of the virility of the germ, which has. been a feature of the disease this year also. The veterinary officers are doing an excellent job, and the Minister is to be commended for the proposal to increase the vote for work in connexion with animal husbandry and the control of disease in stock. </para>

Honorable senators  on  this side of the chamber have asked a number of questions about production during the last few weeks and the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has invariably replied that the matter of increasing production is within the jurisdiction of the States. The Opposition does not mind expenditure of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture increasing, so long' as we are getting something for the increased outlay. However, this Government seems to be ignoring agriculture. It has abolished subsidies, and it is disbanding boards wherever possible. Expected administrative expenditure, therefore, should be less during this financial year than formerly. Has the Government any plan for increasing production? Honorable senators opposite have advanced so few proposals in this connexion that one wonders whether they have rattles in their heads instead of brains. </para>

                            should take notice of what I am saying. In the fertile Circular Head district of Tasmania which he represents, only 100,000 acres of land are in production. If the honorable senator would get busy and have swamp areas there reclaimed in order to enable primary production to be increased he would be doing something valuable. Our technical officers should be fully employed workingout details for the development of our idle fertile areas. In view of the inflammable international situation, we should pay serious attention to this matter. The spark of a match would be sufficient to set off another conflagration. The moment that the blaze started the Australian Government would be called upon to take over the production of food. It would not be able to claim that that was a matter for the States. During the war period the former Labour Government had a very efficient staff and was able to make ample supplies of food available not only to the increased civilian population of this country, but also to the many thousands of Allied servicemen who were stationed here. I remind honorable senators that the anti-Labour Government that was in power before Labour came to office in 1941 did not encourage the development of primary industries. In those days the wheat farmers received only 2s.10d. a bushel for their wheat, and the dairy- farmers received only about1s. per lb. for their butter. If

                            would reflect on the assistance that the Chifley Labour Government rendered to the primary producer during its period of office, he would not make stupid interjections.

                <para>Can the Minister assure honorable senators that, in the event of an emergency arising, the primary producers of this country will be able to increase their production by from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent.? In view of the potentialities of this country, our highly qualified staff should plan ahead. It is futile for the Minister for Shipping and Transport to say that primary production is entirely a matter for the States. During the last financial year the Commonwealth expended £341,665 on the production of flax, and precisely the same amount was recovered from the sale of flax fibre. The estimated expenditure under this heading during this financial year will be £460,000, and I notice that it is expected that precisely that amount will be recovered. Will the Minister inform me whether the production of flax is controlled by a flax board, and whythe estimated amount of revenue coincides exactly with estimated expenditure? It is indeed remarkable that, when dealing with broad acres sown to crop, the Government can budget to the exact £1 of estimated revenue and expenditure.This is the best forecast in respect of a growing crop that I have ever seen. Of course, there may be some explanation for the apparent coincidence. Only scant information about the Government'? activities in this connexion has been furnished to honorable senators during the last two years. Is there still in existence a flax board or a flax committee? If so, who is its  chairman,  and what does it cost to administer? Does it sell flax on behalf of the farmers? I trust that the Minister will explain this matter in detail. </para>

                        seems to have formed the habit of getting up and spluttering away on all sorts of illogical proposi tions. He insinuated that no productive progress has been made during the last two or three years in the Circular Head district of Tasmania. I remind him that a magnificent processing factory has been established there by Peacock and Company, and the Duck River Butter Company has also established a bacon factory. Furthermore, a depot for whole milk has been completed for Cadbury Fry Pascall Limited. Capital works to drain a considerable portion of that area, that were commenced by the Tasmanian Government during the last two years, have been continued as a result of the Commonwealth agreeing to underwrite State public works. In the one municipality that I mention, four essential adjuncts to development have been, carried out. The honorable senator's assertions are baseless.

Although I appreciate his interest, I hope that he will concentrate on the matters that are contained in the bill, and allow men who have important work to do to get on with the job. He should not delay them by talking unnecessarily about matters of policy. The Flax Production Committee, under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Stevenson, who is an officer of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, has been established by the Commonwealth, in view of the importance of flax in wartime. A considerable amount of money has been guaranteed in order to permit of the expansion and development of the flax industry in this country. It is expected that the proceeds of the sales will about equal expenditure. If there is a deficiency, it will be made up by a special grant. This organization was established as a war effort to increase production, not to make profits. As a result of my long association with the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, I am able, to inform honorable senators that very harmonious relationships exist between the Commonwealth and State Ministers. The technical officers of the Commonwealth and the States confer, in season and out of season, at meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council, which performs very useful work. I hope that we will not get into this petty, paltry frame of mind and perhaps disturb the harmony that now exists. I assure Senator Aylett that Commonwealth and Tasmanian Ministers are conscious of the serious decline of production, and they are constantly pooling their knowledge and exchanging ideas in order to endeavour to cope with the situation that has arisen. The honorable senator should appreciate that, having regard to what may happen in' the future, special preparations are being made to ascertain the directions in which primary production may be expanded. At the moment we are critically short of man-power and material, which makes the problem of production very acute both for the State and the Commonwealth. I hope that the honorable senator will not spend time on matters of general policy. If he desires specific questions to be answered, I shall be happy to answer them, but if he wants to wander from Dan to Beersheba, he can strike out on his own. </para>

On the other hand, this is an opportunity for honorable senators to discuss certain problems in detail. They do not often get such an opportunity to express opinions and to criticize or to comment upon the activities of government departments. I contend that the Department of Commerce and Agriculture will have an increasingly important part to play during the next five or ten years. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> have stated, the Tasmanian Government, in conjunction with the Australian Government, is preparing the ground work for war service land settlement and for the development of agriculture generally in that State. It must be appreciated, however, that it is necessary for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to co-ordinate the work that is being carried out in the various States. Recently I suggested in the Senate that an investigation should be made of the whole problem of food production in Australia, but my suggestion did not meet with favorable consideration by the Government." </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Department of Commerce and Agriculture must tackle the problem of  food production. I suggest that in Australia 'to-day we are 'faced with the disadvantages that arise from the needs of private enterprise and initiative clashing with national requirements. Whilst the extremely high price of wool has 'brought great prosperity to our wool-growers, it  has  also meant that -many people have taken up wool-growing and have drifted aw-ay from other agricultural industries such as 'dairying, wheat-growing and meat production. I consider that tha't is not in the best "interests of the nation. Unless Australia produces sufficient food for its own needs and, if possible, a surplus, the whole "basis of our economy will fail. </para>
                <para>I wish to -know where, in our administration, the machinery is available with which to co-ordinate the activities of the various States in order that out land may be developed economically. New settlers must be attracted to the land. I do not mind if they are new Australians, although I should prefer them to be land hungry Australians who have previously worked on farms and are prepared to produce food. Of course, finance is the difficulty that lies in the way of prospective settlers. </para>
                <para>Before the war, when I was living in Queensland, I applied for a land settlement block in that State. In some areas, such as that in which the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> lives, 3,500 or 4,000 applications were made for each block of grazing land that was available. The qualifications that were required of applicants were previous experience on the land, sufficient capital to pay the first year's rental and to pay for improvements, and ability to pass what amounted to a test conducted by the examiners. I suggest that land hunger still exists in Australia and that there are many young men who. are prepared to battle as the early pioneers battled. Their difficulty is that they are not able to obtain land. There appears to be a bottleneck somewhere and it is necessary for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to remove that bottleneck as soon as possible. I have travelled the length and breadth of Australia and have a special interest in primary production. From the knowledge that I have gained it is apparent to me that the country will face a great agri-cultural  and food crisis if the problem of food production is not tackled very soon. The opportunity to discuss this matter does not occur very often, because the department is quiet-moving and mos*t efficient. I consider that if honorable senators wish to take up 'the time df technical officers or of 'the Minister for Shipping -and Transport in discussion of this matter, it is their  duty  'and 'their responsibility to do so. </para>
                <para>In my opinion, food production is more important than defence preparations, because if we have no food defence forces will be of little use. </para>

I refer to Division No. 83, Commercial Intelligence Service Abroad, concerning trade representation in various countries. Would the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> furnish to the Senate a statement setting out the volume of trade between Australia and the countries mentioned? Very often trade representatives are appointed to certain countries and are left there whether trade continues or not. I should like to know whether the appointment of these trade representatives is warranted by the volume of trade with the countries concerned. If their appointment is justified, I do not cavil at it. I appreciate that the Minister cannot supply such a statement at the moment, but if he would be good enough to do so at a later date, it would be of interest to honorable senators generally. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no doubt that the statement to which the honorable senator has referred can be made available. I understand that the trade commissioners in the various countries to which they have been appointed do very good work. It happens that sometimes in a new country evidence of the real pioneering work that is being done is not apparent. In addition, periods occur such as the present when shortages of practically all exportable commodities exist. For that reason not very much trade can be promoted by the commissioners. They are obliged to say, " I am very sorry, but we cannot supply you with the goods ". Having regard to the overall picture, I think that it is important that a country such as Australia should increase its export trade and be well represented in other countries. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Whilst I appreciate the importance of the matters that have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> I point out that they are not the only problems with which the Department of Commerce and Agriculture is concerned. I was interested to hear the honorable senator say that the production of food is more important than defence preparations. I think it was Napoleon who said that an army marches on its stomach. I need not say more than that. </para>
                <para>The matter of expansion and development of primary production rests mainly with the States, and I consider that the Department of Commerce and Agriculture is regarded by the States as the coordinating authority. I remind the honorable senator that an Australian Agricultural Council has been established and. is doing a splendid job. If a  person  desires advice on the development of the sugar industry and the expansion of primary production in Queensland, I suggest that he will obtain far better advice from the Queensland Department of Agriculture than he will from the South Australian Department of Agriculture, where food production problems are of a completely different kind. It is a physical impossibility for an officer stationed at Canberra to be an authority on all such matters. The honorable senator should remember that 90 per cent, of the .problem of expansion of primary production concerns the States. If a Commonwealth Minister were to suggest to a State Minister in Queensland or Tasmania or Western Australia how he should run his department he would probably receive the same kind of reply that I received from a Minister of the New South Wales Government when I, through one of the officers of my department, suggested to him what he should do about the Newcastle harbour. I do not think that the Commonwealth has been backward in making money available for the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. Tha </para>
                <para class="block">Commonwealth has vacated the loan field in favour of the States, and it has promised to underwrite State loan raisings. We are conscious of the urgency of the problem, and the Commonwealth, being the co-ordinating authority, is doing everything possible through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, and in other ways, to do a good job. </para>

Can the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say whether the Commonwealth is, in fact, importing superphosphate from overseas? There is a great shortage of superphosphate in Australia, and because we cannot get enough sulphur, it is impossible to manufacture in Australia all the superphosphate required. If superphosphate is being imported, can the Minister say what is its soluble content? </para>

The Government has been doing everything possible during the last two years to obtain substitutes for sulphur. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Seward</inline> discussed the situation in Western Australia. Special efforts are being made to transport by rail 1,000 tons of pyrites from Norseman to the superphosphate works at Perth. We have explored the possibility of increasing the production of pyrites by giving a high dollar priority for machinery to companies engaged in this enterprise. Financial assistance is also being given to the companies, and priority has been given to them for the transport of necessary goods over the railways. </para>

I should like to  know  whether those reports are collated so that they may be made available to honorable senators and others who are interested. I have heard of instances of foreign countries capturing markets quite close to Australia although we were in a position to supply the goods. </para>

I am glad to learn that he has technical officers to advise him. Perhaps the information that I have supplied may be of value to them. No government should make money available for agricultural development unless the proposals have been recommended by technical officers. The statement that I made a little while ago was correct, notwithstanding the criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I quoted from the report of the marine board at Circular Head, issued in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture in Tasmania. The report was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Luck,</inline> the honorable member for Darwin in the House of Representatives, and I suggested that it be sent on to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chamberlain,</inline> because that gentleman knows something about farming. I know the district concerned, and what I said is true. It is proposed to develop 50,000 acres, but there is no reason why the area should not be increased to 250,000 acres. The technical officers are looking for good land which they may recommend for development. </para>

                    mentioned the canning factory at Smithton. That factory was built by the Labour Government during the war. Afterwards, it was bought by the State Government, which eventually leased it back to a private firm. We know all about that, but my point is that factories, as such, cannot increase the volume of primary production. They cannot clear land or till it or plant crops.

                    <para>. - Unemployment and sickness benefits are always estimated in a round  sum  because, it is imposible to forecast what amount will be needed. That  is  particularly so  in  relation to the unemployment benefit. There are conditions peculiar to sickness benefits, but the unemployment benefit is very largely influenced by industrial conditions. Strikes may result in heavy  demands for  the benefit, and consequently it is necessary to have a sufficient reserve to meet them. The respective estimates are - unemployment benefit £970,000, and sickness benefit £800,000. Payments of the unemployment benefit in 1950-51 totalled £62,500. The special benefit of £230,000 includes provision for payments made to immigrants during the period of their residence in Australia before they are able to obtain employment. </para>

                    <para>. - Item  5  covers ordinary services rendered in connexion with various matters in which substantiation is required of claims made for pensions. An applicant for a pension must appear either before selected officers of the department or the special magistrates employed by the department. If the applicant lives in an area in which no branch of the department lias been established, he must appear before the nearest  Clerk  of Petty Sessions or other legal official and answer such inquiries as are addressed to him. For services of that kind the department concerned makes a charge on the Department of Social Services. There is a marked increase in the estimate for that item this year because arrears of payments for services rendered in the preceding year have still to be met. Claims for 'payment include amounts due to the Queensland Government for work done but for which no basis of payment had been decided. </para>

                    <para>. - Several years ago the department published a booklet which contained most interesting information for the guidance of applicants for pensions. When it was published, the information contained in it was up-to-date, but so many changes have since been made in our social services legislation that it is now completely out of date. I ask the Minister to consider the desirability of publishing a new booklet of up-to-date information. Calculations of pension entitlement are very difficult because of the provisions relating to permissible income. Portion of the vote of £90,000 under Division 88 - General Expenses - Item 2, " Office requisites and equipment, stationery and printing ", might be set aside for the printing and issue of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> revised booklet for the guidance of applicants. I suggest that on this occasion the booklet might carry the notation, " Issued with the compliments of the Liberal Minister for Social Services ", as the earlier booklet carried a similar notation in relation to the Labour Minister. </para>

To what degree will the amounts provided under those two items be affected by the retrenchments that have been made in the Public Service since these details were prepared? In relation to payments to other department:, for work performed for the Department of Social Services, has any consideration been given to the establishment in the States of special social services officers,  independent of the Postal Department, where pension payments can he made on lines similar to those in operation in New Zealand? If such offices were established congestion at post offices, particularly on pension pay days, would be greatly relieved. </para>

From memory, I believe that 1,000,000 copies of the earlier booklet were printed and distributed.

The printing of a book like that represents a substantial outlay of funds, but the information in it was up to date and correct at that time. </para>

                        <para>- I will not deny that it served a use other than informing the pensioners of their rights under the Social Services Consolidation Act, but that did not alter the fact that the booklet was very useful. I agree that it should bc brought up to date having regard to the changes that have been made in the act and in the social services benefits during the past two years, and I shall pass the suggestion on to the Minister for Social Services. I cannot give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> information on officers on loan and those awaiting appointment to higher positions. The figures that are given are estimates of the cost and I think the honorable senator will agree that it would be practically impossible to support them with details. The Social Services Department has regional officers in each State outside the capital cities. These regional officers serve a very useful purpose in collecting claims that are made against the department. </para>

                        <para>- No. In Newcastle and Wangaratta the officers have a small skilled staff which deals with the whole range of social services benefits, but there is not a pay office. It would be a major task and impracticable, I should say, to attempt to set up a pay organization for benefits outside the Postal Department itself. The story of the rehabilitation scheme, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred, is a long one. There are two or three pamphlets issued by the department which outline it and which might be studied by the honorable senator. Briefly, the scheme provides that those who are eligible for the invalid pension may apply to the department for medical treatment to eradicate or mitigate the permanent medical condition which makes them eligible for the invalid pension. The act provides that the department may, in certain circumstances, withhold the invalid pension if the recipient of it is not prepared to make himself available for rehabilitation. In each of the States there is at least one rehabilitation establishment, and in New South Wales there are three. These rehabilitation establishments are staffed with medical and nursing personnel. Frequently the medical condition of persons who receive treatment is one that arises from orthopaedic or muscular complaints, rheumatism or arthritis which react to physio-therapy treatment. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> regard the rehabilitation scheme as one of the bright spots in the social services administration in that it does constructive work, which not only relieves the Commonwealth of financial responsibility for those on pensions, but also makes a very substantial contribution to the mental health and happiness of those who otherwise would be doomed to exist permanently on an invalid pension. It is interesting to see the appreciable proportion of recovery effected. Sometimes it is difficult to convince pensioners who are eligible for rehabilitation treatment but when they are persuaded that they can be made physically fit many have gone into the establishments and shown great benefit. Many have been taken out of the classification of unemployable as  a  result. </para>

                    <para>. - After having had a great deal to do with one of the rehabilitation centres, I take this opportunity of paying tribute do the splendid work that they are doing. They are not only assisting those who are having treatment but are also giving them confidence in themselves and a much happier outlook. As a result, the persons who receive curative treatment are able to play their part in the community and learn an interesting occupation which assists them to a happier and healthier future. The spirit of co-operation, friendship and encouragement in these centres is something that honorable senators should commend heartily. </para>

                    <para>. When an aged or invalid pensioner is in  a  government institution, part of the pension is paid to the institution. Can the Minister inform the Senate how much is paid to the institution, since the introduction of the act, and who controls the balance of the pension? Is it paid to the individual and does the Deputy Director of Social 'Services have the right to pay a sum to the matron  of  the institution whether the pensioner is willing or not? If any such amount is paid to the matron, is any check kept on how she spends it for the pensioner ? </para>

                    (New South Wales - Minister for National Development) S.25J. - Institutions can apply to the department to be classified as an approved institution. If they are approved, the department pays to them directly a proportion of the pension. Each fortnight £2 2s. is paid to the pensioner and £3 18s. to the institution. The department thus pays £1 19s. a week for the upkeep of the pensioner.

                    <para>. - Seven years ago the Social Security Committee investigated the problem of mental health. I wrote the report that the committee made on mental hospitals throughout Australia. For some years we were trying to get the co-operation of all State governments regarding those institutions. Quite recently the Government of Western Australia decided to give some small payment to the inmates of mental hospitals as a form of pocket money. Is that money paid through the grant from the Australian Government or not? Is there anything in the act to provide that payment to children of invalid pensioners can be made other than by child endowment ? I have in mind a case where there are five children under fourteen years of age. If no such provision exists those children are at a great disadvantage in the community compared with children in institutions or those whose parents are on the basic wage or more. </para>

                        <para>- I only remember that at a conference of Commonwealth and State Premiers that I attended, at which I held the portfolio of Social Services, the State Premiers brought forward a proposal that the Commonwealth should pay to inmates of mental hospitals amounts similar to those paid to inmates of other institutions. The Commonwealth's reply over the years has consistently been that this is a health matter and not a social services benefit. </para>

                    <para>.- When the portfolios of Health and Social Services were combined, was not an approach made to the States on this matter ? I recall having raised this question on several occasions in this chamber. I have always regarded mental health as the  Cinderella  of medical and social services. My recollection is that the Commonwealth found it impossible to secure the agreement of the States to any scheme for Commonwealth payments. I am wondering whether the States have ,now withdrawn that opposition. </para>

                    <para>. - Since I visited Papua and New Guinea about eighteen months ago, I have been most interested in the development of that territory and when last year's Appropriation Bill was before the Senate, I drew attention to some of the factors which I considered militated against the effective administration of the territory. I was impressed, however, by the progress that the Administrator,  Colonel Murray,  and his staff, had made in their work amongst the natives. The development of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea is of great importance to Australia, and is a matter with which this Parliament should be kept well acquainted. The report of the United Nations Visiting Mission which surveyed the administration of New Guinea was  a  reflection 05 Australia and on the Australian people We have been given  a  very important trusteeship. Our responsibility to the United Nations is to look after the welfare of the native peoples of New Guinea and to develop that territory to the limit of our capacity. I am pleased indeed that the Legislative Council  of the  Territory  of  Papua  and  New Guinea  will  begin work next week, and I hope that  the  members  of  this Parliament  who have been selected to -attend the opening ceremony, will be able to bring back better reports on conditions in the territory than I was able to make after my visit. The establishment of a legislative council will bring to the Territory a measure of self-government which should be welcomed by New Guinea residents and by the native peoples. I understand that the move has been opposed by certain chambers of commerce and by some planters who view with alarm the abolition of the old " boong-bashing " order under which for many years they have been able to exploit the natives by forcing them into labour for which many of them were not suited. The establishment of the council, therefore, is a notable advance in the improvement of the welfare of the native peoples. Various interests and localities in the Territory will be represented on the council, and British residents will have an opportunity to play a more active part in the administration. At least they will know what is going on. It is most difficult for members of this Parliament to get any information about our territories. Even the Parliamentary Library, which is a most efficient organization, is not much better off than is the general public for information on the progress that has been made in the territories. I should like to see frequent reports made on such important projects as the re-building of the antiquated hospitals in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. "When I spoke on this subject previously, I mentioned the appalling state of the native hospital at Ella- Beach. I should like to know whether that hospital has been replaced by a modern institution because the conditions that I saw were a grave reflection on the Australian Government. During my visit I was informed that blue-prints had been prepared for new hospitals for white people at Port Moresby and Lae. I saw the plans of the Port Moresby hospital and I considered them to be very good. I should like to know whether the construction of those hospitals has been started. Brief newspaper reports that have come to my notice indicate that various industries are being established in the Territory, of Papua and New Guinea, but </para>

                <para class="block">I do not know what progress has been made with them. I saw fine stands of timber in the Bulolo Valley, ready for milling, and some time ago the Minister for Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck)</inline> said that an arrangement was being made between Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited and the Australian Government to exploit those timber resources. A report was to be made on the possibility of manufacturing plywood in New Guinea, from klinkii and hoop pine timber, but so far, neither this Parliament nor the people of Australia have been told what progress, if any, has been made with these projects. </para>
                <para>The report of the United Nations Commission to which I have already referred condemned the policy that had been pursued in New Guinea in connexion with the development of natural resources. Since the war the Administrator of New Guinea,  Colonel Murray,  has had a very difficult job to perform as a result of the devastation that was caused during the war. I hope that, as a result of the establishment of the Legislative Council for the Territory, regular reports will be furnished by the Administrator, and that they will be made available for perusal by honorable senators. The Australian Government is faced with many problems, and is often guilty of adopting the attitude " out .of sight, out of mind " as far as Papua and New Guinea, are concerned. We must remember that our responsibility in respect of the Territory is very great. We must make good use of the opportunity that we have to show that we are good colonizers and good administrators. We should bring about a general improvement of educational, medical, and other facilities at Lae, Rabaul, and Port Moresby in order to attract more white people to the administrative services there, so that further progress can be made with development. Conditions in those towns are very primitive indeed. Unless the facilities that I have mentioned are improved, white people will not be encouraged to leave civilized areas to undertake pioneering work. Steps should be taken to open up the fertile land on the highlands . and adjacent Wahgi Valley, which have wonderful potentialities. Much money will have to. be expended on the construction of roads. Of prime importance is the construction of a new bridge over the Markham River at Lae. </para>

It was most encouraging that the bank should look in that way to the future of New Guinea. A very important experiment was carried out in New Guinea during the last twelve months in connexion with the growing of groundnuts, and the crop topped the market in Sydney. That was quite an achievement for New Guinea. </para>
                <para>Opportunities to debate these matters occur only infrequently in this chamberso I hope honorable senators are not being bored by my remarks. If they would take the trouble to visit Papua and New Guinea, they would be convinced that we have a big job ahead of us there. I consider that it is specially incumbent on us to develop the territory over which we exercise a trusteeship. I realize that my interest in the development of Papua and New Guinea will not gain for me any additional votes at the next election of members of this chamber, and I am actuated only by a sense of national responsibility. Other nations of the world will eventually test our trustworthiness in this connexion. It is for that reason that I hope that we will soon receive regular reports from the Administrator about the progress that is being made in Papua and New Guinea, and on the deliberations of the new Legislative Council. I trust that they will be made readily by the Minister for Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck),</inline> in the same way as periodical reports on external affairs are made  W-*  .the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Casey).</inline></para>

In that sense they are unattached officers. The employment  of  persons in addition to those employed at the present time is not contemplated. The increase of salaries to which the honorable senator has referred is due to normal increments, cost of living adjustments and increases of salary consequent upon arbitration determinations. The estimates have been worked out having regard to those matters. </para>

                    <para>. -  I notice that the total estimated expenditure of the Department of Labour and National Service is £219,185 less than the expenditure last year. Can the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> say whether that reduction of expenditure is due to the fact that a number of employees of the Commonwealth Employment Service have been dismissed? If so, I suggest that no allowance has been made by the Government for the increased expenditure that will be necessary because of the additional overtime required to be worked in connexion with the call up of national service trainees. I consider that in the long run, the department will be involved in more expense because of the necessity to pay additional overtime than it would have been had it not dismissed the employees to whom I have referred. </para>

                <para class="block">National -Service. It is somewhat breathtaking to peruse the estimates of expenditure for the first year of the life of this infant, when the total expenditure was estimated at £144,200, which included even the rent that was payable at that time. The proposed vote for this year does not include the rent, which appears in the estimates for the "Department of Interior, and amounts to £77,500. One cannot but recall that occupants of premises have been pushed out by this department and prevented from reoccupying office space after coming back from the war, and although in the interim, there has been no appreciable increase of the rates of rental. Yet, because of expansion of government departments the rent which this department has paid to outsiders has increased from £12,700 in 1940-41 to 'the present estimated expenditure of '£77^500. </para>
                <para>One of the original purposes of the department, peculiarly enough, was to write the doomsday book for the decade of the war. I refer to the national register. The object of that record was a sensible one at the time because the Commonwealth was then exercising complete man-power control and was directing men into munitions works and the Civil Constructional Corps, according to the exigencies of defence of the nation. To-night we have before us a proposed appropriation of £1,681,000, which, as I have 'said, does not include at least £77,500 for rent. In the circumstances, I -suggest that this portion of the -schedule is significant not only from the point of view of economy. Having regard to the statements made by honor-able senators opposite about economy during the budget debate, if they were sufficiently consistent to carry their arguments through to their proper conclusion, considerations of economy alone would seem to justify some scrutiny of this department. I take the view that this is a department which was constituted directly for war functions and that its continuance is justified only as long as post-war reconstruction functions, which properly appertain to a government department, are necessary. I am aware that at tha present time the department discharges functions in relation to placing  immi-  grants in employment and that it conducts an employment exchange. I also appreciate that to -some degree it . polices federal industrial awards and is responsible for the operation of the national service training scheme. I suggest that 'this department, which was established during the war to direct man-power, was continued after the w.a'r simply for propaganda purposes, and in order to win popularity for the Labour Government. There is no need for the department to concern itself in these days with finding employment. In any case, even if such <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> need existed, all the. States have for many years had Departments of Labour and Industry which could very well undertake the placing of people in employment, and which have particular local knowledge which renders them especially valuable. Eoiinstance, the office in Brisbane has a special knowledge of the sugar industry ; that in Adelaide has a special knowledge of the needs of the coal-mining industry at Leigh Creek; whilst that at Hobart has a special knowledge, of the needs of the small fruits industry. I -urge the Government to consider particularly the ill-effects of duplicating State services. In Tasmania, I have heard complaints from officers of the State Department of Labour and Industry that they encounter competition from 'Commonwealth officers who think that it is their duty to police certain awards. I am aware that the State officers could properly police Commonwealth awards only if they were asked by the Commonwealth to do so, but in the past very sensible arrangements have been entered into between the  Commonwalth  and the 'States for the collection of Commonwealth revenue by State officers. I believe that it would make for more harmonious working of industrial awards if people seeking information could get it from one central office, both in regard to State and Federal awards. I urge the Government to consider reducing the activities of this department. At page 168 of the schedule details are given of the staffing of the department, and when one notes the number of persons engaged, one wonder? whether there is any room or, indeed, any need for the recruitment of a new army. The schedule shows that there are 346  employment officers in the department, whose salaries total  £315,599.  I congratulate the Minister upon having reduced the costs of the department, but there is room for further reduction. Above all, it is necessary to avoid duplication of Commonwealth and State activities. </para>

At that time, a Liberal government was in office, and the organization out of which the present department grew consisted of only a few executive officers. The department was not then concerned with directing people into the Civil Constructional Corps or into the labour corps. I was one of those who helped to establish the department in Tasmania for the .purpose of diverting man-power into fields where it was most needed in the prosecution of the war effort.

                    <para>. -  The catering officers are attached to the food services branch, which consists principally of experts in large-scale catering. They assist in the establishment and running df cafeterias in large industrial establishments, and On the waterfront. The branch, provides expert assistance in connexion with food services operated by the Government, particularly in immigrant hostels, df which there are about  70.  Members df the staff also have inspectorial responsibilities. They concern themselves with nutritional matters, and in the conduct of courses for management and staff. We must view 'this department iii its proper perspective, and understand that it is making a real .contribution to the maintenance of industrial peace. If it is successful in that, the money spent on it will have been well spent. It would be false to assume that 'the department is concerned only with the employment service. At one time it was concerned largely with finding jobs in which to put men. Since then, the position has been reversed, and now the employment service is concerned mostly with finding men to put into jobs. There are more vacancies than there are men to fill them. On the employment side, the department still does valuable work by putting into suitable jobs displaced persons and immigrants. Whilst some honorable senators may be critical of particular items, I suggest that when the estimate for the whole department is considered, it cannot be regarded as a heavy contribution by the country for the maintenance df industrial peace. </para>

                    <para>. - In Queensland, the State immigration authorities assumed responsibility foi* placing British migrants in jobs, and I cannot see why the Commonwealth Immigration Department cannot perform the same service for immigrants who are under its aegis. Where is the line to be drawn between the activities of the Commonwealth and those of the State? T believe in State rights. The functions which belong specifically to the States should be exercised by 'them, and the Commonwealth should not encroach on fields of power reserved foi" the States. When 'this department was first established, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gair,</inline> who was at that time' Minister for -Labour and Industry in the Queensland Government, protested strongly against what he regarded as unnecessary duplication of State and Commonwealth services. There is not room for Commonwealth and State activity in this field, and we should not have State and Commonwealth officers competing against one another at the expense of the taxpayer. Goodness knows, we are already "taxed heavily enough 'for urgent purposes without having to meet these added -burdens. Some reduction has b'ee'n made in the overall provision for the department, but its administrative staff has been increased. It is difficult to understand why, at a time of full employment, it is necessary for the department to employ 346 employment officers. That is a paradox which cannot be explained. No unemployment exists among able-bodied men who are willing to work. </para>

                        <para>- It is always possible for a government to establish a government department and to find all kinds of jobs for those appointed to it. I should like to submit a questionnaire to the administrative head of the Department of Labour and National Service asking him to state how his employees fill in their time throughout the whole of every working day in the week. I do not think that he could make a very satisfactory reply. Irrespective of what government is in office, while I remain a member of this Senate, I shall do everything possible to ensure that the taxpayers shall receive value for their money. Now that this matter hai been brought prominently to the notice of the Minister, I trust that the Government will examine this department and other departments that compete against, and duplicate the work of, State departments. Control of labour and industry is the express concern of the State parliaments. When I toured Queensland during the 1949 general election campaign I was informed by the officer in charge of one employment office in a city in that State that he would be glad to receive instructions to ClOSe down his office because he had nothing to do. He said, " Everybody in this locality has a job. There is no call upon my services except in a very remote way. I should be glad to be more profitably occupied ". That unfortunate man was buried away in an office in which he had nothing to do of any consequence in the way of finding employment. </para>

The department is rendering very valuable services to the people of Western Australia. One result of the establishment of employment offices was to close down a number of private registry offices, the proprietors of which were battening on the unfortunate unemployed and taking from persons who obtained employment through their offices one-half of their first week's wages whether or not the job offered was a congenial one. Large sums of money were extracted from unfortunate persons who were not in permanent work. The large number of registry offices that had been established throughout the State was clear evidence of the profit that was gained from such ventures and demonstrated the need for the establishment of government employment offices which would not take advantage of the ill fortune of those seeking employment. </para>

                <para>During the war years, and since the war, the Department of Labour and National Services has rendered very valuable services to the people of Western Australia. Recently, when the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> was in Western Australia taking part in the referendum campaign, he received a deputation of business men and employers of Collie protesting against the announcement that the employment office at that centre was to be closed. As the result of the representations of the deputation, the Minister decided that it should remain open. He made an on-the-spot assessment of the needs of the district and decided that they could be met adequately only by the continuance of the govern: ment employment office. A similar decision was made about the employment office at Merredin. An officer in one of  the eastern States, knowing nothing of the circumstances of the Merredin district, decided that the employment office there should be closed in the interest of economy. That has since been found to be a false move and I understand that the office has been re-opened. </para>
                <para>Many persons do not understand the scope of the work carried out by employment officers. It has been said that it is the task of the State governments to ensure that British immigrants shall be settled in employment in Australia. That function is not the sole prerogative of the State governments. British immigrants are supposed to be promised employment before they leave Great Britain. Indeed, that is one condition under which they are allowed to come here. They are also supposed to have accommodation arranged for them. M.any of them come here and share accommodation with relatives and friends. Often, after an arrangement  of  that kind has continued for some time, the friendliness of the arrangement wears off and the new arrivals eagerly seek accommodation elsewhere. Those who are successful in so doing have to obtain employment at centres nearer to their new homes and depend upon the assistance of  the  Government employment officers in obtaining it. I agree that much can be done by the States in the provision of accommodation and employment for immigrants. In that respect Queensland might be in a very much better position than is "Western Australia, which has only a very small population and very limited financial resources. This problem must be tackled on a national basis. Honorable senators opposite talk about full employment a? though that desirable state will last for ever. In Western Australia recently one business undertaking alone put off 200 men in a week. Many big business houses are already carrying out extensive staff retrenchments, because of the uncertainty of the future. Clothing manufacturers in Western Australia have stated that conditions in that industry have never been as bad as they are now. A psychology of fear that a depression is around the cornet is being created in the minds of business people. Even if the services of Commonwealth employment officers are not being fully availed of now, having regard to the way in which the economic position nf the country is drifting they may be full} availed of within the next few months. </para>
                <para>I pay a tribute to the excellence of the work performed by the officers of the Department of Labour and National Service. Many persons who are employed at centres distant from their homes have approached me for assistance in obtaining employment nearer to their homes for domestic reasons. The officers of the Department of Labour and National Service have invariably been able to make the requisite arrangements, and without cost to the persons concerned. Conditions to-day are very different  from  those of a few years ago when seamstresses and waitresses paid one-half of their first week's wages to proprietors of registry offices before they were even given a chance to see what sort of a job had been offered to them. It is regrettable that there should be in the community persons waiting to take advantage of the misfortunes of other people. I commend the Government for its decision to retain the Government employment offices. I pay a tribute to the efficiency and helpfulness of all the employment officers with whom I have come in contact during the last eight years. Those whom I have sent to them have invariably been treated courteously. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to discuss the activities of the board for two reasons; first, because of my experiences when as a Minister in the Western Australian Government I was in charge of the Fremantle Harbour Trust; and, secondly, because of the shocking report circulated by the board earlier this year about conditions on the waterfront. Before the establishment of the board, men working on the wharfs at Fremantle were under the control of the Fremantle Harbour Trust, the appropriate government instrumentality for that purpose. The Australian Stevedoring Industry Board was foisted on the people and as a result there has been inefficiency, loafing and general dislocation on the wharfs. To' give an example of how the new authority operates I inform honorable senators that a former Prime Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> asked the Western Australian Government to provide crib houses and conveniences close to the places of work of the men engaged on the waterfront in Western Australia which is as it should be. I made inquiries and found that the request resulted from a visit that had been made by an official of the board. After having inspected the wharfs, he recommended that new crib sheds be erected at Bunbury, Geraldton and Albany, in some instances only 50 yards away from similar amenities that had been provided only twelve months earlier. The Prime Minister ordered those new facilities to be provided. That is the sort of thing that happens when a Commonwealth instrumentality overrides the authority of the State harbour boards. When control of waterside workers at Fremantle was exercised by the Fremantle Harbour Trust certain men were allotted to specific jobs in the .carrying out of which they became very proficient. For instance certain men were employed in storing goods as they came off the ships. They acquired an intimate knowledge of the brands of various importers and became expert in tha work. When control of the waterfront came under the jurisdiction of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board no attempt was made to retain the gangs of picked men and as a result cargoes have not been handled as efficiently as they were under the former system. I went to the Fremantle wharfs and it was a daily occurrence to see half a dozen men playing cards between the sheds. If they were not doing that they  could be found at the hotel nearby. As the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board stated in its report, the position is chaotic. There was nobody in authority. The harbour trust could not touch those men. The unfortunate foreman had uo authority. That is one of the main reasons why shipping is being slowed down at Fremantle. The report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board states that Judge Kirby had found that in Sydney one stevedoring company in 194S achieved a loading rate of 15.99 tons of general cargo an hour, as against the rate attained by all  other  interstate companies of 12.90 tons, a difference of 3.09 tons an hour or about 25 per cent, better loading. That wa? because of greater efficiency and much less apparent confusion because the foreman was more co-operative in a friendly way. In the port of Melbourne there came to the board's notice an alarming number of cases of waterside workers having been arrested by the police for drunkenness and similar offences  during  their time of employment without the knowledge of their employers. In each case the working report which was furnished by the employer at the conclusion of each job made no reference to the arrest. Many reports credited the me.:i with working a full shift. What was seen by the board in Melbourne was seen in every port that it visited. There was evidence of laxity in supervision and efficiency. Men were found playing cards or two-up, sitting idle on ships and wharfs, fishing, leaving jobs without the permission or knowledge of their employers and in some cases taking it in turn to go home and stay home without being disciplined. In fact, they were paid for their absence as if they had worked. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Another aspect is the time taken up by work in which the men should not be employed. Before the establishment of this board, the work of shifting hatches was done by the ship's crew, but gradually that was transferred to the waterside workers and it is now done exclusively by them. As a result the work is slower. A ship has to berth before the hatches can be removed, whereas it could be done while the ship is entering the harbour. The waterside worker is thus prevented from doing full-time work. Judge Kirby gave one instance regarding the engagement of labour. If a gang knocks off work in a port, instead of being put on another ship, it finishes and another gang is engaged. As a result, an enormous amount of labour is lost. In his report the judge stated - </para>

                <para>He has no authority or stability of employment, and how can he exercise authority? It should be done by the harbour trust authorities for more reasons than one. It is their duty to erect the wharfs and put machinery on them and they should engage the men to do the work. Many requests are made for up-to-date machinery to assist the men. I have here the report of the Eleventh Interstate Conference of the Australian Port Authorities Association. In it there is a paper which was read by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> A. Whitton. He stated - </para>

                    <para class="block">We have arranged and carried out experiments to have the whole cargo of a ship palletized and handled with fork lift trucks. Gentlemen, I am afraid that these trials have not indicated the slightest improvement in output and I am not comparing that output with pre-war output but with present day output. We found in some of those experiments - I could give you the actual figures, of course, but I do not propose to bore you with them - that the handling of a whole cargo which amounted to somewhere in the region of 0,000 tons where every bit of cargo could be palletized was palletized, was handled at a slightly slower rate than a similar type of cargo which was handled on the ship's previous voyage. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">There is not the slightest encouragement for the harbour authorities to introduce modern machinery. In Fremantle they have installed it, but they have not the slightest choice of the men who will work it. I saw a man on a fork-lift truck having a great old time driving it around the shed like a motor car. </para>
                <para>The Government is trying to effect economies. If the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board was abolished and the work was handed over to the harbour trust authorities, man-power would be saved and the turn-round of ships would be expedited. That would be of no small benefit to industry in Australia. If there was an item in these Estimates relating to the board I would move for its abolition, but as I cannot find one, all that I can do is to bring this matter to the notice of the Minister in the hope that something will be done in the near future to abolish this board and allow the control of labour to revert to the harbour trust authorities. </para>
                <para>In justice to the men, I do not want it to be thought that they are the only ones to blame. They are not. There are cases where employers are to blame. In the case of drunkenness which I have mentioned, the employers did not report the man, but paid him. The judge pointed out that in some cases wool was brought to the wharfs and dumped, there was nobody to direct the men where to put it. They had to wait for their assignments. The employers have some responsibility, but the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board is in no position to enforce any conditions on the employers or employees. The harbour boards are in that position. The Australian Stevedoring Industry Board has no authority and the position on the Western Australian wharfs is a scandal. I cannot speak of conditions in the eastern States. </para>

The fruit industry of Tasmania is very important. It is a seasonal industry and the producers work like beavers at harvest time to take advantage of the unique opportunity to supply the market in England when the English apple crop is not ready for harvesting. Therefore, the ability of ships to lift the apple crop is of the greatest moment to southern Tasmania. Because of restrictive influences that have trussed the industry like a plucked fowl for the last five years, members of the Waterside Workers Federation have been permitted to work only two nights a week up to 9 o'clock in Hobart instead of five nights until 9 o'clock and in some cases until 11 o'clock as in other parts of Tasmania. By reason of this iniquitous system of government control of the waterfront industry, the available waterfront labour in Hobart during the apple season has been reduced to 59 per cent, of requirements. </para>

                <para class="block">That means that the producers are prevented from getting their apples to the market. I have risen only because apparently it is not possible to get a comprehensive report so that it can be implemented before the next fruit season and because I wanted to show how the iniquitous position that has been demonstrated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Seward</inline> affects the apple industry of Tasmania, so that the Minister will be able to keep it specially in focus and so prevent in the 1952 season a recurrence of the unsatisfactory conditions of the past. </para>

                    <para>-. - This proposed vote represents an increase of more than £200,000 over actual expenditure last year. Apparently, as expenditure by this department increases, our shipping services decrease. The lack of adequate shipping is having a severe effect on production in Tasmania. Farmers are saying, " What is the use of producing more if we cannot obtain shipping space for our produce?" For the information of the Senate I shall cite figures showing the decline of cargoes shipped from one relatively small port in  Tasmania.  I refer to the port of Stanley. In 1950, cargoes shipped from Stanley totalled 35,516 tons; by 1950, that figure had fallen to 18,569 tons. Details of the decline  are  shown in the following table: - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>There has been a similar deterioration at all other Tasmanian ports. The decline has not been caused by the absence of cargoes. Considerable quantities of produce have been transported 50, 60, or 70 miles by road to other ports on the off-chance that shipping space could he found for them. Last season, farmers turned their live-stock into fields of carrots and turnips which they had not bothered to harvest because of the lack of shipping space; yet vegetables were selling at famine prices in Sydney and elsewhere on the mainland ! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> has complained that Australian shipbuilding yards have not sufficient orders to ensure continuity of employment to dockyard workers. I have no doubt that, when the shipbuilding industry in this country has become almost extinct, honorable senators opposite will be deploring the difficulty in purchasing vessels overseas. Even during the worst years of the war, shipping facilities in this country were not as bad as they are now. The position has become worse in the two years that this Government has been in  office, and- the Australian economy and the Australian people are suffering as the result. I do not underestimate the ability of the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> but I trust that Cabinet will give more serious attention to this problem. Tasmania is, of course, hardest hit by the inadequacy of shipping services, but some of the mainland States are also labouring under serious disabilities. Not long ago a certain individual informed  me  that, by buying ten tons of onions at Orbost in Victoria and transporting them  by  road to Sydney, he was able to make a profit of £600. That kind of  black-marketing  could be eliminated if shipping space were provided to transport Tasmanian vegetables to the mainland. </para>

At another Tasmanian port which at one time was a big exporting centre for timber, shipments fell from 7,361,45S super, feet in 1940, to 4,753,000 super, feet in 1950. Millions of super, feet of timber are stacked in Tasmania awaiting shipment to the mainland where it is urgently required to build homes. This situation is a national tragedy. Vegetables are being fed. to stock in Tasmania while they are being sold on the mainland markets at famine prices. Huge quantities of timber are lying in stacks in Tasmania while thousands of people on the mainland are homeless. This state of affairs is seriously reducing Tasmania's industrial potential, and is upsetting the Australian economy. </para>

The fact that Tasmanian shipping services are still inadequate is not the fault of the department. Any requests that .have been made by honorable senators, individually or collectively, to the department have been complied with if that has been at all possible. While it is true that there are still substantial accumulations of cargoes at Tasmanian ports, the department has done much to alleviate the position. Paper has been shipped from Burnie, timber from Beauty Point, and so on. I am convinced that the Minister and his advisers have done everything possible to help. </para>

                    <para>, - I have the unusual pleasure of joining in this debate at the invitation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> in an attempt once more to focus the attention of the Senate on the very serious deficiency that exists in Tasmanian shipping services. It is important that all Tasmanian senators, regardless of their party affiliations, should face  the veal causes of the present difficulty. Surely the only justification for continuing a government shipping service is that it is free from dislocation due to industrial troubles. The waterside workers and the seamen have tribunals to which they can take their claims foihigher wages or better conditions. Why cannot the important work of carrying cargoes between Australian ports be continued while grievances are being placed before those tribunals? If necessary, wage increases can be made retrospective. A national shipping line should be free from the industrial dislocation with which the private shipping companies have to contend. Again I can illustrate the position by referring to the apple trade. Whereas in 1939 ships carrying apples from Tasmania made 22 round trips to Sydney, to-day they make only eight trips. The Mount Lyell mine in Tasmania supplies most of Australia's requirements of capper. If honorable senators knew the degree to which irregular shipping services have affected production at that mine they would be appalled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has drawn attention to the effect that the lack of cargo space is having on primary production in Tasmania. 1 have no- apology to make for endeavouring once again, even at this late hour, to impress upon honorable senators the need to place Tasmanian shipping services on a proper basis. </para>

                    has asked why expenditure has increased. With the readjustment of the various departments, shipbuilding is now under the control of the Department of Shipping and Transport, and the original administrative staff has to be provided for in the proposed vote. Together with the automatic increases that have occurred from time to time, that is the main reason for the increased expenditure. I make a final appeal to honorable senators to push on with a consideration of the schedule, in order that the departmental officers who have been in attendance for a considerable time may get on with their work.

This approach to the problem will ricochet against the Government in due course, unless encouragement is soon given to the industry.. </para>

                    <para>. - I appreciate the fact that this matter has been under review continuously during the last two years, and that this constant review takes a lot out of Ministers. But when does the Government intend to order ships to be built in Australia? It is of no use for the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> to say that the pressure of naval construction is a factor sufficiently important to warrant the closing down of Australian merchant shipbuilding yards. I remind the Minister that there are merchant shipbuilding yards at Brisbane and Maryborough, at which there is no naval construction worth talking about. Because of the fact that the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> has stated that we are short of some thousands of men, does the Government intend to let the Queensland merchant shipbuilding yards die? He is suggesting to the Senate that, because there is a shortage of 5,000 workers for shipbuilding in Sydney, that is what should happen. There is also a merchant shipbuilding yard at Whyalla, in South Australia, at which no naval construction is proceeding. Where there is no competition for labour between merchant shipbuilding and naval construction what is to stop the Government from getting on with the job of constructing merchant ships? It is true that ships that were ordered when I was Minister for Supply in the former Labour Government will  not be completed until 1953. The main reason for that is that that Government ordered a long way ahead. </para>

                        <para>- That Government ordered a long way ahead. Labour was responsible for starting up shipbuilding again at Mort's Dock in Sydney. Four orders were placed in 1949. At the present time, about ten merchant ships are under construction in this country, four of which are due to be delivered before the end of this year. This matter is becoming very urgent, and something beyond a daily review by Ministers is warranted. Ships should be ordered for construction in Queensland and South Australia now, in order to give the shipbuilders an opportunity to lay in supplies of steel and auxiliary machinery, much of which has to be imported. It does not matter so much that delivery will not be effected until 1953. It is only with the utmost difficulty that an expert team can be got together once it has been disbanded. A very fine shipbuilding yard has been established by Evans Deakin Limited at Brisbane. That firm was able to establish its modern shipbuilding yard because the orders that it received enabled it to lay the keel of its next ship when the ship on which it was working was probably only half completed. By that means, the company was able to gain more experience and technical ability as it went along. When the day comes that it has not an order to go on with, its personnel will disperse, and, as I have already mentioned, it will be tremendously difficult for that company to get its team together again. I make a final appeal to the Minister, and the other members of the Cabinet sub-committee which is handling this matter, to lodge orders for the construction of merchant ships with shipbuilding yards at which there is no naval construction taking place. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not intend to speak again, but I have felt impelled to do so by the statements of the Minister for Shipping  and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wright</inline> about the slow turn-round of ships which, they stated, has been due to the attitude of the seamen and the waterside workers. According to evidence that was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vertigan</inline> 75 per cent, of the slow turn-round of ships has not been due to the waterside workers. If honorable senators would refer to the last report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board they would learn that the reason for the slow turn-round, particularly in Sydney, has been the cluttering-up of the wharfs. For instance, vessels have gone to Sydney and have had to lie beside a wharf for up to a month. Wool has been' placed on the wharf alongside the ship, but has not been loaded because the complete consignment of wool had not arrived at the wharf. On other occasions ships have been loaded with wool, but because the brokers had not paid the bankers for it, the wool had to be unloaded. As a result, shipping has been lying alongside wharfs for many weeks, thus preventing other ships in the stream from coming alongside. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely rebutting statements that have been made by the Minister and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> Their indictment of the workers should not be allowed to go unchallenged. The slow turn-round of ships has been occasioned, also, because waterside workers have had to unload at the western ports cargo consigned to the eastern ports, in order to reach the cargo destined for the west. The cargo consigned to the eastern ports has then had to be reloaded. In one instance, 17,000 tons of cargo had to be so unloaded and reloaded. The waterside workers received no credit for such additional handling. The report to which I have referred states that the efficiency of the waterside workers in Tasmania is only 29 per cent. The reason is that ships are ballasted in Hobart. On occasions, ships are sent from Sydney to Hobart to unload certain cargo from their holds and take on other cargo. I have known instances of ships being sent to Hobart in order that certain cargo may be transferred from one hold to another. Again, the waterside workers get no credit for that work. In many instances the wharfs and wharf sheds are so cluttered up with cargo that it is impossible for the waterside workers to proceed with the unloading of additional cargo. </para>

                    <para>.- The chief reason for the increase relates to the open-cut coal-mining programme. The Bureau of Mineral Resources has joined with the Joint Coal Board ' and the New South Wales Mines Department in an open-cut programme. The bureau not only carries out surveys but also takes an active part in drilling operations. It has a temporary staff of approximately  100  employees engaged in the drilling operations, and drills and plant have been imported from overseas. That is the main reason for the increase, but I point out that there' has been a general increase of activities of the bureau because of the work that is necessary to stimulate the production of metals that are now in short supply and in endeavouring to locate additional sources of supply of certain metals with some new scientific equipment which has been obtained. </para>

                    <para>. -  Despite the lateness of the hour, I cannot let pass the opportunity to commend the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organizationupon the work that it is doing. I point out that funds have been provided by way of outside donations and grants to assist the organization. I am. sure that those donations are made to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization because of wide appreciation of the excellent work that it is doing. The organization was established in  1926.  It will be remembered that the first important work which it carried out was the effective destruction of prickly pear by the use of the <inline font-style="italic">cactoblastis</inline> insect. Since then, its activities have spread to secondary as well as primary industries. The work that is being done for the benefit of secondary industries to-day is of immense value, and the organization is accepted by industry as the final authority on many problems that occur from time to time. The organization continues to play a most important part in primary industries. It takes our problems into the laboratories and surmounts what appear to primary producers to be insurmountable difficulties. I suggest that its work will also make a great contribution to resolving the food shortages throughout the world to-day. It is capable of greater efforts in the future. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>One of the greatest achievements of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization last year was the use of myxomatosis in the destruction of rabbits. That valuable work extended more than 1,000 miles, starting from Victoria and going as far as Queensland. When one considers the ramifications of the work that is being done by the organization, it will be found that that work includes investigation of plant and animal diseases, plant breeding, animal breeding, animal husbandry, and covers such diverse matters as insect pests, soil problems, flax, fisheries, food preservation and transport. All those matters are on the primary production side, whilst on the secondary production side its work deals with industrial chemistry, physics? forest projects, paper making, coal, building materials, radio, radar and many other matters. It is pleasing to note that during the years respective Australian governments have appreciated the work that has been done by the Commonwealth' Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and have successively increased the vote for the organization. It is now on an excellent footing, and under the guidance of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Clunies</inline> Ross, a man of whom Australia has reason to be proud, this fine organization will be taken on to greater heights in the future. Although I have no doubt that next year the proposed vote will be greater, honorable senators may rest assured that although more money may be spent, even more important results will be achieved. </para>

                    <para>. -Recently, in the United States of America, an all-party non-partisan committee of the House of Representatives has been investigating, with somewhat startling results, the effect on human life of new fungicides, insecticides and preservatives which are being used very freely for the preservation of food ana the stimulation of growth of primary products. The opinion has been hazarded in that country that the use of some of those chemicals is inducing sterility both in human beings and in animals. In America, and in Australia also, virulent and widespread outbreaks of poliomyelitis have occurred and the incidence of malignant cancer has spread. There has also been an increasing incidence of virus diseases. The investigations committee to which I have referred has called expert evidence from some of the leading doctors in the United States of America, who&gt; have directed their minds to the possibility that the increasing incidence of diseases of that kind can be attributed tosuch matters as the extensive use of DDT for the destruction of insects on plants. The plants are then eaten by stock, and the DDT finally finds its way into the human system. It is interesting: to note that the matter has been considered of such importance in the United' States of America that a non-party investigating committee of the House of Repersentatives has been appointed. T suggest that the same action might well be taken here. </para>

                <para>Some very near tragedies have been averted in the United States of America. Chemical preparations have been used for the preservation of the bloom on peachesand meats sold for human consumption without proper tests being conducted. There have been one or two instances in. which the deleterious effects of such preservatives have been appreciated almost immediately after they have been used by unscrupulous food packers and processors and before the goods have been consumed by the public. The discovery of their danger was merely fortuitous, and it was recognized that human life had been in great jeopardy. If that state of affairs exists in Australia, it should receive the consideration of this Government, and particularly that of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. </para>
                <para>Honorable senators are aware thaisuch preparations are being very widelyused to-day. Whilst they have certain, immediate and short-range effects, such, as the killing of pests or the preservation of fruit and vegetables, we do not know what their long-range effect will be. I do not know whether the health authorities of the United States of America or of this country insist that preparations of that kind must be adequately tested and that any evidence of danger from, their use will result in their use being;  promptly prohibited, or whether they are allowed to be used willy-nilly by unscrupulous manufacturers who wish to push the sales of their products, with detrimental, harmful and even fatal effects to the consuming public. </para>
                <para>The source of my information concerning the investigations of the American committee is a well-known American magazine called <inline font-style="italic">The American Magazine.</inline> I have not seen the official report because I understand that the investigations of the committee have not been completed, but the interim report will no doubt bring to light many startling instances of the inherent dangers of such preparations. If the results that are taking place in the United States of America are likely to occur in this country, I suggest that swift action should be taken to prevent harmful effects. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is proposed to grant £12,000 to the States as a subsidy towards the maintenance of housekeeper services. Last year, £15,000 was appropriated, but only £11,761 was expended. This service is of tremendous value to the women of Australia, because it assists those who are in hospital or who have just been recently discharged from hospital. I understand that all the States, with the exception of Queensland, have accepted the Commonwealth grant, and 1. should like to know whether the appropriation is smaller this year because of Queensland's refusal. I should also like to know whether Queensland will be given an opportunity to re-consider its decision. Such organizations as mother-craft associations, the Country "Women's Association, the Red Cross Society and homehelp services do valuable work, and they would be greatly assisted by grants from this appropriation which, I hope, will be increased. </para>

                    <para>.- Under division 183, £5,000 has been provided for the expert committee on taxation. The committee consists of some of the leading taxation authorities of Australia. It has submitted about twelve reports, most of them dealing with the taxation of companies. The work of the committee should be extended. No such extension is envisaged in these estimates, however, because although £6,248 was expended by the committee in 1950-51 the vote this year is only £5,000. The * committee should be requested to investigate the effect of taxation on primary production. "Wise taxation laws based on scientific principles may play a very important part in the stimulation of primary production and provide the necessary incentive to primary producers to extend their activities. The committee could undertake very important research in that connexion. I suggest that it should be directed to investigate and report upon depreciation allowances and matters of that kind. The desirability of the restoration of the initial deduction of 40 per cent, for depreciation might be examined by the committee. I commend the Government for having appointed the committee and I compliment the committee on the excellence of its reports. </para>

The allowance originally granted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Hinkler</inline> has not been increased despite the fall in the value of the £1. Considering the service rendered to Australia and to aviation generally by her distinguished son, and the diminished' purchasing value of the allowance, the Government might well increase the allowance to an amount more in keeping: with that originally granted. Under item 16, "Jubilee Celebrations 1951" although the vote for 1950-51 was £250,000, expenditure amounted to £26S,567 and an additional amount of £85,100 has been provided for 1951-52. 1 should like to know what, if anything, of" permanent value has resulted from the jubilee celebrations. Too much diffusion of activity resulted in some of the celebrations being complete washouts. In. Western Australia the organizers of the celebrations intended to stage a native display but the natives went on strike, exercised their rights as human beings, andrefused to be stared at by the people. In spite of all the prior organization theproject had to be abandoned because thenatives refused to have any part in it. Why is an amount of £S5,100 still outstanding on this item? The original estimate of £250,000 has already been, exceeded by £18,567. The total excess expenditure represents 50 per cent, of the original vote. </para>

Having regard to thewonder.ful work done throughout Australia by the surf life-saving clubs, and" the risks taken by their members in saving lives on our beaches, that provision is not sufficiently generous. Throughout theyears thousands of lives have been saved on Australia beaches as the result of the activities of honorary beach patrols. These organizations should receive greater recognition from the Commonwealth. The total grant will not go very far when it is divided between the various clubs. The members of surf life-saving clubs arecontributing money from their own&gt;  pockets to provide surf life-saving equipment. They are sacrificing their leisure in training to make themselves physically fit to patrol our beaches. As a token of the appreciation of the nation of the work that they are doing, the vote should be considerably increased. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> in connexion with the expert committee on taxation. Yesterday T received two letters from Western Australia. One of my correspondents stated that not one acre of fallow was to be seen in the districts of Roe and Merredin. The other letter was from a man who expected to have 30,000 bushels of wheat this year. He said that he will not grow wheat next year, because of the heavy taxes imposed on him. He proposes to grow a few acres of oats and barley, and let his stock feed on them.. Primary producers are making decisions of that kind to-day solely because of the incidence of taxation. High taxation is one of the principal factors that have brought about a restriction of production in Western Australia. I trust that the expert committee on taxation will be directed to investigate the incidence of taxation on primary producers. I should like the members of the committee to visit Western Australia in order to see for themselves the conditions that operate there. </para>

                    <para>. - The total votes under miscellaneous services for the Department of Immigration amount to £11,791,000. The Government has acted rightly in resisting the strong pressure which has been brought upon it in this chamber, and in another place, to cut its immigration programme. If the flow of immigrants were reduced, we should have to cut our development and defence programmes. We should not do anything to slacken our efforts to recruit the best possible immigrants in the greatest possible numbers. An amount of £20,000 has been provided this year for contributions to the States towards the establishment of reception depots for British immigrants. Last year, £70,000 was provided for that purpose. When the immigration programme was originally drawn up, it was the intention of the Government to bring to Australia as many British people as we could induce to come here. It is necessary that British immigrants, when they arrive here, should be housed and taken care of under the best possible conditions. In 1946, the Chiefs of Staffs warned the conference of Prime Ministers that, in the interests of overall strategy, the dispersal of population and' industrial plants should be put in hand immediately. The migration of a great number of British people would help not only Australia but also the mother country. </para>

                <para>An amount of £2,000 has been  provided  this year for pre-school child facilities for immigrant children. The vote last year for that purpose was £20,000. I am at a loss to know why the vote has been so considerably reduced. If there is any section of the community upon which money should be expended, it is those pre-school children who are in holding centres and whose parents are living in. hostels or holding camps. It is desirable that pre-school facilities of all kinds shall be made available for such children. </para>

What does a young man or a young women have after the celebration of his or her twenty-first birthday? Usually the young man has a " hang-over ". In this instance, we have a "hang-over" of £85,000; which forms a part of a total amount of £350,000 that the Government decided to spend on the celebration of our jubilee year. In addition to the total amount, a further £3,900 has been provided for the Sydney Royal Jubilee Sheep Show. The £S5,000 represents the difference between the £350,000 which it was originally intended to expend on jubilee celebrations and the £268,567 which has already been spent. With regard to

                    first point about the £20,000 for the reception of migrants, the Commonwealth and States entered into an agreement to provide accommodation for the reception of assisted migrants. Most of the building for that purpose has already been done. The Commonwealth will meet the cost of erection of the accommodation which is to be operated by the States. The building programme is tapering off and it is estimated that the provision of £20,000 should be sufficient to cover the Commonwealth obligations. In regard to education and health, there was an allocation of £20,000 but the scheme did not actually come into operation until this year. It is expected that the £2,000 provided this year will be all that will be used in the circumstances.

                    <para>, -  I direct attention to Division 191, Assisted Migrants, items one to nine inclusive. Can the Minister inform me how many immigrants the Government proposes to bring out for the amount of £8,085,000 that is shown in these estimates? There is an allocation for expected child immigrants, British migration, Empire and allied ex-service personnel, Maltese, displaced persons, citizens of Ireland, Dutch migrants and so on. I draw attention particularly to the question of immigration for rural areas. Unfortunately, the immigrants that we have received in Australia are not all that we would have desired, but I am prepared to concede that many of them were displaced persons of a type that could not be expected to undertake arduous rural work and some allowance should be made for that fact. In future, however, Australia's quota of displaced persons, who are virtually war refugees and not immigrants, will be considerably less. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In pursuance of the Government's policy, genuine immigrants are to be brought out and I would like to see a little difference between the type of immigrants that we have had and those who are about to arrive. Australia urgently needs men who will go to the rural areas. I do not mean necessarily men who have knowledge of farming but those who are willing to go there and work. Last year I went to the Northam immigration centre to get 100 semi-skilled employees for the town of Lakewood. It is a long way from Perth in the gold-fields. Of 103 able-bodied men who were interrogated in my presence, only two volunteered to go. The others refused point blank. They said Lakewood was too hot. That experience impressed on me very forcibly that we cannot afford to bring men to Australia who will not go to the rural areas to work. I think that we have been apt to believe that the displaced persons who have baca brought to Australia have all become good workers. I do not deny that many of them have done so. But far too many have not been compelled to go to the rural areas. As soon as their period of contract labour has expired, I am certain that the great majority of them will drift back to the cities. I, therefore, urge the Minister to consider the need for workers in rural areas which is of national importance. </para>

                    <para>. -  When the Minister replies I would like him to refer to Division 190, Tasmanian shipping service subsidy. Already I can hear an outburst from Tasmanian senators from both sides of the chamber. Probably the Minister's explanation will justify the whole-hearted praise that has been thrust upon the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> to-night. In 1951 the subsidy was £16,000. This year the allocation is £90,000, I am merely seeking information. If this means an improved shipping service for the Australian continent, so much to the good. Can the Minister inform the Senate what is involved? Is the increase due to extra shipping or extra freight? In the next line there is reference to the Sydney- Vancouver service, for which £27,000 is allocated. When <inline font-style="italic">Aorangi</inline> was tied up in Sydney, an arrangement was entered into and I understand that the New Zealand Government was responsible for some of the subsidy. Will the Minister inform the Senate what is the total subsidy, and is it only for this year or does it cover a longer period? </para>

In respect of the Tasmanian service, the working expenses of <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> have increased because of the slow turn-round of ships and higher costs and a substantial increase in the subsidy was necessary. Otherwise the company would have had to continue the service at a loss, and it indicated that it was not prepared to do so. Having regard to the serious situation facing Tasmania if it had no shipping service to the mainland, the Government decided, wisely, I believe, to pay the cost to keep <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> afloat. </para>

                <para>In  the process of doing so, we are not getting the right types of immigrants in many cases and I was pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> refer to the need of the rural areas. All that we have done so far is to congest our capital cities. This talk of getting people to Australia to end shortages is only creating more problems. For the length of time worked each week and the consequent small production, these people are not helping the situation at all. We want people who will help to produce food and we are not getting them. </para>
                <para>I am concerned at the allocation of £8,085,000. In my city returned soldiers brought out a party of British immigrants. Within a few months there was hardly one of them remaining. They floated back to the capital cities. That is the case throughout Australia because we are rushing immigration. Even taking into account defence commitments and requirements, it would be better to be more selective and I feel confident that with the situation existing in other parts of the world over a period of years there will be people who will want to come to this country with the freedom and prospects that exist here for the right kind of immigrant. I was talking recently to a well-known British subject who came to Australia, and he said that this country was not getting the best types of British immigrant in many cases. He was concerned because he thought the people would not always be a good advertisement for the British. There are good and bad, but the proportion of poor immigrants is too large. It would be better to take in immigrants at a slower rate, and get those who will be good citizens and particularly those who will settle in country areas. 1 am concerned about the lack of migration from some places and the preponderance of immigrants from others. Provision is made for £125,000 for people from Malta. They are of British race and did a good job in the war. Provision is also made for £575,000 for Italians. This is a discrimination that I cannot understand. If Australia is to take exenemy subjects, why not make provision for German immigrants who have made good previously in Australia? I think the immigration policy is one of hustle and bustle and I believe that in years to come we shall pay the penalty of going too fast and not being selective enough. The Government should concentrate on selecting immigrants who will be prepared to go into our rural areas and to remain there. </para>

                    <para>. -  Provision is made under the heading " Miscellaneous " for an expenditure of £500 on " Assistance under Special Circumstances to exService Personnel or their Dependants ". I should like to know whether any special assistance could be provided out of that money for widows of deceased eximperial pensioners who are in necessitous circumstances. No provision is made for such widows under the Repatriation Act and if they are not entitled to the widows' pension or to some other social services benefit they have to depend on the charity of ex-servicemen's organizations in this country. There are quite a number of such widows. I have spoken to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> about this matter on several occasions, and I ask him now whether he will have a further investigation made with a view to providing some assistance for these deserving people. </para>

That appropriation is for the payment of compassionate allowances to deserted wives of Australian ex-servicemen, particularly ex-servicemen of the World War I. Provision is made also for the purchase and repair of surgical aids for an ex-serviceman named McConaghy who is not eligible for assistance under the Repatriation Act. I shall give consideration to the honorable  senator's representations on behalf of widows of imperial ex-servicemen. Each case would have to be dealt with on its merits, and an inquiry made to ascertain whether any payment was being received from the Government of the United Kingdom. Assistance could be granted only as an act of grace by the Treasurer. \. invite the honorable senator to let me have the details of any cases that he has in mind. </para>

                    <para>.- The maximum war service homes loan has now been raised from £2,000 to £2,750. In some instances persons who have let contracts for the construction of homes to private contractors and have obtained the previous maximum loan of £2,000 from the War Service Homes Division have found that their actual commitments have exceeded that amount. I should like to know whether such persons will be entitled to have their loans increased to ±2/750. </para>

                <para>The "War Service Homes Division has discontinued its earlier practice of taking over mortgages. Many persons have found that under conditions existing at present in the building trade they have not been able to obtain a home of the standard that they required for the maximum loan of £2,000. Consequently, they are obliged to obtain additional loans through other agencies, such as banks. 1 should like to know whether the new maximum loan will be made to persons who find themselves in such circumstances. As they have already received a loan from the division, they can offer only limited security when they endeavour to raise the requisite additional money through other agencies. The refusal of the division to take over mortgages places a hardship upon such persons. I suggest that the division should re-institute its practice of taking over mortgages. In that way, persons would not only be enabled to have constructed a home up to the standard that they require hut also would enjoy the consequential additional in ea sure of security. </para>
                <para>I should also like to know whether the War Service Homes Division will approve of the writing down of the value of properties that are still being paid off by ex-servicemen of World War I. Many ex-servicemen of that war have now paid more than double the original purchase price but have not yet discharged their full liability under their contract. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so in the instances that I have in mind. I am referring to wooden structures, some of which were built 34 years ago and have depreciated in value because of the fact that the localities in which they are situated have not developed. The suggestion that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> has made may be true in respect of homes that have been constructed in progressive towns, such as Devonport. The War Service Homes Division should write down the value of properties of the kind that I have mentioned. My attention has been directed to the case of an ex-serviceman of World War I. who contracted to pay £650 for his home. He has already paid £1,050 and still owes £300 under his contract. The division should be generous enough to write down the value of those homes to purchasers, particularly as such action will enable " diggers " of World War I. to enjoy a greater measure of security in their declining years. </para>

                    <para>.- Whilst the sum of £34,000 was voted last year in respect of Allied Control in Japan, the actual expenditure amounted to £36,267, and the proposed vote under that heading for this year is £69,000. I refer to this matter because reports were published in to-day's press that it is proposed that the British Commonwealth Occupation Force will be wound up in the near future. I should like to know whether Allied Control will be maintained in Japan for, say, the next twelve months. Honorable senators are aware that the peace treaty with Japan has been signed and also that the Japanese have already entered into competition on the Australian market with Australian manufacturers. </para>

The increase of that amount compared with the expenditure that was incurred under that heading last year is due to the probability that the mission will be thrown entirely upon its own resources in the near future. Up to the present, part of that cost has been paid by the Japanese. In addition, it is expected that the costs will rise considerably. </para>

                    raised three questions with respect to the financial assistance that is made available to individuals in respect of the construction of houses under the war service homes scheme. I suggest that the information that the honorable
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator has</inline>
                    sought can be more appropriately supplied when the relevant legislation that has been introduced in another place comes before the Senate. I could answer accurately if I had the proposed legislation before me. However, I shall have a stab at it, and if, when the legislation comes forward, it transpires that I have been incorrect, I trust that I shall be forgiven. I do not think that it would be possible to alter contracts that were commenced on a basis of a loan of £2,000 in the light of the recent increase of the maximum amount of loan to £2,750. I am aware that, as a matter of administration, the Commissioner of War Service Homes is meeting special cases. In any event, I do not think that the average ex-serviceman would want to go back on a contract that he entered into many years ago, under which he obtained certain conditions. The repayments are spread over a lengthy period, and borrowers derive advantages both at the beginning, and at the end of the contract. By and large, I do not consider that there is justification for recasting the whole of the contracts. The act provides for generous benefits, and generous re-arrangements when ex-servicemen really need assistance.
                </para>
                <para>The other aspect of the matter relates to a provision in the proposed legislation that is not before the chamber. Speaking in anticipation of that legislation, he has suggested that there will be a variation of the arrangements concerning the provision of finance in cases in which ex-servicemen are already in homes and want to discharge existing mortgages by substituting mortgages to the War Service Homes Division on more favorable terms and conditions. That has been the practice in the past. We are making the available financial resources go around to the best advantage.

This is a considerable increase compared with the expenditure of £2,302,742 under this heading during the last financial year. Will the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> inform me whether the proposed vote will coincide with the amount of subsidy to be paid to TransAustralia Airlines in respect of air mail services? The portion of the proposed vote in respect of the conveyance of Australian mails in other countries is £300,000. Will the Minister inform me of the cost of carriage per lb. both in Australian currency and in other currencies ? </para>

                    <para>. -  I shall be very glad to obtain for the honorable senator particulars of costs in the various countries. The increase is accounted for by higher payments to the Department of Civil Aviation, as a result of increased traffic and the inclusion of other articles in the categories of mail carried overseas. The proposed vote of £300,000 for the conveyance of surface mail is £4.2,124 lower than was the expenditure on this item during the last financial year. This is due to the considerable decrease of the number of food parcels being sent to the United Kingdom and Europe, and a corresponding decrease of payments for terminal charges. Amounts totalling £540,000 were paid to TransAustralia Airlines for the carriage of airmail during the last financial year. That was an average of 0.48d. per lb. a mile. The total payment to TransAustralia Airlines represented 67 per cent, of the payments for the conveyance of domestic airmail. Small amounts, also, were paid to two Western Australian airlines. That is a matter which concerns the Department of Civil Aviation. </para>

I consider that the full amount which is provided for the purchase of welfare equipment should be expended during the financial year, and that a part of it should not be transferred to the next financial year. The proposed expenditure for the current financial year is £7,000 compared with estimated expenditure last year of £9,000 and an actual expenditure of £3,626. My purpose in directing attention to this matter is to emphasize the importance of expending the amounts that are provided for the purchase of welfare equipment. </para>

From the figures that are shown in the printed estimates it would appear that the cost of that publication for the year ended the 30th June, 1951, was £26,576. Although the payments exceeded receipts by this amount,  it  does not mean that a loss of £26,576 was incurred. The income and expenditure account for the publication, which was compiled under a commercial system, discloses that the cost of the publication for 1950-51 was only about half of that amount. Owing to delays in overseas shipments during the previous year, the cash payments for newsprint purchased during 1950-51 were abnormal and exceeded by £12,400the cost of the. newsprint actually used. Honorable senators will therefore appreciate that the <inline font-style="italic">A.B.C. Weekly</inline> has an asset of £12,400 worth of newsprint at the present time. </para>

                <para>The financial position of the publication during 1951-52 will show a substantial improvement as a result of the action chat has been taken by the commission to discontinue from the Srd February, 1951, the printing of separate editions for Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania which will result in considerable reduction of printing and freight costs. Advertising rates have been increased by 25 per cent, from May, 1951, and the retail price of the journal was increased from 4d. to 6d. from the 9th June, 1951. As the result of this action, I have been informed that at the present time the <inline font-style="italic">A.B.C. Weekly</inline> is showing a profit. </para>

The Postmaster-General's Department invited tenders for the erection of that station in order that conclusions might be reached by the Government concerning the financial aspect of the matter. Subsequently, a. delegation comprising representatives of the Postal Department, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission was sent to the United State of America, Canada, and the United Kingdom to investigate certain aspects of a practical nature, such as studio design, the form of administration necessary, the availability of programmes and the cost of materials. That delegation recently submitted a comprehensive report to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> and I understand that he is preparing certain proposals for submission to the Cabinet.

Cost-of-living adjustments and general salary increases account for the increase of the estimated expenditure over actual expenditure last year. The Australian Broadcasting Commission, in its wisdom, wishes to provide the best possible service for the people, and such a service is necessarily expensive.

                    <para>.- A tradition of the Senate for many years has been to arrange for a brief suspension  of  proceedings when sittings continue beyond midnight. Many of us have been constantly in this chamber since 8 p.m., and this is the longest unbroken sitting for many years. There is likely to be considerable discussion of the proposed vote for the territories, and I suggest  to  the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> that the sitting be suspended at this stage. </para>

Unfortunately, at this late hour I do not think that we can make arrangements for the service of supper because most members of the refreshment-rooms staff have gone off duty. However, I shall endeavour to arrange for honorable senators to be supplied with tea and toast or sandwiches. The Government is anxious to have the .consideration of this bill completed during the present sitting because departmental officers have been brought to Canberra from other cities for the occasion. I remind honorable senators that the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff has been working for many hours to-day and that most of the matters that have been discussed in committee could have been dealt with more appropriately in speeches on the motion for the first reading or during the debate on the Estimates and budget papers. Detailed consideration of the schedule is intended to enable honorable senators to seek for information, not to make second-reading speeches. My remarks are addressed to honorable senators on both sides of the chamber. I shall endeavour to arrange for supper to be provided. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct attention to Division 250, "Australian Capital Territory - General Services ", for which the proposed appropriation is £782,000. There is an itemized list of " other services ", which includes an amount of £20,000 to provide for an anticipated loss on the operations of Australian Capital Territory hostels. I wish to make a request in connexion with the supply of food to those hostels. For a considerable time past, 'tariffs at government hotels and hostels in Canberra have been increasing steadily, and the quality of the food supplied has been deteriorating. I have been unable to discover who is responsible for buying the food supplied in these places. So bad is .it now that I should not be surprised if I were to see some one fall down from malnutrition. At Hotel Kurrajong, the meat may be fairly good in one month, but in the next month residents are called on to eat some of the toughest hide in the world. As a matter of fact, one would need a sharp axe to cut it. The Department of the Interior employs nutrition experts, but I believe they all should be booted out. One could get better food in Central Australia by carrying it a thousand miles on camel back than can be obtained in government hostels in Canberra. During a potato shortage, the first people to suffer are those who live at Hotel Kurrajong. I have had three tiny " spuds " since I have been in Canberra for this sessional period. Those in charge have noticed that Italians can live on spaghetti, so we who live in the government hotels get spaghetti instead of potatoes. At other times we are served with wishy-washy rice that no one can eat. Then, for a change, we get boston beans out of tins. They are tasteless, and quite useless as they are served. </para>
                </talk.start></interjection><para>I understand that the department will not buy fresh, vegetables from local growers. It will buy only in bulk, and local growers have to send their produce to Sydney, where some of it, I have no doubt, is bought by the Department of the Interior and brought back to Canberra. Sometimes we get spinach or silver beet. I have been told that this stuff can be washed until the moon turns blue without losing all the grit that it has in it. At other times we are served with something that is called cabbage, and it contains 50 per cent, of water. I have made inquiries, but I cannot discover who is responsible for the present conditions in government hotels and hostels. They are nominally controlled by the Department of the Interior, but the supplying of food is apparently controlled by nutrition experts who, as I have said, should be booted out. The hostels should be placed under the control of some dear old lady who knows how to cook. As things are, residents are being called upon to pay more and more for food that they cannot eat. An inquiry should be instituted with ;i view to providing better food and better facilities for cooking. </para><continue>

I should like to know how many miners are engaged in sampling work and the nature, of the maintenance of batteries that can involve the huge expenditure of £38,850. The services of a large number of highly technical men could be obtained for a lot less than that amount to maintain a battery that is not at work. Of course, if the battery is at Work the maintenance costs will be greater than it otherwise would be, I wish to know whether the Government has any interest in maintaining batteries for private companies. Is it sampling ores for private companies or is it interested in those matters on its own account? Can the Minister explain why last year's expenditure on this item having been only £26,250, it is proposed to expend £3S,850 on it this year?

                    <para>. - I refer to the item, " Grant to Administration towards expenses, including native welfare, development, war damage and reconstruction, £5,371,000", in Division 254 of the proposed vote for Papua and New </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Guinea..  The vote for last year was £4,578,000, yet the estimate this year is £5,371,000. I should like to know  why an increase of almost £1,000,000 is considered necessary, because surely reconstruction of war damage must have proceeded almost to completion. There is also the fact that the people of Rabaul have been told that they are to be evacuated. I should like to- know whether, building is going on now in Rabaul, and also whether the repair and re-organization of the naval base at Manus' Island is included in this estimate, because I cannot find it mentioned anywhere under the Defence estimates. If it is included in this estimate it is out of place because it should have been shown- in the Defence estimates. </para>
                <para>In passing, I should like to say that , I. very much appreciate the remarks, pf <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> in relation to this division. I am glad that there, is another honorable senator who is interested in this most important territory and is not afraid to say so. He spoke of the Legislative Council of the territory as something entirely new. It is. not hy any means new, because we had a good Legislative Council in the territory 30 years ago. The composition of the present Legislative Council is not in keeping with my ideas. We had a Legislative Council with nine elected and nine nominated members, the Administrator of the territory having a casting vote. The present Legislative Council has three elected members of a total of 29 members. That is hardly democratic, but we can work on that matter in the course of the next three years and perhaps have something done about it. The honorable senator also said that the Chamber of Commerce was opposed to the Legislative Council being constituted. That is not so. It was against the principle of having only three elected members. I shall not carry that matter any further. I merely wished to put the honorable senator right about those points. I have no doubt that if we get together we can talk these matters over. New Guinea, Dutch New Guinea and the British Solomon Islands are far too important to be party playthings. </para>
                <para>I turn now to the item, " Shipping service, £58,000 ", in Division 254. The vote for 1950-51 was £60,000, and for some reason it has been reduced this year to £58,000. Whoever was responsible for the notation to the item, " Amounts earned may be credited to this vote ", has a perverted sense of humour. Does the proposed vote of £58,000 represent the amount that may he lost on the operation of the shipping service, or does it represent something else? Does the expenditure of £88,650 last year represent an actual loss on the running of the shipping service, or does it, too, represent something else altogether? </para>

                    <para>. - War damage and reconstruction represent only some of the work to  be  covered by the proposed vote for item 1 " Grant to Administration towards expenses, including native welfare, development, war damage and reconstruction ". Australia has international commitments in respect of the trust territory of New Guinea. Some progress has been made in the restoration of areas devastated by the war, but it is clear that, if there is to be complete restoration, and if material progress is to be made in the development of the resources of the territory, substantial amounts will have to  be  provided by the Commonwealth for expenditure over a period of years on capital works and for the extension of existing district, health, agricultural, educational and other services. </para>

                <para>Present arrangements for the operation of the Papua and New Guinea interisland shipping service provide  that  Burns Philp and Company Limited, New Guinea Company Limited, Colyer Watson Limited, and Steamships Trading Company  Limited,  shall operate  a  fleet of 23 government-owned vessels,  as  agents for the Government. The Government will provide the vessels and meet the cost of operating the service. It will receive all revenue derived from the service and the agents will be paid a managing fee, plus a percentage of the revenue. Due to the unusually large number of vessels laid up for repairs, extraordinary losses occurred during the first half of 1951. A large portion of the expenditure for 1951-52 will be for the purpose of balancing those losses. </para>

                        <para>. - The Opposition does not intend to oppose this measure, but honorable senators on this side, of the  chamber are glad of the opportunity to examine it, even though it be done at such an early hour in the morning. It is regrettable that we have to keep so many of the senior officers of the various departments in the chamber, but we do not see them often enough. Honorable senators see them only once a year when the departmental estimates are being considered. TI] is gives members of the Opposition an opportunity to have clarified many aspects of government administration. During the year, honorable senators sometimes have difficulty in securing equal clarity when asking questions of Ministers. To-day, honorable senators had an outstanding illustration of clarity when questions were asked because of the expert assistance that was given to Ministers by officers from the departments. I believe that in the circumstances the officers should not be hurried away. The length of the sitting is not the fault of the Opposition. If the Government had planned its business .properly, it would not have had highly paid and highly respected officers of Commonwealth departments sitting in the chamber for so protracted a period. They are here to do a job for the members of the Government parties and for honorable senators on the Opposition side as well. That happens only once in a year. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I now turn to the proposed appropriation for works and services. The Government proposes to expend on works and services this year about £101,000,000. Last year's expenditure on the same account was approximately £68,000,000. The expenditure is thus estimated to increase by nearly £33,000,000. I do not know whether the country will actually get any more works constructed or services rendered for the expenditure of that additional sum, or whether the provision  is merely a measure of the inflation that has occurred since last year. If the object be to counter inflation, then we shall get only the same actual value for the expenditure of £101,000,000 as we got last year for the expenditure of about £33,000,000 less. I suggest that the Government will be hard pressed in the next twelve months to carry out the works and services ' contemplated. One of the reasons for that is our diminishing overseas credits. The reduction of our credits will naturally affect our imports. At present a very important part of our overseas imports consists of steel, cement and other products used in our building programme which are unobtainable in this country. Moreover, prefabricated houses, schools and post offices are being erected in large numbers throughout the country. That is a very good thing. However, if our overseas credits continue to diminish in the frightening way in which they have diminished during the last few months, the Government will have to reduce substantially its imports of prefabricated building components. </para>
                    <para>The policy being applied in Commonwealth departments was laid, down by the Chifley Government. When it became apparent in 1947 that the Australian production of steel and other fundamental building materials could not keep pace with our requirements, instructions were given to departments that they should obtain overseas as much as possible of their requirements of steel and other building materials. I suppose one of the reasons why the proposed vote for works and services is so large is that we have to buy materials overseas at very high prices. Of course, no matter how high may be the prices, the materials must be obtained. If our overseas credits continue to dwindle, many of the works that are at present in hand will have to be suspended, and those in contemplation will not be commenced. Time alone will prove whether that action will be necessary. </para>
                    <para>I do not know whether the Postal Department constructs its own buildings, or whether they are constructed by the Department of Works and Housing. However that may be, I recently saw an illustration of a tremendous waste of expensive imported material. I saw land which had been prepared for the erection of a post office. Foundations were laid, after which the whole project was left in abeyance for some months. Then a building crew arrived and, in a few days, erected a beautiful prefabricated post office. For months afterwards the building stood idle because no internal fittings had been put into it. There was a building, which represented an investment of probably thousands of pounds, lying idle because a little extra work had not been done. That loss of use occurred through the inability of either the Department of Works and Housing or the Postal Department to complete the job. It is a very sad thing to see valuable assets lying idle because we have not the power to put them into use quickly. </para>
                    <para>In 1949-50 the vote for the equipment and furniture of Australia House and the official residences in London was £70,000. During that year £78,632 w:is expended. This year the vote will be £S0.000. At the end of this financial year probably almost £160,000 will have been expended in two years on equipment and furniture for Australia House and the official residences in London. I submit that that is a lot of money to expend for such purposes. I saw Australia House in 194S and I do not think that it has changed much since then. According to my recollection of the building, it is difficult to understand how this large amountcould be effectively expended. According to the estimates there are only two official residences in London, those of the High Commissioner and the  Deputy  High Commissioner. The amount voted for expenditure on Australia House and the official residences seems very high, and I should like the Minister to explain the reason for the necessity to. vote such a large sum. </para>
                    <para>Another matter to- which I desire to direct the attention of the Minister is the proposed vote of £240,000 for the Royal visit next year. However, there will be an interesting increase of the expenditure on Government House in Canberra. I should like to know whether the £240,000 will cover all the expenses connected with the visit, or whether there  will be other expenses that will not be defrayed out of that vote. For instance, the estimated expenditure on Government House for this financial year is about twice as much as was expended last year. Is that sum to be expended on Government House because Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh will visit Australia, and, if so, why should it not be added to the vote for the Royal visit? </para>

I have a substantial volume of information concerning Australia House. According to that informamation it is apparent that extensive alterations to and renovations at Australia House are in contemplation. The items range from an estimate of £10,000 for lavatory accommodation to £15,000 for the installation of new boilers and £21,000 for the reconstruction of office accommodation. The note that has been supplied to me mentions that the alterations and renovations have been under consideration since November, 1949. In May, 1950, the then Resident Minister in London made a special report and in July of the same year, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> made a personal inspection while on a visit to the United Kingdom. Obviously, therefore, the proposed extensions have been carefully considered and have been in contemplation for a considerable period. </para>

                    <para>. - The subject that I wish to discuss was referred to during my absence last Thursday night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton.</inline> It is a matter that I should like to have cleared up. I have paid <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> the courtesy of seeking an occasion when he is present in this chamber to speak on this subject, and to reply to the allegations that he made against me. I should have thought that, having had the experience of being mistaken for a Communist at a Melbourne political meeting at which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> had to come to his aid, he would have been a little more careful in bandying the word " Communist " about this chamber. My colleagues know where I stand on that matter. Some weeks ago, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration whether it was a. fact that there were in Australia declared war criminals who had come here under the displaced persons immigration scheme. The answer that I received to that question was that no displaced  persons against whom war crimes had been proved, had been admitted to Australia. I then asked the Minister whether two immigrants, whom I named, were at present in Australia, and whether they had been declared by the Government of Yugoslavia to be war criminals. I also asked whether a third immigrant, whom I named, had applied for Australian citizenship under the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan),</inline> who replied, on behalf of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer),</inline> carefully avoided giving a direct reply to those questions. I then asked whether it was the policy of the Government to allow Australia to become a dumping ground for European war criminals. In reply to that question I was given a comprehensive answer, which set out, amongst other things, the post-war records of the immigrants whom I had named, but made no reference to their activities while, allegedly, they were imprisoned during the war. On the 8 th May of this year, an extradition order was applied for by the Government of Yugoslavia through its consular officials in Sydney. The Yugoslav Government wanted the first two immigrants to whom I have referred to be returned to that country so that they could be tried for war crimes. Three months after that application was made, issue No. 25 of the <inline font-style="italic">Jewish News,</inline> published on the 21st September, openly made allegations similar to those that I had made in this chamber; yet the Department of External Affairs, in its note to the Consul-General for Yugoslavia on the 30th June - a little more than one month later - stated that the matter was being considered by the competent Australian authorities and that the Yugoslav Consulate would be duly advised of the position. The application for an extradition order against these two men was made on the 8th May, 1951. There was much discussion of the case after that, but no statement to clear up the matter was made until this evasive statement was made to me on the 8th November. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It evaded every question that I had asked. It was more or less an indirect reply to the authority which had applied for the extradition of these men, but that authority has not received a reply from the Department of External Affairs. A statement was published in the Jewish press a month or more after the extradition order was applied for. No action was taken for more than five months after the order was applied for. "Why has not the Department of Immigration or the Department of External Affairs attempted to clear the names of these men? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> said that the person who made these allegations should be summoned to appear at the bar of the Senate. The men have been accused of grave crimes, but, although five months have elapsed since the extradition order was applied for, no action has been taken. In those circumstances, the people who read the Jewish press may believe that the men are, as has been alleged, wanted for war crimes. </para>

                        <para>- I can watch, and I can also speak my mind. I should not call upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to act as a judge in cases of this kind because, with his blinkers, he can only look ahead. I do not think he would recognize a fascist if he saw one. The Department of External Affairs is charged with the responsibility of either clearing the names ot these men or of extraditing them. Five months ago, the Yugoslav Consul applied for the extradition of the men to face very grave charges. When the Government of Yugoslavia or of any other country that is represented in Australia applies, through the proper diplomatic channels, for an extradition order, the representative of that government in Australia should have extended to him the ordinary courtesies that are extended to the diplomatic representatives of othercountries. The fact that the Department; of External Affairs has delayed the clearing up of this very serious matter for five months gives me cause to believe chat everything is not open and above board. I should like the department to take some definite action with a view to disposing of the matter finally. </para>

                    <para>. - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> began to speak. I hoped that some regard would be had to the ordinary decencies and that, having accused two men, whom he had named, of foul crimes, he would either produce some evidence in support of his charges or withdraw the charges, admitting that he could not substantiate them and that in having made them he had made a cruel and tragic mistake. But, as the honorable senator's apologia progressed, I was forced to the conclusion that he was going to do none of those things. It was obvious that, in no circumstances, would he admit that an injustice had been done to the men. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I shall not reply in any way to his personal reflections upon me. That would be too much like shooting a squatting rabbit, and would be a waste of time. I realize that honorable senators must be allowed to bring to the notice of the Senate matters that they consider to be of high public moment and that, in so doing, they should be shielded from ordinary legal processes. In that way things can be done that otherwise could not be done. But honorable senators also have imposed upon them the heavy responsibility of ensuring that that privilege shall not be abused and that no charges shall be made in this chamber against any person until every effort has been made to sift all the available evidence and to ensure that no reputation shall be wantonly and lightly destroyed. My complaint is that in this case <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> has made no attempt to check, through proper channels, the accuracy of the information that came into his possession. I believe that in this instance the privilege to which I have referred has been abused. It is of the utmost importance that we should not allow this chamber to become a place in which Communist organizations or other organizations can use credulous dupes to carry on smear campaigns or to indulge in character assassination that those organizations could not carry  on or indulge  in publicly and be free from libel actions. I do not now accuse, and have not before accused, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> of being a Communist, but I do say that the charges that have been levelled against these two men proceed from a Communist. All the evidence that has been produced in reply to the questions that the honorable senator asked goes to show that the two men are being attacked because they are now, and have been before, violent anti-Communists. Underlying this charge, without the honorable senator's knowledge, is an attempt by Communists to smear people who are opposing them. </para>
                <para>Let me put the matter to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> in this way: He has been a prisoner of war and has been in a prison camp. How would he like it if somebody rose in this place and said that, while in a prison camp, he had given to the enemy information that should not have been given to them, and if then, in support of that vile accusation, the accuser said that some enemy of the honorable senator had written to him and had told him that that was so? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> would justly resent that. That is why I resent thu allegations that have been made against these men, whom I have never seen and about whom I know nothing except that the reply to the honorable senator's questions goes to show, as far as it is possible to show, that the accusations are not likely to be true. I say also that there is more to this matter than the mere blasting of a man's reputation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> wants to go further - this is literally true - be wants to send these men back to their death, and he is prepared to do that solely on the say-so of a person who is notoriously opposed to them on ideological grounds. That is the sort of practice that filled concentration camps ir; fascist Germany and is now filling similar camps in Communist Russia.  In  order that similar injustices shall not be allowed to occur in this country, it is time that attention was drawn to the danger that can flow from this sort of thing. </para>

                        <para>- In having failed to do so, he may have shown bad judgment. However, he had reasonable grounds for placing his questions upon the notice-paper. Subsequently, he received from the Consul-General for Yugoslavia ti statement which developed still further the allegations that had been made against these two gentlemen. Then, it appears that as the matter developed, the Consul-General for Yugoslavia in May last contacted the Government on an official  country-to-country  level and requested the extradition of these two men. Wher ever elm any degree of responsibility may rest in this matter it. certainly rests upon the Government. Whether or not others share that responsibility, I shall not say. If the Government either in private correspondence to the Consul-General for Yugoslavia, or in a public statement, supplied the same answer as was supplied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne's</inline> question, upon notice, the matter to my mind was then finalized. The reply was reasonable. That should have ended the matter. But the Government took, five months to answer the correspondence that it had received from the Consul-General for Yugoslavia, which, whether all honorable senators approve of the fact or not, is a country that is friendly to Australia. Yugoslavia has consular representation in this country. Yet its representative's application for the extradition of these two men  was ignored by the Government for five months. </para>

                        <para>- But not to the degree that the matter has been determined one way or the other. The charges are still floating. I suggest that the best way to clear up the charges once and for all would be to invite the Consul-General for Yugoslavia to appear at the bar of the Senate to supply to honorable senators the evidence upon which he has alleged that these men are war criminals. If he cannot produce the requisite proof, the men would be enabled- to walk again in the light. They would be absolved publicly of the charges and would be in the clear. But if the allegations are not cleared up these men will continue to walk in the shadows, because there is a period from 1941 to 1945 that I do not think the immigration authorities have been able to check completely in respect of their movements. The only man who it would seem can prove the allegations is the Consul-General for Yugoslavia. If it be shown that the allegations have been made as part of a wicked political persecution, we should be enabled to ascertain that fact and let these men go, completely free from taint and suspicion. </para>

All honorable senators who heard his allegations will admit that the replies that were furnished to him were complete and gave the lie direct to the charges that he or the Consul-General or the Vice-Consul for Yugoslavia levelled against these men. I was particularly impressed by one part of the answer of the Minister. I suggest that the questions that were asked both in regard to Lukic and Rajkovic were of a kind that can do irreparable harm not only to our immigration scheme generally, but also to the individuals concerned. Particularly is this so when the allegations are found to be without evidence, as in these two cases, and to have been based on reasons which, to say the least, could be defined as being irresponsible, irrespective of whether they came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> from whom we have become accustomed to expect nothing but irresponsible statements, or from the Consul-General for Yugoslavia, or from the Vice-Consul.

I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> will convey the following information to his informants. The war-time record of Milorod Lukic  was as follows : - He was interned in  Oflag VI.b.  Warburg, Westphalia, from, the 1st May, 1941, to the 23rd October, 1941. From that date until the 23rd April, 1943, he was interned at  Oflag XIII.b  Nuernberg. On that day, as a result of British bombing, the whole camp was transferred to a new site at  Hammelburg,  where he remained from the 24th April, 1943, till the 6th April, 1945. He was then released. During the whole of the time he was in the various camps he was under the direct supervision of the International Bed Cross, and the records of those camps can be checked with that m03t reliable organization. He is accused of having caused the deaths of many of the inmates of the camps. The facts are that during those years there were only three violent deaths in the camps. The circumstances of those fatalities were immediately investigated by the International Red Cross authorities, and the reports about them exist and can be checked. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> that he examine them. I shall give the details of the three deaths from violence. In 1945, two American officers, at Hammelburg,  were killed during an air raid because they did not run for cover quickly enough. Those fatalities were immediately investigated, and the report in relation to the circumstances is in existence. In May, 1942, at  Oflag  XIII.b Nuernberg, 'a </para>

He did not move quickly enough and a guard fired a shot into the air to cause the prisoners to hurry. The bullet ricocheted and killed the man. Honorable senators can ascertain from the records how many violent deaths occurred in the camp. </para>

                    <para>Rajkovic  was in the concentration camp at  Klos/Albania.  That camp was under the supervision, not of International Red Cross, but of the Italian Red Cross, and the man in charge of it was Bishop Orthodox, of Montenegro. A record of that camp is also in existence.  Rajkovic  was subsequently transferred to the  Sulmona  concentration camp in Italy, where he remained until he was finally released. Records of that camp are also in existence. Many persons in Australia who were in that camp are able to substantiate the details of those records. As I have stated, all the records can be checked. That is one way in which we can ascertain whether those two men were involved in the alleged killings. I mentioned last week that  Rajkovic  and  Lukic  were members of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. I do not like to rub salt into the wounds of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> but I should like to inform the Senate that Lukic  is a prominent figure in Western Australia, and a prominent member of the State branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. He has taken an active part in the recruiting campaign. He has spoken from the stand of honour in Forrest-.pla.ce, Perth, from which he has appealed for recruits. In that respect at least he has a greater assessment of our defence needs than has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne.

Sonic Labour politicians are only too ready to find fault with the post-war European migrants. They are not doing this for the general benefit of Australis but for selfish, political ends. </para>

                            states that the Yugoslav Government has declared these two men  to  be war criminals. From the end of 1944, when he took control of Yugoslavia,  to  June,1948, when he separated from the Cominform, Marshal Tito and many of his Ministers named

                    <para class="block">The Yugoslav community in Western Australia, and many' new Australians, deeply resent what has happened.

Just as  those new  Australians have come to look for democratic principles in this country of  their  adoption, so will a majority of honorable senators see that those principles are applied in this case. </para>
