The Ambassador was seriously, but not critically, wounded in the stomach, and a blood transfusion was performed. The military attache and the financial adviser, who accompanied him, were unhurt. As yet there is no definite evidence of the nationality of the attacking aeroplanes. The Ambassador's car was flying the Union Jack, hut of the size of the flag I am not informed. </para>

                                <para> About three years ago a joint Japanese-Western Australian deputation waited on the Minister for Trade and Customs and requested the exemption from customs duties under by-law of machinery and equipment of Japanese manufacture which might be imported for use in the development of iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound. The granting of concessions such as that sought is subject to the condition that plant or equipment of the class or kind of that to he imported is not being commercially manufactured, firstly, in Australia, and, secondly, in the United Kingdom. In view of the general nature of the request, and of the probability that much of the plant would be of a class or kind capable of commercial manufacture in Australia and the United Kingdom, the request was refused by the Minister. No specific request for by-law concession has since been received. Any such specific request would, if made, be dealt with in accordance with the general principles governing the granting of by-law concessions. </para>

                                <para>In 1936-37, the Loan Council, by unanimous resolution, decided the amount of loan money to be included in the Commonwealth loan programme for all purposes. Of this sum, the maximum amount that was possible, £1,500,000, was allocated to rural debt relief. The States subsequently applied to the Commonwealth, from time to time, for the amounts they required within the limits set by the Loan Council. In the case of some States last year, the full amounts decided by the Loan Council were not drawn, but any savings of this kind were allotted amongst the other States. As regards 1937-38, the position was discussed by the Loan Council at its meeting in July last, and it was ultimately decided that the total amount to be included in the Commonwealth loan programme of 1937-38 for this purpose would be £2,500,000. Agreement could not be secured at the Loan Council as to the allocation of this sum amongst the States. The Commonwealth is at present considering how the amount will be allocated. </para>

                        <para>- The  President  of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Lynch)</inline> has been informed that the fact that the Commonwealth Government is generally in accord with his views is evidenced by the policy which it has adopted towards the mining industry during recent years. During 1935, the Commonwealth agreed to co-operate with the States in a scheme which was designed to stimulate the development of the metalliferous mining industry on a nation-wide basis. The Commonwealth provided £500,000 for this purpose, spread over a period of three years, which will expire on the 30th June, 1938. One of the purposes for which these moneys were made available was the assistance of prospecting. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Western Australian quota of the Commonwealth provision of £500,000 was £106,400, £66,800 of which was allocated for prospecting. The scheme has proved an important factor in the achievement of gratifying results. Since it came into operation, direct employment has been provided in the mining industry for an additional 8,000 men, and the value of gold production has increased from £7,544,491 in 1934 to £10,172,420 in 1936, and £5,647,782 in the first six months of 1937. In addition to the metalliferous mining scheme, the Commonwealth Government is co-operating with the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia in an aerial, geological and geophysical survey of Northern Australia. The Commonwealth provision for this survey was £75,000, and the States each provided £37,500. In effect, this financial provision results in the expenditure in this regard by the States being subsidized by the Commonwealth to the extent of 331/3 per cent, so far as their territories are concerned. The pooling of the resources of three governments in connexion with this survey enables the employment of the most up-to-date scientific methods, including those of aerial photography and geophysics, whose cost would probably be beyond the reach of any single government. This survey is materially benefiting the mining industry in the territories concerned. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of this bill is to provide that the qualification of electors of the Australian Dairy Produce Board shall be conferred only on those persons who are enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll in accordance with the provisions of Part VII. of the Commonwealth Electoral Act  1918-1934.  By an amendment of the Dairy Produce Export Control Act in  1935  the Australian Dairy Produce Board was created. The constitution of this Board is - One government nominee ; one elected by the Federal Council of the Australian Dairy Factory Managers' and Secretaries' Association; two elected by Owners of Proprietary and Privatelyowned Butter and Cheese Factories; two elected to represent Co-operative Butter and Cheese factories in each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland; one elected to represent Cooperative Butter and Cheese factories in each of the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, one elected by producers in each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland ; and one elected by producers of the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. In all these cases, with the obvious exception of the government nominee, election is as prescribed. </para>
                    <para>Turning now to the regulations to ascertain the manner in which these elections are conducted, we find that for the elected representative of the Federal Council of the Australian Dairy Factory Managers' and Secretaries' Association, the secretary of that council must furnish to the Chief Electoral Officer a list of the names and addresses of the members of that council, and that list is deemed to be the roll for that election. For the election of the representatives of the co-operative butter and cheese factories, all producers are entitled to vote who supplied, during the year preceding the election,milk or cream to any co-operative butter or cheese factory in the State in which they were producing. It is also provided that a producer entitled to vote for co-operative representatives, as well as for all other representatives of which I have made mention, shall, before his name is placed on a roll in respect of any of these elections, lodge with the returning officer certain prescribed forms attesting his eligibility to vote as an owner or a producer. It will be seen from this, therefore, that there is no question of basic eligibility of the voter to comply with the first principles of citizenship: ie., that ho should be qualified to have his name enrolled on the Commonwealth electoral rolls. Thus a man not having this qualification as an Australian citizen, is nevertheless entitled to record his vote as to who should or should not be elected a representative on the Australian -Dairy " Produce Board. It is to remove this anomaly that the present bill is brought down and I commend it to the favorable consideration of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the law of some foreign countries takes no cognizance of the fact that their nationals have become naturalized Australian citizens. That is to say, the status of such persons, so far as the laws of those countries are concerned, remains unaltered. For that reason we should not encourage a person to become a voter in Australia for the purpose of exercising a voice in the control of an important industry if he be still subject to the law of the land of his birth. He may be conscripted by the other government for service abroad. Before a person is permitted to exercise a vote in connection with the direction of any Australian industry he should be wholly an Australian citizen; he should become assimilated in the Australian community so that ultimately his descendants will lose their foreign identity and associations. If it be too late now to consider that matter in con- nexion with this bill, I .hope that the Government will give attention to it in the future, and make special enquiries to determine what nations insist that their nationals, even though they become naturalized citizens of another country, shall retain their original nationality. </para>

                        <para>. -  Can the leader of the Senate give us any indication of the number of persons who will be affected by this provision? So far as I am aware, comparatively few persons are involved, and therefore it seems to be rather paltry to single them out, as is done in this measure. Doubtless there is some more important reason for this amendment than appears on the surface of it. At the present time a minor, if he were a dairyman, would be given a vote, and possibly a person who is not a British subject would also be eligible; but the numbers must be very few. </para>

                        <para>-  I assure the Honorable senator that the Government has not acted without advice on this matter. Although comparatively few  persons  will be affected by the provisions of this bill, ;i. considerable number will be affected by a similar measure, which will presently lie before the Senate. If it were not for this provision there would be sufficient unnaturalized aliens in some areas of Australia to decide an election for the Dried Fruits Export Control Board.

                            <para>- That will take some years. The matter seems too small to warrant a bill of this kind, particularly as it will not affect many people. A citizen of the United States of America might decide to invest a considerable sum of money in a dairy farm in Australia; but he would not be entitled to exercise a vote in the control of the industry. In view of the fact that an overwhelming percentage of the persons engaged in the industry are Australians, their numbers would be sufficient to counteract any detrimental effects that might possibly result from a block alien vote. This prohibition is not a friendly gesture towards foreign nationals. If there were present any great danger to the community, I could see reason, for the incorporation of this provision. </para>

                            <para>- It might easily happen that an alien would be elected to the board. As has been indicated by interjection, these aliens are entitled to become naturalized Australian citizens ; naturalization should be a <inline font-style="italic">sine qua non</inline> of a person having any control of the industry in which he is engaged. As to the matter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> raised, I take it that unquestionably the aliens, even if disfranchised, will be required to comply with the provisions of the act. I cannot imagine that any country would permit a person who is not a naturalized citizen of it to possess powers which might lead to his becoming actually one of the controllers of an important industry. The principle contained in this clause is sound, and if it is to be applied to other industries, that is a greater reason why honorable senators should support it. </para>

The Dried Fruits Export Control Board consists of one member appointed by the Governor-General as the representative of the Commonwealth Government; two representatives elected by growers in the State of Victoria, and one representative elected by growers in each of the States of New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia and two members with commercial experience appointed by the Governor-General. </para>

                <para>In introducing the budget for 1937-38 in the House of Representatives to-day the Treasurer, the Honorable R. G. Casey, said that it is not too much to claim that at the present time Australia has reached the highest level of prosperity ever recorded. Based on unemployment percentages reported to the Statistician by trade unions, unemployment has declined from 30 per cent, in the second quarter of 1932 to 9.7 per cent, to-day. On more complete figures which are available for New South Wales and Queensland, it is evident that the position is even better than these percentages indicate. The value of production has increased in the five years by over 40 per cent., and building and construction in the same period have more than quadrupled. The market for Australian primary products has materially improved, the value of our wool clip in 1936-37 being almost  double that in 1931-32. "Wheat also has shown nearly as marked an increase. Export prices in 1936-37 show the substantial increase of 20 per cent, over 1935- 36. The extent of the recovery is further illustrated by the fact that in 1936- 37 Australia had a favorable trade balance of nearly £36,000,000. The marked recovery during the period of its office is a source of great satisfaction to the Government, which can reasonably claim to have contributed in no small measure to this achievement by following a sound financial policy. </para>
                <para>The improved condition of the country is reflected, also, in the budgetary position of both the Commonwealth and the State Governments. The aggregate deficits of the Commonwealth and the States for the year 1930-31 amounted to £25,390,000, and in 1931-32 to £19,490,000; but in 1936-37 an aggregate surplus of £965,000 was recorded. </para>
                <para>Since the assumption of office in December, 1931, by the Lyons Government, the Commonwealth debt has been reduced by £11,019,000 to £386,910,000. During the year a loan of £12,360,000 was converted in London, with a saving in interest and .exchange of £46,000 per annum. . Further loans totalling £11,410,000 will mature on the 1st February, 1938. Two loans of <inline font-style="italic">£7,500,000</inline> each were raised in Australia during the year 1936-37, the yield of the first being £3 19s. 4d. per cent., and of the second, £3 19s. Id. per cent, per annum. In the current financial year the Loan Council has decided to limit the borrowing for Sta te and Commonwealth purposes to £16,000,000, of which the Commonwealth's share wall be £2,500,000. The whole of this latter amount will be used for grants to the States for rural debt adjustment. </para>
                <para>The national debt sinking fund has played a most important part in connexion with the debt. Since the establishment of the fund in 1923, over £75,000,000 has been provided for the redemption of Commonwealth debt, and over £37,000,000 has been paid to the fund for the redemption of State debts since the State sinking funds were established in 1928. This year £5,580,000 will be provided for State sinking funds, and £4,630,000 for the Commonwealth sinking fund, a total of more than £10,000,000. </para>
                <para>The revenue for 1936-37 amounted to £82,807,977, and the expenditure _ to £81,531,419, showing an excess of receipts over expenditure amounting to £1,276,558. Practically the whole of this excess is due to increased income tax receipts on account of the more rapid payment of outstanding arrears. It is proposed that £1,000,000 of these excess receipts shall be set aside for the public works of the Postmaster-General's Department, and that £276,558 shall be applied to the reduction of the accumulated deficit of the Commonwealth, which will then be £15,658,000. </para>
                <para>For the year 1937-38, the Government again presents a balanced budget. Since it assumed office in December, 1931, the burden of taxation on the Australian, people has been considerably reduced by this Government. Successive reductions have been made of sales tax, land tax, and income tax, while the entertainments tax has been abolished altogether. In order to illustrate the value of these reductions of taxes, I point out that, had the income tax, sales tax and land tax been continued at the 1931-32 rates, they would have yielded £36,500,000 in the current financial year instead of the £18,200,000 which is shown in the budget. Extensive reductions have also occurred in primage duties and in customs - British preferential - and excise duties on certain commodities. In view of the formidable and inescapable increases of its obligations for the immediate future, the Government regrets that it is unable still further to reduce taxes in this financial year. </para>
                <para>The estimated budget results for 1937-38 may be summarized as follows : - Estimated revenue, £85,190,000; estimated expenditure, £85,160,000; estimated excess receipts, £30,000. </para>
                <para>It is proposed to increase the rate of invalid and old-age pensions from 19s. to £1 a week, representing a cost of £800,000 in a full financial year. Further increases are due to the normal growth of the number of pensioners, and by the fact that, in this year, there will be 27 pension pay-days instead of the  usual 26. In all, invalid and old-age pensions will cost practically £2,000,000 more than last year. </para>
                <para>Following the discussions on Empire defence at the Imperial Conference, substantial provision has been made for strengthening our defences. The total amount to be expended in this direction will be £11,531,000, as compared with £S,067,000 in the last financial year. These defence proposals are to be financed as follows: - From revenue, £6,000,000; from defence equipment trust account, £2,656,000; from civil aviation defence account, £375,000; from loan fund, £2,500,000. </para>
                <para>For some years it has been the practice to pay as much as possible of excess receipts of the Commonwealth to the defence equipment trust account, and to draw upon this account to assist the budget in respect of defence expenditure in subsequent years. At the close of 1936-37 approximately £3,000,000 was held in the defence trust accounts, and practically the whole of this sum is being committed during the current financial year. The Government has decided to meet the balance of £2,500,000 from loan fund. To this end it is proposed to raise £2,000,000 sterling, that is, £2,500,000 in Australian currency, by means of. Commonwealth  treasury-bills  from the Commonwealth Bank in London and, at a later date, to fund the short term securities from the proceeds of a public loan. This course has been decided on, because, first it is desired to restrict the total raisings of all governments in Australia in 1937-38 to £16,000,000 ; and secondly, a conversion operation of £72,700,000 has to be dealt with in 1938. Moreover, by this means, we shall be able to finance our expenditure in Great Britain for defence equipment without encroaching on our existing London funds. </para>
                <para>The total additional provision in this financial year for war pensions and repatriation i3 £212,000. It is proposed to increase the rate of war service pensions from 19s. to £1, involving an additional <inline font-style="italic">charge</inline> of £22,000 on the budget. </para>

Ince, Chief Insurance Officer of the British Ministry of Labour, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir "Walter</inline> Kinnear, Controller of Insurance in the Ministry of Health in Great Britain, respectively. The former report was recently discussed, with representatives of the States, when it was arranged that a committee of officers and actuaries, representing the Commonwealth and States, should further examine certain aspects of unemployment insurance. The matter of health and pensions insurance is now under consideration by the Government. Towards the initial expense of national insurance, £75,000 is included in the budget. </para>
                <para>It is proposed to grant superannuation rights, together with the right to furlough for long and meritorious service, to as many members as possible of the staffs of the High Commissioner's office, the War Service Homes and Repatriation Departments, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, who arc, in fact, though not technically, permanent officers. ' </para>
                <para>The estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department for this financial year provide for an increase of the expenditure chargeable to revenue, by about £900,000, and for a corresponding increase of the receipts of that -department.' The Government has carried out a policy of continuous improvement of postal, telegraphic, telephonic and broadcasting services. This is illustrated by the progressive increase of expenditure on new works of the Postmaster-General's Department from £865,000 in 1933-34 to an estimate of £3,250,000 in 1937-38. As I have already said, £1,000,000 of the £3,250,000 will be provided from excess receipts of last year. There has been extensive development in air-mail and passenger services and telephone facilities, particularly in the country, whilst additional broadcasting facilities have also been provided. It is pleasing to note that, in respect of all this work, Australian manu-  factures have been used to a far greater extent than in the past. </para>
                <para>The sum of £10,000 has been provided i.o meet possible commitments which may arise in 1937-38 in connexion with Pacific shipping services. This matter was discussed at the Imperial Conference, and it is hoped that an agreement will shortly be entered into under which two new ships will replace those at .present operated by the Canadian-Australasian line. </para>
                <para>The provision in 1937-38 for scientific and industrial research is £170,000, compared with £138,000 for 1936-37. Excellent work has been done by the council, and, as a result, increasing contributions are being received from industry. Research is being pursued with regard to the blowfly pest, pasture improvement, forestry, fruit preservation, &amp;c, and early in 1938 a fisheries investigation vessel will bo in operation under the guidance of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thompson,</inline> formerly Director of Fisheries in Newfoundland. </para>
                <para>The Government has undertaken to provide £334,000, and the New South Wales Government £166,000, as debenture capital for the development of the shale oil industry at Newnes. Towards this amount a first instalment of £100,000 is provided in the present budget. From the £250,000 appropriated under the Petroleum Oil Search Act 1936 assistance has been approved for several companies in the search for flow oil, and the prospects are considered promising. </para>
                <para>In accordance with a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, the Government proposes to establish a new department of the Commonwealth Bank to provide facilities for fixed and long-term lending, and a bill for the purpose will be introduced this session. </para>
                <para>The direct financial assistance rendered to the States will amount this year to £15,565,500, which is £543,000 in excess of the grants made during the previous year. These grants are made up as follows: - Interest and sinking fund under the financial agreement, £9,015,000 ; federal aid roads, £3,750,000; special grants, £2,350,000; other grants, £450,500. The fourth annual report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission recommended that payments for 1937-38 should be: South Australia, £1,200,000; Western Australia, £575,000; and Tasmania, £575,000. It is proposed to ask Parliament to approve of these recommendations. </para>
                <para>As the result of the federal aid roads and works agreement authorized by the Commonwealth Parliament at the beginning of the present session, payments to States have been increased, and it is anticipated that in this financial year these payments will be £3,750,000, or £721,000 more than last year. The budget also provides for other grants to the States amounting to £200,000, to provide technical training and skilled employment for youths, £100,000 towards interest and sinking funds in respect of loans for public works, £70,000 for assistance to the metalliferous mining industry, and £80,000 for assistance to forestry. </para>
                <para>In view of continued low prices, the sum of £65,000 is provided in the budget for general assistance, scientific research, and publicity in respect of the apple and pear industry. The bounty given in previous years in relation to oranges is also being extended to all citrus fruits, and it is expected that the expenditure involved will be £8,000. </para>
                <para>Due to the fertilizers subsidy, which has; been paid since 1932, the use of artificial manures by primary producers, other than wheat-growers, has substantially increased. In order that the subsidy may be kept within reasonable, bounds, it has been decided to limit the payment to the first twenty tons of fertilizers purchased by any individual. The estimated cost this year is £250,000. Recognizing the valuable work that is being done by the Australian Travel Association, the Government proposes to increase the Commonwealth grant to this body from £15,000 to £20,000. The sum of £30,000 will also be made available to the Australian Overseas Trade Publicity Committee for advertising and trade promotion in the United Kingdom, whilst £7,500 will be made available for general exhibition purposes in the United Kingdom. </para>

                            <para>. - I earnestly request - I do not like to use the word - challenge - the Leader of the Opposition to explain fully that part of the Labour party's policy on defence which he expounded in this chamber yesterday, providing that no Australian military forces shall be allowed to go overseas! In what measure would that rule of the Labour party apply if the very existence of our sister dominion in the Pacific, New Zealand, were threatened by the naval forces of other countries? I believe that the Australian people will demand from the Leader of the Labour party a clear, unequivocal declaration on this point, because it is of the utmost importance to the welfare and happiness of every man, woman and child in Australia that our citizens should know just what responsibility is placed upon them in deciding who shall be given the right to say what part Australia shall play in the preservation of the British Empire. According to press reports of his speech yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition said that, under the rules of the Labour party, every member of that party was committed to the " adequate " defence of Australia. </para>

" <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Savage</inline> drew a beautiful picture of the New Zealand paradise, and I suppose we need not be surprised at that, since it is a natural human impulse to try at some time or other to attain to a state of supreme felicity. But I remind our Labour friends in this chamber and elsewhere that in the world to-day, there, are very many people in other countries who would be only too glad of an opportunity to break into New Zealand's paradise if they thought that effective measures had not been taken to prevent them. Even the Labour party cannot divorce itself from its responsibility to the citizens of Australia with regard to defence. </para>

                            <para>- Over and over again yesterday, when the Leader- of the Opposition was speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> asked him point blank to say what a Labour government would do in the event of a threat being made against the sister dominion of New Zealand, and the honorable gentleman is reported to have said "I shall answer that later." He has not yet answered the question. I challenge him to do so now or on some other occasion before this Parliament is dissolved. The people are entitled to know what would be the position in the Pacific in the event of the Labour party being returned to power. Honorable senators will no doubt remember the interesting position that developed in the Pacific during the Great War, and the anxiety felt in Australia because of the exploits of a small but efficient fleet of German cruisers which raided shipping and did enormous damage to the cause of the allies. At one time they were believed to be planning a raid on Fiji, and there is little doubt that they would have done so but for the fact that they picked up a wireless message indicating that the Australian battle cruiser </para>

                        was not anywhere within striking distance of the enemy cruisers, but a " bluffing " wireless message served its purpose, and the raiders did not, as was feared, visit Fiji or New Zealand. Most of us remember the battle between those German cruisers, and an inferior British fleet off Coronel in the South Pacific; the British vessels were destroyed.We remember also that the German warships later descended upon the Falkland Islands, a possession in the South Atlantic, where they were met. and destroyed by a superior fleet of British battle-cruisers -which had been released from other duty in European waters to attend to them. What would have been the position if, at that time, the commanders of the German cruisers had known that Australia was under Labour government, and that a "rule" of Labour's defence policy precluded Australian naval forces from proceeding beyond territorial waters until after the taking of a referendum?

On the other hand, we do not want to see a display of that spirit of jingoism which, towards the end of last century, became such an object of derision. As a civilized people we do not stand for that. Neither do the Leader of the Opposition and his supporters here and elsewhere. But we of the ministerial parties do affirm that the leadership for peace displayed by the British Empire is an important factor in world affairs. It is so regarded by the governments of other countries, but it would be foolish to allow our defence measures to be determined by the " rules " of a political party, especially at a time like the present, when nations, without even a declaration of war, are fighting among themselves under " Rafferty " rules - fighting not minor wars, but cruel, major wars of the worst type. </para>

Unfortunately, Great Britain's efforts evoked no response from other major powers. On the contrary, the spirit underlying the peace gesture was mistaken for evidence of weakness. Some, indeed, entered the realms of prophecy; they talked of the disintegration of the British Empire and metaphorically threw their hats in the air. </para>

Et is important to note also that, if that unhappy day should arrive, Federal Labour could not possibly govern, except with the consent of the New South Wales Labour party, and from events of recent years we know what that means. Not long ago we heard the Leader of the Op position in this chamber wholeheartedly and sincerely repudiating the actions of a well known Labour leader in New South Wales. Very well!

                            <para>- Again I agree with* the honorable gentleman that much of Labour's policy is " bunk ", and I remind the .Senate that, with one exception, all the New South Wales Labour members of the House of Representatives belong to what is known as the Lang party. That fact, I suggest, is highly significant. We know, from recent utterances of certain members in the House of Representatives and from newspaper reports of speeches of other political leaders what their attitude would be following success at the polls. From speeches which we have heard in  this debate we gather that a fair amount of Communist support will be given to Labour candidates at the coming elections. A real danger to British interests in the Pacific would be constituted, should the government he in the hands of the New South Wales Labour party, as there is good reason to believe it would be. </para>

                            <para>- It is tragic that such a contingency should be possible, if Labour should be successful in the coming elections. It is tragic that, notwithstanding repeated requests from the Leader of the Senate and government supporters for a declaration of Labour's defence policy, there should have been such deliberate reticence on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. What is needed is a straightout declaration of what will bo the position in the Pacific if Labour be returned to power. We have had certain " rules " of the Labour party read to us. What is our strength in the Pacific? Does it rest solely upon the naval forces which Australia can afford? Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> the Leader of the Federal Labour party, says " No " to that question. He clearly  is of the opinion that, alone, we could not provide a navy of sufficient strength to safeguard all our interests. Therefore, it is true that our strength in the Pacific depends upon cooperation between the Australian naval forces, the smaller naval forces in New Zealand, the British China Squadron and the Singapore Naval Base. </para>

We cannot, I suppose, hope for complete immunity from raids or serious damage. But we have been told that the " rules " of the Labour party would prevent an Australian naval force from being used to check an enemy there until the people had been consulted by referendum. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- A very worthy object, too. Vessels of the British Navy are stationed at Singapore, and, in the event of war, the naval strength of that squadron would be increased. British vessels are also on the China potion and New Zealand has a small force. Only a lunatic would suggest that, in the event of war, Australia should not co-operate with other British naval forces in the Pacific zone. If the Government declared that the Australian naval vessels were to serve only on the Australian coast, that co-operation would be impossible. In endeavouring to explain what he terms the " adequate " defence of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> used the same words as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> in referring yesterday to our extensive coast-line, the area of this continent, and the vast amount of British capital invested in this country, said that Australia would be doing its job if it defended its own people and the interests of British capitalists in Australia. Does the honorable senator think that we can protect the whole of Australia merely by aeroplanes operating within the 3- mile limit"? I imagine that, in the event of war, the objective of naval experts would be to get the enemy vessels into a bottleneck, which would not be on the Australian coast. I rose more particularly to see if I could secure from the representatives of the Labour party in this chamber a straight-out answer as to Labour's policy in respect of co-operation with British naval forces in the Pacific. But all honorable Senators of the Opposition do is to refer us to some plank or rule in their -platform at a time when the whole world  is struggling under  Rafferty  rules. We have reason to be proud of the outstanding results achieved At what the Leader of the Opposition calls a " dud " imperial Conference-. It was ni&gt;t a " dud " conference, but one which gave to the world an inspiring declaration of where the British Empire stands-. Yet we have some members of the Labour party quibbling about the expense Australia incurred in sending its delegates to attend that gathering. In view of the results achieved, the cost was insignificant-. </para>

                                <para>- It certainly would not be within the 3-mile limit. It might be in eastern or western waters; but, wherever it was, the service of the silent navy would bo required. Surely he does not suggest that the power to determine whether the Australian Navy should participate in any conflict to ensure the safety of the Australian people should be in the hands of one section of a political party! That is the greatest insult that could bo offered to free people in a democratic country. The Leader of the Opposition also gave to the Senate an interesting disquisition upon the value of aeroplanes in modern warfare. There are, I know, many so-called experts in the Labour party, and probably there are some in the party to which I belong, but I remind the honorable senator that Great Britain is more vitally concerned in the defence of the Empire than we are. What is Britain doing? </para>

                            <para>. - I rose particularly to endorse the policy of holding Imperial Conferences, and to congratulate the Australian delegates at the recent con'ference held in London upon the capable way in which they represented Australia! If membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations is worth anything at all, it surely should be worth the expense incurred in sending delegates to such conferences. The remarks of honorable senators in opposition suggest that in holding such gatherings a new principle is introduced; but conferences arc held by political, religious and sporting bodies in order to formulate policies, on. the understanding that each section co-operating will give effect to the policy determined by the conference. A few months ago a conference of members of the representatives of the Labour party from five States was held in New South  Wales, and that conference even Went so far as to tell the New South Wales delegates what they had to do. That action had the support of the Leader of the' Opposition. The Commonwealth Government is expected to give effect to  the  decisions reached at the Imperial Conference in the same way as the political delegates are expected to abide by the decisions of the conferences which they attended. </para>

                        <para>The most important subject considered at the recent Conference was defence. In the last war the military arm played the greatest part, and in the next conflict it is reasonable to assume that the naval and air services working in co-operation will be of major importance. The aerial arm is not only the most recent addition to our defence forces, but promises to become the most destructive. In concentrating upon the development of our naval and air forces,- the Government is acting on the best advice obtainable. When the construction of the Singapore naval base was commenced some years ago, I realized that it would be of special significance in the defence of Australia. The impregnability of the Singapore Naval Base, and the invincibility of the navies of the British Empire alone can save Australia from invasion and consequent disaster. In view of the fact that we cannot accurately predict the location of the next theatre of war, it is rather premature to determine in detail the means that we shall adopt for the part, that We may be called upon to play in it. The Labour party has announced its intention to " wait and see ". The Federal Government, however, is not prepared to delay ; it is going ahead with a programme which will enable Australia, in collaboration .with other members of the British Empire, to offer the utmost resistance to an aggressor. It is of opinion that the aerial and naval arms will play the greatest part in the next war. Those two branches of the fighting' machine can and must work in perfect co-operation. </para>

                                <para>- I shall presently refer to the policy of the Labour party as enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings.</inline> At present we have not the faintest idea of where the destiny of Australia in the next conflict will be determined. In the Great War the destiny of Great Britain and this Commonwealth was determined on the battlefields of Flanders. Where the centre of the next great upheaval will be we do not know. We sincerely hope that the last great war has been fought ; nevertheless wo must be prepared for an emergency. During this debate the Labour party has enunciated its policy for the defence of Australia. A little while ago, honorable senators were obliged to extract what satisfaction they could in regard to that policy from the two mysterious words " adequate defence ". As the result "of this debate, we have advanced our knowledge slightly. </para>

                        <para>The Labour party proclaims that it is a practical party, in defence and in other matters; I propose to examine the practicability of the defence policy of the Opposition. The Labour party, if not in favour of the complete scrapping of the navy, proposes sadly to neglect it in future. I am able to understand that. According to the policy of the Labour party, there is no need for a navy. Obviously, as our battleships cannot fight on our own soil, the naval arm of defence is to be practically abandoned. The sole function of the navy will be to report the approach of the enemy to the Prime Minister who, I presume, will thereupon summon Parliament. After an interval of three weeks, the Parliament will have assembled in Canberra. During this period the hostile navy with aeroplane carriers, each carrying, perhaps, 40 or 50 machines will be lying within fifteen miles of our shores ; and Parliament will be assembling to debate what steps shall be taken to meet the emergency. </para>

                                <para>- When Parliament has met, a prolonged debate on the emergency will take place. All this time, I remind honorable senators, the enemy is within fifteen miles of our shores. If the Goverinment believes that a state of emergency exists, it will introduce a bill to provide for the taking of a referendum to determine whether or not the enemy shall be resisted. The debate would occupy two or three weeks and if Parliament decided that the enemy must be fought where he is, provided he stayed there awaiting the result, a referendum would be taken. This would occupy approximately four weeks, and in order to restrain the enemy from dropping a few shells upon Sydney, a notice would appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> requesting the aggressor not to fire until the campaign was concluded. In case the enemy should' not read the' <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> placards would be posted along our coast bearing the inscription " Trespassers before the referendum will be prosecuted ". </para>

                        <para>That is the logical conclusion to be drawn from the defence policy of the Labour party. The referendum must be held if the Government feels that the enemy should be fought outside our borders. I wonder what attitude will be adopted in the crisis by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ceilings?</inline> Will he say to the people, " The enemy is off our shore; the Government believes that we will have to fight him where he is, and accordingly asks your permission, through this referendum, to attack him with our navy"? After these periods of delay extending over some months the aggressor, provided that he has not grown weary of waiting in deference to the wishes of the Labour party, and provided that the referendum is passed, will be subjected to an onslaught by our navy. That the attitude of the Labour party on this matter is impracticable is obvious to school children. It is an impossible policy. Why does that party endeavour to fool the people with something that is impracticable? The reason lies in the fact that members of the Opposition recall a certain vote a few years ago, and they have not the courage to lead the people. The Government would be in possession of information which it could not disclose; yet if Labour were in power they would be prevented, under their policy, from saying to the people: " An enemy is off our shores and we must engage him at sea where we have the best prospect of beating him ". Instead of having this freedom of choice they prefer to wait until the aggressor lands, and then endeavour to pit Australia's strength against him. The Labour party is fully aware that, in such circumstances, the people will not be in a position to decide the issue. They will not be in possession of the inside information; that will be known only to the government, which has not the courage to provide for the proper defence of Australia. </para>

                            stated that when the Labour party was returned to power it would co-operate closely with New Zealand. I hope to hear the honorable senator explain in what respect it would co-operate. Inregard to defence, no such co-operation would be possible, because the policy and rules of the Labour party forbid it. Consequently it is humbug for the honorable senator to say that when the Labour party is in office it will co-operate with New Zealand. Its defence policy would preclude the despatch of assistance to New Zealand, should it be assailed by an aggressor, until a referendum on the matter had been taken. I was disgusted to listen to the humbug, rubbish and clap-trap spoken in. this chamber by members of the Opposition on this vital subject. Having paid close attention to their statements I now understand why they have never been able to explain to us what they mean by " adequate defence ". I sympathize with the Labour party.
