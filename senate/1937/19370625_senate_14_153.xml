        <quote>
          <para>A conference of Federal and State Governments is to be held in August, promptly after the Prime Minister&#39;s return, to debate not only the merging of present overlapping services, but also the constitutional difficulty of federal powers under the Constitution.Without employment cover the present scheme would be shorn of its chief recommendation to the immense body of the public. Yet trade and industry are powers reserved for State sovereignty and not that of the Commonwealth. The Canadian Government&#39;s Employment and Social Insurance Act of 1935 crashed upon precisely this rock; the Privy Council, upon reference, held last January that the Dominion Parliament&#39;s legislation was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the Constitution, since trade and industry are provincial powers, and that the Federal Act was an encroachment. Alone, therefore, Parliament in Canberra cannot legislate for insurance affecting industrial contracts. Experience of referendum submissions suggests that the course to-day must be for the States to hand over the necessary powers to the Commonwealth. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I now ask the Leader of the Senate if he will have made available to honorable senators a synopsis of the Canadian case to which reference is made in the article. Although the Canadian and Australian Constitutions differ in some respects there is a great deal of similarity between them, and the synopsis for which I have asked would be of considerable value to honorable senators. </para>

          <para>- When an honorable senator asks for leave to make a statement based on a newspaper paragraph, it is assumed that he himself is affected by the paragraph. So far as I can judge from the statement which the honorable senator has read, he is not implicated. Unless he is personally concerned to the extent of having been misrepresented or misreported by a press statement, an honorable senator should not adopt the procedure that has been adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan this morning. </para>

            <para>That the Senate approves of the distribution of the State of Western Australia into Electoral Divisions as proposed by Messrs. R. H. Bandy, J. P. Camm and S. R. H. Roberts, the Commissioners appointed for the purpose of distributing the said State into Divisions, in their report laid before Parliament on the seventeenth day of June, 1937, and that the names of the Divisions suggested in the report be adopted. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Following the census taken on the 30th June, 1933, commissioners were appointed, pursuant to the provisions of the Electoral Act, to propose a redistribution of the Electoral Divisions in the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. The respective commissioners duly submitted their proposals, and those relating to the States of New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, were adopted and given effect prior to the general elections held on the 15th September, 1934. With regard, however, to the States of Victoria and Western Australia, the commissioners&#39; original proposals were disapproved by the House ofRepresentatives, and as time did not permit of fresh proposals being obtained and dealt with before the dissolution, the 1934 elections in the States mentioned necessarily had to be held on the then existing boundaries. Subsequently a direction was issued to the commissioners for these two States to submit fresh re-distribution proposals. These were received, and while the proposals in respect of the State of Victoria were, in due course, adopted, those in respect of the State of Western Australia were, on the 14th May, 1936, again disapproved by the House of Representatives, mainly with the object of enabling further proposals to be submitted by the Commissioners On the basis of up-to-date figures. The previous proposals for the redistribution of the electoral divisions in Western Australia were based on the enrolment figures as at the 30th December, 1933. On those figures the Division of Kalgoorlie was considerably below the allowable minimum, and, therefore, the Commissi oners were compelled i n any scheme of redistribution based thereon to increase the territory of that already extremely large division. Since 1933. however, the enrolment for Kalgoorlie division has advanced at a much greater rate than that of any other division in the State, and when the last proposals were disapproved that division was already well within the margin permitted by law. In the circumstances it was considered advisable to obtain entirely new proposals based on up-to-date figures, and accordingly a fresh proclamation directing a redistribution of the electoral divisions in Western Australia was issued in October last, and the proposals now before the House, based on the enrolment as at the 31st October, 1936, are the outcome. These proposals were duly published by the Commissioners as required by the Electoral Act before submitting their report, and as no objections or suggestions were lodged in respect of them within the period of 30 days allowed therefor, it would appear that they are wholly acceptable to the electors of the State concerned. </para>
          <para>The principal features of the proposals are, first, that provision is made for a reduction of the size of the extremely extensive Division of Kalgoorlie by transferring therefrom a considerable portion of the Subdivision of Irwin, and, secondly, that by re-arranging the boundaries of the Divisions of Freemantle, Perth and Swan, not only is a more equitable distribution of representation provided for, but also greater effectiveness is given to the principle of community of interest than obtains at present. Having due regard to the provisions of the Electoral Act, I commend the proposals now before the Senate as making for a fair and reasonable distribution of the electoral divisions in the State of Western Australia, and urge their approval accordingly. </para>

            <para>- Pardon me, it was not. It. recommended that, by a constitutional alteration, Western Australia should have, for 25 years, control of its own tariff - I wish those who suffer from the tariff to receive real relief of that nature - or be given such other relief as might be thought fit by the Inter-State Commission after a full inquiry into the facts. It is quite likely that the Inter-State Commission, if it had delegated to it the power for which my amendment provides, would recommend, as did the Royal Commission in 1925, that Western Australia should have fiscal autonomy for a period of 25 years. Of course, if the commission had power to inquire into the tariff and other federal laws, it might evolve some remedy that does not occur to me in the hasty consideration which the committee has to give to the bill. If, however, we are going to withhold from it a power which was specifically given to its predecessor to investigate tariff matters, the whole work of the commission is going tobe rendered, if &#34;not abortive, then of much less value to the smaller States than was the work of the previous commission, which <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> was empowered to investigate the following : - </para>

            <para>- I know. Power for the commission to investigate the incidence of the tariff and other federal laws at&#39; the request of the State was given specifically in the previous act, and it should be continued in this legislation. Why not make it clear that if any State thinks that it suffers from the Navigation Act or any other Commonwealth law or regulation, it has the right to have its complaint investigated by the commission? Why should not the commission have a direction to inquire into these matters? We want something more than a general provision, which may or may not be regarded as conclusive. Yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> tried to floor me with a Latin quotation. I am not floored, and I am not discouraged from proceeding with this amendment which is essential if the case of the smaller States is to receive due consideration by the commission. A Latin tag dug up from ministerial legal archives has nothing to do with the present and future needs of Western Australia, or with its position under the burden of high tariff protection. </para>

          <para>. - The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> is identical with an amendment moved some time ago by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Bill. The powers of the Inter-State Commission are sufficiently wide, and are much more comprehensive than those of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Having obtained legal advice on the subject, I have not the slightest doubt in this matter; otherwise I would support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> The Inter-State Commission will have sufficient power to inquire into any disabilities which Western Australia, or, in fact, any other State, may suffer. If we start to itemize by including subjects which should be inquired into, it will be necessary to include everything. The work of the commission in Western Australia should be much broader than of assessing the disabilities of that State due to federation. For instance, it will have powerto inquire fully into the disability which Western Australia Buffers owing to the enormous area of country which the government and people of that State must develop in the interests of national security. Western Australia with its comparatively small population and large productive capacity also suffers the disability of being far removed from the &#39;big consuming centres in the Commonwealth. Having perused the bill most carefully, and obtained legal advice, I feel that the powers of the commission are sufficiently comprehensive to enable it to inquire into any claim which a State may make. In these circumstances, I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will withdraw his amendment. </para>

          <para>. -  This important measure provides for the reconstitution of the InterState Commission to ensure that the States individually will receive a fair deal as &#39;between one another, and that the States as a whole will obtain just treatment from the Commonwealth. Honorable senators will recall those wise wor ds of that fine statesman, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin, that the &#34; Inter-State Commission is the eyes and the ears of the Federal Parliament&#34;. Such a commission should he not only the eyes and ears, but also the conscience of this Parliament. I shall state, somewhat briefly, how some of the States and particularly Western Australia will be affected by this measure unless adequate safeguards are provided. I direct the attention of honorable senators, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> particularly, to the fact that, while coastal vessels and transcontinental trains are constantly carrying the products of eastern States to Western Australia, and to one another, there is practically no traffic in goods from Western Australia to the eastern States. Western Australian products are carried principally by overseas vessels to other countries, where they are sold in open competition. The products of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia are sold extensively in the western State; but Western Australia, as a primary-producing State, has to dispose of its products in overseas markets. The tariff policy, which affects Western Australia so detrimentally, both now and hitherto, is one which I helped to create and have always supported, but adequate safeguards are still necessary in this bill to ensure that the people of my State may be compensated in some way for the undoubted losses they incur under the tariff and in other ways. That is the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.&#39;B.</inline> Johnston&#39;s amendment. An overwhelming majority of the electors in Western Australia who cast their votes in favour of secession originally resided in the eastern States, but after living in Western Australia for some time, they realized that &#34; something is rotten in the State of Denmark &#34;, and, despite their previous allegiance to and association with eastern States, they supported* the secession movement in an endeavour to secure some measure of justice. We feel aggrieved, and justly so, when asked to support a policy from which we cannot extract any benefits to compensate us for our lossses. Commission after commission has been appointed, and all their reports have told the same story of Western Australia&#39;s unsatisfied and unsatisfactory position. In these circumstances, we feel that there is some justification for the complaints we lodge and the requests we make. Jibes are hurled, quite unjustifiably, at the western State. Thirty years ago &#38; newspaper published in the State represented in this chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> referred to the railway from South Australia to Western Australia as &#34;the desert railway&#34; in an endeavour to convey the impression that such a line would traverse only desert country to an unjustified destination ; that is only one of many instances of the unreasonable prejudice displayed by responsible elements in other States against Western Australia. When I was first elected to this chamber in 1907 I supported a protectionist policy, and from that day to the present, I have advocated reasonable protection in the interests of the Commonwealth. Therefore, I am justified in finding some fault when adequate consideration is not extended to the western State, which is not only a big market for eastern manufacturers, but also actually their feeding ground, if not the fattening paddock for their interests. Although Western Australia imports millions of pounds worth of eastern products, the quantity  of Western Australian produce which the people in the eastern States purchase could be transported in a single train. Honorable senators will therefore see the disabilities under which Western Australia labours. The possibilities of additional development in Western Australia are tremendous, and the Inter-State Commission should have the fullest possible power to inquire into every phase of that States&#39; disabilities and to recommend the best way in which relief can be afforded. Much of the light land which is being worked in Western Australia would be regarded in the eastern States as rubbish; our settlers, in their endeavours to extract a living from the unwilling soil, are doing wonderful work in the face of great handicaps. This fact has a direct bearing upon the proposals in this bill now before the committee, because if settlers in Western Australia do not receive a fair deal they will be forced to abandon their holdings, crowd into the cities, and intensify economic competition in the more populous centres. This they will be provoked to do if they are called upon to carry further unreasonable burdens whilst, at the same time, industries in the eastern States are pandered to by every government, without exception. </para>

            <para>- I had experience on the land in Queensland long before the honorable senator was born, and I repeat that land which is being worked in Western Australia would not be even looked at in Queensland. It has been said that Western Australians are all right at the moment, and that their difficulties will be attended to fully in good time. They might be; but history has the habit of repeating itself. I urge, therefore, that provision should be made here, and made emphatically, in this measure, to alleviate those conditions under which Western Australian settlers are obliged to strain every nerve and sinew in order to win a living from the soil. The argument advanced by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in respect of the amendment now before the committee is that if any specific subjects for inquiry are stipulated in the measure, we shall run the risk of excluding other subjects which may be of equal importance. </para>

            <para>- That means if we include one provision which, by unanimous consent, ought to be included - such as is now suggested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston&#39;s</inline> amendment, for instance - we may exclude something of no moment at this stage but which may arise for consideration inthe near or distant future. I recognize the great work achieved by the pioneers who wrote the golden headlines of our early history, and who laid down many great principles for our guidance. But as an example of the necessity for making specific provision for particular cases in our legislation, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> now proposes, 1 recall a scene from <inline font-style="italic">The Merchant of Venice.</inline> When Shylock was asked to relent in the bargain he had made with Antonio, he invariably insisted that such and such a concession had not been nominated in the bond. He paid no heed to the pleading of the keeneyed Portia when she pointed out that Antonio&#39;s life would be in danger if he insisted on his pound of flesh; again, he replied that no such eventuality was mentioned in the bond. Then, dramatically, the tables were turned when Portia declared that the law of Venice was superior to Shylock&#39;s bond, and that if in cutting his pound of flesh he shed one drop of christian blood his lands and goods would be confiscated. </para>

          <para>. - The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat has painted so dismal a picture of the trying conditions in Western Australia that 1 am prompted to ask him why he made his home in that State. If his description of the difficulties confronting settlers in Western Australia were true it would he impossible for them to remain there. He himself  has lived in the west for many years and he has grown white and honorable in the service of that great State and in the service  of  this Parliament. One  of  the reasons why I welcome this measure is that for quite a number of years representatives of the smaller States, and even senators from New South &#34;Wales, have said in this chamber within my hearing, that the eastern States, the largest of which I represent, are over-bearing in their attitude towards, the smaller States. </para>

In this instance, also, we shall do well to express what we mean and intend &#34; in the bond &#34;..  I  should like to have the assurance of the Minister that it is the intention  of  this_ Government that the claims of a State on the ground of disability, due to the operation of the tariff, shall come within the investigatory powers of- the commission. Furthermore, I point out that no provision is made in this measure to enable the commission to deal with disabilities which might arise in respect of transport either by water or by air. I remind the committee that in 1912, when the principal act was passed, the present development of aerial transport was not foreseen. Then, again, if we are to believe the words of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> other difficulties may arise if the policy of his party is put into full operation in this country. </para>

            <para>- My sole purpose is to give the Inter-State Commission the duty and the right to make inquiries concerning all disabilities which may be suffered by a State as the result of federal legislation. All similar tribunals are vested with wide authority. The five economists appointed by the Bruce-Page Government some years ago to report on the economic effect of the tariff, pointed out that certain States, particularly Western Australia and Tasmania, suffered definite and severe disabilities under federation, whilst other States benefited from the incidence of Commonwealth tariff policy and other forms of legislation. Even with the partial measure of relief given at certain seasons of the year to Tasmania, that State has suffered definite injury from the operation of the Navigation Act. The same may be said of citizens of the north-west of Western Australia. I have received many complaints from constituents in that portion of my State that they are not permitted to travel by or receive goods from British-owned vessels which touch at the north-western ports of Western Australia. These complaints have been brought under the notice of the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan),</inline> who has very courteously given them his attention. For the reasons given I am anxious that the Inter-State Commission shall have full power and a direct responsibility to investigate, on behalf of the smaller States, any unjust incidence of the tariff or other Commonwealth legislation. </para>

But we may not always have in this chamber sympathetic representatives from the eastern States, and I wish to be quite sure that it will be the duty of the InterState Commission to investigate their disabilities, particularly these resultant from federal legislation. It is fitting that the bill should be introduced in the Senate, which is the States&#39; House. I hope that the amendment which I have moved will be carried so that we may be quite sure that this independent tribunal will investigate all disabilities and do justice to the smaller States. </para>

          <para>. - This is the clause to which I directed attention last night in my speech on the second reading. Notwithstanding the explanation given by the Minister, I am still of the opinion that it should be mandatory on the part of the GovernorGeneral to lay before Parliament any report made by the Inter-State Commission relating to investigations made by that body of disabilities suffered by the States, or applications by them for financial assistance. It should not be possible for a government to withhold from the Parliament reports or recommendations of the commission, thus depriving members of the opportunity to peruse them. </para>

            <para>- It might be, but  it  is not an impossible contingency. I  am  aware that a government may consider that a report,  if  laid before Parliament, would disclose its probable budget proposals, which are confidential before presentation to Parliament. But I see a weakness in the clause in its present form, and I think the committee should accept my suggestion to substitute the word &#34;shall&#34; for  the word &#34;may&#34;  There will then  be  an obligation  on the  Government to lay all reports on the table of the Parliament. </para>

If some future government should withhold a report of the commission from Parliament or fail to introduce legislation to give effect to the commission&#39;s recommendations, the commission will still have an opportunity to make its views known to the legislature. Clauses  26  and  27  provide that the commission shall present an annual report containing; a summary of the work done, togetherwith its recommendations, and there is  an  obligation on the Minister to lay that report before each House of the Parliament within fifteen sitting days. Therefore, if by any chance a government did not lay before Parliament reports on specific investigations, we may be quite sure that, in its annual report, the commission would comment strongly on this fact, and members would, have ample opportunity to criticize the Government. </para>

            <para>- The bill provides that, should any freight rates on State railways be regarded as discriminatory or unfair, any State railway authority, or any borough, municipality, body politic, harbour board, marine board, or other State authority, or any association of traders or freighters, or chamber of commerce, manufactures, or agriculture may make complaint, whereupon the whole machinery of this legislation will be set in motion, and such discrimination may be declared to be illegal. No such power is given to those bodies in respect of Commonwealth railways. I. want that power to be vested in them in respect of Commonwealth railways; the Commonwealth railway freights are most unjust to Western Australian primary and secondary industries, and I hope, therefore, that the Government will accept my amendment. Unless it be incorporated in the bill, State railway authorities who prescribe discriminatory freights will be subject to control by the Inter-State Commission, whereas the Commonwealth railways authorities may not be challenged for similarly offending, unless the authority of a State government or of the Governor-General is invoked, if at all. From the point of view of a State which is responsible for making its railways pay, the carriage of onions and potatoes on a Commonwealth line from one side of Australia to the other at low freights is a matter of considerable importance. If the Inter-State Commission is to be empowered to deal with a complaint against a State railway, it should be able to act similarly when the complaint is against the Commonwealth railway authorities. </para>

          <para>.- I like to give the honorable senator credit for being solicitous for the welfare of his State when he persists in his statement that, unless they are manacled, the other States will do an injustice to  &#34;Western Australia. It should not he necessary for me to disclaim any such intention on the part of the representatives of the other States. I should have thought that <inline font-style="italic">every</inline> honorable senator sits in this chamber as an Australian, not only to represent his own State, but also to have careful regard to the rights of every other State. &#34;When the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> interjected somewhat heatedly that the right honorable gentleman was attempting to drag a red herring across the trail. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stated an elementary fact when he said that this legislation must be read in conjunction with other legislation already on the&#34; statute-book, particularly the Constitution Act. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that even the High Court cannot wipe out the Constitution, or any portion of it. Nor can this Parliament do so, other than by the methods set out in the Constitution itself. The honorable senator must have in his mind the possibility of something happening; otherwise he would not have moved an amendment designed to make provision for that happening. When I asked him what he feared would happen, he replied that, in the event of a State railway providing for discriminatory freights, a number of bodies could make complaint to the Interstate Commission with a view to the discontinuance of the objectionable practice, whereas, should the Commonwealth railways discriminate in respect of freights, there would be no means of cheeking it. For that reason, it is necessary to look elsewhere in the Constitution. Yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> gave some reasons why the Commonwealth railways were not mentioned in the bill in exactly the same connexion as the State railways. There is a further reason why the honorable  senator&#39;s amendment is not necessary, namely, should the Commonwealth railways authorities discriminate against the railways of a State their action will come within the scope of section 99 of the Constitution, which provides that - </para>

          <para>. - I assure the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> that what is agitating <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston&#39;s</inline> mind is not what might happen at some distant date on the transAustralian railway, but what actually has already happened. There have been instances in which the Commonwealth freight rates in Western Australia have been much lower than those of the State. Complaints on that score have certainly been countered by the Commonwealth Commissioner of Railways declaring that the State rates were too high. To a degree, I agree with him. The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> also exercised my mind during the secondreading debate, but the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in his reply, convinced me that more than sufficient authority exists under this bill to cope with the very position with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> wishes to deal by his amendment. Confirmation of what he said was given to me by the qualified legal officers of the Crown Law Department. 1 am assured by them that, in the event of discriminatory railway freights being charged by the Commonwealth to the detriment of a State, that State may take appropriate action under clause 18 1 <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> and I have no doubt that in such an event a State government would have no hesitation in exercising its right to do so. I am also assured by legal authority that it is impossible to insert <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston&#39;s</inline> amendment in thebill, because it would mean that a. set of circumstances might arise which would demand the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to take action against himself; such a situation would be ridiculous. Some years ago a similar Gilbertian situation arose in an outback part of Western Australia, when, assecretary to the local hospital board, a public servant applied to himself, as Registrar of Titles, for the grant of a piece of Crown land for the purpose of building a hospital. As Registrar of Titles he wrote to himself as secretary to the hospital board refusing the application on the ground that the land was the inalienable right of the Crown, and pointing out that if the hospital board wanted a site for a hospital it would have to purchase land in the normal way. Then, as the representative of the hospital board, the gentleman appealed to the Minister against the decision which he himself had reached in his official capacity as a State officer. And so the comedy went on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> could himself have ascertained what I have already learned from competent legal authorities, namely, that his amendment could not possibly be inserted in the bill. There is no need for the honorable senator to be anxious about the position in our State. Every Western Australian senator is equally anxious to see that nothing is done in respect of railway freights to prejudice the position of that State. I respectfully urge him to withdraw his amendment because, according to legal advice, there is no virtue in it. </para>

          <para>&#91;2.22&#93;. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - In moving the second reading of the measure, I explained that originally the Commonwealth was included in the British act; but, since the last Convention was drawn up, it has been decided that we should legislate in this matter ourselves. The Government waited until the amending British act, which was passed only last March, became operative before introducing this measure. </para>

The Commonwealth can only take action through its powers of control over exports and imports, but, as I said in my second-reading speech, arrangements have been entered into by the Government with the States in order to effect control over that very limited class of substances which are not intended for export from the State in which they are manufactured. Any State legislation along these lines would be complementary to this legislation; thus the Commonwealth will have powers of control over both imports and exports, and, through the agency of the States, material manufactured in  a  State, but  not sent outside  that State, will also be controlled. </para>

          <para>. - -I have very little to say in respect of this document. It represents more or less a method of conveying information to honorable senators, and contains quite a deal of informative matter; for that reason, we are glad to have it. It  i3  desirable that these conferences be held, and that Australia be represented at them, for we should do everything in our power to support the League. Probably I shall have an opportunity on some future occasion to deal more fully with that phase of the matter. The speech of the Right Honorable S. M. Bruce at the 17th Assembly of the League of Nations on 29th September, 1936, which is published in Appendix D. of the report, is worthy of more than passing notice; it is an admirable address, and I recommend it particularly to the attention of the Government. In the course of his remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> said - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>It is urged in some quarters that, unless the existing practice is abandoned in favour of the literal interpretation .of obligations, certain nations will take advantage of that freedom to refuse co-operation. That view I challenge, because I suggest it takes no account of the greatest potential&#39; force in the world to-day, namely, the will to peace of the great mass of ordinary men and women in every country. In the minds of a large proportion of the populations of the world are vivid recollections of the horrors of the Great War. They remember how, in that ghastly cataclysm, the use of modern weapons a&#176;dded to the  barbarity  of war. Nowadays, through the media of the press, the cinema and other methods of modern publicity, the world is learning bow the discoveries of science are 6till further adding to the horrors and terrors of war. As a result, there is, in most countries to-day, such a detestation of war as to create an almost incalculable force of public opinion which demands that the League shall not be allowed to fail, that temporary failure, though severe; shall be converted into an opportunity for the re-adaptation of League machinery so that it may become more effective in the preservation of world peace. </para>
          <para>The strength and pressure of that world public opinion, to which I have referred, will grow progressively in force and will, in the last resort, compel statesmen to act with justice and righteousness whenever the issue is that of the maintenance of world peace or the restraint of an aggressor. </para>

In support of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce&#39;s</inline> remarks, I wish to impress upon the Government that we in this Parliament should recognize that the peoples, not the governments, of the world do not want war and do not want any of us to do any of those things which would ultimately lead to war. Other remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> in concluding his speech also are worthy of the most careful attention of the Government - </para>

In that section of the report dealing with the liability of ship-owners to pay wages to seamen in cases of sickness, there appears the following: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Wages are payable, in full, so long as the sick or injured seaman remains on board his ship. If he is landed, wages in whole or in part, as may be prescribed by national laws, shall be paid (but only where the manhas persons dependent upon him) until he is cured or the sickness, or incapacity has been declared to be permanent. National laws may fix a minimum period during which payment continues, being in anycase not less than sixteen weeks from the day of the injury or commencement of the sickness. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">My reading of that paragraph is that a seaman with no person dependent upon him will not receive payment for sickness, and I shall be obliged if the Minister can explain the reason for that.

        <quote>
          <para>It is desirable to create in every important port an official or officially recognized body which might comprise representatives of shipowners, seamen, national and local authorities and the chief associations concerned. The function of such body would be to collect all useful information and suggestions on the conditions for seamen in the port, to put forward measures for the improvement of such conditions and to collaborate in the carrying outof such measures. In order that these measures maybe co-ordinated, it is desirable that the maritime States should furnish the International Labour Office every three years with a report on the experience acquired and on the progress made in this field. </para>

I am not suggesting that the Government is in agreement  with  this section of the report, hut I should like to know what is being done? In some cases I know that Commonwealth legislation overrides State laws dealing with the same subject. I turn now to the report of the Australian workers&#39; delegate. It contains some interesting information which, if time permitted, I should like to read to the Senate. I admit that the generally accepted feelingof members of the various industrial and political organizations with which I am associated, as  well  as other sections of  the  people,  is  that  these  conferences arc of  little  value. I strongly dissent from that view. I  believe  that the Labour Organization at Geneva is one of the best institutions we have ever had, and I consider that we should have full representation there of the different sec  tions  of the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudehope,</inline> the Australian workers&#39; delegate, states - </para>
