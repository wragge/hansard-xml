      <para>HIS EXCELLENCY was pleased to deliver the following speech :  - </para>
      <para>Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives - </para>
      <para>You have been called together to deliberate upon matters of importance to the well-being of the Commonwealth. </para>
      <para>The principal aim of the foreign policy of my Government continues to be the preservation of peace and the promotion and maintenance of friendly relations with all countries. My Ministers consider that peace can best be assured by a respect on the part of all nations for the terms of international agreements and by a universal acceptance of the view that international differences should be settled by methods of conciliation and consultation. It was for these reasons that my Government associated Australia with the action taken by other States Members of the League of Nations in the present Sino-Japanese dispute and that Australia., as a signatory of the Nine Power Treaty of February, 1922, is represented at the Brussels Conference convened to seek a peaceful solution of the dispute. </para>
      <para>My advisers would welcome a cordial understanding between the British Empire and the United States of America. In consultation with other Empire countries they will examine the difficult questions involved and will be prepared on behalf of Australia to play their part in the conclusion of a satisfactory understanding, provided they can be sure that the best interests of Australian industries and of Australia as a whole are adequately safeguarded. Full opportunity will be given to the representatives of Australian primary and secondary industries to express their views with regard both to the revision of the Ottawa agreement and to any proposed trade treaty with the United States of America. My Ministers feel that by co-operating in the American negotiations they will assist to stimulate world, trade and by so doing will improve the prospects of increased trade with foreign countries. They will continue to carry out their policy&#39; of encouraging Australian industries and of making, wherever possible, further trade treaties with other countries. </para>
      <para>As a result of negotiations with His Majesty&#39;s Government in Canada added protection was given: to certain Australian manufacturing industries, while reduction of the Canadian duties was arranged on a number of Australian export commodities including meats, fruit products and wines, which will materially benefit Australian producers and exporters. </para>
      <para>My advisers propose to press on with the further strengthening of the defence of Australia along lines already laid down. Their plans provide for full cooperation with other parts of the Empire in measures for common&#39; defence against aggression, and for the full development of Australia&#39;s resources to provide for its own security. </para>
      <para>Negotiations between His Majesty&#39;s Governments in the United Kingdom and Australia for the inauguration of an Empire air-mail scheme have now substantially been concluded on a satisfactory basis, although minor details are still receiving attention. The scheme provides for a thrice weekly service between England and Australia. Bills dealing with the ratification of the agreement will be submitted to Parliament. </para>
      <para>Negotiations are proceeding between the Governments of the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand in regard to the conditions underwhich an air-mail service may be established between Australia and New Zealand to form a further link in the Empire service. </para>
      <para>My Ministers will immediately proceed to frame appropriate legislation and to set up a suitable administration for national health and pensions insurance. In this task the Government will have the best expert advice available. In the formulation of the necessary details full opportunity will be taken of consultation with the friendly societies, the medical profession and other interested bodies or persons. </para>
      <para>Officers of the Commonwealth and State Governments have made an exhaustive examination of various financial and administrative aspects of unemployment insurance. Having received a report on the results of this examination, my advisers will again approach the State governments with a view to arriving at a satisfactory solution of this problem. </para>
      <para>Commonwealth and State loans to the extent of approximately &#163;70,000,000 will mature in December, 1938. My advisers, through the Australian Loan Council, will, in due course, take such steps as are necessary to carry out the conversion of the maturing obligations. </para>
      <para>It is proposed to introduce a bill to provide for the appointment of an Interstate Commission. Meanwhile the term of appointment of the members of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has  been extended to 30th June, 1938. </para>
      <para>My advisers have examined the recent report of the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking Systems in Australia, and will submit legislation to Parliament. In the first instance, a bill to establish a mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank will be placed before Parliament. </para>
      <para>The committee recently appointed to consider the problem of small loans to men in work is expected to complete its investigations and furnish its report at an early date. </para>
      <para>With aview to providing relief to persons out of employment at Christmas time, my Ministers propose to ask Parliament to appropriate a sum of &#163;100,000. It is intended that this money shall be used to enable the Commonwealth to undertake a number of minor works of such a nature as will provide employment for the greatest possible number of workers. </para>
      <para>Consequent upon the volcanic disturbance in May last at Rabaul, the capital of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, my advisers caused an investigation to be made by experts as to the possibility of future volcanic disturbances at Rabaul, with a view to arriving at a decision on the advisability of retaining Rabaul as the administrative capital of the territory. A report on the matter has now been received by my advisers who have given consideration to it, and have decided that, in view of the terms of the report, the administrative head-quarters must be removed from Rabaul. The report will be laid before both Houses of the Parliament. </para>
      <para>My advisers propose to introduce a bill to regulate life and fire insurance throughout Australia, in an endeavour to. render uniform the legislative control which is at present exercised by the various States. </para>

          <para>That this Senate expresses its deep regret at the death of Major-General the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville</inline> de Laune Ryrie, K.C.M.G., CB., V.D., a former member of the New South Wales and Commonwealth Parliaments, Assistant Commonwealth Minister, and High Commissioner for Australia in London, places on record its appreciation of his . distinguished public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Since last we met, death has claimed a distinguished Australian in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville</inline> Ryrie, who died in Sydney on the 2nd October last. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville</inline> had a record of service to his country, both as a soldier and as a public man, of -which any person might well be proud. Born some 72 years ago at Michelago, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville</inline> was for many years connected with the pastoral industry. </para>
        <para>In 1906, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales as member for Queanbeyan, and held that seat until the expiration of the Parliament in 1909. In 1911 he entered the Federal Parliament as member for North Sydney, and was re-elected for that constituency in 1913, 1914, 1917 and 1919. He was elected, unopposed, for the new division of Warringah in 1922, and was again returned in 1925. From February, 1919, to February, 1922, he was Assistant Minister for Defence in the Hughes Ministry. In January, 1926, he was appointed a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and later became the  chairman  of the committee. In 1927, he was appointed High Commissioner for Australia in London in succession to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>record of military service is equally distinguished. He served in the South African War in 1900 and 1901, for which service he received the Queen&#39;s Medal with four clasps. Soon after the outbreak of the Great War he received an appointment as colonel in the Australian Imperial Force to command the Second Light Horse Brigade, head-quarters. A little later, he was appointed a brigadiergeneral. He saw active service in Egypt, and Palestine and on Gallipoli, being twice wounded and mentioned in despatches on five occasions.  His  Majesty the King conferred on him the honours of C.M.G., in 1916; CB., in 1918; and K.C.M.G., in 1919. </para>
        <para>Such is a brief account of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville&#39;s</inline> record of public service. On the personal side, too, he left a name that will be cherished by all who were privileged to know him. A typical Australian, his geniality and spirit of loyalty won for him many friends wherever he went.  His  courage and cheerfulness inspired his comrades in arms in the many battles in which he took part. In mourning his loss, we remember his widow and family, and offer to them our deep sympathy in their great bereavement. </para>
