                                <para>Pan-American Airways, under agreement with the New Zealand Government, have been granted facilities for running an air service between the Pacific coast of America and NewZealand. The company undertook to commence the service by December, 1936, and, if unforeseen circumstances occurred, not later than December, 1937. No official advice of the date of commencement has been received, but the New Zealand representative of the company, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harold</inline> Gatty, is reported to have recently stated that, from the end of December, 1937, Pan-American Airways would commence a fortnightly trans-Pacific air service between San Francisco and Auckland, carrying freight, mails and a limited number of passengers. </para>

                                <para> An agreement has been reached between the Governments of the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand to establish a trans-Tasman air service under the joint control of the three governments. Under this agreement, the New Zealand Government is to take the initiative in the matter, and, following discussions between representatives of the three governments in London, definite progress has been made on the subject, but many matters still require further consideration, and certain aspects are now receiving the attention of the Government. Until the trans-Tasman air service is commenced, Australian mails will need to be conveyed to and from New Zealand by the existing steamship service. It might be added that air mail from America to Australia is at present conveyed by Pan-American Airways across the Northern Pacific to Hong Kong, by Imperial Airways from Hong Kong to Singapore, and from there by Qantas Empire Airways to Brisbane. The proposed service across the Southern Pacific can, therefore, as far as Australian mails are concerned, be regarded as an alternative air connexion with America. It is not possible at this stage to say whether the trans-Tasmanair service will be in operation by December. The value of an air link between Australia and New Zealand is appreciated and every endeavour is being made to expedite its inauguration. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary's</inline> curt reply standsunrebuked by the Prime Minister, then we witness a spectacle resembling that of a ship being directed, not by the commander on the bridge, but by one of the men in the galley.

                        <para>- When an application for naturalization has been refused on numerous occasions, notwithstanding that the applicant's friends know nothing against him, does the Leader of the Senate think that a member of this Parliament, who has interested himself in the case, should be refused the reasons? Is it possible for an honorable senator to obtain from the Minister for the Interior the reasons for such refusals in the case of particular persons on whose behalf he may make inquiry, or is it a general rule to refuse to give the reasons ? </para>

                    <para> The Minister for the Interior deals with all naturalization matters, and I suggest that if the honorable senator is interested in a particular case, he should call on the Minister in regard to it. I do not see how the Minister could very well reply to a hypothetical question, but if the honorable senator were to accept my suggestion I am sure that the Minister would explain why the reasons were not made known.

<para> The extract from the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> of Saturday last, has been noted. Although the matter of the location of the Sandy Bay Rae Range by the Commonwealth was, at one stage, held up owing to the difficulty of the Hobart City Council in financing the project, this is not now the position. The only  major  difficulty now existing is with regard to the indemnification of the Commonwealth in respect to any possible claims in the event of accident on the Glenorchy water reserve area. The position is that, in addition to the range proper, the Commonwealth requires firing rights over portion of the water reserve area and, as the Commonwealth has no real control over that area, the indemnification clause was included in the draft agreement now being discussed between the Department of Defence and the Hobart City Council. This clause was considered necessary as the Defence Department would not be in a position to protect or control any trespassers on the water reserve area, nor could it control the use to which the land might be put at some later date. It was not considered reasonable, therefore, that the Common-wealth should accept responsibility for possible claims due to any accident which may be sustained on that area. The matter is being explored, however, with a view to ascertaining if the Commonwealth can obtain  more definite rights over the water reserve area so- that consideration may be given to the elimination of the  indemnification   clause in the agreement. </para>

                            <para>. - When this debate was adjourned last week, I was dealing" with the subject of defence. In my opening remarks, I said that I proposed to deal with the subject in general terms, because the proceedings of the Imperial Conference were themselves recorded in general terms. The precise point that I was discussing when the debate was adjourned was a matter, mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> relating to the contributions of the different parts of the Empire. I emphasize that that is not a very material question. In the nature of things, one part of the Empire may find that it is essential that it should pay much .more for its defence than another part, which is in a more favorable position, feels called upon to pay. I took the statistics which the Leader of the Opposition gave in this chamber on the 26th August and assumed that they were correct. I have no reason to think that they_ are not. The latest statistics on Empire defence show the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> expenditure as follows: New Zealand, 12s. 7d. ; Canada, 5s. 7d.r South Africa, 3s. <inline font-style="italic">5d. ;</inline> and Australia, £1 ls. lOd. It will be seen that, on that basis, Australia's contribution is the largest ; it is nearly twice that of New Zealand, four times that of Canada, and six times that  of South Africa. I went on to say that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution in Great Britain is very much greater than any of the others - in fact, it is greater than all of them together. It is difficult to get reliable figures because the expenditure this year lias gone up so tremendously, but I quoted figures to show that the cost per head of the population of Great Britain was probably between £5 10s. and £6. Since I spoke on this subject, I have made further inquiries, and I understand that Great Britain's contribution is now nearly £7 a head. That is an enormous contribution for the centre part of the Empire to make. The Government of Great Britain may consider that it is acting in the interests of the safety of not only the Mother Country but also the Empire as a whole; but I point out that if danger to . Great Britain exists in European waters, we in Australia are a long way from the rest of the Empire in the event of an attack being made on our shores. We ought to face the position, with a view to finding out what contribution is necessary for our own safety, rather than that we should say that we are contributing more than any other dominion is doing. The amount has really very little to do with the subject, except that, it shows that there has been a general contribution. It may be urged that Canada's contribution is only 5s. 7d. a head, but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> pointed out a few days ago, the position of Canada is entirely different from that of Australia. Canada has the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the Pacific Ocean on the other. To the south, it joins the United States of America. It is useless to make comparisons in this matter. Taking a narrow view we might say that Canada appears to be just about as safe as is any other country in the world. It is impossible for honorable senators to keep pace with all the literature that comes to them, but I suggest that those who are interested in the subject of Empire defence should read two short articles in the June number of <inline font-style="italic">Bound Table</inline> - one from Canada on Canadian defence, and the other from South Africa on South African defence. In about 20 pages, that magazine gives the kernel of the defence problem as it affects those two dominions. Under the heading " Imperial Conference " the article states - </para>

                    <para class="block">That fact makes it the more incumbent upon us- to go ahead with our own defence programme and to see that our defence expenditure is as great and as well placed as it ought to be. We would be wise to be more realistic in these matters, and not to be so governed by vague hopes and desires in which the whole world shares. In other words we should try to think clearly. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Johnson</inline> has an admirable remark, which - I speak from memory - runs something like this : " Clear your mind of cant; you may talk foolishly - it is a custom of society - but do not think foolishly." It is essential that people should think clearly about this question and give up their idealistic eulogy of the League of Nations, they should abandon the complacent attitude which, may be expressed - " Leave it to the League of Nations and all will be well." This is the time when we must look towards the safeguarding of our own country; we should not leave it to the League of Nations. I found that on the other side of the world the League of Nations is scarcely mentioned except in parliament and on the public platform. It may not be a palatable thing to say, but I agree largely with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> who said that the chances of making anything like a Pacific pact would be much greater if we did not adopt trade diversion policies which operate chiefly against the United States of America, the Dominion of Canada, and Japan, three of our greatest neighbours in the Pacific. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator would give us some details of that .later on. I repeat that it was my experience that the League of Nations is not much discussed abroad except in public. People in England, through centuries of experience are realists; they recognize that they may have to defend themselves with their own arms and they have good cause to know that. One of the reasons why I have great admiration for the new Prime Minister of Great Britain is that, although an idealist, he is essentially a realist in his attitude to facts ; that is the attitude which I am urging that we should take. When a proposal such as the Newnes proposal is placed before us - this I am afraid will not appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> - I greatly wonder whether the money which we can afford to spend will be spent in the best possible way. The decision to assist in the development of Newnes shale is ostensibly for the purpose of defence, but I understand that no production can commence for eighteen months or two years, and that even then the amount of oil that will be produced will be totally inadequate to meet our requirements in time of war. Furthermore, the expenditure on this project will be very great. These three factors shake my confidence, not to put it more strongly, that the money we can afford to spend is being spent in the best possible way. </para>

We have other great generals in Australia, and if the defence of this country is to be left entirely to us, it is desirable that we should have all of the chief experts on defence in this country to guide us. I am not criticizing the permanent heads of the department when I say that the responsibility for the national defence is too big a load to be carried by any three men. We should be only too glad to have the advice of those great soldiers of this country who proved their ability during the last Great War. In tddition to the generals mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand,</inline> I would suggest that we have, at least, three other famous Australian generals - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Blarney, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Gellibrand, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Glasgow.

                    <para>I mentioned that I am surprised to see that no mention has been made in the Imperial Conference report of the important subject of migration. That subject has to be faced and ought to be faced frankly. It is not one in which there is any necessity for secrecy, as there is in connexion with the important subjects of foreign affairs and defence. Migration can be, and should be, freely discussed, and the sooner an influx of migrants into this country  starts  the better. I suggest that we should endeavour to attract British people first. In this connexion, I say now that I adhere to the view which I put forward years ago in the House of Representatives, that we should take what people we can get from the western side of Europe - using the term as a convenient one - as people of the type most similar to ourselves. This enormous country is populated by far too few people. We are always being told that we need more people to consume both our primary and secondary products; indeed most of our secondary goods can never be sold to anybody but our own people, so an increase of population would benefit those industries. And, of course, the more people we have the better will be the defence of this country. I regret that no mention has been made of migration in the Imperial Conference report. There has, however, been a good deal of reference to nationality, a matter which is of importance, but rather technical a.nd minor in  comparison  with the bigger issues I have mentioned. </para>
                    <para>Two impressions perhaps remain predominant in my mind after an experience of more than six months on the other side of the world. The first is the great contrast between the situation that exists in the Homeland, and that in most of the countries on the Continent. To travel from Europe to Great Britain is almost to go into a totally different zone. We are fortunate, I suggest, to belong to an empire which, at the moment, at any rate, is in such a relatively happy position and we should be wise in our own interests, if for no more exalted reason, to adhere to it and do our best to make it strong. I emphasize again the great desirability of contact between the different parts of the Empire, such as occurred in London this year, probably more thoroughly than ever before. Not only were all the parts of the Empire coming to the same meeting place and discussing their problems, whether openly or not, and discussing them, I suggest, in the best of temper, with tolerance and friendliness, but many foreigners also came there in a friendly way, and had a similar reception. They, I think, went away with a better opinion of the Imperial connexion of the British Empire than  they  had ever had before. I was a schoolboy on the other side of the world at the time of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, and that was the only other experience I had had of anything in the nature of a Coronation. I remember the scene vividly, although it is a good many years ago. It seems to me in retrospect that at that time there was perhaps, a certain spirit, not of aggressiveness, but of what some people might call jingoism, in the air, which was very different from the attitude that one felt on every side on this occasion. This Coronation was a. time at which the whole Empire rejoiced, but rejoiced quietly, without antagonism to others, and, it seemed to me, in a spirit of real humility. </para>

It i» somewhat significant that only yesterday the honorable senator thought it necessary when he had the opportunity of  speaking,  to plunge at once into the defence policy of his party. I say that that is significant, because he has had so many opportunities to speak upon it that evidently he has realized that the more he explains it, the more it needs explaining, and will possibly need amendment before it goes much further.

My first reaction to it was to ask that notice be given of the question, because I thought that, if we went through the utterances of the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, we might find out exactly what was Labour's defence policy as he understood it. He has made several attempts to explain what it is. For instance, in September, 1935, a statementwas made in this chamber by the Leader of the Senate on the Italo-Abyssinian situation. On that occasion, speaking to the formal motion that the paper be printed, the Leader of the Opposition gave his views and the views of his party. He opened by saying - </para>

One thing that I should have thought would please the honorable senator about the Imperial Conference was its attitude towards peace and war.

Does that satisfy the Leader of the Opposition that autonomy in the matter of defence is retained by Australia? On many occasions the Leader of the Opposition has attempted to explain the defence policy of the Labour party. After hearing the speech of the Leader of the Senate yesterday, the conclusion we must reach in respect of that policy is that we are no wiser than we were at the end of 1935, when the Leader of the Opposition said that he had explained what the defence policy of the party actually means. </para>

                    <para>. - After careful consideration and consultation with British Ministers and dominion representatives, the Government has found it necessary to expend this year an unusually large sum on defence. We regret that such heavy expenditure should be necessary; but, in view of the present condition of world affairs, we must, in co-operation with Great Britain and the other dominions, organize our man power and provide essential equipment. I was surprised to find that such a large number of young men who offered themselves for voluntary military training were found to be physically unfit to undertake the duties expected of them. The general opinion of competent authorities is that many persons are below the average physical standard owing to unsuitable diet when children, or to malnutrition. It is interesting to note that all fourteen international nutrition experts attached to the League of Nations have recommended that all young people should consume a reasonable quantity of fresh milk daily. The Labour Government of New Zealand is to be commended for having introduced  in that dominion a system under which every state-school child is to be provided, free of cost, with half a pint of fresh milk daily, and doctors in New Zealand have told me that since this system has been in force there has been a remarkable improvement of the health of the children. As the subject of nutrition is of national importance, I trust that before long the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the State governments, will introduce a scheme under which at least half a pint of fresh milk will be supplied daily to every child attending primary and state schools in Australia. Based on what is being done in New Zealand, the cost would be approximately £1,000,000 per annum, but it would be money well spent. The Commonwealth Government makes tremendous grants to the States from time to time, and it should be able to provide . £500.000 per annum - the balance to be made up by the States - to carry out a scheme such as I have suggested. Mornover, it would be a great benefit to the dairying industry, as an additional market would he provided for surplus milk, a large quantity of which now goes to waste. If I am returned to the Senate after the next general election, I intend, with the assistance of other members of this Parliament who have promised support, to urge the Government to introduce this highly-important scheme. </para>

                <para>During the debate on the Imperial Conference reference has been made to the necessity to protect some of our important industrial undertakings, such as the great steel works controlled by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited on the eastern coast of Australia. </para>
                <para>In matters of defence, it is the policy of this Government to work in close cooperation with other portions of the Empire, and not to confine its activities within the three-mile limit as the Labour party proposes. Adequate protection should be afforded not only to the large capital cities of Sydney, 'Melbourne and others, but also to such centres as Newcastle where the iron and steel and other important key industries are established. </para>
                <para>The production of fuel oil in Australia is also of great importance. If the vessels of the Royal Navy or the Royal Australian Navy were unable, even for a short period, to protect our great trade routes, our supply of fuel oil would soon be exhausted. If Australia were invaded., troops would have to be transported by motor vehicles, or even by aeroplane, from one point to another, and in the absence of an adequate supply of petrol, that would be impossible. There should also be an ample supply of the higher grade spirit used by bombers in order to protect vulnerable points and damage transports conveying foreign troops designed to attack Australia. </para>
                <para>Although it is claimed that battleships cannot be sunk by aircraft, transports carrying large numbers of soldiers could be successfully attacked by bombers. I am glad that the Commonwealth Government in conjunction with the Government of New South Wales has made arrangements for the development of the Newnes shale deposits with the object of producing fuel oil in Australia. Present stocks would not last a month in times of national emergency. </para>

                        <para>- The consumption would be greater if we were threatened. Private motor cars would not be used for pleasure, but many of them would be commandeered to carry troops to points where they were required, and, therefore, the quantity of petrol used would be much greater than it is to-day. Moreover, petrol should not be stored as it is at present in conspicuous places on the sea-board. Flying into Melbourne from almost any direction one oan see from a distance of 50 miles the huge white petrol storage tanks in the vicinity of that city; they provide an excellent target. Would it not be better to arrange for the storage of this essential commodity at inland centres where, perhaps, the tanks could not be  seen so readily ? </para>

When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking yesterday, he referred in scathing terms ro the fact that the iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound in Western Australia had been leased to Japan. There may be a good deal of truth in what the honorable senator said, because, if we take a long ange view of the subject, it may be wise to retain complete control of all the raw materials at our disposal. But surely the Leader of the Opposition is aware that permission to export iron ore from Yampi Sound was granted by a. Labour government in Western Australia, Every one must be gratified at the extraordinary improvement that has taken place in the economic position of Australia since the Lyons Government came into power. There is no better indication of a country's prosperity than its employment figures. In 1931, when the Lyons Government came into office, 30 per cent, of trade unionists were out of employment; to-day only 9 per cent, are without work. In 1931-32, the expenditure on building construction amounted to £8,000,000; in 1936-37 it had reached £40,000,000. When the Government reduced the duties on a number of tariff items there was much opposition from certain quarters on the ground that lower duties would interfere with the development of new, or expansion of existing, secondary industries! The truth is that under the regime of the Lyons Government these industries have made amazing growth. For example, in 1931 the number of factories in Australia was 21,627. and the number of persons employed was 336,658. To-day the factories number more than 25,000, and the number of employees is over 500,000, an increase of more than 100,000. The increase of wages paid is £2-7,000,000 yearly. As an instance of the confidence of manufacturers in the Lyons Government and its fiscal policy, I may mention that in the Geelong district the Ford Motor Company intends to spend £150,000 on additions to its factory and the International Harvester Company has arranged to erect a factory at a cost of £250,000. Many other industries are expanding and giving additional employment to Australian workmen. </para><para>Reference has been made in this debate to the Government's proposal to provide vocational training for the large number of Australian youths who missed their opportunity to secure employment during the depression years. One of the most disturbing factors in our economic life, is the stupid policy of overrestricting apprenticeship in the skilled trades. In Australia it has been attended by disastrous results to our young men. The percentage of apprentices allowed to the number of journeymen employed in Victoria - I assume that much the same conditions obtain in other States - is ridiculously small. Consequently many sons of mechanics are denied the opportunity to follow their father's avocation, and there now is a great shortage of plumbers, mechanics, carpenters, and other artisans so essential to the expansion of the trades. It is almost impossible to obtain a sufficient number of skilled workmen in many districts. I am glad to know that this Government is doing something to rectify the position. It has set aside £200,000 to be distributed amongst the States for vocational training of youths. </para><para>The higher basic wage is further evidence of increased prosperity since the Lyons Government came into power. -In 1931 the basic wage was £3 7s. 6d. a week; to-day it is £3 15s. It would be possible to compile from statistical records an extremely interesting booklet showing the benefits that have accrued to the people of this country since the Lyons Government 'came into office, as indicated by the growth of our secondary industries, the increased volume of employment, the improved conditions of the workers, and the increased deposits in our Savings Banks. </para><para>Now that we are on the eve of a general election, Labour leaders have become especially interested in invalid and old-age pensioners. Pensions have always been the favorite catch cry of Labour candidates during Commonwealth election campaigns. The truth is that the old age pensions law was placed on the statute-book, not at the instance of the Labour party, but by the Deakin Government in 1908, and the payment of invalid pensions was authorized in 1910. In September, 1916, the maximum pension of 10s. a week was increased by the Hughes Labour Government to 12s. 6d., and the limit of income including pension was increased from £1 to 22s. 6d. a week. That was the only occasion in the 27 years since the pensions law was passed, when a Labour government increased the payment. In October, 1919, the maximum rate of pension was increased by a Nationalist government from 12s. 6d. to 15s. a week, and the limit of income, including pensions, from 22s. 6d. to 25s. a week. In December, 1920, the same Nationalist government raised the limit of income, including pensions for blind pensioners, to £4 5s. a week. In September, 1923, the maximum rate of pension was increased by the Bruce-Page Government from- 15s. to 17s. 6d. a week. The limit of property was also increased from £310 to £400. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- The Leader of the Opposition does not like to hear this recital of the history of pensions increases, because it shows how much our pensioners have benefited from nonLabour governments and how little from Labour governments. In September, 1925, the Bruce-Page Government again increased the pensions from 17s. 6d. to 20s. a week. In July, 1931, the Scullin Labour Government reduced the pensions to 17s. 6d. a week, and the limit of income, including pension, to 303. a week. No one attaches blame to the Scullin Government for that reduction, because Australia was then in a position of grave financial emergency and all sections of the community were expected to make sacrifices. </para>

                        <para>- In October. 1932, the Lyons Government, also under economic pressure, reduced the pension in certain cases to 15s. a week. The maximum rate of 17s. 6d. a week was, however, retained, and, actually, 63 per cent, of the pensioners received the maximum rate. In October, 1933, the maximum rate of pension was restored by the Lyons Government to 17s. 6d. a week, and was made subject to a yearly adjustment in accordance with variations of the cost of living figures. Under this provision the maximum rate was increased to 1Ss a week as from the 4th July, 1935, and the limit of income, including pension, was automatically increased from 30s. to !&gt;0s. 6d. a week, and in the case of blind pensioners, from £4 5s. to £4 5s. 6d. ii week. In September, 1936, as the result of financial relief legislation passed by the Lyons <inline font-style="italic">Government,</inline> the maximum rate of pension was increased from 18s. to 19s. a week, and the limit of income, including pension, was raised from 30s. 6d. to 31s. 6d. a week. For this financial year the budget makes provision for an increase of pensions from 19s. to 20s. a week, commencing with the first pension pay day in this month. </para>

The new rate is the highest ever paid since the pensions system was inaugurated, because the purchasing power of 20s. to-day is equivalent to 23s. lOd. in 1925, in which year the Bruce-Page Government raised the pension from 17s. 6d. to 20s. a week. </para><para>One of the most  important subjects discussed by the Imperial Conference was Empire defence, which, in the case" of </para><para class="block">Australia, means the strengthening of the navy and the expansion of the army and air forces in order that they may be used to the best advantage in co-operation with the forces of the Empire, including the sister dominion of New Zealand.

I have in my hand a valuable booklet entitled <inline font-style="italic">Red Menace in Australia.</inline> lt is published by the Australian Catholic Truth Society, and I recommend honorable senators to read it. It exposes the futility and cruelty of communism in Russia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; every honorable senator should read what this unbiased and enlightened publication says. Among other statements it quotes from the writings of Andrew Smith, who was one of the leading Communists in the United States of America; he sold all that he had and gave the proceeds to the Communist party, and worked in a Soviet factory for three years. He has published one of the most enlightening books ever written. As I have said, the Communist party is dominating some of the "trade unions in Australia. It also controls a number of newspapers, among them being the <inline font-style="italic">Workers' Weekly,</inline> Sydney ; the <inline font-style="italic">Workers' Voice,</inline> Melbourne ; and the <inline font-style="italic">North Queensland Guardian.</inline></para>

                    <para>To-day the situation in the Labour movement is rapidly changing. There is in this change an assurance that a Labour government elected this year will carry out a programme of benefit to the masses. .First among the changes that are taking place is the growing strength and influence of the Communist party. The party has the leadership of several important unions, and considerable influence in others. More than ever it is the driving force of the Labour movement. </para>
                    <para>As a result of these changes, and especially of. the persevering work of the Communist party, the support for the united front is extending. The working class and their political parties are being drawn together into a common front against their enemies. Local united front actions in one form or another are becoming more frequent throughout Australia. </para>
                    <para>The lessons of world events have not been lost on the working class. United front successes in France, Spain, and the recent formation at the instigation of the Communist party of a united Chinese government are convincing the Australian people that unity is the only guarantee of the defeat of fascism in Australia as in other countries, and the preservation of peace. </para>

                    <para class="block">One of the most disturbing features associated with communism is that prominent members of the Australian Labour party are connected with it. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> in the House of Representatives has often spoken at Communist meetings in Melbourne, and on occasions has occupied the Chair. He and other prominent members of the party will, no doubt, speak at next week's demonstration in the Exhibition Building, Melbourne, which is being cunningly prepared by the Communist party. The Communist reptiles practically compel the pensioners to contribute to propaganda on behalf of the Labour party. To those who contribute, they issue stickers, like a stamp tax sticker, containing the words, "I have donated1d. to the Communist party for the defeat of the Lyons Government ". </para>

                        <para>This year's news from Russia, began, some thought, rather ominously. Two Soviet scientists - one a professor, the other a " famous chemist " - on leave of absence to pursue research work abroad, flatly refused togo back. This, in Russia, was considered unpatriotic. It may have been good judgment. At any rate, it was the January 1 cabled news concerning the " workers' paradise," and, viewing from abroad the Russian scene since then, the two scientists, among: others, must have indulged in some deep thinking.

A bomb having been found ready to be exploded at will under the box frequently used by Stalin in the Little Theatre, the manager was arrested ... In May, 44 Russians charged with being terrorists, spies and wreckers, one ofthem a woman, were executed in Siberia ... In June, eight generals pleading guilty of treason and espionage were shot. These generals all had great power, wealth, magnificent palaces, summer resorts, splendid cars and thoroughbred horses, acquired for services to the revolution. They held nearly all the key commands in European Russia. The Soviet press now describes these ex-darlings of the army us poisonous pigmies ... In August, " Great purge " continued, but with " unprecedented secrecy ". Victims believed to include Moskvin, a "prominent member of the Third International; Chernoff, Commissioner for Agriculture ('after the harvest'); Nathalia Satz, manageress of ' the famous Moscow Children's Theatre'; Arosieff, head of the Department for Foreign Cultural Relations; Fechner, head of the Department for Poland and the Baltic; arid many officials of the Communist party in Moscow, the Ukraine and elsewhere ". . . . </para>

                    <para class="block">Yet this is the country which is referred to by honorable senators opposite as a country of freedom and enlightenment, a workers' paradise! This Australian publication shows that many prominent men and their wives were shot in the back of the head this year. Anybody who goes to that country sees that the heavy work of making roads and carrying bricks, and all dirty jobs are done by women, and that there is part starvation and poverty to a greater extent to-day than at any other period in its history. I ask honorable senators to read the stories of men who have visited Russia recently and who write with first-hand knowledge of the deplorable state of affairs that exists there. Yet the Communists are most active in Australia to-day; they are organizing in shops, factories, labour gangs, labour unions and labour parties. The effects of their insidious propaganda is felt even in the universities and schools. Communism is eating into the unions and undermining this country to a greater extent than has been achieved by any enemies from outside. I warn the Government of the growing activities of the Communist party which to-day is boasting of having secured control of many of the trade unions in Australia, and is seeking by fair means or foul to overthrow the Lyons Government. The position is extraordinarily serious. I am sorry that the Labour party is allying itself with the Communists and allowing its followers to speak on Communist platforms. Almost every week in Melbourne prominent members of the official Labour party are to be seen and heard in public with Communist agitators. The Communists claim a united front with the Labour party and boast that they will be successful in the overthrow of the Lyons Government. That seems to be the common aim of the Communist party and the Labour party in Australia. </para>

We should place an embargo on the export of scrap iron and iron ore from Australia. Honorable senators belonging to the party supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> say we have a potential  enemy in the Pacific, yet they proceed to sell to that enemy all our surplus scrap iron and iron ore. Just as firmly as I object to the export of iron ore, I object to the fact that in this country at the moment, there are emissaries of that country to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and others have referred who have secured the right to survey the iron ore deposits of Australia. Honorable senators opposite paint a picture of horror as to what we may anticipate some time in the future. There is nothing but insincerity and hypocrisy in the whole business. When the deputation from Lancashire was in Australia giving to the Government orders in regard to imports of certain textiles, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Thompson in Brisbane if it were not true that Lancashire interests had equipped Japan with the most modern machinery to enable that country to compete with Lancashire in the textile trade, with the result that Lancashire lost a good deal of trade because, while the Lancashire millers were using obsolete machinery, the Japanese were using the most up-to-date plant. </para>

                        displayed this afternoon a remarkable acquaintance with the activities of the Communist party, and that confirmed my suspicion, which I openly stated in this chamber last week, that the United Australia party and the United Country party are prompting these activities on the part of the Communists in order that the Labour party may get the discredit, which every honorable senator opposite has endeavoured- to fasten on it, by quoting from leaflets and pamphlets with which they are significantly familiar. I have a copy of the book from which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                        quoted, but I have not yet opened it. The honorable gentleman was not fair enough to say that in this book there is not one word of affiliation with the Labour party, not one word of sympathy with the aims and objects of that party. When talking about Russia,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                        said that in February, which was a quiet month, ten or twelve people had been shot. As he proceeded his tale of horror grew, and I understand that the honorable senator claimed that over a thousand people in Russia were shot during a period of seven months. Apparently, the honorable senator has an intimate knowledge of what is going on in Russia to-day. There was a time during the great war, however, when Russia was an ally of Great Britain and her allies. Nothing was said against Russia then. We were all comrades in arms. One could not stand up at a public assembly anywhere in Australia during those hectic years and say a word against Russia or the Rus-. sian people. It was not until, having had more than enough of war, having had their manhood decimated by that awful holocaust which commenced in 1914, the Russian people turned from external conditions and fastened their attention definitely for the first time in history upon the internal affairs of the nation; it was not until they began to consider clothing and feeding themselves, and to do the work which it is essential for every country having claims to civilization, decency and Christianity, to do, that they became anathema to gentlemen like
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline>
                        and those who sit complacently endorsing his remarks. I am not suggesting that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline>
                        speech was made of his own volition. He is too genial, too honest, too "fair, too much of a sportsman to be capable of it, unless commissioned by his party to get up and release, against the leaders of this party, the poison gas which his colleagues are afraid to discharge themselves.

                    <para>The honorable senator also spoke of pensions, but why he troubled to do so I do not know, because all the information he gave, I gave yesterday in detail. I told the Senate exactly what  the pensions were, when the Lyons Government had raised them, and why. I told the Senate also, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> omitted, of the indecent and cruel property provisions, which raised such a storm of distrust and protest throughout Australia, that even the Lyons Government repealed most of them. I also said yesterday that there were still some disgraceful property provisions in the act. I showed that, if a man insured his life, although he could not possibly collect the money himself, the surrender value of his policy was taken into consideration by the Pensions Department, under instructions from this Government, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> supports. I said that if the surrender value, added to what he had in the bank, came to more than £50, the department reduced his pension by so much for every £1 over that amount. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> told only half the story; in fact, he merely repeated a part of the story I told, but left out the unsavoury details. </para>

That statement is entirely incorrect. Nobody ever called the late Alfred Deakin a Nationalist. He was the finest example of a good Australian Liberal that ever this country saw, and he introduced the pensions as part of the price that he had to pay for Labour's support during his administration. </para>

                        also said something about the wonderful prosperity of which I have heard so much during the last week. I admit that there is a measure of comparative prosperity in Australia at the moment. Something was said by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                        about savings banks, and much has been said
                        <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline>
                        about prosperity. I shall deal with the savings banks first.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                        said: "You have only  to  read the savings bank returns, and there you find the wonderful story of the restoration of prosperity". There is another phase of that story that is worth emphasizing. The other day, the financial journals and the published returns of the Commonwealth Bank showed that the note issue is up at the moment by £500,000, which economists and the bank journals say is most unusual at this time of the year. There are times, they admit, such as Christmas and New Year, when the note issue is considerably inflated on account of seasonal conditions. The anti-Labour people, the supporters of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                        and his party, admit that the only explanation is that, because increased employment is operating in the ranks of the working classes, they are increasing their consumption, and increasing the expenditure of their earnings. These are causes which, they say, have brought, about an unusual and undisputed rise in the amount of the note issue. In that one simple statement is contained the whole of the Australian Labour party's outlook on this matter of savings banks, financial policy, and everything co-related to them. We say that, if you will make this prosperity real, if you will distribute it evenly over the whole community, if you will give more of the workers a full breakfast table, if you will give them more security, more relief from the everpresent fear of approaching unemployment and want, then your savings bank returns will go up, and your general prosperity will increase. That is the one lesson that the people who constitute the present Government will not learn.

                            <para>- I had by interjections to force the Assistant Minister to say that that speech was delivered on the Sanctions Bill. He knew that that portion of our defence policy is merely introductory to something else, and that the party has never altered that portion of its defence policy. What was the object of that debate? The Senate was asked to declare its attitude in regard to sanctions. A sanctions bill was before the chamber, and it was opposed by the members of the Labour party in a most determined way, because we said that, if there was any business in sanctions, their imposition must inevitably lead to war. I also said that, in bringing down the bill, the Government knew perfectly well that sanctions would not be imposed on all commodities, for example, fuel oil, the one commodity which would have held up Italy and saved the rape of the Abyssinian people. </para>

Elections cannot be won on spurious charges levelled at the Labour party. We of the Opposition are here to represent, not the wealthy section of the community, but the masses outside, the people who have never seen the inside of a University and who have to toil hard from day to day, and even then do not get sufficient to maintain themselves in reasonable comfort. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to deal for a few moments with the much vaunted prosperity. We are delighted to -find that there has been some comparative improvement, but I ask honorable senators if they really believe that the prosperity is as general as they suggest. It is all right for us, who are sure of three meals a day and who know that we shall not be conscripted for war service. We find a full breakfast table each morning, and generally speaking, live under favorable conditions. I am not denying that prosperity is here, but the conditions under which we, in this Parliament, live are not identical with those under which many are compelled to live. ' The workers in Queensland are better off than in any other part of Australia. The people in that State have the highest basic wage in Australia, their money has a greater purchasing power, their working week is shorter. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with taxation shortly. Queensland is the only country in the world in which there is a statutory working week of 44 hours. The industrial conditions are better, the percentage of home owners and of people purchasing their own homes is greater, and the standard of living is higher than in any other country. Notwithstanding all these facts, which are supported by the Statistician's figures, the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">1'ele- graph,</inline> which does not support the Labour party, has throughout the winter been appealing to the citizens of Brisbane for left-off clothing and blankets for distribution amongst the poor. Is that where prosperity lies? I defy any one to persuade these destitute people that there is prosperity in this country. </para>

The charge of the Assistant Minister, that in offering these comments, I am defaming my own State, does not worry me in the least. In my lifetime people of the class to whom the Minister belongs have not shown much regard for my feelings. Because I have always advocated the interests of the working classes., and fought their battles, I have been called a home-wrecker, a breaker of the marriage tie, a wife-beater, a socialist, a Labour agitator, a red  ragger,  and many other unpleasant names. But these things do not disturb me. What I am saying is true. I dare <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> to come with me to some of the homes in certain parts of Sydney, and tell the inmates that he is an emissary of the Government which claims that it has -brought prosperity to all Australia. If the honorable gentleman accepted my invitation, he would see in some of those homes conditions so distressful that he would not be able to speak for emotion. Callous and politically hard-hearted as he is, he would quail before the spectacle of half-starved children, with hardly a rag to cover their emaciated bodies. </para>

                    <para>This afternoon, my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> interjected while another honorable senator was speaking and invited him to tell the Senate something about the promises made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> during the last election campaign. That interjection was linked with the question which I asked just now: "Where is this prosperity?" I propose to tell the Senate some of the promises made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> on the occasion referred to. The Prime Minister's pledges read very well. No one can deny that they had a wonderful appeal. The people, believing that the Prime Minister would honour his promises, returned his Government to power. They now know how cruelly they have been deceived. One of the promises made by the Prime Minister was that, if returned, his Government would concentrate on the solution of the problem of unemployment, and to that end he declared very definitely that his Government would lose no time in standardizing the railway gauges. To show how it has fallen down on its job in. connexion with that matter, I need only say that, at the present rate of progress, it will take seventeen years to standardize the railway gauges in the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister also said that his Government would carry out a large number of sewerage schemes for large country towns, and provide more employment. Not one sewerage scheme has been put in hand by this Government. </para>

But all that this Government can think of is to pass an ordinance to prevent the unemployed from assembling near the steps of Parliament House lest Ministers and their supporters, in their smug complacency, should see that so many of these unfortunate men have not even a coat to protect them from the winter cold. On one occasion, in winter, I went outside to add ress about 80 men who had assembled in front of this building. I had for protection a. scarf, woollen underwear, sweater and an overcoat; but, not more than one-third of the assembled men possessed a coat. The overcoats that some of them wore were either old military coats that they had when they were demobilized, or used clothing distributed by the Defence Department. The Minister for the Interior, who was not sufficiently courageous to go out to meet them, issued an edict. We hear a lot about dictatorships, but there could not be a worse dictatorship than that contained in an ordinance which the Government promulgated recently. In effect, the workless of Canberra were told, "Don't get near Parliament House; don't annoy us; we want to enjoy our good dinners. You are an encumbrance on the earth. If we find more than twenty of you- ". Perhaps it would be better if I were to give the exact wording of the ordinance - </para>

                    <para>The son of the right honorable William Morris Hughes, the Minister for Health andRepatriation, led the deputation. I do not know the son, but, after the deputation, some member of Parliament spoke to his father in somewhat the following terms :  " My word, Billy, that son of yours can make a pretty good speech to which the right honorable gentleman replied, "Ha, ha! A chip off the old block; he is my ' roads ' scholar ". That conversation is significant, for it shows how little regard the Government has for the unemployed. In Canberra last Friday 120 men were sacked. </para>

In otherwords, the decrease of the public debt of the Commonwealth is due to the fact that the Government has not played the game with the pensioners, as it promised to do. </para>

                    <para>Let us now consider the aggregate public debt of Australia. The total of  the Commonwealth and State debts at the 31st December, 1931, was approximately £1,182,566,000; at the 30th June, 1937, the total amounted to approximately £.1,262,872,000. That is to say, the total public debt of Australia, both Commonwealth and State, has increased in that period by about £SO,000,000. Yet, in spite of that increase, the reduction of the Commonwealth debt is thrown at us as evidence of wonderful statesmanship and capacity. On page 6 of the budget, the Treasurer informed us that the total revenue for the year 1936-37 was £52,807,977, compared with an estimate of £81,263,000. The actual surplus for the year was £1,276,588. The estimated surplus was only £45,000. Of the excess of receipts over expenditure, £1,000,000 has been allocated to public works under the control of the Postmaster-General's Department. With that I heartily agree, and I express the hope that it will enable a commencement to be made with a new General Post Office at Brisbane. The balance of £27.6,558 will be used to reduce accumulated deficits. </para>

It was not found possible for the Commonwealth Government to make funds available for the purpose outlined by the deputation.

The Leader of the Opposition, in referring to a disputation he had with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> as to what happened when we were debating the bill for the imposition of sanctions in the Senate, said that he had asked me why oil was not included in the list of commodities on which sanctions were to be imposed, and that 1 had replied that oil would be placed next on the list. The honorable senator said that that had never been done. I have turned up the speeches made by the Leader of the Opposition, my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> and myself on the Sanctions Bill, which are reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard oi</inline> the 8th November, 1935. The honorable senator suggested that I  replied by way of interjection. I find, however, that in none of those speeches does such an interjection by either myself or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> appear. </para>

                        <para>.- I had left the chamber on business, but hearing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> was on his feet, I putaside what I had to do, in order that J might not deprive myself of the pleasure of hearing him. I came into the chamber when the honorable senator was making a dissertation on the necessity for the imposition of an embargo on the export of Corriedale sheep. The first thing that struck me in connexion with his observations on Corriedale sheep, iron ore and the deputation from Lancashire, was that in my researches to find out exactly what the defence policy of his party is, I came across on more than one occasion - and I had heard it also from his own lips on other occasions - the statement that one of the main means by which the Labour party hopes to secure peace is by cultivating friendly relations with other powers. How would the senator cultivate friendly relations with other powers? Some friendly power suggests that we can export some Corriedale stud sheep, in the breeding of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has been so successful. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> would: say "No, we don't want them for ourselves, but we shall not deal with you ". Reversing; the words of Shylock he would say "I shall not buy with you, nor sell with you". There are iron deposits at Yampi Sound which, have been known to capitalists and miners for many years and have never been developed. Proposals are made now that, instead of allowing them to lie in the ground, extensive plans should be made for their development. " No ", says <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> " we shall not deal with you ; we shall not let you in ; we shall not trade with you, nor shall we let you trade with us; let the iron ore waste in the ground rather than that we should allow you to mine it ". </para>

                            <para>- We are not short of iron ore and we took the greatest precautions in whatever we did about Yampi Sound. We communicated with the British Government which expressed a perfect willingness that we should go on with any action for the export- of iron ore. Furthermore, Western Australia has control of these deposits, and it was the Labour Government of that State which entered into the leases with the companies concerned, and the only voice the Australian Government could have in the matter would be to prohibit the export of iron ore. As, however, there have been no exports of iron ore to date, the Commonwealth Government could have taken no part in the controversy about Yampi Sound. The honorable senator also said that when the Lancashire delegation came to Australia, it gave to this Government orders as to what it should do in regard to certain textile imports. That is the sort of thing that the honorable senator thinks he is entitled to say; he knows there is not a word of truth in it.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings.</inline> - I do not think it if quite fair to say that I know there -is not a word of truth in a statement which I made. </para>

It appears to me that there is as much turpitude in saying things which you do not know to be true as in. saying things which you know to be false. Obeying the ruling of the  Deputy President,  I accuse the honorable senator of having in this senior branch of the legislature given publicity to a statement which he has no grounds whatever for believing to be true, and which, in fact, is not true. In a moment of courage, the honorable senator approached a member of the Lancashire delegation. The same policy was revealed in what the honorable senator is supposed to have said to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Thompson when he asked him if it were not true that British manufacturers were equipping Japan with the latest weaving machinery, and so better fitting that country to compete with Great Britain. Does the honorable senator think that it is the duty of English manufacturers to inquire exactly what is to be done with the things they are selling? These are the methods which the honorable senator would employ in order to cultivate friendly relations with the rest of the world, and so secure peace for Australia. </para>

I do not know whether the honorable senator ever heard of the Riot Acts, which are still in force. </para>

                            <para>- It has been in operation in Victoria for many years. It is not correct to say that it was passed only in times of trouble arising out of the war. My impression, although I have not checked it, is that many of the other States have similar legislation, but whether or not there is any such power on their statute-books, it none the less is true that it is a common law right of parliament to protect itself from interrupt ion. </para>

I want him to see what it is that this ordinance, apart from the repetitions which occur in all acts of parliament, does really say. What is aimed at is not what the honorable senator has said. It is not to prevent people from discussing public affairs or matters of public interest, or considering or preparing or presenting a petition, memorial, or complaint. The vital part of the regulation is that assemblages of more than twenty persons in or about the precincts of Parliament, to hold public meetings or to ventilate their grievances, are prohibited. The whole of Canberra otherwise is open to them, subject to the rights of private property. There are any number of open spaces, and all that the ordinance says is that these public meetings shall not be held within a very limited distance of Parliament House. </para>

                            <para>- It could be done, if the Government chose to be tyrannical, and if it disregarded the fact that there was a Parliament sitting here as a check on acts of tyranny. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> does not think the wisest way to test the justice of an act of Parliament is to consider what could be done under it if it was not honestly interpreted. We, for instance, live in a country in which the Parliament can any day pass a law enacting that all bald-headed men or white-headed men should be executed forthwith, but we do not live in any terror lest Parliament should dothis, because we realize that we are a free people. </para>

The honorable senator made great capital out of a recital of the wording of the ordinance relating to complaints, remonstrances, declarations or other redress, all of which meant the same thing with slight variations, and all of which are merely included in order that a specious-tongued defendant shall not escape on technicalities. If the Leader of the Opposition were interfered with by the police, and told that he was holding a meeting, he would possibly say that he was merely preparing a remonstrance, and if they said that he was getting a petition ready, he would say, " Oh no, I am just discussing a public grievance." </para>

                            <para>- I am confident that they are the sort of tricks the honorable senator would resort to in any case. All that is intended by the ordinance is the prohibition of public meetings within a certain distance of Parliament House. Then honorable senators opposite got hold of another point. They said: "Penalty £100 or six months' imprisonment," and the Leader of the Opposition advised that any one arrested should go to gaol and do his six months. Again he and his colleagues have failed to realize what that provision means. By the Acts Interpretation Act it is decreed that the penalty mentioned after any offence shall be the highest penalty, so that under this ordinance a man might be fined half a crown, but he could not be fined more than £100. I said that, even if it were not true that acts of parliament were on the statute-books of the different States, there was a common law power to keep Parliament free from interruption. In order to illustrate that, let me show that Parliament does sometimes exercise its common law power.

There were a dozen or more 'incidents, which in ordinary circumstances, would have merited arrest, but the police contented themselves with scattering the demonstrators. One man, of Russian nationality, was arrested, following a scuffle in which Detective Purcell was struck a heavy blow on the ear. A squad of 100 police was on duty outside Parliament House to cope with the crowd of 500 unemployed. Traffic in Queen-street was disorganizedfor twenty minutes. </para>
                    <para class="block">This seems to be an extraordinary condition of affairs to prevail in the workers' paradise of which we hear so much from the honorable senator opposite, but there it is. This Labour Premier seems to be inexorable. They come at him time after time, and still he will not interview them. Instead of bringing 500 police up here on the steps of Parliament House, we simply pass an ordinance and have a policeman there, whereupon the orderly residents of Canberra will go elsewhere and hold their demonstration. I have wasted time, I think, in showing the necessity for the ordinance, because it seems to me that no matter how strongly the Leader of the Opposition has spoken against it, he sits there as the best possible illustration of the necessity for it. I shall tell the Senate why. Supposing that some unemployed person in Canberra with a voice similar to that of the Leader of the Opposition stood on a box immediately outside the doors of Parliament House and delivered an oration, with his cusomary tom-tom accompaniment, what possible chance would Parliament have to conduct its deliberations? It is the duty of Parliament and of the Government to exercise foresight, and, having done so in this instance, this ordinance has been framed. Of course, if honorable senators opposite find little reason tocriticize the Government, they must fall back upon trifles. If they have only trifles such as this to deal with during the forthcoming election campaign, it will be obvious that they have no real criticisms to offer. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of the bill is to appropriate £3,721,000 for new works to  be  undertaken during the current financial year. In the budget speech, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> indicated that the proposed expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for public works this year would be £7,721,500. Of this amount an appropriation of £3,721,000 only is now required since the following special appropriations have already been granted by Parliament: - </para>

                    <para>The decrease of £1,111,048 in departments and services, other than business undertakings and territories, is entirely due to the fact that provision for defence works from revenue is limited to £8,000, as compared with an expenditure of £1,132,036 in 1936-37. A comparison of the means of financing new defence works this year and last year shows : - </para>

                    <para>The expenditure on postal, telegraph and telephone works last financial year was £2,419,079. The provision in this bill is £2,250,000. In addition £1,000,000. of last year's excess receipts will be devoted to this purpose, and it is proposed to submit a special bill to appropriate that sum. The total provision of £3,250,000 is necessary to meet the ever increasing demands for these works, particularly telephone services. As honorable senators are aware, this class of expenditure is of a distinctly reproductive character. An additional £154,271 is provided to continue the developmental policy in the territories. </para>
                    <para>I do. not propose to go into detail in regard to these Estimates, as full information concerning specific works to bc undertaken during this year will, if desired, be given in committee. It lias been the practice for many years to ask Parliament to consider the new works proposals of the Government as soon as possible after the budget speech has been delivered. This is desirable so that new projects may proceed early in the financial year, and dislocation of employment be avoided. </para>
                    <para>Although I have just stated that it is not my intention to deal with the items in detail, the defence expenditure for this financial year is of such importance that it is necessary and desirable to give to the Senate some of its main features. </para>

                    <para>The new naval expenditure provided for this year is £1,244,000. The navy programme aims at raising thu present squadron to the highest degree of effectiveness, and providing for the local seaward defences of our ports  a.gainst  attacks by submarines and minelayers. Following are the important projects to be undertaken: - </para>
                    <para>The Admiralty is increasing the armour protection of the 8-inch gun cruisers in the Royal Navy, and the H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Canberra</inline> will be similarly armoured. H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> will be commenced this financial year. The armour plate is on order, and the work will be undertaken at Cockatoo Dock. The large refit for which this ship is shortly due will also be carried out. The crew of the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> will be used to commission the seaplane carrier <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline> and the destroyer <inline font-style="italic">Voyager.</inline> H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Canberra</inline> are to be equipped with modern and additional anti-aircraft guns and control arrangements for anti-aircraft defence. H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> which still has many years of effective life, is to be converted to an oil-burning ship at. Cockatoo Dock. The local seaward defences of the ports will involve the provision of special equipment, buildings at the various ports for its storage, an anti-submarine school, and a certain number of specialist personnel for the technical equipment. In connexion with the booms and other devices to be provided for harbour entrances, three local seaward defence vessels will be constructed at Cockatoo Dock. Strategical naval wireless stations are to be erected at Darwin and Canberra. These stations are considered of vital importance in the scheme of Australian defence in connexion with the operations of our warships, determining the routes of merchant shipping, and intelligence reports relating to the movements of enemy ships in the waters adjacent to Australia. </para>
                    <para>The new army expenditure provided for this year is £1,277,000. The bulk of the increased provision under the army vote is being devoted to (a) Continuing the strengthening of the fixed coast defences of the main ports; (fe) A further instalment of the anti-aircraft defences of the main ports. </para>
                    <para>Following are the main steps being taken at the various ports: - </para>
                    <para>Sydney. - The 9.2-inch and 6-inch armament has been installed and various small items of equipment and works remain to be completed. Anti-aircraft guns and searchlights also are to be provided. </para>
                    <para>Newcastle. - In view of the vital importance of this industrial centre to Australia, a commencement will be made this year with the installation of the modern armament shortly to be delivered. Antiaircraft guns and searchlights also are to be provided. </para>
                    <para>Fremantle. - The installation of the 9.2-inch and 6-inch armament will be completed this year. Anti-aircraft guns and searchlights alsoare to be provided. </para>
                    <para>Melbourne (Port Phillip defences). - The Port Phillip defences are to be modernized by reconditioning the fire command, communication and defence electric light systems. Anti-aircraft guns and searchlights also are to be provided. </para>
                    <para>Hobart. - The existing armament and equipment at Fort Nelson are to bo transferred to a new site in order to render more effective the defence of Hobart. </para>
                    <para>General observation. - Provision has now been made for the fixed coast and anti-aircraft defences of Sydney and Fremantle, up to the point contemplated in the first stage of the general scheme of defence against raids. All anti-aircraft guns to be provided will be manufactured at Maribyrnong. </para>
                    <para>Increased provision has been made for the maintenance of the army on a more efficient basis. The Permanent Forces will be increased by148 during 1937-38 to provide additional instructional staff, personnel for coast defence, and technical staff for the more complicated modern equipment. An increase of the staff corps is to be provided, by maintaining the present entry of 22 cadets to the Royal Military College. The strength of the Militia Forces has been increased from 26,295 to 35,000, as the result of the action taken by the Government for the improvement of the voluntary training system. These improved conditions will be maintained. </para>
                    <para>Provision has been made for additional storehouse and other staff, and for sup plies for the reconditioning and more effective maintenance of stocks of war material. </para>
                    <para>An extensive programme of army works and buildings is in hand to provide for new drill halls and additions and alterations, in order to furnish improved conditions under the voluntary system of training. </para>
                    <para>The free grant of Mark VII. 303-in. ammunition, half of which was restored last year, is now to be restored in full to rifle clubs. </para>
                    <para>The new air force expenditure provided for this year is £1,430,000. </para>
                    <para>During the progress of the three years' programme, the development of aircraft for military purposes proceeded at an extraordinarily rapid rate, and types with considerably higher performances than those contemplated when the programme was prepared became available. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline> comparison with the types originally set down for purchase, the later types of aircraft are 100 miles an hour faster, carry double the bomb load, and have a greatly increased range. These higher performances arc obtainable, however, only at greater cost, and additional funds have therefore been provided for the increased cost of aircraft purchased under the three years' programme. The increase of 353 in permanent personnel, making a total strength of 2,472, is due to the introduction of the higher performance aircraft, which require more extensive maintenance and larger operating crews.  Owing to a substantial rise of the price of building materials and building costs generally, a large additional amount is provided this year for the completion of works and building projects estimated at a much lower figure in the original air force programme. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made towards the equipment, aerodrome, emergency services and buildings required for the formation of a general purpose squadron, to be located eventually at a new Air Force station at Darwin. This squadron will be equipped with reconnaissance and fighter bomber aircraft. The first line strength of the Air Force will be 108 aircraft, as against 114 contemplated in the original Salmond scheme, and 198 proposed in the revised scheme approved by the Council of Defence. </para>
                    <para>An additional 137 officers and airmen of the Citizen Air Force will he required during the year to complete the establishment of the Citizen Air Force squadron at Pearce, "Western Australia. </para>
                    <para>Certain essential war reserves, including bombs and ammunition and aviation spirit, are to be provided. The new munitions supply expenditure provided for this year is £611,000. </para>
                    <para>At the Imperial Conference, the principles of Empire defence, as laid down in 1923 and 1926, were extended to provide for the decentralization of the production of munitions, .so as to diminish., as far as practicable, the dependence of dominions on the United Kingdom, and to provide for the extension of overseas resources in time of emergency. The munitions supply development programme may be divided into three broad divisions - </para>

                    <para> In order that the plans for industrial mobilization may be accelerated, the permanent staff on this work is being more than doubled, and additional technical investigators are now in course of training. Liaison officers of the chambers of manufactures have been appointed in each State, whilst direct approach is also being made to other trade organizations and individual companies. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made for the commencement of the Empire air mail scheme with flying boats early in 1938. The Sydney and Rabaul service will also be inaugurated next year. In view of the vital importance of radio and meteorological aids to air navigation, arrangements are well advanced for the establishment of these facilities at capital city aerodromes and at essential intermediate places along the inter-capital routes. In keeping with the increase of regular services and the necessity for facilities for night flying, an active policy of improvement and development of aerodromes throughout the Commonwealth is being continued. This provides for the enlargement of landing areas, the construction of hard-surfaced runways for wet weather operations, the installation of lighting equipment at aerodromes and airway beacons along the air routes. </para>
                    <para>The position in regard to the local shipbuilding industry is that orders are in view for the immediate future for a total amount of £500,000 for cruiser reconstruction and the local seaward defence vessels. The bulk of this expenditure will be on wages. There is also the probability that, when the consultations with the United Kingdom Government are completed regarding facilities at flying boat bases, several launches will be required. In addition, consideration is being given to the question of local construction of two target-towing launches for the army.- </para>
                    <para>The educational orders to industry will in the first place be for such items as steel shell bodies for the navy and army, steel and iron bomb bodies for the air force, and brass primers for army shell. These orders will contribute to employment and ultimately should lead to local industry participating in the building up of the necessary reserves of munitions. </para>
                    <para>The equipment of the naval wireless stations will be produced in Australia. Orders are in hand for the supply of medium and ultra short wave radio navigational aids and beacons, the major portion of which will be of local manufac-  ture.  In addition, arrangements have been made for the manufacture of rotating beacons previously obtained from overseas. These items, which will prove of great value to both military and civil aviation, represent important new spheres of manufacture in Australia. </para>
                    <para>The works expansion programmes of the Government factories and the navy, army, air force, and civil aviation branch, will be beneficial to employment. In addition to the normal annual requirements for the maintenance of the forces in the forms of food, clothing and other supplies, substantial purchases have been made of practice shot, bomb castings and certain machine tools not previously produced by civil industry, while contracts have been arranged for large supplies of cotton piece goods of a quality previously unobtainable in the Commonwealth. Considerable contracts were also arranged for foodstuffs and wheat for shipment to Empire defence establishments in the East and elsewhere. </para>
                    <para>The new government factories, upon completion, will create a demand for labour and materials. The expenditure in the last financial year on wages at the factories was approximately £540,000, and the number of employees at the 30th June was two and a half times greater than during the depression. Similarly, the value of orders during the past year was over five times larger. The increased local production of munitions formerly imported, and the growing sales to other governments, will add to these advantages. </para>
                    <para>The preparatory organization and erection of buildings and the provision of plant for the local manufacture of airframes and engines is well advanced. The establishment of this industry, which ultimately will give employment to some 700 Australians, is a further example of the Government's policy of sound development of local manufacture, and represents a notable advance towards the goal of self-containment. As already announced, the Government has intimated its preparedness to place an order for 40 aircraft complete with engines, and also ten spare engines, subject to agreement as to price -and other main heads of the proposed contract. </para>
                    <para>An important feature of the defence expenditure is the large amount that is being spent locally. Of the total provision of £11,500,000 for the current financial year, it is anticipated that £9,500,000 will be expended in Australia and £2,000,000 overseas, mainly on items of modern equipment of a technical nature and advanced types of aircraft which it is not possible to produce locally. The manner of development of the Commonwealth defences is such that the financial capacity of. the country to provide for its security is being increased by the stimulation that is being given to local production and employment. </para>
                    <para>Within the last few days there have been references to other matters connected with the Government's defence proposals, and it is fitting that I should, at this stage, state what has been done. On the 3rd September, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> referred to the claims of North- West Bay, south of Hobart, as a site for a' naval base. As promised, I conveyed his remarks to the Minister for Defence, who now informs me that Snug Beach Tourist and Progress Association urged the claims of North- West Bay as a site for the establishment of a sea and airplane base and munitions centre. I am advised that the Australian naval squadron, during its visits to Tasmanian waters, uses this bay in common with other anchorages in the Hobart area from time to time. Owing to the distances of this area from the main base of supply, it is not possible to use the Hobart area as the main exercise area of the squadron. It will, however, continue to be used as an alternative exercise ground. The Naval Board states that from the strategical point of view there is no justification for incurring expenditure in the establishment of a naval base near Hobart under existing conditions. </para>
                    <para>The flying training school for the Royal Australian Air Force, which amply meets present requirements, is located at Point Cook, Victoria, and no necessity arises for the extension of this activity to Tasmania. A company recently formed for the manufacture of aircraft in Australia selected a site at Fishermen's Bend, Melbourne, as the most suitable location for its factory. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the manufacture of munitions, the Government does not, at present, envisage the establishment of factories in new localities. As the honorable senator is, no doubt, aware, certain extensions in respect of munitions manufacture are contemplated, but these will consist of additions to the existing Government munitions factories which are located at Lithgow in New South Wales, and Maribyrnong andFootscray, in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>.- For the erection of a building at the Forestry School, Canberra, the sum of £1,000 is provided. A footnote indicates that the estimated further liability is £2,200. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> told us yesterday that there were only five students at the school, although it was hoped that the number would be increased next year. Is there any guarantee that that will be so? On a previous occasion, I drew attention to the lack of harmony that existed between the principal of this school and the forestry officers in at least two of the States, resulting in students not coming forward as was hoped. The existing building is capable of accommodating more students than there are at present. Is there any guarantee that the Forestry School, which has been somewhat of a white elephant in the past, will  be  better, patronized by the States in the future? </para>

                        <para>[8.52]. - The total estimated cost of £3,200 refers to" an additional building which it is proposed to erect at the rear of the Australian Forestry School building at Canberra, in order to provide accommodation for  a  museum,  a  carpenter's shop, seed store and  a  place for the storage of publications. A photographic dark-room is also included in the plan. The development of investigational work necessitates the storage of a large quantity of material and of provision for photography, which will form an important part of the research activities. This work has been deferred for several years for financial reasons, and it is now desired to make a commencement with it. I point out that there are two activities - forestry work proper, and the forestry school. The building will be used in connexion with both activities. Although there are at present only five students completing the course, the Minister assures me that there Ls indication of  a  greater number in the immediate future. The school is capable of doing most valuable work in the interest of forestry throughout Australia, and of saving the States which co-operate with the Commonwealth a large expenditure on similar institutions in their own territories. </para>

                        PEARCE (Western Australia- Minister for External Affairs) [8.54].- The sum of £50,000 set down for the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, is required to supplement  the  balance of £33,217 standing to the credit of the War Memorial  Canberra  trust account at the 30th June, 1937, in order  to  meet expenditure in connexion with the completion of the initial section of the building, and to enable a commencement to be made with the final section of the work. The position of the trust account is  as  follows: -

                    <para class="block">The initial section of the work has been practically completed, although services in the nature of floor coverings, provision of show oases, and the installation of central heating, have had to be deferred, for various reasons. In July, 1936, Cabinet gave consideration to the proposals submitted for the completion of the building, and subsequently approved of tenders being called at a maximum cost of £160,000. A sum of £14,000- part of a total of £30,000 - was provided in the Estimates for 1936-37, and paid to the trust account,. but no expenditure was incurred in that direction during the year. It  is  now anticipated that  a  tender will be let at an early date, and accordingly a further sum of £50,000 has been included in these Estimates. It will be paid to the credit of the trust account. The total amount which will be available for expenditure during 1937-3S on the supply of floor coverings, provision of show cases, the installation of central heating, and the erection of final sections, will be £83,217. and it is estimated that that amount will he fully expended. It will be necessary to provide a further sum of £96,000 in 3938 to complete the work. </para>

                            <para>- I notice that only £15,000 is provided for educational orders for the navy. That is a very small amount, which obviously will not go very far, and seems paltry when compared with the total amount to be expended on  defence this year. I regard these educational orders as essential to the future defence of Australia. I have no doubt that the expenditure of this money will demonstrate the ability of Australian factories to produce our munitions requirements in time of national emergency. I believe at the present time that Australian manufacturers are not given the opportunities they deserve in this respect, as much of our defence material which could be manufactured in Australia is imported. For quite a long time a body of highly skilled engineers in "Sydney has been asking that provision similar to this should be made and they have expressed their willingness to co-operate. </para>

                            <para>- I stressed the necessity for provision of this kind eighteen months ago, and I have spoken about it many times since, and for years before the general public I have stressed its importance, but on every occasion I have done so in this chamber at least one honorable senator, who is supposed to be an authority in these matters, has said that I waa talking "bunkum." Although it has been said in the past that experimental orders have been placed with Australian manufacturers and a set plan fixed, I have repeatedly been informed by outside but interested persons that no such action had been taken. I was informed recently by a member of the House of Representatives that for a considerable time highly skilled engineers have been clamouring for the provision of funds for the defence vote for this purpose. Those highly skilled engineers are willing to give their services on a council of investigation in a purely honorary capacity. </para>

                            <para>- No; but I should be pleased to see it increased. I pay tribute to this Government for its vigorous defence policy, but at the same time 1 say that at no other period in Australia's history has the necessity for a comprehensive defence programme been so urgent. With the experience gained from experimental orders, Australian manufac turers will be able quickly to -turn out our requirements of war materials in the event of emergency. </para>

                        <para>.- I am quite in accord with the provision of funds for educational orders, but at the same time I do not want the position of manufacturers to be misunderstood. As long as the expenditure of money is confined to orders of an educational nature it will be all right. Australian manufacturers have no desire to enter into the commercial manufacture of munitions for profit, but they want to be placed in a position to be able to turn out war materials when they are wanted. I do not want it to be thought that our manufacturers are trying to make money out of the manufacture of munitions in Australia. The Government is doing the right thing in making this money available, so that some factories will be ready to turn out munitions in time of emergency. </para>

If to reply to my questions does not involve too much detail, I should be glad to know from the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> if provision is included in this amount for the extension of the air-conditioning of the East-West express train, the completion of the ballasting, and if it is proposed to utilize some of this money for the purchase of larger type engines? Provision of £110,000 is made under item 5 for the Port Augusta to Port Pirie railway. I should be glad to know if this amount represents the final payment of the Commonwealth's share of the expenditure incurred in connexion with the extension of the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line to Port Pirie. </para>

                        <para>. - I draw attention to the first item " Telephone Exchange Services, £1,031,000." I congratulate the Minister on the excellent work done by his department in regard to the extension of telephone services throughout Australia, although I admit that there are still quite a number of pressing requests that I, with other Western Australian members, have lately put before him, for which we still await approval. There is, however, certainly no direction in which the Government is doing better work than in the extension of telephone services. But I ask the Postmaster-General why are not more automatic telephone exchanges established in the country districts? " We have quite a large number of them throughout Australia. As an experimental measure we have put a number of them in isolated country districts, and they have been very successful there, but the amount of money that brings one suburb under the automatic system would probably install it in several hundreds of the small exchanges that, have only 5 to 20 subscribers. It is in these outback places that automatic exchanges should first be put, because we cannot afford to have a well-paidofficer looking after an exchange for many hours, with perhaps only half a dozen or a dozen or a couple of dozen subscribers. By means of the automatic system we could, at comparatively small expense, give these isolated centres a continuous service. </para>

                            <para>- A mechanic could travel about and look after  quite a number. The system is being worked in many parts of Australia already, without a mechanic permanently located at each, and is successful. I commend the general administration of the department and the extension of telephone services, but I urge this further improvement upon him. Many country exchanges that are open for only a few hours of the day, some perhaps only for the morning, could be given the advantage of a long and continuous service if the Government installed the automatic system. These small exchanges are established in districts where there are not very many local amenities, where one has to send a good distance for machinery parts, or even for the more important medical requirements. In many of them, even if one is prepared to pay the opening fee, he cannot get attention after hours because there is no one living on the actual premises after a certain hour. I commend this aspect of the matter to the consideration of the Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>. - The general policy of the department is to convert all manually operated exchanges to automatic working, but workable plant cannot be scrapped. That is to say, we cannot be uneconomic in making the conversions. Quite a number of places have been brought under my notice where the officers have reported that the plant is capable of giving good service for a few more years, and we have had for the present to withhold conversion in those instances. We have, however, already thirty-three or thirty-four rural automatic exchanges, and fifty more are in' contemplation for establishment. Four of these are in the State from which the honorable senator comes. Honorable senators may rest assured that while I remain in the department a steady attempt will be made to convert the whole system to automatic working, for the simple reason that I do not regard a service that stops at 6 p.m. as a real service to the country people. Tt. must go on later and be there for them to operate at all times. </para>

I only wish that I could say the same about other items, particularly one in which he has delegated too much power to a commission. I should like to know whether the item of £500,000 for "buildings, works, sites, fittings and furniture ", includes the necessary .amount for the new post office at Brisbane, which has been promised to us for a very long while. We hope to see a start made' on that work very shortly.

                        <para>. - The Brisbane post office has been the subject of very lengthy investigation already, foi- the purpose of giving effect to the decision that was arrived at while we were in that city. It has been most difficult to work out these plans, and considerable differences of opinion arose between the Postmaster-General's Department and the Department for the Interior, which is entrusted with the architectural work. A conference took place there on the 23rd August and a nominal amount is provided on the Estimates for this year, because I do not anticipate that we shall do any actual work on the post office during it. The work has all to be mapped out carefully so that wo may carry on that vast service in Brisbane at the same time as we are carrying out the reconstruction, but I can assure the honorable senator that the matter is well in hand and that probably on the next Estimates a large provision will bc made for it.

                    <para>A few moments ago a question was put to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> by interjection, about the provision of broadcasting stations in the north-west of Queensland. I have told the Senate on many occasions that this broadcasting business is being carried out according to a predetermined plan. We can go only so far as our money will let us, and so far as our scientific knowledge allows us, from time to time. It is intended to cover this very difficult region, of which the honorable senator has complained, and of which one of my colleagues in Cabinet has been constantly reminding us. Steps have been taken to improve the short wave service, which is already in operation at Lyndhurst, and I think that will relieve' the difficulty that I admit exists with regard to reception in north-west Queensland. </para>

                        <para>.- I appreciate to the full the fact that the Postmaster-General's Department is greatly improving the telephonic service throughout the Commonwealth and giving more and more facilities to people who use the telephone. At the same time, the  president  of a Tasmanian producers' association has brought under my notice the fact that, in the opinion of his association, the country subscribers are handicapped to a great extent and penalized through no fault of their own by being a certain distance from the exchange. A little while ago I brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General representations made by this association, which he investigated and courteously replied to. To-day I received a reply to the communication I sent to that body, enclosing the Postmaster-General's reply to my representations. The letter is as follows - </para>

                        <para>When dealing with your letter, and that of the Postmaster-General at our executive meeting last night, we noticed in the latter that the wording relating to country subscribers was very ambiguous. It stated that 90 per cent, of country subscribers "were connected" with exchanges that had a basic rental of £3 5s. That does not mean that 90 per cent, of country subscribers pay £3 5s.; we know that nothing like that number pay so little and, further, it must be remembered that business people on country exchanges make up a good percentage of those who are on the basis rental. Far too many farmer subscribers are paying more than the basis rental and we would suggest to you that you and your colleagues might put it strongly to the Postmaster-General that the basic rental should apply to subscribers up to the three-mile radial distance </para>
                        <para>This would be some concession, would recognize the principle we hold, and give some relief to genuine farmer subscribers. </para>

                    <para class="block">I trust that the Postmaster-General will consider the request of the  president  of this important Tasmanian association, so that people living in country  districts will be in closer touch with those in the larger centres of population. The concession asked for is small, the cost would not be great, and if the request were complied with the number of subscribers would increase. </para>

At- the opening of a new station at Orange I said that there is still a good deal to be done in completing our broadcasting system, and that several A class stations are still to be established. For that reason wave lengths have to be reserved for national stations yet to be erected; that is a reason why the number of wave lengths available is limited. </para>

                        <para>. -  The proposed vote for the Postmaster-General's department is the largest in the schedule, and roughly one-third of the total amount to be appropriated. The proposed expenditure in other departments is either fairly close to the estimate or even below it. but this vote is a striking instance to the contrary. It seems unusual that the vote of £850,000 for 1936-37 should have been exceeded by nearly £500,000 in respect of telephone exchange services. The total proposed vote for the Postal Department for the year has been exceeded by £366,000. Why should there be such a discrepancy between the estimated and actual expenditure? The difference in connexion with the transcontinental railway is £20,000, which is negligible when compared with this vote, particularly when we remember that as the Postal Department does not embark upon new works with undue haste, it should be able to estimate its expenditure more accurately. There must be some reason why there is such a difference in the figure which incidentally has increased this year, and also has a further liability attached to it. </para>

                        <para>. -  It was anticipated that funds would be obtained from loan moneys last year, but as no loan moneys were available, the expenditure is to be financed from revenue. Instead of receiving £600,000 of loan money, we obtained only £300,000. I realized last year that the vote for the department had been pruned too closely, but cabinet agreed with me that an increase should be made to provide for the extension of some important services. We have expended more money than we anticipated, because we had to work in accordance with the vote provided in the first instance. </para>

                            <para>- I compliment the Postmaster-General upon the manner in which the work of his department is conducted. It is a business undertaking receiving considerable revenue from its customers, many of whom would not mind paying a little more for more efficient service. The time is rapidly approaching when the revenue of the department will have to be curtailed. It must be pleasing to the Postmaster-General to walk into the cabinet room with a smile on his face and say to his colleagues " Here is another £3,000,000 for you." In some business houses the employees are told to remember that the customer is always right, and I trust that that will be the slogan of this department. Two or three weeks ago, I complained concerning the service I was receiving,  and an  official of the department came to test my office telephone. He rang about ten different subscribers, and the rapidity with which he was answered was extraordinary. I have never received such prompt service and I was amused  at  the smug satisfaction he displayed with the results achieved. Recently my home in Melbourne was unoccupied  for a  week or so, and on my return from Canberra, I was notified by the department that numerous unsuccessful attempts had  been  made by the central exchange to raise my number. That, I think, is an instance of the businesslike way in which the department is conducted. </para>

                        <para>. -  Some time ago there  was cause  for complaint concerning the manner in which the telephone services  in New  South Wales were conducted, but it is now  exceptionally good. Only this evening, the Treasurer informed me that, in speaking, to Melbourne to-day the clarity of reception was remarkable. We may very properly pay a high compliment to the officials .of this branch of the department for the excellent services now being rendered. I now direct the attention of the committee to the proposed vote for national broadcasting services. Last evening, the Postmaster-General, when replying to some criticism concerning the Australian Broadcasting Commission, said that excellent results had been obtained from short wave transmission. If my memory serves me aright, and I think it does, about two years ago the Director of Posts and Telegraphs declared that short wave wireless transmissions would be of no use in Australia. Now, as the results of experiments in all countries, the greater part of long distance reception is on the short wave, and very good. I consider also that the time has arrived when Australia should have high-powered stations. Che  Postmaster-General  said last night that this matter was receiving attention. E hope that a more definite announcement will be made in the near future of the Government's intention to erect at least one high-powered station in the Commonwealth. In this matter Australia is the most backward country in the world. Czechoslovakia, with a population of about 10,000,000, has a 200 kilowatt station with an aerial 900 feet high, and for many years in the United States of America, 500 kilowatt stations have been in operation. In New Zealand, the main broadcasting station is, as far as my memory serves, about four times larger, than any Australia station, and the whole of the equipment was manufactured by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. If we had a high-powered station, we could expect perfect transmission in every part of Australia. In war time high-powered stations are essential, in order to prevent enemy countries from jamming messages and thus interfering with the conduct of military operations and for many other purposes. I hope that the Minister is alive to the importance of this development. Large sums are spent annually in importing foreign artists at high salaries to entertain the listening public in Australia. In my opinion, it would be better to spend at least some portion of that money in establishing efficient high-powered stations. </para>

I hope also, that before long there will be a prospect of television broadcasts in Australia. </para>

The final view was that for transmission in Australia, the medium wave-length would give the best results. I, in common with the honorable senator, considered myself something of a radio expert, and when I became ministerial head of the department, I was convinced that the experts were wrong; but I have had an opportunity since then to examine the position, and I am satisfied that the Government was well-advised to adopt the medium length wave for Australian broadcasting. I feel confident also that when the plans now in hand are completed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> will agree that the medium-wave transmission is giving efficient service to the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para>After listening to the compliments that have been paid to the Postmaster-General and officers of his department, I almost feel that I should apologize for breaking the continuity. But I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the urgent need for an improvement of the trunk line service to Mount Isa in Western Queensland. It is practically impossible to get trunk line messages through the steel telephone line between Cloncurry and Mount Isa. I have complained about this matter on several occasions. It is high time that a copper wire was substituted for the existing steel line. I have been informed that the volume of traffic does not warrant a new line. That answer is not satisfactory. The department could not expect an increase of traffic with the existing line, because it is impossible to get messages through satisfactorily. I have personal knowledge of the difficulties that are encountered, at Mount Isa, because I have tried on a number of occasions to speak from both ends of the line, and have found that it was utterly impossible to carry on a conversation. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> paid a visit to Mount Isa recently, and I understand that he had brought to his notice the inadequate living accommodation for the postmaster. As there is a permanent population of between 4,000 and 5,000 at Mount Isa, vvhere private enterprise has invested about £5,000,000 in developing the mining industry, it is surely not too much to expect the Postal Department to spare some portion of its huge surplus to provide decent accommodation. The local Progress Association, the Chamber of Manufactures, and the local branch of the Australian Workers Union, as well as the secretary of the Australian Labour party, have made representations to me on this subject. I hope that, in view .of the importance of the town, and the strong probability of developing a large volume, of trunk line traffic, steps will be taken immediately to replace the existing steel telephone wire with a copper line. </para>

McLachlan)</inline> say where the permanent studios and offices of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Perth are to be located? Pour or five years ago the commission bought two fine adjoining blocks in a central position in Perth, and prepared plans for the erection of buildings. The people of Western Australia were informed that up-to-date studios would be provided there, but the plans ultimately drawn were, for a building of only one storey. The Perth City Council and other interested parties objected to such a building in the heart of ' the city, and suggested that a two-storey structure should be erected. The commission then transferred its offices to an old wood and plaster building known as the Stirling Institute, and has since spent a good deal of money in renovating it. I cannot imagine that this building is to be the commission's permanent home. Can the Minister say how long the lease of these premises has to run, and when more modern studios and offices are likely to be erected? </para>

Sites have been acquired at Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart. An officer of the commission and the chief architect of the Department of the Interior, who recently went abroad to investigate modern studios and studio designs, have now returned and are preparing plans for up-to-date studios. I am not sure of the location of the new studio at Perth, because difficulty has arisen about the title to certain land. Personally I thought the site chosen was excellent, but in view of the legal difficulties mentioned, it is probable that another site will have to be obtained. </para>

The whole of the amount of £189,610 set down for architectural services, fittings and furniture, will not be available for expenditure during the current year, as this item will require to contribute towards the general saving of £30,000 to be effected under all the items of division 34. Re-votes in respect of uncompleted works in hand at the 30th June last will absorb £83,010, whilst £75,000 will be required for the erection of cottages, the demand for which is steadily increasing. Approximately 300 applications are in hand from persons desiring cottage accommodation. The amount provided will meet only a limited portion of the existing requirements.

                        <para>. -  If there is one vote we should not cavil at in these Estimates, it is that for the further development of the Federal Capital Territory. I suppose no other city in the world is showing the return on the capital invested in its development that Canberra shows. That is a very wholesome state of affairs. I urge the Leader of the Senate to bring under the notice of the Minister for the Interior the necessity for pushing on with the construction of cottages, not only because of the present demand for them, but also because under existing conditions a good deal of the money spent in wages in the Federal Capital Territory is finding its way into Queanbeyan, nine miles away. Nothing is occurring in that town which would* account for the prosperity evidenced by the number of new buildings and shops being erected there, and for the improvement of its hotels. We can only assume that this measure of prosperity is entirely due to the fact that as Canberra does not provide the accommodation required by artisans employed in the Federal Capital Territory on developmental works, many of them are forced to reside in Queanbeyan. Where they reside, they spend their wages. I seriously urge the Leader of the Senate to suggest to his colleagues in the Cabinet the desirability of providing suitable cottage accommodation for artisans employed in the Federal Capital Territory. </para>

The Minister for  the  Interior has supplied to me the following particulars: - </para>
                    <para>It does not necessarily follow that, when an alien becomes naturalized and renounces his allegiance to the country of his origin, he loses his former nationality. In the majority of countries a person loses his original nationality upon naturalization abroad; in a few caseshe does not, and in somehehas to obtain authorization from the Government, even thoughhe has renounced his former nationality. The general principle accepted by the British and Commonwealth governments is that it is for each State to determine the rules for the acquisition and loss of its nationality. One State need not recognize legislation passed by another State which it considers prejudiced to its own rights. The principle consistently followed by the British Government is that, if a person enjoys the nationality of two States, each of those States is entitled to regard its own nationality as the dominant one - </para>

                    <para>For example, if a Jugoslav were naturalized here and also retained his Jugoslavian nationality incontemplation of Jugoslavian law, the Jugoslavian Governmentcould not claim to accord him protection whilst he was here. If he proceeded to Jugoslavia, and was called up for military service, we would not interfere. Section 24 of our Nationality Act has a bearing on the point. It states - " Where any British subject ceases to be a British subject he shall not thereby be discharged from any obligation, duty or liability in respect of any act done before he ceased to he a British subject." </para>
                    <para class="block">Consideration was previously given to representations made by the Consul-General for Jugoslavia that Jugoslav nationals should be required to obtain a release from the Jugoslavian Government before being naturalized. It was decided not to do this. The. Government of the United Kingdom does so, but not the governments of the other dominions. </para>

                            <para>- He may have been, but at the same time the figuresare really astounding. It is not fair to the Senate or the country. If this gentleman's commercial interests prevent him from attending to his parliamentary duties, the fairest course for him to take is to resign from the Senate. He may be doing some work which we do not know about, but I think it is usual for an honorable senator to attend the majority of the sittings of the Senate. Honorable senators have visited various parts of the world with leave of absence and others, unfortunately, have been very ill, causing them to spend much of their time away from the Senate. As the Senate meets on only a few occasions during the year, and since October,1934, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-Greene</inline> has been in attendance only fifteen times, it is evident that some explanation is due from him in fairness to the Senate and to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. -  It is with a considerable amount of reluctance that I rise to endorsethe remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown.</inline> 1 realize that the honorable senator to whom he has referred possesses outstanding ability. He was elected by hisState to give service to the people in this chamber and the people are entitled to the benefit of his ability and knowledge. I feel that the position of a senatoris a full-time job, and the least a man holding it can do is to attend the sittings of the Senate, unless prevented by ill-health or absence overseas. This honorable senator has  been away 89 sitting days without leave and eight with leave out of a total of 112 ; that sort of thing tends largely to bring this chamber into disrepute. For that reason more than any other I take exception to his continued absence without leave. Possibly the Senate itself has erred in not granting leave to him. I notice that he was absent for only eight days with leave, and I do not understand how he could be absent for 89 more without leave without ceasing to be a senator. </para>

                        <para>. - In this matter, on which I regret to speak, as much as the previous  speaker  does, one must keep clearly in his mind two considerations; the first is that there are a certain number of meetings of the Senate, and the second is the quality of the work that is done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SirWalter</inline> Massy-Greene was elected, as I was, in 1931. I think that I am right in saying that he was not at that time in good health. Nevertheless, he became Assistant Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and held that position, one of extreme difficulty and great responsibility, at a most troublous time in Australia's history. He did his work in a way for which we ought to be grateful. Many of us sit here year after year and never in the whole of our careers do anything like as good work as the honorable senator did in those three years, at a time when he was in ill-health. I do not desire to go into the other side of the question, nor should it be necessary to do so. Honorable senators, should, in all fairness, weigh the value of a man's work against the number of his attendances ; that is what I do, and I say that, on a consideration of the last six years this country has good reason to be grateful for the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Massy-Greene was a member of this Parliament. </para>
