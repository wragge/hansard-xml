                        <para>.- On behalf of the Opposition in this chamber, I have again to protest most emphatically against the procedure, which is becoming an incurable habit, of this Government keeping Parliament in recess for the greater portion of the year, and then bringing . down important measures without giving honorable senators an opportunity to criticize them effectively. We all know that, as usual, the Government is scurrying into recess. Personally, I think it is rather wise to do so, because by prolonging proceedings in full view of the electors it is hastening its political demise ; if I can do anything to expedite that occurrence I shall be only too willing, to do so. In discussing this bill, I propose to deal with a number of subjects which appear to me to come within its scope, the most important of which is that of  defence. I am going to ask honorable senators not to repeat the " hooligan " behaviour to which this chamber was treated yesterday afternoon. </para>

                            <para>- If the remark is offensive I withdraw it. The conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins,</inline> who .was one of the chief offenders to whom T have alluded, was not becoming a gentleman of some distinction and claiming a measure of education.  It was apparent from the remarks of those honorable senators opposite who criticized the Labour party and its defence policy yesterday, that they have the guts to do everything bin defend their own b't of the Empire. The members of the Labour party have assumed full responsibility for the defence of Australia and have declared to t],e  nation  that they will fulfil that responsibility. Yesterday, during the de hate on the Imperial Conference we were definitely slandered on the  subject  of defence. I repeat that honorable senators opposite, and their colleagues in another place, have all the courage necessary to commit Australia to join in every mercenary war that may be undertaken, but lack the courage and constructive ability to defend 7,000,000 people, the citizens of Australia, who belong to the Empire as much as any others do. I repeat what I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> yesterday afternoon, that in the policy outlined by him and others of his party there was no room left for the doctrines of Christianity and that, in the circumstances which these gentlemen outline and their reactions to them, the Sermon on the Mount will again be censored, if war ever again breaks out, which God forbid. In this connexion I would say that honorable senators in the Government are in all this nefarious propaganda merely preparing the stage for a loyalty election campaign. They know that they dare not go to the country on their own deeds. </para>

                                is such a thick and thin supporter, although he was a thick and thin condemner of it before the alliance with the Country party, is deliberately allowing Australia's iron 01'e and stores of scrap iron to be" exported to another country. Although it is continually asserted in this chamber that that other country is the potential danger in the Pacific, the lessons of the past are never heeded by honorable senators opposite. They have forgotten all about Gallipoli, they have forgotten all about the Dardanelles, they have forgotten that the military and naval experts of the United Kingdom are being sent to other countries to train their nationals in the fine arts of defence. They forget that on Gallipoli, Australian soldiers were murdered. I use the word " murdered " deliberately, because it was not  a fair fight. One honorable senator said that the young recruits from Australia did not know how to load or unload it rifle, and that when they got to Gal lipoli they were mercilessly mowed down. How were they mowed down? By guns and munitions manufactured by British armament firms for profit, as everybody here knows. I would not dare to say that during war time, because the censor would be after me, but -some of us knew what was going on.

The members of the Australian Labour party in this chamber and elsewhere are prepared to go to the people of Australia on the Government's loyalty campaign. Let honorable senators opposite make no mistake about that. They will not have the advantage of the atmosphere that existed in 1914. All the Christian churches are not behind them this time in this campaign. Most of the churches are arrayed in these days against the Government policy and against war. </para>

Quite recently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> advocated the policy of building up a standing army in Australia, but yesterday he weakened, and suggested something he called Swedish drill, quite an anaemic proposition from a defence point of view. Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald, he had not the courage to stand up and say what the Government's intentions were, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald, who has some sense of logic, said that the report of the Imperial Conference was a business proposition, that it meant business, and that the Government had returned from the meeting prepared logically to carry out the implications of the report. He went on to say that in his opinion it was time to revive compulsory military training in Australia. I told him a fortnight ago that that was the intention of the Government. I pointed out to honorable senators and to the people of the whole nation that unless the Imperial Conference decisions, agreed to by Australia, are merely pious platitudes with no business behind them, there is no doubt whatever that they must be implemented by compulsory universal military training and conscription of the manhood of Australia for service abroad whenever the next war occurs. </para>

I wish now to quote a newspaper report of a debate in the House of Lords - " The Primate the other day said ' Christians are entitled to draw the sword for a righteous cause '," remarked Lord Ponsonby in the House of Lords recently. The Archbishop of Canterbury : " It may be true, but I am not aware of having said it." Lord Ponsonby: " I think I am right in saying that the Primate used the expression ' the sword.' " The Archbishop of Canterbury: "I quoted St. Paul." Lord Ponsonby: "The Primate ought to have brought St. Paul's words up-to-date, and, instead of the . sword he should have said  chlorine, phosgene, mustard gas, Lewisite and thermite.' Then he should have asked his fellow Christians if they were justified in using those in any cause at all." </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will remember the remark I made earlier as to the lack of courage on the part of those Up loyalists, those flag flappers, those spurious patriots who were so vocal in this chamber yesterday afternoon. One can tell the lack of business behind the whole plan when one finds that this Government proposes, in this .budget, or in this Supply Bill, to begin again the pernicious practice of borrowing abroad. It intends first to float on the London market £2,500,000 worth of treasury-bills. These cannot be left eternally floating in mid-air, and, undoubtedly, the intention is to float a loan on the London market, to redeem them. If there is any honesty behind the defence proposals of the Government, honorable senators opposite should see to it that the people who are to be protected pay for the protection. We all know perfectly well that an overseas loan cannot be floated and paid for in anything but goods, that the result of the loan comes here not in cash, but in the form of goods, and that every pound's worth of imports which could be manufactured in Australia means that some good Australian has been kept out of a job. As a matter of fact, the Government really proposes to spend on defence less -than the amount it has indicated. </para>

                            <para>- I mean less from revenue, as the honorable senator well understands. I can tell the Government the proper thing for it to do. . In. this chamber, yesterday, one honorable senator, I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins,</inline> proposed a complete survey of the resources of Australia, so that we could be prepared to meet a national emergency. It was very significant to me that the honorable senator left one important matter entirely out of his purview. He had nothing whatever to say about taking a survey of the private wealth of Australia, or about calling on that wealth' to contribute in order that Australia might be adequately defended. Of course, he could say nothing else but what he did say. The right honorable senator had to be eloquently silent on that point because his Government is determined at least that the workers, who pay for war in blood and treasure, shall carry the greatest burden of taxes. It is time the people of this nation were told just where this combination of United Australia and Country parties, these queer bed-fellows that constitute the Government of this country to-day, stand on this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> who was one of the few speakers yesterday afternoon who lifted his share of the debate on to a high plane, is always a gentleman. That compliment is very willingly paid <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the honorable gentleman, however much we of the Opposition may disagree with him on matters of policy. He makes no secret of the fact that he is an Imperialist, and he has just returned, he tells us, from a trip to the United Kingdom; during his absence he had the benefit of a tour through six different European countries. He also has the advantages of social prestige, wealth, and superior education. Yet even he, when he came down to tin tacks yesterday afternoon, visualized the need for boots, rifles and machine-guns and then said that it was no use. having all those things unless men were ready for them. I imagined that at. the moment all he could see in the prob lem of defence was the preparing of enough feet to go into enough boots, and enough training to enable men to destroy life and property. </para>

                    <para>In the House of Representatives last night I heard a statement by a supporter of the Government that in no circumstances would he touch the Statute of Westminster and that it was a very dangerous thing. The Statute of Westminster lies behind the whole, or at least a large portion, of the Labour party's attitude on this matter of defence. The Statute of Westminster, as passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, definitely provides that the government of every dominion in the British Commonwealth of Nations shall have complete sovereignty in all matters, including the defence, and war. I want to separate the matter of defence and the question of going to war. Every honorable senator knows, in spite of all the false insinuations that are made from time to time, that this party is definitely pledged to the defence of Australia. In this chamber yesterday, we heard that the defence of Australia might be more effectively accomplished not here, but "over there " and every where else, and one honorable senator went so far as to say the North Sea. The Labour party is not having that on. </para>

                    <para>I proceed to refer to matters connected with the tariff policy of this Government and particularly to a recent happening. It is well known that this Government has recently appointed what it is pleased to call a tariff advisory committee consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C</inline> H. McFadyen, of the Department of Trade and Customs, who is Chairman; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> F. Ferguson, Director of the Australian Association of British Manufacturers, member; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> Withall, Secretary of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, member. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. J. Harrison),</inline> who is not a member of this party, hut a thick" and thin supporter of the Government, asked certain questions on this matter in the House of Representatives - questions which I think should have been asked. The answers are in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> In my opinion, the appointment of this committee is ill advised. It is further delegating power away from the Minister and this Parliament. If there is one thing to which I object more strongly than anything else, it is the continued delegation of power from the ministerial heads of departments, and the failure of the Ministers themselves to do their jobs. If the taxpayers pay men extra salaries to act as Ministers - I do not suggest that they gay them enough, because I do not think that they do; we should have fewer governments and more highly paid members of the national government - and those men accept the contract by taking the taxpayers' money, they should give equivalent services in return, and have no right to delegate powers to bodies which they create and which ultimately become more powerful than their creators. </para>

But even that immense secretariat is not sufficient to enable the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> to do his job, and he has delegated other powers to the Advisory Committee. Not many manufacturers in this country will be prepared to go before that Advisory Committee and submit facts regarding their lines  of  manufacture. </para>

                    <para>Now for a few words about tariff matters. During its term this Government has been monkeying with the tariff which was imposed by the Scullin Government to give effective protection to Australian industries, and had the endorsement  of  the majority of the people. In its five years of office this Government has reduced the protection on nearly 2,000 tariff items, thereby bringing about an element of uncertainty about the security of existing industries, leading to insufficient employment, insufficient food and insufficient spending power for Australian workmen. Every reduction of the tariff has affected the homes of some factory employees and lessened their prospect  of  employment. In this connexion I was extremely interested in the linguistio  acrobatic performance of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> during a recent visit to Brisbane. I heard the right honorable gentleman's speech, delivered at the annual show of the Royal National Association of Queensland. I admit that he made some interesting observations about increased prosperity, and I give him full credit for the fact that at no . stage did he mention "My Government", or suggest that credit was due to it for the improvement that had taken place in the economic situation of the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, those who heard him could not dissociate the Prime Minister and this composite Government from the increased prosperity now being enjoyed by some sections of the people. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not knowingly omit anything; if I do I feel sure that the honorable senator, who reminds me of a perpetual note of interrogation, will prompt me. The Prime Minister when in Brisbane said that Australia had emerged from the valley of depression to the hilltops of prosperity, and he added that there were still further hills to climb. That was all very fine and there was certainly some truth in the statement. But when he was in Sydney a little later he spread himself in a somewhat different way. The right honorable gentleman repeated the story of abounding prosperity, but said a number of other things also. </para>

We on this side do not deny that, compared with depression years, there is a greater amount of prosperity in this country, but time will not permit me to examine the situation in detail, and show just where credit for this improved condition lies. We do not, I repeat, deny the present comparative prosperity of Australia. On. the contrary, we are happy to acknowledge that the condition of the people has improved ; but, before I resume my seat, I intend to ask the leader of the Country party a few questions under the heading, " Where is- this prosperity?" Then I shall tell him where prosperity is not. </para>

                    <para>Let me now tell honorable senators how this wonderful economic survey was conducted in Queensland. My information on this point is to be found in a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith, the Premier of that State. This is taken from the newspaper report of an interview with him - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In Queensland information was obtained from a mere handful of factories, and upon that narrow basis the Prime Minister had made sweeping generalizations which did injustice to this State. He was also informed that no official approach had been made to the Queensland Bureau of Industry,  which  could have supplied useful information. Pot instance, it could have informed the economic surveyors that, in Queensland in 1932-33, registrations of companies were 206, with a nominal capital of £12,500,000, and that on the 30th June, 193C, there were 3,052 companies in the registers of the State, with a total nominal capital of £449,313,562, an increase oi £15,126,815. It is also a fact that numerous companies registered in other States trade in Queensland. This has been brought about because Queensland has the most up-to-date companies legislation in Australia, with the greatest protection to investors and the public. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Premier of Queensland further stated that he had ascertained the sources of the information relating to Queensland used for the so-called Commonwealth industrial survey, and had discovered that neither the Commonwealth nor the State statisticians had been consulted. Thus it would seem that, upon material so obtained, the Prime Minister had spread himself before the Chamber of Manufactures or some other body in Sydney, and talked at large to the disparagement of my State. The report continued - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Brisbane Chamber of Manufactures and the Chambers of Commerce hail been asked to supply lists of firms which were producing new goods, or had expanded, but the lists supplied for Queensland were incomplete, and some firms did not send replies at all. As an example of important firms which were not included in the alleged " survey ", the Premier mentioned Evans, Deakin Limited, of Brisbane, Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, and the Toowoomba Foundry, all of whom are large employers. It was through such omissions that the Prime Minister's figures showed a much larger capital investment' for each employee -in Queensland than in some other States. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is the old-time theory which influences the economic policy of this Government as "well as the governments of many other nations. Yet in the midst of abundant production we have the destruction of essential foodstuffs in order to keep up prices. In Brazil, for instance, millions of bushels of coffee arc destroyed <inline font-style="italic">every</inline> year ; in Seville, millions of bushels of oranges are destroyed.; in Denmark, thousands of milch cows are destroyed annually; and, to come nearer home, in Tasmania, thousands of tons of apples in seasons of glut are fed to the pigs or ploughed into the ground. Thus in times of abundant production we have the cruel and criminal paradox of starvation and malnutrition among the peoples of the world as well as a tremendous volume of unemployment. Let me repeat the opening sentences of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash's</inline> speech, and give the whole of his statement- </para>

                        <para>The economic outlook of the British Nationalist Government is based on the outworn scarcity theory and on the idea that the " law " of supply and demand should be allowed complete freedom in determining a price level, except that, if prices fall low enough to stir the home producers to exert their influence, the Government would be prepared to restrict consumption in order to force prices up. The economic outlook of the New Zealand Government follows the newer philosophy that the determining factor should be the possibility of production being increased till every human, need is satisfied. </para>

                        <para>The British Government certainly could put a restriction on consumption by controlling imports, but I pointed out that our policy was to utilize to the full the resources of New Zealand, and to send them in various forms to the United Kingdom up to the point where the needs of the people of the United Kingdom would be satisfied. It is obvious that there are millions of people in Britain who have 'far less to cat and wear than their reasonable needs. </para>

The Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of the 22nd July, 1937, published a unique ordinance, which purported to prohibit unlawful assemblies within a proclaimed area in the vicinity of the Federal Houses of Parliament.

                    <para>There is nothing new or objectionable in that, I admit. In fact, a new ordinance was not necessary to apply this law. It is in the definition that the unique character of the ordinance is disclosed. A subsection of section 3 states - </para>

                        <para>For the purposes of the last preceding subsection, persons shall bc deemed to have met, or to be assembled for an unlawful purpose, if they or any of them, while assembled, do anything unlawful- </para>

                    <para>AVe all agree with that but, unfortunately for the Minister, he has given a definition of what is unlawful. The sub-section continues - or make known their grievances, or discuss public affairs or matters of public interest, or consider, prepare, or present any petition,  memorial, complaint, remonstrance- </para>
                    <para>Have honorable senators ever heard of anything so monstrous having been done to a community, not one individual in which has a vote for the election of a member to this Parliament? These people are denied the right to assemble and hold a meeting outside Parliament House. They must not discuss their grievances, present petitions, or do anything which every other community may do without let or hindrance. In every other part of Australia the people have a vote, and can have their views expressed in the different legislatures, yet those who reside in the Federal Capital Territory cannot do anything of the kind, because they have no vote. They must not, according to this ordinance, " present any declaration or other address to  His  Majesty or the Governor-General". What a pity it would be if the serenity of the Governor-General were disturbed by his being told by a few of the unemployed that their kiddies go to bed in the cold of winter without a blanket to cover them. The prohibition against the presentation of any declaration or other address applies also to " both Houses or either House of Parliament, or to any Minister or officer of the Commonwealth ". These disfranchised people must not even say to a departmental officer - " Excuse me, sir, can you tell me what the position is regarding such and such a matter, because we are thinking of taking some action and do not want to transgress the law?" If 20 persons do that without warrant - - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator can put me right on that point, if he cares to do so it is not marked on my brief. The penalty provided for a breach of this ordinance is a fine of £100 or imprisonment for six months. Obviously the offender would be imprisoned, because he would be unable to pay the fine. Some of the unemployed would do well to break the ordinance and' be imprisoned for six months, because then they would at least be fed, clothed, and housed for that period, No comment or argument is necessary to show that this is an attack on what are regarded as the fundamental rights of Australian citizens. The fact that the ordinance is limited in its operation to a small area and necessarily to the comparatively small number of Australian citizens who dwell or temporarily sojourn in the Federal Capital Territory does not improve the position. It is the more remarkable that this restriction of liberty should occur in the city which was built to house the National Parliament, when <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> considers that the history of British parliamentary institutions is the history of Parliament's struggles to protect and give legislative force to those principles of liberty which. British peoples have always cherished dearly. Although in strictly legal theory Parliament is able to accomplish anything by means of legislation, there is an unwritten law in every British country that even Parliament is not to be permitted to attack the liberty of the subject. Behind this law, where it is not expressed in the Constitution - as in the case of the American Constitution - is the sanction of the ballot-box. But the residents of the Federal Capital Territory cannot appeal to that.I shall be glad to hand my brief to the Assistant Minister who represents the Attorney-General in this chamber, so that he may privately, if not publicly, tell me if and where I am wrong. </para>

                            <para>- I was not in Brisbane when that occurred. But, even so, that demonstration was made by the Communist friends of the Commonwealth Government; a prosecution against them was withdrawn by the Commonwealth Attorney-General because he wanted them to support the Labour party to its undoing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> forgets two important facts. If the circumstances in Queensland were identical with those in the Federal Capital Territory, I should say that both governments were equally culpable. In Queensland, however, every man and woman of adult age outside a gaol or a lunatic asylum has a vote, and in that State there is only one branch of the legislature. The people of Brisbane can make their appeal directly through the ballot-box and accomplish by that means anything that they regard as essential to their interests. I am astonished that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> who ought to know that I have the accumulated experience of a fairly long life, should think that I am such a trusting innocent that a little joke such as he has made would put me out of my stride. When he endeavours to find excuses in this matter for the Minister for the Interior I am more than ever convinced that I am right, and more right than I had imagined. </para>

                    <para>I wish to touch on a very serious matter that comes under the control of the Postmaster-General's Department. I have already had something to say in this Senate concerning the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Quite a long while ago I made certain definite charges against the members of that body, with the result that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder,</inline> who should never have been appointed to the position that he held but should have been left to continue bullying the prisoners in- Pentridge gaol, of which he had been governor, was dismissed. We were not taken into the confidence of the Government, but apparently it believed that my charges were well founded. I have no wish to restate those charges, and shall content myself by saying that the personnel of the commission does not commend itself to me. I have previously enlarged upon the lack of qualifications on the part of the members, including the lady member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Couchman.</inline> With respect to that lady I wish to add to what I said on the last occasion, because further information has since been placed in my possession. Does the Postmaster-General consider that it is a part of the duty of any member of the commission to go in to the offices of the commission where ladies are employed, inspect the quality of the sanitary paper that is being used in the lavatories, condemn it as too expensive, and go through the girls' bags during their absence? </para>

                            <para>- I have not said so. The Opposition in this chamber, and the members of the Australian Labour party throughout the Commonwealth, believe, and have stated so in their programme, that all things which of themselves are in the nature of public utilities should be in the hands of the community, and that in no circumstances should private enterprise be allowed to exploit them. Those things which are in the nature of public utilities are, water, gas, electricity, transport and wireless. The Postmaster-General is the ministerial head of one of the finest departments in the Commonwealth. We may voice grievances at times because the facilities provided are not what we think they might be, but no man can say one word against the efficiency of the department. In every part of Australia there is an entire absence of friction. People even in the most isolated parts of the Commonwealth can enter post offices and transact postal, telegraph and telephone business with the utmost facility, and I pay a tribute to the excellent work carried out by the officials of the Postal Department throughout Australia. That is a public utility rendering a valuable service to the community, but such utilities should not be exploited by private profiteers. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of the fact that the Postmaster-General has been officially advised by the expert at the head of his department that no suitable wave-length is available. He is, I am sure, a very capable man, but while he says that it is impossible to allocate a suitable wave-length in Brisbane, transmitting stations have since been opened in different parts of Queensland. I do not believe the story that it is impracticable to make a transmitting station available to the Labour party in that State. The wireless stations in Australia are, with one or two exceptions, owned by the syndicated press and other syndicates. </para>

I have a fair command of language, but when I realize the frightful indignity inflicted upon these representatives of the people language fails  me.  The commission suggests that politicians are infants in swaddling clothes and should not be treated as decent citizens. I challenged the qualifications of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moses,</inline> the general manager  of  the Australian Broadcasting 'Commission, when he was appointed, and I do so again. I know that the Government has no satisfactory reason for allowing him to retain his present position. The day following the action taken in Brisbane this mau came along and submitted me to the greatest insult I have ever suffered. I make it a guiding principle in my life not to submit to any injustice without protest. I am making my protest to-day against this " whipper snapper " - this incompetent. Prior to his appointment as general manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission he was a mere sports commentator, and he has had the audacity to say that because the speeches of politicians are neither educational nor entertaining, he does not propose to allow them to be broadcast. </para>

The Postmaster-General is an affable man, but, unfortunately, he is supplied with unreliable information. The honorable senator does not always supply me with fair answers to the questions that I submit. Some time ago, I put, certain questions and received certain answers, which I submitted to certain people who were capable of technically examining them. The Postmaster-General told me something about Regulation No. 48. That regulation says : " A broadcasting station licence may be granted for any period not exceeding three years, for the Postmaster-General to determine." Of course, under Regulation No. 54 (1) a licence can be varied as the Postmaster-General determines. The honorable gentleman led me to believe that he. could not do anything of the kind. The fourth question that I put was whether there was any record of the earnings of B class stations, and the Postmaster-General told me that he had no knowledge of their earnings. Yet Regulation No. 62 provides - </para>

What happened is well-known to every honorable senator. It is true that the Scullin Government reduced pensions from £1 to 17s. 6d., and it is also true that it was supported in that action, not byvery member of the Labour party, but by every member of the then Opposition. Members in another place said "Whilst we agree that this cut is forced upon us, we do not like doing it." All parlies agreed, however, that it was a financial emergency cut and that, immediately the revenue permitted, that cut with other similar ones should be restored. </para>

Every honorable senator knows that the alternative presented at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin's</inline> head was "Reduce the pension to 17s. 6d., or on the 1st July,, next you will not have enough money available to pay more than 12s. in the. £." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> said " I cannot go to the pensioners and tell them that I am going to cut them by 8s., but I will tell them that I must under duress cut them by 2s. 6d. Still, as a return for what I am forced to do in this connexion and in others regarding social services, I demand a reduction of interest." He got the reduction of interest. </para>

                            <para>- I hope it never will be restored, and that it will even be still further reduced. In 1932 the Lyons Government cut the 17s. 6d to 15s. Not a solitary word is ever said about that, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> with his smug selfcomplacency and his lack of knowledge of the facts, sits back in his place and interjects as to who did this, that, or the other. There, however is the stark cold fact that Labour under duress reduced the pension from £1 to 17s. 6d., and contracted to return it immediately the oppotunity  offered. The Lyons Government in October, 1932, cut the pension to 15s. and brought in those cruel, cowardly and iniquitous property provisions which were a disgrace to this nation. The Government as a matter of fact became money lenders to the old-age pensioners on the security of their property - a .most horrible proposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham said in another place that under those property sections 12,000 people who were getting the pension - the paltry 15s. or 17s. ,6d. as the case might be - surrendered it rather than submit to the indignity of parting with the little bit of property they might have. He also said that 13,000 more qualified to obtain the pension refused to apply because of the iniquitous property pro visions. He added that at that, time, if the property provisions were repealed, it would have meant an increased expenditure of £610,000 annually, and that the rate of future claims for pensions would be substantially increased. In October, 1933, the Lyons Government put the pension back to 17s. 6d. </para>

                            <para>- An acknowledgement of that sort" is a measure of truth and decency of which honorable: senators opposite are not capable. In every speech of theirs they refuse to give the Labour party credit for anything. In July, 1935, the Lyons Government raised the pension to 18s. because of the increased cost of living, and the property sections were modified. In September, 1936 the pension was raised to 19s., but in the meantime pensioners had been robbed of about £9,000,000 in the aggregate. </para>

                            <para>- By the LyonsPage Government, which refused to keep its contract by repealing the emergency legislation as soon as the finances permitted. As regards the finances, listen to these figures: In 1932-33 the Government had a surplus of £3,500,000, but nothing was done for the pensioners except to cut them down further; in 1933- 34 the surplus was £1,300,000; in 1934- 35 it was £711,000; in 1935-36 it was £3,500,000, and in 1936-37 it was £1,250,000. In other words, it would be perfectly true to say that all the Government's surpluses for those successive years were taken out of the old-age and invalid pensioners. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> Under the existing state of affairs, which will not be allowed to continue if the Australian Labour party obtains control after the elections, as I confidently believe it will, some cruel and cowardly property sections still operate. </para>

For the moment, let me say that if a man has an insurance policy it counts against his pension in certain conditions, although the policy is on his own life and the money from it will never be available to him. He has to declare that life policy, and the department assesses the present value of the policy to expire within a given time. </para>

                            <para>- In order to save time and save you worry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President,</inline> I gladly withdraw the words complained of, and refer to those provisions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is obviously so proud of and so willing to defend, as highly admirable, Christian, and charitable. The case I wish to cite is that . of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. E.</inline> J. Stanley, of Creek-street, Wynnum. She applied for the old-age pension in' July, 1935. She is 63 years of age.  Her  application was refused on account of the value of her capital assets. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Stanley</inline> has a reversionary interest in an estate, the assets in which are at present valued at £14,000.  Her  share on the death of the life tenant, who is 83 years of age, will be £900. The departmental ruling states that, " the present value of £900 on the death of a woman aged 83 years is approximately £610 ". Hence no pension is payable in this case. The fact is that this old lady of S3 is in splendid health and there is not the slightest suggestion that she is likely to die. The applicant for the pension, who is 63 years of age, has no income whatever. She has been to moneylenders in Brisbane, to the Public Curator, to the Queensland Trustees, and to other similar institutions and she has said : " This is what the Pensions Department says that this asset is worth. Will you advance me enough money on it to . give me enough to eat from week to week?" No financial institution in Brisbane is prepared to negotiate this alleged reversionary interest. As a matter of fact, that woman has been reduced at last to the extremity of accepting relief from the State government. She has not a penny to her name and, but for the fact that the State government has at last given her ration relief, she would starve. We, on this side of the House say that such conditions as those are wrong. </para>

In order to show that those adjectives which I used were justified, I quote now from the speech made by the right honorable the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> on this very question of invalid and old-age pensions on the 29th September, 1932. The right honorable senator had something to say because I had said something on behalf of the pensioners. He unburdened himself of this Christian sentiment - </para>

                            has not the slightest sympathy for those people; he sympathizes only with that section of the pioneers, which in many cases, because of its thriftlessness has had to draw old-age pensions. I admit that some pioneers who exercised thrift during their lifetime have been compelled, because of unforeseen circumstances, to fall back on the pension, but there are many others who, because of their tliriftlessness  and because  they  have never denied  themselves  every form of pleasure and luxury, have, by their own act. brought themselves within the pension class.

                    <para>That is' the attitude of the Government to the pioneers of this country. Possessing a good salary and a lovely home with environments that in every way are conducive to contentment and decency, it is easy to get up from the banquet table with a well-filled stomach, but it is very difficult for people in such positions to put themselves in the place of those people who have been systematically robbed by this Government which is entirely out of sympathy with them, and whose only sympathy in the matter of national insurance lies with the upper class whom it wishes to relieve of the liability for pensions which it is now carrying. Supporters of the Government say that the cost of pensions is rising and that the country cannot go on increasing its liability in that respect. Therefore this Government wants to introduce something that will take the liability off the backs of their wealthy friends and put the burden on the backs of those who should not have to carry it. </para>
                    <para>Before I conclude I wish to know from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> who represents the Attorney-General, how much longer the people of this nation are to be treated like a lot of children by the censorship. How much longer are the members of this Parliament to be told when they go into the Parliamentary Library. " You cannot get that book because it is on the banned list " ? In other words books printed and published in the old country without ban are denied to members of this Parliament because a bau has been placed on them here. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. What rot, nonsense and cowardice it is to say that these expensive editions should be allowed entry whilst the cheaper editions are banned. Either these works are alright or they are all wrong. If they are all wrong, no matter how expensive their setting up may be, they should be prevented from getting into circulation. If these books are made available to students it is nonsense to say that they should not be equally available to the common people so that they, too, might increase their studies and culture. I am opposed to the banning of books, newspapers and films. </para>

                            <para>- I have already answered the honorable senator. One cannot keep him on the straight track no matter how one tries. If books are blasphemous and obscene they should be wiped out. I am not sure what kind of literature the honorable senator reads, but it appears that his intelligence has been warped by whatever kind he does read. The State parliaments have passed effective laws to deal with the kind of literature to which the honorable senator is apparently referring. </para>

                    <para>By way of interjection yesterday, and now by way of explanation, and in gratitude for the extra time allowed to me I state that yesterday in this chamber I suffered for three hours. I did my best then to be orderly, but transgressed on some occasions under compulsion. Now, keeping within the Standing Orders, I say that yesterday I was subjected .to the greatest indignity that I have ever suffered in my political career. Never before have I heard anything that was so unfair, ungentlemanly and unsportsmanlike. To-day I have told this assembly definitely where I and my colleagues stand on the different matters to which I have referred. I know a great deal of it is unpalatable to those honorable senators who do not support the Labour party, but I tell the Senate in what will probably be my las't effort before we go to the country that my speech this morning represents the lines on which I shall appeal to the electors of Queensland. </para>

The honorable senator was the champion for his party in Gwydir, and I was a more follower of my party, but I know that his party's ignominious failure was due to his poisonous tactics. Our party went there honestly and succeeded, whereas the honorable senator and his party failed ignominiously. </para>

                        supporter when I say that we have suffered in this chamber for the last hour and a half. When the Leader of the Opposition speaks of such words as " unsportsmanlike I answer him by declaring that if we wanted a precedent for unsportsmanship, it was provided by the honorable senator himself in his attack upon a lady who is employed by the Broadcasting Commission. I have been in this Senate for about six years but on no other occasion have I ever heard an honorable senator on the floor of the Senate take advantage of parliamentary privilege to launch an attack on the good name of a woman. That is one thing, at least, which the people of Queensland will remember against the honorable senator when he faces the bar of public opinion within the next couple of months.

I thought at least that we would hear the last of it when the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill went through this Parliament last week', but the Leader of the Opposition was away. In his attack on the Lyons Government to-day, in which he told how the pensioners had been robbed of their due rights, the honorable senator carefully refrained from entering into the history of the invalid and old-age pensions system which was recapitulated in this chamber last week. For the honorable senator's benefit and in an attempt to improve his education on this matter, in order to prevent him from future misrepresentation of the facts, I shall again recapitulate the history of invalid and old-age pensions. </para>

                            <para>- This is the history. The Deakin Government of 1908, which by no stretch of the imagination could be claimed as a Labour government, introduced the invalid and old-age pension at the rate of 10s. a week. It is of no moment that, in doing so, it created a system which, ever since, has been the subject of political propaganda and a political football which has been kicked around the political arena. The Leader of the Opposition was careful not to reveal the interesting fact that, the Deakin Administration introduced pensions. He should also ask himself what action was taken by the several Labour governments that have been in power since 1908 to improve the lot of invalid and old-age pensioners. A period of over 30 years has elapsed since the first act was placed on the statute-book, and I suggest that the real test of the Labour party's sincerity for the welfare of pensioners is the measures taken to better their conditions. In 1908, the pension fixed by a non-Labour government which inaugurated this form of social legislation in Australia was 10s. a week. In 1910, and again in 1916, Labour was in power, but did nothing, lt was left to a third Labour government, one led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Hughes, to increase the pension by 2s. 6d. a week, but a fourth Labour government - the Scullin Administration - reduced it by a like amount.  In the face of these known, facts, Labour leaders and the rank and file of the Labour party in this Parliament, in their desire to make political capital out of the misfortunes of pensioners, endeavour to persuade the people that non-Labour governments have never extended a helping hand to this deserving section of the community. The truth is that pensioners owe all that they now enjoy to legislation initiated by non-Labour governments. It is significant that the Leader of the Opposition, who for an hour and a half this morning spoke volubly and recklessly on many subjects, is now silent. I repeat that, with the one exception mentioned, every increase of pension since the inauguration of this social legislation, has been made by governments other than Labour. This is a fact, which I believe the people will remember at the elections to be held next month. </para>

                            <para>- In the section dealing with defence, there is no reference whatever to Labour's attitude to the Communist party, but there is mention of  its  opposition to war and fascism. This booklet is, I consider, convincing evidence of an agreement between the Australian Labour party and the Communist party, an arrangement which has not been weakened by any of the events of the last four or five years. To establish the connexion between the two organizations, we have to study, not the statements of the reputed Labour leader in the House of Representatives, but the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley</inline> who, when he was  President  of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, submitted a motion that the Labour conference affiliate with the Moscow Third Internationale. It would be well to remember, also, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley</inline> was responsible for the defeat of the Scullin Government. He is now. attempting to disavow his association with the resolution of the Labour conference two or three years ago, but these are facts which, I believe, the electors will remember. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> to explain the omission from the blue book of any mention of Labour's attitude to the Communist party. </para>

                    <para>The claim that this Government has been responsible for the present prosperity of Australia is well founded. Its record will stand the closest investigation. When it was returned to office the affairs of the Commonwealth were in a state of chaos, due to the faulty administration of the Seullin Government, and it is to the credit of this Government that order was restored and prosperity ensured. </para>
                    <para>One matter which I should like to see clarified is the policy of the Labour party with regard to broadcasting. This matter should be put beyond all doubt, because in the blue book, containing an outline of Labour's policy, there appears the statement that, if successful at the next elections, the Labour party intends to carry out the greatest radio steal that has ever been perpetrated in the history of the industry. </para>

                            <para>- Labour candidates are saying everywhere that if they are returned the spoils of the coming election fight are to be the B class stations, which have been established by the expenditure of much capital and give employment to large numbers of Australians. We should have the issue clarified because the Leader of the Opposition this morning told us that Labour's policy was in tune with that of the Labour Government of New Zealand, which has practically abolished commercial stations and nationalised broadcasting. </para>

                        is the real Leader of the Labour party, because
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline>
                        can- not govern without the assistance of the New South Wales group. In fact,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline>
                        cannot do anything without the approval of that group. When he was elected Leader of the party by a majority of one vote, not one member of the New South Wales section of the party voted for him. I emphasize that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley's</inline>
                        statement was made recently - not three or four years ago, or even just before the alleged union of the two groups.  His  speech was delivered in December, 1936. He told his hearers that if the Labour party were returned to power it would cancel all B class licences and re-allot them to suit the Labour party. Is it any wonder that I classify
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline>
                        as a second-hand dealer in words?  His  latest statement is an attempt to re-assure the B -class stations that it is not the intention of the Labour party to interfere with them, if returned to power. The Leader of the Opposition in this chamber said that the Labour party in Australia was attuned to the Labour party in New Zealand. The tuning-in must have produced a most discordant note, because in regard to defence the Labour party in Australia plays a tune entirely different from that played by the Labour party in New Zealand. But I take his words at their face value. It is reasonable to assume that, the Australian Labour party will advocate exactly the same policy as the New Zealand Labour party adopted when it obtained control of the broadcasting system. In that dominion the Labour party did not nationalize broadcasting. Oh no; it adopted a policy of peaceful penetration. It said' to the B class stations of New Zealand : " We will take only some of you over, and will leave some of you to operate under the control of private enterprise ". Those which were left to private enterprise were graded as C class stations - small stations of about 100 watts, capable of being heard over a radius of about 5 miles. Then it said to them that the stations under the control of the Government would enter the advertising field in competition with them. ' The result is that the pick of the B class stations in New Zealand are operated by the Government in competition with private enterprise in the broadcasting of advertisements. That is an effective way of achieving the nationalization of broadcasting. It, reminds us of the policy of the Labour party in regard to the control of private banking. Once Labour obtained control of the Commonwealth Bank, it would use the facilities provided by that institution to overthrow the private trading banks. If the Labour party gets into power at the forthcoming election, it will not cut off heads, but it will select for public control those B class stations which are most powerful and exercise the greatest influence, and give to them advertising rights. The B class stations in Australia are handling about 15 per cent, of the total advertising of the Commonwealth. If radio fell into the hands of a Labour government, there would be ruthless competition with the newspapers. When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking of the increase of monopolies, I asked him why he did not support the nationalization of newspapers instead of the nationalization of radio, but he sidestepped the question. Labour wants control of the air because .it believes that that will mean the control of the country. Its definite and deliberate policy - a policy inspired and controlled by the New South Wales Labour party - is to secure control of B class stations and to nationalize them along the lines that I have indicated. Is it any wonder that I describe the policy of the Labour party as the great radio steal?

                    <para class="block">Some of the most interesting evidence that I have ever read was that submitted by the advocates of trades unions in the Federal Arbitration Court in support of an application for an increase of the basic wage. The Senate will remember that the unions asked for an increase of 12s. a week, and received 6s. The evidence submitted on behalf of the unions was in direct contrast to the remarks of the Leader of the Labour party in this chamber, and of its Leader in the House of Representatives. I myself have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> refer to the partial prosperity of the Commonwealth, and to-day the Leader of the Labour party in this chamber spoke of foodstuffs being wasted while many people are unable to get sufficient to eat. I have no doubt that, if the honorable gentleman repeats his activities in the Gwydir electorate, he will try to paint for the people a picture of unemployment - men standing idly at the street corners, factory machinery lying .idle, and prosperity still far off. The honorable gentleman would do well to compare his statements with those submitted to the Arbitration Court by the industrial wing of the Labour party. The comparison makes interesting reading. The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crofts,</inline> who was the leading advocate on behalf of the unions, show how wide is the gap between the policies of the industrial and the political wings of the Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crofts</inline> told the court that the case of the trade unions was based essentially on a comparison of present and past conditions. I have no quarrel with that, for it is all that we ask the electors of the Commonwealth to do. If the electors will compare present conditions with those of 1931, the parties constituting the Government will be prepared to stand or fall by their impartial judgment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crofts</inline> said - </para>

Yet those statements are denied in this chamber by the supporters of the Labour movement. Is not that evidence of the use of a double-headed penny - of political chicanery intended to delude the people ? Undoubtedly it is, and I believe that when the full facts are placed before the people of Australia the Lyons Government will be returned with a greater majority. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems the right thing to say something about defence since that important subject fills many pages of the report on the Imperial Conference. During the course of my remarks, however, I do not propose to air my views on the best methods of defending Australia because I have already done so on other occasions. The fundamental principles of strategy and tactics - secrecy, surprise, early information, guarding lines of communication, concentration of superior strength at the right time and place, meeting the aggressor before he can lay waste your country - hold good now as in Hannibal's time. The remarkable scientific development of the instruments of war, even since the Great War, has not affected these principles one iota. Listening to the speeches on this subject in this chamber and in the House of Representatives one would think that there were no Australian officers capable of giving expert advice. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash has passed on, there are at least two Australians, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White, to whom the Government can turn for advice. During the Great War these three Generals of the Australian Imperial Forces stood head and shoulders above the majority of British and other dominion generals. Ten years ago an Imperial Defence College was established in London for educating senior officers of the navy, army  and air services in Imperial strategy. A very limited number of students is admitted for the year's course. Every alternate year, however, an Australian staff corps officer attends the course. Two of them, Major-General Lavarack and  Colonel "Wynter  have passed through the college with credentials equal to those of any British or other dominion students. These officers had the opportunity to study empire defence from every angle, and with that knowledge as a foundation, they are able to give expert advice to the Minister for Defence, particularly as they, like myself, are Australians and Australian minded; but they and the two senior generals I have mentioned are likely to get out of touch with the progress made in scientific defence preparations at the heart of the Empire and to be in the dark as to what progress a potential enemy has made or to what extent Britain can help the dominions ;n time of emergency. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence can, however, obtain this information first-hand confidentially at an Imperial Conference, as they undoubtedly did recently. Possessed of this information the Government has framed its defence policy, upon which it intends to stand or fall at the forthcoming elections. Every member of the Australian Imperial Forces knows how the Royal Navy and armed merchant ships protected Australia's overseas trade in 1914-18. It is, therefore, right that our small Australian navy should be brought up to something approaching the strength of armament and personnel of pre-war  days. Very few - the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is one - knew the reason why, in September, 1914, the 37 New Zealand and Australian transports were held up day after day while 30,000 men were ready to embark. The two German cruisers, the <inline font-style="italic">Scharnhorst</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Gneisenau,</inline> were prowling around in Australian waters, and transports dared not leave their berths. Then, within a few hours, embarkation and sailing orders were received, because our battle cruiser, H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia,</inline> the creation of the Labour party, had driven these enemy cruisers across the Pacific. Instead of human beings, these 37 transports might have been laden with wool and wheat, or other commodities which contribute to the wealth of this continent. History might repeat itself, so it is better to be on the safe side. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The navy rightly claims the greater portion of this year's defence expenditure and the air force is well provided for, but the poor old army, which wins a nation's battles, is almost forgotten. Should Australia ever be in danger, a demand will surely arise for an efficient; mobile army. Unless the paltry six days training in camp is increased before then, I would not envy the generals who had to command troops. China to-day is fighting for its existence, not only with a. powerful up-to-date air force; that arm is backed up by an army of nearly 1,000,000 trained men. We cannot afford to let our nucleus army crumble. Who is the scoundrel or lunatic who wants another war? A visit to the Caulfield or Randwick Hospitals should silence any one so inclined. But " Safety first " is a good slogan; that is why all parties should support the Government's defence policy. </para>
                    <para>I agree entirely with my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> that a complete survey of the capabilities of certain factories for turning out war material in time of emergency  should be speeded up, but he need not. get so " hot under the collar," because the Defence Department does not proclaim from the housetops its mobilization plans. </para>
                    <para>I express the satisfaction that will be felt by riflemen -all over the Commonwealth when they know that the Government has made provision on this year's Estimates for the restoration of the full annual allowance of free ammunition, Mark VII., to effective members of rifle clubs. </para>
                    <para>There is discontentment amongst superannuated Commonwealth public servants, whose pensions were restored entirely in November, 1933. From July, 1931, to November, 1933, in accordance with the Financial Emergency Act 1931, the Government's contribution to their superannuation pensions was reduced, but it was fully restored in November, 1933. It is claimed, and rightly so, that the Government had no right to make a reduction, which was a repudiation of the contract made by the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government with its public servants under the Superannuation Act of 1922. The Commonwealth superannuation system was framed by actuaries specially qualified for this class of business. It is a family annuity purchase, similar to that obtainable from leading life assurance societies, and no such society would think for a moment of breaking its contract with assured persons. When the Superannuation Act became operative, many public servants surrendered life assurance policies because they could not afford to contribute for superannuation benefits as well. In the early days of federation, a considerable number of State public servants transferred to the Commonwealth Public Service with State pension rights. When the Commonwealth Government, under the Financial Emergency Act, reduced the pensions of these transferred officers, .the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth Parliament had no power to do so. Why should not the same principle apply in respect of pensions under the Commonwealth Superannuation Act, and all public servants be placed on the same footing? In Great Britain, civil service pensions are non-contributory; yet during the period of very severe financial strain, these pensions were not reduced. Ex-Commonwealth public servants now on pension, and "those in the Service who are still contributing, fear that unless the Government redeems its liability in respect to reduced pensions during the period July, 1931- November, 1933, similar deductions may lie made for a longer period and to a greater extent in the future. The Government should honour its contractual obligations under the act, and so restore confidence by refunding the £57,000, which is estimated to be the amount of deductions made. At least 67 per cent, of those affected could not afford to take up more than four units, which represents a pension of £2 a week on retirement. The pensions of widows in this category were reduced by 4s. a week during the period mentioned. The individuals concerned in this appeal are the lower-paid officials, and their grievance ought to be removed without further delay. </para>

                        <para>. -If the supporters of dictatorships in various parts of the world heard the froth and bubble of honorable senators opposite when dealing with vital problems they would be confirmed in their opinion that democracy is dead or, at least, moribund. Listening this morning to some of the views expressed by honorable senators opposite I came to the conclusion that there is a good deal in what the supporters of Fascism and dictatorships say, because it seems almost impossible to discuss problems properly, and with due cognizance of their effect upon the people, particularly when some honorable senators make such puerile statements. I was struck by the stupidity and puerility of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy's</inline> reference to the Australian Labour Party's blue book and pensions, and I wondered if it is not possible in a legislature such as this to deal with important problems fairly, without having our minds solely on the elections. In view of the approaching political storm, it is perhaps difficult to remain calm and collected, to deal with each subject on its merits, and to give due consideration to the views of others. But I shall endeavour to deal dispassionately with the subjects which have been discussed during this debate. It is amazing that three members of the Opposition represent 47 per cent, of the electors, and that the other 33 senators represent only 53 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows that the Labour party platform provides for the abolition of the Senate, but while this chamber remains in existence I believe we should have some better system of representation. My mind reverts to bitter experiences that fell to my lot in the early days, merely because I held Labour, views. I was dismissed from various positions because I had the courage of my convictions. 1 know the bitterness that was engendered in the minds of those controlling industry against me and those who held similar political views. Many, like myself, had to suffer indignities and hardships because of the principles we espoused. To-day, some applaud the work of the Labour men of the past, but they  do not give to the Labour representatives of to-day credit for what they are endeavouring to do. We are told that the Labour party of to-day is different from the party of twenty years ago. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, whose name has been mentioned, came from the ranks of the miners. He was dismissed from his employment, and for months found it impossible to get a job because of the political views he held. But the Labour movement has grown in strength, and those who would villify and destroy it cannot do so because of the power within the movement. When I first came to Australia I was told that those who supported a Labour policy were home despoilers,  wreckers of happiness, and men anxious to interfere with the religious solemnity of the marriage tie. Later when the war broke out, the Labour party was alleged to be under the heel of Germany, and to be accepting German gold. Still later it was Russian funds that were being placed to the credit of the Labour movement. To-day we have reached the stage where our good friend from the Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Hardy)</inline> allies us with the Communist party. I suppose he will tell the people of New South Wales, through that loud  speaker  of his, what a fearful party the Labour party is, because forsooth it has linked itself up with those horrible Communists, and destruction of all that stands for the national life of Australia will follow. Of course all these allegations are only so much political bunk, twaddle, puerility, stupidity and all the rest of it, but they have to be made in order to catch votes in our modern democracy. No wonder democracy is losing its power and strength, when men of high intelligence, as men should be who are sent to the highest legislature of the land as the representatives of the people, utter or believe such tarradiddles  and stupidities as we have had to listen to this morning. The Labour party is a political party with a political programme that every man and woman can read and understand. </para>

                            <para>- If that is true the honorable senator is not fit to be a representative of New South Wales in this chamber. Any man who aspires to be a senator should have the intelligence to understand the plain language of the Labour party's platform, and I do not believe the honorable senator when he says that he cannot understand it. We are a political party owing no allegiance whatsoever to any other political party. If any man wishes to join the Labour movement and to run as a candidate, he must sign the pledge which states, amongst other things - "I hereby declare that I am not a member of a Communist organization or party or any political party having objects and methods in any way opposed to the Australian Labour party." That is the pledge that we have to sign and it is unfair to fasten the Communists on to us. I do not wish to speak in a derogatory manner of any one. This is a free country and every one in it has the right to speak to his fellows if he so desires. He has also the right to organize a political party. We have the Country party, and we have the United Australia party, which has had about 20 different aliases ; we have the Labour party, and the Communist party, and also the Douglas Credit party. In fact we have two Country parties, one which supports <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan</inline> in Victoria, and the other which supports the United Australia party, the representatives of the big mortgage companies and the banks and the pastoralists. They and the United Australia party are linked up one with the other. I understand that the Country party in Victoria is more representative of the working class, but the Country party in this Parliament is closely allied with the money machine, the banking machine, the big commercial men and manufacturers of Australia. We have in this chamber direct representatives of the big companies, some of them directors of those companies. That, of course, is their own business. The section of the Country party which we have in the Senate is allied, not with the workers, but with those who dominate Australia financially. I expect that some day we shall see a change in the outlook of the farming community. Instead of closely allying themselves with those who exploit them the farmers will turn to the Labour movement and seek to better their conditions by closer alliance with the workers of the cities. Indeed, at the present time, we have in our ranks many working farmers. I am' pleased to know that our new senator, who evidently stands very high in Queensland's regard, is a working farmer, and from the age of fourteen has been a member- of our party. Quite a number of working farmers, as I say, are members of our party, and we hope, as time goes on, to see the farmers leaving the moneyed section, and the banking section, and the exploiting section, and transferring their allegiance to those who are seeking to improve the lot of the producers. The Communist party has a perfect right to organize, but we say to it " We do not desire your attachment. Four members have the right as citizens of Australia to preach your doctrines so long as you keep within the law. You have the right to organize any of the people, and to ask for their votes, but "we as a party say that any one who wants to belong to our party must give full and complete allegiance to it." As a matter of fact the Communist party has opposed the Labour party, and to-day in Queens.land. Communist candidates are running against our nominees. Judging by the voting cards that are distributed near the polling booths at election times, the Communist party has on many occasions advised its supporters to vote for the United Australia party and the Country party. However, that is their business, but I think it is grossly unfair and ungentlemanly on the part of those who occupy the Government benches to accuse the Labour party of an alliance with the Communists. They go their way, and we go ours. We believe in our programme, and we believe that the carrying out of it will be for the benefit of the mass of the people of Australia if we obtain control of the Government. We are entitled to that belief, whilst the Government is entitled to show clearly and explicitly, if it can, in what way our programme is not for the benefit of Australia. But, for goodness sake, let us be honest, gentlemanly and intelligent, and discuss the issue fairly and squarely. </para>

                    <para>As regards pensions, no member of our party will deny the facts. As I said the other day,- we are delighted that some measure of restitution has been made to the old-age pensioners, and that the Government at long last has seen fit to restore the payments to the full rate. In replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> whom I call the Vicar of Bray, I would point out that such reforms as have been made are due to the pressure, the organization, the activity and the propaganda of Labour. I refer honorable senators to the little blue book in regard to the institution of the pension system. I hope every senator will shortly have a copy of that book in his possession. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> referred to it. [ wish to assure him that it has only one edition, and that there is no such thing as an expurgated edition, or a second, third, fourth or fifth edition. It was sent to the printer and issued, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> should have the courtesy as a gentleman to accept our assurance that there has been no expurgation _of it. If we had the money, we should be delighted to issue a sufficient number to enable every elector to read it. I make bold to say that it will be read with a greater measure of understanding and appreciation than was the case with the book which the Government issued to every elector on the referendum, and which, very few electors read. I am certain that honorable senators on the Government side will read this little blue book avidly. I hope it will do them a world of good, because if they speak the truth on the platform, they will be able to tell the electors some of the things which are in it. </para>

                        has told the chamber one side of the story with regard to pensions. Now let me tell what the little blue book says about it. On page 65 of the book, which is entitled "Why Australia should vote out the Lyons Government, " under the caption of " Pensions, Labour responsible for first pensions act. " it says -

                        <para>The first Commonwealth Old-age Pensions Act was introduced in 1908. Although Labour was not in power at the time, being only a small party, it held the balance of power between two other parties. Having such .power it forced the Deakin Government to make provision for old-age pensions, agreeing if it did so to allow the Government to remain in office. </para>

                        M.P., who recently published a number of typewritten sheets on the subject, and who is an honorable man, the introduction of old-age pensions was due to the fact that the Labour party in the Federal House at that time used its influence,because it held the balance of power, to exact from the Deakin Government this measure of reform. On the 3rd June, 1908, a speech was made by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline>
                        of Tasmania, who was a member of what was then called the Liberal party. Certainly he was an anti-Labour man, but he left no doubt as to who was responsible for the old-age pension. This is what he said -

                    <para>That is an answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> out of the mouth of a gentleman who was a member of the anti-Labour forces. Surely Ministers and government supporters must admit the sincerity, force and power of the reform movement which was headed by the Labour party. Surely they can give the Labour party credit for the good work it did in bringing about the institution of that admirable social service. It should be said again that the Lyons Government, through the mouth of its leader, did make a definite promise to return to the old age pensioners that which was taken from them partly at the instigation of the then Opposition, of which the present Prime Minister was Leader. Yet when the finances allowed of a restoration of pensions being made, the Government continued to remit taxes to . an inordinate degree, and the poor old-aged pensioners lost several millions of pounds through the Government not fulfilling its pledge. I say that, because I believe it to be true. I take the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> when he was Leader of the Opposition, and I read into them that which I think he himself meant to be read into them. I am not introducing any extraneous matter; I am simply giving his words in good, plain English. </para>

Whilst the Treasurer, no doubt, felt uplifted when he delivered his budget speech, and whilst his listeners may have agreed with him about the rising tide of prosperity, we must not be carried away with the idea that we have reached a stage in our internal economy when we can afford to ignore the possibility of dangers ahead of us. It is not always wise to be satisfied with the existing financial situation. We should take to heart the Treasurer's advice and put -something aside for a rainy day. So far we have had little evidence of such prudence on the part of the Government, although there is no certainty that this country may not once more be plunged into the dark valley of depression. </para>

                    <para class="block">According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keynes,</inline> the construction of public works when there is also a demand for capital goods by private enterprise creates huge plants and capital goods which are not required when another depression comes, with the result that thousands of workers are thrown on the industrial scrap-heap. That policy, which overlooks the need to reorganize society, is wrong, because it merely attempts to divide the present poverty, thereby making it more difficult for men to obtain work. The advocates of that policy see the curve of employment rising in times of prosperity, and then sinking low in times of a depression, and they believe in maintaining it at a mean level, by reducing the prosperity curve and lifting the depression curve. That is the idea of some men who are giving thought to this problem. </para>

That is absurd. In order to safeguard the existing financial system with its exploitation, the honorable senator would close down on public works so that, in the future, a few of the men now put out of employment may find work in other directions. Among government supporters there are many who advocate a curtailment of public works. The Labour movement is concerned that, even in spite of the prosperity claimed by the Government there are 200,000 workers unemployed in Australia to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator, who, himself, is applying his brains to some of the problems confronting this country. Despite the cold reception sometimes given to his remarks by supporters of the Government, I admire the honorable senator for trying to show the need for obtaining the fullest information in order that essential reforms may be instituted. Unfortunately, many honorable senators are not prepared to discuss these matters intelligently. They prefer to talk a lot of blather and blurb in ali attempt to score off one another. I do not want to be accused, of merely abusing the other side and of having no constructive suggestions to put forward. The Labour party says that, in a community in which hundreds of thousands of men are out of work, it should be possible to utilize the services of those men to increase the total production. I would not support any political party whose object was simply to average booms and depressions, and which was not prepared to take legislative action to increase the total production of the community. In New Zealand, as the result of the policy of the Savage Labour Government, there  lias been an. increase of production, and practically every person in the community, including the farmers, has shared in the benefit. </para>

There is much that we can learn from other countries; it matters not whether we learn from New Zealand, the United States of America, Germany, Italy, or even despised Russia. I believe that we should take cognizance of the legislative action of other countries, and its effect on their economic development. If the effect be- good, we should have sufficient sense to use similar methods in this country. </para>

If we were strong enough to utilize the power of Parliament on a national scale, f am convinced that the total production of commodities in Australia could be increased, thereby eliminating many of the troubles which arise out of economic poverty. </para>

That action illustrates my point. If such production is necessary, it should be controlled by the Government, and not handed over to a private manufacturer. Let me give another simple illustration. The standardization of the railway gauges of Australia would be a good tiling for this country, as would also the building of arterial roads, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> so eloquently advocated yesterday. </para>

                            <para>- I am suggesting that this country, if it saw fit to adopt certain financial reforms, could utilize the labour of this country through the medium, in the first place, of the financial system I visualize, for the purpose of improving the economic position and increasing total production. At present any attempt to increase total production is left almost entirely to private enterprise, and we know that private enterprise in the past has failed to employ our people and make available that purchasing power which is essential to the absorption of the goods which we so abundantly produce. Has any major national action been taken by this Government during the last six years that has had for its objective an increase of the power of the community to produce and distribute essential goods? I challenge honorable senators opposite to point to one instance of such an endeavour. </para>

                        <para>. -  I desire to confine my remarks to the budget-papers which have recently been presented, and which  are closely allied to the Supply Bill. There is an old saying that " government is finance and finance is government ". The presentation of the budget-papers in this chamber gives us an opportunity to discuss the collection of moneys from the taxpayers for which the Government is responsible. To get an index to the financial position of an individual, one naturally goes to his banking account ; to arrive at the financial position of any country we have only to examine its budget-papers. While few, if any, of us are competent to take budget-papers page by page, and with actuarial accuracy sum up the financial position they reveal, all of us can peruse them and form our own conclusions as to whether revenue has been collected and disbursed fairly. The first thing that strikes one in the budget-papers' recently tabled is the immensity of our public debt. In spite of sinking-fund contributions amounting during the last few years to no less than £75,000,000 the public debt of Australia is still increasing to an appalling extent. We can console ourselves, however, with the fact that the budget is a remarkable trading account of our country. If we could express in figures the value of the natural resources of this great country, and the value of its public buildings and works, and put them on the credit side of the ledger, the enormous total would prove that Australia, despite its huge national debt, is still quite solvent. Given the continuance of sound government, such as has been experienced in the last six years, I have no doubt that we can not only maintain our present position, but also improve it considerably. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> in his introductory remarks on the bill now before the Senate, spoke of the favorable position we occupy and of the prosperity we enjoy. In fact the honorable gentleman went so far as to say that the measure of prosperity enjoyed by Australia at the present time is greater than at any other time in its history; and he quoted statistics to support that contention. I do not propose to dispute his figures because I have no doubt he could further substantiate them with figures of employment, banking, trade, &amp;c. ; but I say unhesitatingly that at least one section of the community has enjoyed much less prosperous" conditions than the people of Australia generally, particularly since the financial and economic depression of recent years. A few days ago when the .Senate was discussing the .States' Grants Bill, a good deal was heard about the position of the claimant States. The section to which I refer is composed of the primary producers, particularly in the claimant States. After all, the primary producers are responsible for the prosperity which we enjoy to-day; it has been because of the high prices received for export commodities that national recovery has taken place Those who know the primaryproducers and who move among them, know that very little of the proceeds of their production goes into their own pockets. The greater part of the wealth which they produce is used to make up the leeway in our liabilities incurred during the years of the depression. A continuance of the high export prices that have  been experienced recently is needed for at least three or four years before primary producers generally will be placed in the position which they enjoyed in predepression times. .Some of them, however, will never return to that position, whilst, others have already fallen by the wayside.1 I do not want it to be thought that I am unmindful of what the Government has done for these people; at the same time, I contend that they were entitled to everything they got. It is advisable that the plight of the primary producers should be constantly brought before the public generally, because by a great many people they are regarded merely as hewers of wood and drawers of water. The people of Australia should be brought to ;i realization of the fact that the primary producers are our best money-spinners. In order to show that the Government, has done much for the primary producers - I think it has done more than any other Commonwealth Government - I propose to quote figures from the budget regarding the assistance granted to primary producers. I find on page 72 of the budget papers that the Government has handed to the primary producers of Australia during its period of office £21,636,073. exclusive of £2,500,000 handed to the States for farmers' debt adjustment. Of the former amount £5,554,926, or nearly 25 per cent., was allotted to my own State. For that I am very grateful. </para>

                    <para>I desire now to say a word or two regarding the recent referendum. "When we passed through this Parliament a bill authorizing the taking of a referendum in an effort to protect the primary producers of Australia, it was found that considerable pu'blicity was given to propaganda designed to cover up the real issue or cloud it with as many extraneous subjects as possible. The principal stalking horse employed by the opponents of the proposed amendment was the greed of the Commonwealth Government. The result of the referendum is well known, and it cannot be denied that the primary producers did not receive a fair deal from the people. During the depths of the depression between 1929 and 1934, Australia had uo credit at all on the other side of the world, and it has only been due to the efforts of the primary producers that our credit overseas has been restored. The returns from the sale of our primary produce overseas maintained Australia's solvency, and upheld our prestige in the eyes of the world. During the depression the producers of wool, wheat, meat, dried and canned fruit, butter, and cheese conducted their operations uninterruptedly and disposed of their products overseas, but not at a profit. Primary producers worked, not 40hours a week but very often 120-hours a week, and many have to depend upon the assistance of their wives aud families in order to retain their holdings. But what happened when the electors were asked, by means of a referendum to afford them some protection? Prices had recovered, and many had al most forgotten the depression. An adverse vote was recorded and the primary producers were without any effective security. </para>

                    <para>Having regard to the fact that our secondary industries are effectively safeguarded by means of the customs and excise duties, it is only right that the primary producers also should be afforded protection. On page 25 of the budget papers it is stated that customs and excise duties cost every man, woman and child in Australia £6 10s. or £43,000,000 per annum. That is the price the Australian people are paying for the protection of our secondary industries, and the amount is not decreasing. We have been told that customs duties on certain commodities have been reduced, but the Australian people are now paying practically £2 per annum more in customs and excise duties than they were paying in 1931. </para>

                        McLACHLAN.Yes, but it does not assist them to the extent that it should. An excise duty on flour, costing the people approximately 4s. a head, was said to be an unjust tax. The workers, through the Arbitration Court, and also by means of the tariff, are assured of a reasonable wage, and the primary producer also should receive sufficient to maintain himself and his family in reasonable comfort.
                    </para>
                    <para>We have been assured that the Government intends to introduce a national insurance scheme to assist the unemployed, invalids and the aged, and generally those unable to provide for the time when they will be unable to work; but even that scheme makes no provision for primary producers. A man who works arduously on a farm until he reaches the age when he can no longer work, will have to claim an old age pension because he cannot benefit under a national insurance scheme. I believe in national insurance, but primary producers also should, in common with other sections of the community, be assisted. Why should they be the only persona who have to appeal to the Government as mendicants, particularly when they produce the wealth on which the stability of the country depends? </para>
                    <para>According to the figures disclosed in the budget papers, this Government has proved itself to be a National government. All sections of the community suffered severely during the depression, and appeals were made to governments for assistance. As soon as Australia began to emerge from the depression, governments realized that it was their duty to restore the salaries and wages of public servants to their former level. A few days ago Parliament passed a bill in which provision was made for the restoration of the pension rate to £1 a week. I do not propose to enter into a controversy on pensions at this stage, because, unfortunately, the subject is used unduly for political purposes. But salaries and wages reduced  during  the depression having been restored, pensioners also were entitled to share in the returning prosperity. An aged or invalid person without income must find it difficult to maintain  himself or herself on £1 a week, and pensioners should be paid a sum sufficient to enable them to purchase the necessaries of life. I regret to find that the 'index figure has been removed from the pensions table, because it has been particularly useful in Arbitration Court cases when a living wage has been under consideration; but as the measure passed through both branches of the legislature without demur from those who are closely associated with the pensions problem, perhaps the omission is not of great importance. I agree to a large extent with the alarm expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> in respect of the increased expenditure on pensions. A few days ago I read a carefully calculated actuarial record of the extent to which the Commonwealth is likely to be involved if pensions continue to be paid at the present rate. This document sets out that in 1977 - 40 years hence - the pensions bill of the Commonwealth will be approximately £40,000,000. Despite that fact, I make no apology for assisting to restore the pension to the original rate of 20s. weekly, particularly as I claim to be an advocate of our standard of living. While I believe that every man, woman and child in Australia should be properly fed, clothed and housed, I can not favour a rate of pension lower than that at present paid because in doing so I would be advocating a lower standard of living for these people. I trust that the adoption of a national insurance scheme  will result in a decrease of the expenditure on pensions. </para>
                    <para>The Government has. assisted various industries by the payment of bounties, and, although some have been reduced, such bounties assist not only the industries concerned but also are of benefit in developing primary industries and increasing the sale of our products overseas. If our overseas markets are to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> developed, the Government must cooperate with the exporters aud render every assistance in the selling of primary produce abroad. </para>
                    <para>During the last few years unemployment has been an important feature of our economic life, but on the figures now before us that evil is almost at vanishing point. This- should give governments an opportunity to attend more fully to the employment of youths. Such employment is essential, but the training of youths is of even greater importance, so that they may gradually take the place of skilled tradesmen who drop out of the ranks. It is the duty of all governments to revise their arbitration laws, especially those sections dealing with apprentices. At present , the law provides that a certain proportion of apprentices may be employed, but there should be statutory provision that every industry employing a certain number of hands shall also employ <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> specified number of apprentices. That would soon correct the shortage of skilled labour which prevails to-day. </para>
                    <para>I appreciate the action of the Government in increasing the apportionment to the States from the petrol tax ; South Australia will receive an additional £70,000. Large sums of money are required in that State for roads - not bitumen speedways, but roads to enable producers to transport their produce to the railway. Although my ideas are not in accord with many of those whom I represent, I believe that while the States' share of the  petrol tax is being expended in constructing and maintaining roads, no serious objection to the tax can be offered. I  have  been driving a motor car for 27 or 28 years and I say confidently that it  is  cheaper to-day to run a motor car on  the  good roads that are provided, than  it  was when petrol could be purchased  at.  one half of its present price. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased to see an amount of £36,000 on the Estimates in relation to  the  League of Nations. The benefit of  the  League to the peoples of the world  was  so well put to this chamber some  time  ago by the Leader of the Senate, that  I  need not comment on it. If any one wishes to know why the League of Nations is required, he has only to turn up the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on that occasion to satisfy himself that the establishment of the League was for the benefit of humanity. It has partially failed to live up to the high ideals of its founders, but we must not forget that the old tradition of " Might is Eight " which has been  growing  up for thousands of years cannot be swept away in one decade. The League has been established, and, if  it  went out of existence now, it would  have  to he reconstructed from the foundations, should we ever desire to revive it. It is, in my opinion, the only genuine effort the world has even made to secure collective peace, and I hope it will continue and eventually yield beneficial results. </para>

                        <para>.- I. have listened this afternoon to some interesting speeches, and it is somewhat difficult to make a contribution  that  will break fresh ground. I do not intend to make anything like an election speech, such as I heard from <inline font-style="italic">tha</inline> other side of the chamber earlier today. T regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> the Leader of the official Labour party  in  this chamber, destroyed the effect that his speech might have had on me, by speaking in such a loud tone, and making so much noise, that at times, T was unable to distinguish what he said. He is always anxious to belittle, as far as he possibly can, anything which may be done by his political opponents, who to-day form the Government of the country. I wish he could learn to cultivate a more generous mind and admit that, on the face of them the budget speech and the Estimates prove conclusively that this country has reason to be thankful for the circumstances which brought about the change of government some six years ago. One cannot help realizing the totally different condition  of  affairs to-day as compared with what obtained then. I do not suggest that all the advantages we have gained during the last six years have been due to the administration of the Lyons Government, but I do say that the change of government at that time  was  most opportune, because it brought about overseas almost immediately a restoration of confidence in Australia. Without that confidence on the part of those upon whom we have to depend to a great extent Australia would be in a very bad way indeed. That was the first good result from the change of government. Things have gradually become better, and to-day we have the satisfaction of seeing an Australia practically back to the normal prosperous conditions which obtained prior to 1929. I am not here as a spokesman for the Lyons Administration, but speak as a senator helping to represent a very important portion  of  this vast Commonwealth. I propose later to make some remarks which I hope will be taken by the representatives of the  Government  in this chamber in the most kindly spirit, with a view to enabling that portion of the Commonwealth to become, as it can be, a very great helper to the rest of the nation. </para>

                    <para>I wish to refer to something said a little  while  ago about the enormous public debt that  Ave  in Australia have incurred. Certainly the debt is very great, but I wish the electors of Australia to draw a distinction between the total Australian debt and the actual Commonwealth debt. Time after time, in my peregrinations throughout Australia, I have heard denunciations of the Lyons Government for  allowing  the debt to increase in the way it has, whereas the fact is as disclosed by the budget papers, that the Commonwealth debt has been reduced by £11,000,000 during the last few years. Instead of it being heavier, it is  considerably  lighter than it was. At the  same time, the national debt of the States and the Commonwealth combined has increased by £80,000,000. If honorable senators on the other side of the chamber were candid in this matter, they would endeavour to disabuse the minds of those upon whom they depend for election of the error that most people fall into in that regard. ' The States have their own boat to row. They know probably better than the Commonwealth Government does what is essential to develop their territories, because of their individual State peculiarities, and although the national debt, on paper, seem3 very large, it is possible that an inquiry, which would have to be a lengthy one, to estimate the actual value of the assets of Australia as compared with the national debt of the Commonwealth and States combined, would show a substantial credit balance. </para>

                            <para>- We have a very large debt, but that should give us no cause for worry if we are satisfied that, on the other side of the ledger, we have assets which will more than cover the indebtedness. If it had not been for the borrowing policy of the States of Australia - and remember that the Commonwealth did not enter the field of borrowing to any extent worth mentioning until the great world war began, and then was compelled to do so - practically no development would have occurred in these vast territories. Australia could be developed only by money obtained by loan. We did not have sufficient people here to furnish the necessary revenue for the purpose. We could not borrow locally as the necessary amount of cash was not available in Australia and so we had to rely on borrowing overseas. Who would suggest that the little island State of Tasmania which I represent would have developed as it has, and became an eye-opener to many other portions of the Commonwealth, without a borrowing policy? I do not believe in rash borrowing, but a loan policy may be necessary for the States for many years to come. If the policy is controlled, and a thorough investigation made of the objects on which the money is proposed to be spent, to ensure that expenditure is only on works which will be productive, either indirectly or directly, and for the well being of the Commonwealth, then that borrowing policy is a wise one. </para>

                    <para>I wish to stress here, that the people of Tasmania, especially the fruit growing section, are most grateful to the Commonwealth Parliament and Government for the assistance that has been given over the past three years to Tasmania's greatest primary industry. The fruit-growing industry which, as I said before, represents the finest example of closer settlement to be found in any part of the Common wealth was flourishing, but during the last ten years or more through the development of the same industry in other countries and on the mainland of Australia, it has been seriously handicapped and embarrassed. The markets which were available some years ago in the old country had to bo shared with the produce of other countries, and the fact that we in Australia, have been producing, especially during the last two or three years, considerably greater quantities of apples and pear? than were produced hitherto, has tended to make it more difficult to carry on the industry satisfactorily. For this reason the aid that has been given to it during the last few years has been very welcome. D urine; this last year we expected, particularly as regards Tasmania, that on account of the Coronation celebrations in the United Kingdom, the returns of the industry would be much more satisfactory than they had been in the previous year, but unfortunately these anticipations have not been realized, and the industry to-day finds itself compelled to seek continued assistance from the federal Parliament. Those who have been entrusted with making out the case for the continuation of that assistance have shown very clearly the urgent necessity for at least as much help to be provided this year as was provided last year. Unfortunately, and I use that term advisedly, we find in the proposals for assistance this year, that the bounty has been cut down to <inline font-style="italic">£50,000,</inline> as compared with £85.000 last year. Any one reading the budget papers might conclude that some additional assistance is to be granted owing to the fact that the Government.  lias arranged with the shipping organizations for a reduction of freight by 3d. a case, but I would remind the Ministry that that reduction will not apply till the 1938 season. Consequently, the reduction that has been secured in freight can have no application to the season which has just closed, in respect of which the amount of £50,000 is being provided by the Government. I have here letters which I have received from various sources in Tasmania, one from an organization which practically docs not control the industry, but has been formed for the purpose of helping it, and the other two from persons engaged in the industry as a means of livelihood. These letters show to me conclusively that none of the statements which have been made recently to the Government by delegations which have come from Tasmania to the mainland to plead the cause of the orchardists has been at all exasperated. The figures that have been submitted to me, compiled from statistics available in Tasmania, through the State Fruit Board" of Tasmania, show clearly that the last season, instead of being profitable, has been, for many individuals, disastrous. This year, for the first time, the quota system was established and made operative for the whole of the export season. T understand that the Government had the impression that, because a large quantity of fruit had been sold f.o.b., the industry was not in need of the same amount of assistance this year as formerly. It was easy for the Government, to fall into this error, but I may explain that although a large quantity was sold f.o.b., it was not allowed to be exported because of the quota system. Consequently, growers are just as much in need of assistance this year as ever they were. Let me cite the case of an individual grower in order that the Senate may understand the position. If, for instance, I sold, in January or February, 3.000 cases of apples to an agent for a British buyer at a certain price, and then applied for my quota for export, I would be informed that it would be only 800 cases, so I would have on my hands 2,200 cases which I could not export. Consequently, my only revenue on overseas sales would be the return from the 800 cases allotted to me. Hundreds of growers are in that position this year, and approximately 500,000 cases of apples were withheld from the overseas market. I hope that the Government will realize the need for an investigation of the entire position in order that, by supplementary legislation, the financial aid to be given to the industry this year will he equivalent to that of last year. If this is done, the growers will be able to face the 1938 season with some confidence. Without this assistance, they will find it difficult to carry on, despite the freight reduction of 3d. a case, because this advantage is more than offset by an increase of 100 per cent, in the cost of wrapping paper, an increase of 3£d. each for pine cases, and corresponding increases of other charges which, it is estimated, will cost the industry an additional £78.000 on the export quota alone. The continuance of the industry will be an advantage to the shipping companies interested in this trade, but, if the industry suffers,  a3  it may unless the Government comes to its assistance, there will be fewer overseas vessels calling at Tasmanian ports, and consequent loss of revenue. I urge the Government to do what is possible to help this important industry^ which is the best example of closer settlement in any of the British dominions. If the growers are forced to abandon the industry, at, least 80 per cent, of the land under orchard cultivation will be useless for other purposes. </para>
                    <para>I publicly express my appreciation of the practical interest shown by the Government in a proposal to establish the shale oil industry in Tasmania. I personally thank Ministers for the promptness with which the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> took this matter up when the necessary information was furnished to him on behalf of the Adelaide Oil Exploration Company, which made a request for the introduction, duty free, of essential machinery which has been manufactured recently in the United States of America. If the request had followed the usual course, if departmental inquiries had not been expedited, and if, in addition, the United Kingdom Government had offered opposition, as it was entitled to do, the proposal to establish  this new industry in Tasmania would not have been advanced to its present stage. But, thanks to the active interest of the Minister for Trade and Customs and the compliance of the British Government with a request to waive the right of the United Kingdom manufacturers to insist upon an inquiry as to whether the machinery, estimated to cost £140,000, could be manufactured in the Mother Country, the company is in a position to proceed with the project. Unfortunately, a temporary hitch has occurred in the negotiations with the Tasmanian Government over the leases for certain land, which contain the shale deposits ; but I hope the company and the Government will be able to come together at an early date, and that the negotiations for the establishment of the industry will be completed without loss of time. </para>
                    <para>There has been some severe criticism in this debate of the Government's attitude to the censorship of books introduced into Australia. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> was particularly severe. I assume there is general agreement that some censorship is necessary. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> takes the view that there is no need for censorship, I oan understand his attitude. He told us that books which are published and circulated in Great Britain should be permitted to Australia without censorship. I know that the honorable senator was not referring to indecent literature, but to political works which are printed and have free circulation in the Mother Country. I have taken a good deal of interest in this matter. 1 have read nearly everything I could obtain relating to the objective of the Anti-Censorship League, and I was surprised to discover that many of my friends, very worthy individuals indeed, are members of that body. Knowing them so well, I feel sure that if they had read some of the books which I have seen, they would never have become members of a league which advocates the free admission to Australia of all literature printed and circulated in the United Kingdom. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but in Great Britain I have seen things which I should be very sorry to see in Australia. I know that the honorable senator desires that this kind of literature should have free circulation in Australia, and I can very well understand why the general opinion is that Labour is being allied to the Communists. The fact that he and. his colleagues favour the introduction of this kind of literature without censorship, encourages that belief. </para>

                            <para>- This declaration by the Leader of the Opposition is new and very refreshing, because on other occasions I have heard him denounce in the most scathing language many things that have been done in Great Britain. He has told the Senate about his experiences as a boy in Great Britain, and has denounced some of the laws of the Mother Country. But apparently in regard to censorship he prefers to believe that everything that the Mother Country does is right and proper. The Leader of the Opposition, referring to a speech delivered by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> in Queensland, said that the right honorable gentleman spoke in unduly high terms of the prosperity of that State. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to refer first to a matter mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> this morning. The honorable gentleman said that I, and others, had engaged in a controversy in relation to the broadcasting of speeches by members of Parliament over national stations. If he had read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he would have seen that one of the first things which I did on my arrival in Queensland was to obtain some in formation from the Postmaster-General on the subject. I have had some correspondence with the Prime Minister in relation to the refusal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to broadcast certain speeches in Queensland. I have not altered the views which I first voiced on this subject. The commission ought not to have prevented the broadcasting of the Premier's speech which it had advertised for six weeks previously. It was most unfair that because the chief  speaker  at a communion breakfast at St. Barnabas Church to a number of boys and girls was a member of Parliament, and the Premier of the State, a broadcast of his speech by a national station should have been refused. On that occasion the commission acted unfairly, not only to the Premier of Queensland, hut also to the State. But when it went further and refused to allow the Prime Minister of Australia to speak over the national network -it altogether exceeded its functions. Show week in Queensland is regarded as a most important occasion. Many people gather in Brisbane ' from places far distant ; the Royal National Association spends large sums of money, and the production of both primary and secondary industries is exhibited. The official opening, which is usually performed by the Governor-General, and is attended by the Prime Minister as well as the State' Premier and other Ministers, is an occasion which Queenslanders regard as one of the greatest annual events iri that State. In refusing to allow the Prime Minister of Australia and the Premier of Queensland to speak over the national network, the Broadcasting Commission showed an utter disregard of its responsibility to the public. I go further, and say that the statement which was made later by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moses,</inline> the general manager of the commission, was a studied insult to every man in the public life of this country. It is true that on the following day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moses</inline> modified his remarks ; but even in their modified form they contained all the elements of the statement that he was reported to have made on the previous day. </para>

                            <para>- The general manager of the Broadcasting Commission published a list showing broadcasts made by federal Ministers over a period of eighteen months. Those broadcasts would not average one a week in each State. Only on rare occasions is there a national link-up when the Prime Minister or some other federal Minister speaks over the national network. Consequently, we can assume that for a period of from fifteen to twenty minutes each week a federal Minister has used the national stations to make some announcement of public importance. Yet the lists were published in support of the claim of the general manager of the commission that the national stations had been used too frequently by public men. The list published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moses</inline> includes all the speeches delivered by the Prime Minister of Australia during the British constitutional crisis associated with the abdication of King Edward VIII., and also the whole of the speeches which the commission allowed in connexion with the recent referendum. Consequently, there -could have been only a few other speeches by Ministers broadcast by the national stations. The Prime Minister has no need to apologize for asking the Australian Broadcasting Commission to make available the national stations in order that he might say something of importance to the people of this country. The use of radio is the most modern method, of disseminating news, and prominent men of all nations use this means to make announcements of national importance. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the Leader of the  Opposition  for his courtesy in making available to me a copy of the famous blue book issued on behalf of the Labour party. I confess that, before <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> received a copy of it, I was somewhat envious of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> who appeared to be the only member of the Senate outside the Labour party to have a copy. The book is entitled "Labour's Challenge ; Why  Australia should vote out the Lyons Government." It is " authorized by the Federal Parliamentary Labour party, and published on behalf of the party by John Curtin, Parliament House, Canberra, 20th July, 1937." I studied the booklet to ascertain whether the policy of the Labour party in regard to banking bad changed since the last election, and I found on page 10 the following paragraph : - </para>

                            <para>- Three years ago the Labour party was in favour of the nationalization of all banks, but now it would confine nationalization to the Commonwealth Bank, which is already nationalized. On many occasions the Leader of the Opposition has complained of the tendency to hand over the control of various activities to boards and commissions. He believes that they should be administered directly by the representatives of the people. That, I suppose, is his attitude towards broadcasting as- well as towards banking. </para>

                        <para>What do you mean by giving utterance? - 1 considered Baker had made, according to his report, or taken upon himself to declare the policy of the Labour party as to monetary reform for the next election, and he had no authority to do that. I took it to mean also that he had untruthfully declared that Labour had lamentably failed to grapple with unemployment in Queensland and that the Queensland Government was a failure. </para>

                        <para>Why? - Because the Labour party is quite satisfied that the people of Australia would not agree to a monetary policy being in the hands of politicians; and it has never been the policy of the party. </para>

                            what hu meant by the words " monetary policy ", and

                            gave me the answer that they were self-explanatory. I suggested that they were not self-explanatory to me, but apparently he left it there. Monetary policy is a widely embracing term, is it not? - Yes, and we well appreciate that few people can expound the policy.

                        <para>Just as a matter of curiosity, who would the board of experts be responsible to? - The intention is that a board of experts would control credits. They cannot be dismissed or interfered with in any shape or form by parliamentarians. They will be elected as Supreme Court judges are- </para>

                        <para>Of course the executive appointment then would be the crucial matter? - That is so, hut exact details of the scheme of that kind cannot be expounded, off-hand, but definitely there is no intention that the elected representatives should control. </para>
                        <para>You think that the electors would at once get a scare if they thought that the members of Parliament were going to be directly in control of the finances of the country, as suggested there? - I do not think we would be entitled to any support if we put that forward. </para>

                        <para>. -  At the outset, I should like to make a passing comment on the speech delivered to-day 'by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> The honorable senator made a somewhat outrageous attack on the members of my party in the Senate, saying that the conduct of at least six senators on this side of the House yesterday was unworthy of gentlemen and of nien holding the high position of members of Parliament. Immediately after he had castigated those honorable senators he turned the torrent of his abuse on my defenceless head. All I can say is that those who read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will be able to realize that my comments and conduct were orderly, and that I did not say anything to which the Leader of the Opposition could reasonably take exception. Any one reading my speech will find that it is riddled with interjections by the Leader of the Opposition, and at times there is difficulty in determining who was actually making the speech. I do no know whether the honorable senator had hallucinations during the night, or whether some one outside had made an unwarranted attack upon him, but the charges he levelled against me were quite unworthy of a man occupying the important position of Leader of the Opposition. This morning he commented upon the speech of the Prime Minister in Brisbane, which was repeated, but perhaps more fully, at a meeting of manufacturers in Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister, in speaking of the return to pros perity in Australia, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> cast a reflection upon Queensland where a Labour Government is in power. The Leader of the Opposition said that the figures published by the Queensland Statistician show that the position in Queensland is infinitely better than the Prime Minister stated. If that is so, the general position of the whole Commonwealth is even better than was stated by the Prime Minister. In these circumstances it would have suited the Prime Minister's case had the figures of the Queensland Statistician been given. The right honorable gentleman referred in his Sydney speech to the fact that Australia's internal and external trade has developed wonderfully since the Lyons Government has- been in power, and said that our economic recovery has been almost phenomenal. What are the actual figures? In 192S-29  -  the year preceding the start of the depression - there were 450,482 factory employees; in 1931-32  -  during the height of the depression  -  338,483 ; and in 1935-36- after the depression  -  492,771. In 1936-37, a record of 525,000 was estimated. These figures show that between 1931-32 and 1936-37 the number of factory employees increased by 188,000, and for this wonderful achievement the administration of the Lyons Government is largely responsible. During each week of that five-year period, 723 men and women found employment. . </para>

                    <para>This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> quoted a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crofts,</inline> in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, showing the extent to which the financial and economic position of Australia has improved. Other leading officials in the trade union movement have also said that the betterment of Australia's financial and economic position during the last few years has been phenomenal. I propose now to refer to a report headed " The </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Basic Wage Inquiry 1937. In the matter of an application by Organizations of Employees for an Increase in. the Basic Wage." Honorable senators will recall that, in 1929, the main argument used in support of a reduction of wages was that the economic position of the country rendered a reduction necessary. There must have been something in that contention, because the Labour Government then in power, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline> who knew that pensioners were then getting barely sufficient to provide them with food, clothing and shelter - an aspect that is often overstated by Labour members - reduced pensions as part of an endeavour to secure some form of economic stability. I do not suggest that any other action could have been taken at the time, and perhaps the position was so acute that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was forced to reduce pensions. This document, which refers to reduction of wages, said that the causes responsible for such reduction were the decline of the national income, increasing unemployment, violent fall of export prices, and overseas borrowing, goes on to show that those engaged in primary production are now back to predepression levels. The document is compiled, not by politicians, but by persons acting in a conciliatory capacity between employers and employees. It also states that manufacturing industries have been more than restored to the 1929 level. A supporter of the Government in the House of Representatives, in speaking -of the administration of the Scullin Government, said that even its own supporters - he was referring to the Beasley group - said that that Government was incapable of governing and accordingly voted it out of office. A general election was held, and the people also said that the Scullin Government was incapable of controlling the destinies of this country. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> appeared before the electors, he did not promise them a new Jerusalem or a modern Utopia in which every one would live in perfect happiness, but he said that if he had sufficient support to form a government he would endeavour to get the people back to the position in which they were prior to the depression, that his government would restore confidence and in that way, stabilize finance. </para>

                        <para>Using such methods of calculation as arc available, it may reasonably be inferred that real national income per head is now as great as before the depression. Unemployment has rapidly decreased and, at the moment, with a falling trend, is little, if any, in excess of that of normal years. Export price3 have reached the level of 1928. The Common wealth has adapted itself, mainly by increased manufacture, to the absence of overseas borrowing. </para>

                            <para>- I know that some of the States have expressed the wish to impose customs tariffs of their own. At the beginning of federation Western Australia was under great disabilities, one of which was said to be the abolition of interstate customs duties. Under the Constitution, for the first five years of federation - the first suggestion made was that the period should be 25 years - the Western Australian Government had the right to impose customs duties on goods passing into that_ State but not originally imported from' beyond the Commonwealth, but that power was never exercised, for the simple reason that it would not have been wise, and for the additional reason that the State would, probably, have been not better off. I was about to deal with the extension of existing industries and the establishment of new ones under the regime of the Lyons Government.

                        <para>It is generally acknowledged that the field for the manufacture of new classes of goods in Australia has certain limits, and consequently one turns to the older industries more truly to gauge the effect of the Government's tariff policy. </para>
                        <para>Tlie extensions in those older industries, that is those engaged in the manufacture of classes of goods which were made in Australia prior to 1932, are more significant when viewed from the aspect of increased capital expenditure a.nd employment than are the new industries. </para>
                        <para>The limited survey shows that the capital investment in additional producing units for extending the production' of classes of goods made prior to 1932 is £11,300,000, and that employment, as a result of the installation of the additional units has been given to some 23,000 hands. The annual valna of the output of the additional producing units is £14,115,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish, to recite the actual distribution of those extensions, giving the States and the quantities under the different heads. Again it is pleasing to me to note that New South Wales takes the lead: - </para>
                    <para>The only fault to be found with this splendid development, as the Prime Minister pointed o'ut, is in relation to the incidence of its spread. Although 1 am pleased that New South Wales has been the leading State in these improvements, especially in those two phases - new industries and the extension of new units within existing industries - I believe that one of the great drawbacks in Australia is that we do not distribute the various factories over a greater area. I should like to see them not only in other States, but also in some of the country areas of New South Wales. I should bc glad to see new industries springing up in places like Goulburn and Bathurst, and other towns all over the country. I believe there must be a reorientation of industry in. the Commonwealth.  One vital factor which we have discussed very heatedly in. this chamber is defence, and from that aspect I think it is foolish to have all our eggs in one basket. Some of the industries which are closely allied with defence seem to me to be in very vulnerable spots, although I do not know whether the strategic distribution of military, aerial and naval protection is sufficient to cover them. I should like to see at least some of them placed in the hinterland of the various States. Another reason is that it is wrong to have all our industries in great cities, creating large industrial centres, where people are herded in crowds. My policy would be to get them out into the country, to take our factories out among the gum trees and the rural beauties, and, if necessary, give them rebates to enable their goods to be brought to the coastline or to the cities for consumption. I would put the factories in the large towns of the country, so that we should have big towns growing up all over Australia, and by that means destroy the harmful process of centralization which has been going on. I know that H. G. Wells,- one of the world's greatest thinkers, forecast a great metropolis of the future. I disagree with him there. I want to hasten the process of decentralization; I want to see, not a great metropolis, but the people spread out into the open spaces in God's fresh air, where the green grass . grows and the trees are a glory, in order that they may build up their health, strength, and vitality, instead of following the mistaken idea, adopted in England during the periods of its industrial growth, that all the factories must be put in one area. What was the result of that policy? ]m many places the atmosphere is unsatisfactory and other places suggest a land of stinks. I am not a believer in the great metropolis of the future. On the contrary, I believe in the development of economic units far beyond the crowded metropolitan areas. I believe that wherever God has planned a landscape man should not defile it by unsightly factory buildings. </para>

He lives on the business of persuading the workers that they are being exploited by some one else, and it has been for him a  profi  table occupation hitherto.

I strongly urge the Government to have a representative at that gathering, because of its importance to the future of Australia. Eminent authorities have estimated that, according to the present low rate of natural increase, the population of Australia 40 years hence will be about S.000,000. That suggests an alarming situation. If we are to enjoy security, we must have a flow of migrants to this country instead of away from it.

I would like to believe that the Labour party would also see the wisdom of coming into line, because there is a distinct possibility of inducing a considerable number of very desirable young men and young women from Great Britain as well as from some of the central European countries and North America to make their homes in Australia. I feel sure that if we opened up some of the available land for closer settlement, we could attract from the United States of America a large number of young men who have "had training in afforestation and therefore would be a distinct asset. Our objective should be to attract to Australia, the highest type of youths - young men of Nordic descent - whose forefathers braved the perils ' of the Atlantic and established for themselves homes in the new world. Young men of this type should be welcomed in Australia and encouraged to carve out careers for themselves in this country. </para>

                        also had something to say regarding the insufficiency of the statistical information obtainable. L agree with him that the information is inadequate, and also that there should be a greater uniformity in regard to it. It sometimes happens that information on a certain subject is compiled on a different basis in almost every State. Statistics should be uniform throughout the Commonwealth, and, moreover, it should be possible to obtain from the statisticians much more detailed information on a greater variety of subjects than is now the case. For instance, it would be useless to ask what quantity of flour, sugar, or yeast, &amp;c, is used in the baking trade, or the quantity of bread produced, for the statisticians could not supply the information. I hope that before long there will be a reform of our statistical methods.

I do say, however, that we in this Parliament should be able to obtain information regarding the activities of that body. We should be able to know, for instance, how much it costs to bring to Australia a conductor, singer, or instriunen.tali.st, or a group of instrumentalists from some other country. Such information is of public importance and should be supplied. Moreover, if a visiting conductor submits a report, that report should be made available to the public. Otherwise, of what use is it? The fourth annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission contains the following reference to a competition for Australian composers: - </para><quote>
                        <para>The results of the Australian Broadcasting Commission's 1934-1935 competition for Australian composers were announced during the period under review. The entries submitted were judged in England by a distinguished musical authority, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Ireland, who commented favourably upon much of the work. The competition drew 269 entries, covering a wide range of types of musical compositions - symphonic, choral, brass and military band, chamber music, operetta and vocal and instrumental solos. The commission was widely commended for this encouragement to local composers. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">It is remarkable that the report does not give the name of any of the men and women who won the prizes; it merely says who the judge was. The public is concerned to know, not who judged- the contestants, but who among them were sufficiently brilliant to win prizes. I know some of the successful competitors; but in spite of the fact that they were adjudged, brilliant composers, not one of their compositions has been broadcast by the commission. These brilliant Australians have not had the advantage of having their names brought before the Australian public or at the least written in the records for posterity to read. Their only reward has been the few guineas which they earned as prizes. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- There are;, but it may be better to get an outsider to adjudicate. Even in Australia there are cliques. We sometimes hear of friction in public bodies. The Australian Broadcasting Commission runs on friction; and if its members are not careful, it will die because of friction.- If painters, sculptors or other artists entered a competition, and some of them won prizes, would not their names be made public and kept on public record and their pictures exhibited? It is time that the affairs of the Broadcasting Com mission saw the light of day. Despite all the complaints about the commission, we are told that its chairman is to receive an honorarium of £2,000. There has been much comment on this payment, and we in this Parliament have been wrongly accused of " calling the dogs off ". The accusation is unfounded, but the fact that it is made shows the construction placed on these things by many members of the public. The ban placed by the commission on broadcasts by members of the executive committee of the 150th anniversary celebrations in New South Wales, merely because some of them are also members of Parliament, is most unfair. Some time ago, in referring to the treatment of Australian musicians by the commission, I described its action as a scandal, and said that many wrongs done had not been righted. For saying such things, I am criticized; but although I do not like having to bear the odium, I say these unpleasant things in the interest of the public. </para>

He said that the thing was uncanny, and expressed his amazement at what was being done in Great Britain to develop the science of television. Recently, the cables announced that one of the greatest entrepreneurs in London had installed television in six or eight of his theatres. Here in Australia, nothing has been done in that direction. </para><interjection>

We must remember, however, that the International Labour Organization 'operates under the aegis of the League of Nations, and practically the whole of the countries which first subscribed to the covenant of the League still subscribe to the International Labour Office. I have constantly quoted in this chamber from reports of this organization, particularly the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler,</inline> an Englishman, who is the head of that body. Undoubtedly he is a wonderful man, and the organization which he controls play3 a very important part in the affairs of the world, because it seems likely that the pathway to peace lies in international industrial understanding. </para>

                        said that when he attended the Paris Exposition he was particularly struck by the poor quality of the Australian exhibit. He is an observant young man, and if what he says is correct, that display was a disgrace to this country. Whether exhibits of Australian goods are made in foreign countries, or in any part of the British Empire, we should see . that we are represented adequately and by the best that we produce. This is undoubtedly the best possible form of advertising. Every effort should ha.ve been made to ensure that only our best products were '.exhibited at the Paris Exposition, which was visited by people from all over the globe. We go to a great deal of trouble in displaying Australian goods at agricultural shows in all of the States, and when we exhibit our products in other countries we should see that they are of a quality that will do credit to us.
                    </para><para class="block">Criticism of the sort levelled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scholfield</inline> is all too frequent, and the Government should see that Australian goods exposed in the shop windows of the world should be of the highest grade that this country can produce. </para><para>I have endeavoured to illustrate the wonderful progress which has been made in Australia during the regime of the present Government. I know that people have very poor memories, and that many see only the things that confront them at the moment ; for that reason I propose to give a summary of the tragedy that faced the State of New South Wales under the premiership of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> just before the Lyons Government assumed office. At that time the public debt had increased by £28,000,000 ; the deficit had increased to £14,227,884 and the accumulated deficit totalled over £23,000,000; building values had decreased by over £17,000,000; property sales had decreased 1.v nearly £13,000,000; mortgages had decreased by £16,250,000; the 'unemployed had increased to 200,000; food relief had increased from £3,252,846 to £10,500,000; the interest rate on short term loans had increased to 6 per cent.; the wages tax bad increased from 3d. to ls.; expenditure on 'relief works had dropped to £766,000, a fall of £1,500,000; the loss on Government enterprises amounted to over £9,000; railway losses amounted to £4,564,605; tramway losses "mounted to £290,140; hospitals all over the State were in debt to an amount in excess of £650,000; and no less than 30;000 employees were rationed in the railways service alone. Owing to the sound policy of the Lyons Government in the federal sphere and the Stevens Government in New South Wales, that State has emerged from disaster and chaos to the stable conditions enjoyed before the depression. The percentage of unemployment throughout the Commonwealth is the lowest on record ; our financial position and recovery from the depression is not only a credit to the Commonwealth and the Government, but is also, according to high officials of the British Government, a pattern to the rest of the world. It cannot be denied that the Commonwealth generally is in a ' flourishing condition as a result of the policy of the Lyons Government. Business has increased; primary industries are flourishing, although seasonal conditions have contributed to some extent to their success; secondary industries have gone back to normal; new industries have been established and previously existing industries have been expanded to a remarkable extent. While all of these things have been brought about, the economic power of this country has been developed and cared for by a paternal government, of which we should be proud. We should also be proud of the fact that, in spite of all the difficulties that confronted us, Ave are now laying the foundations of a defence policy that redounds to its credit. We  have also commenced to create the basis  of  internal peace in this country. Already, large sums of money have been expended on investigation of national insurance, and £70,000 has been provide-.! in the budget for the establishment  of  unemployment and health insurance, which will do much to guarantee social security to the people of this country. When we review the progress that has taken place in this country during the last few years, we must remember that this Government was returned to hold the! reins of office for one thing only, namely, to put the country on a solid financial and economic basis. And it has achieved its objective. We make no apology to anybody in the Commonwealth for the policy which we have followed, and which has been so successful. I. am confident: that the people of Australia will remember the tragedy of the past, and, comparing it with tile prosperity of the last few years, will return the present  Government  to  office  in order to ensure the security and future prosperity of this great Common wealth . </para></speech>

                    <para>In passing, I direct attention to the lack of clarity in Labour's defence policy as enunciated by the Leader of the Oppo- sition. The honorable senator indulged in a spate of words, but made the position no clearer than it was after his declaration a few days ago. The honorable senator talked about co-operation with New Zealand and about the immense production that was to be the result of better times in that country, and still he failed to tell us how he proposes to assist our sister dominion in keeping open the trade routes for the conveyance of the produce of the two dominions overseas. </para>
                    <para>The honorable senator also characterized the alliance in this Government of the United Australia and Country parties as an association of strange bedfellows. I remind the honorable senator, however, that the bed-fellows which the Labour party has selected to join it in the election campaign will be found to be wearing spurs. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition and other honorable senators have seen fitto offer some criticism concerning the Broadcasting Commission which was established under a statute of this Parliament, which imposed upon the commission certain obligations.With regard to that, I can say no more than that Parliament has seen fit to delegate to that body the powers it has to-day. The commission may or may not be exercising those powers in accordance with our individual wishes, but, if the Parliament desires to get more control over broadcasting, it can create another body more subservient to the legislature. The commission was appointed to act as an independent body with only a small measure of political control. </para>

                            <para>- I now come to. the criticisms offered by the Leader of the Opposition to-day and on other occasions concerning the personnel of the commission. It is very easy for members of Parliament to make charges concerning the. work, characters, and capabilities of the persons appointed to the commission ; but letme inform the Leader of the Opposition of the type of individuals who constitute that body. The  chairman  of the commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary,</inline> instead of being an accountant in a brewery, as the Leader of the Opposition stated, was at 37 years of age appointed to the position of general manager of Tooth and Company Limited, one of the largest industrial and financial concerns in Sydney. In the course of his career, and by the employment of his leisure time at night for four years, he graduated with first class honours as a Bachelor of Economics at Sydney University. For ten years afterwards, while still discharging responsible duties in his high office with Tooth and Company Limited, he lectured on two and sometimes three nights a week to university students on business organization, to accountancy and other groups on finance and business problems, and to classes of working men and women at the university. . I understand that some of the colleagues of the Leader of the Opposition have studied economics under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> at the Sydney University, and from him have obtained a good deal of valuable knowledge. He did not occupy a junior position in the railway service of New South Wales, but was the Chief Commissioner of Railways in that State during the difficult depression years. </para>

                            <para>- Whether Parliament was right or wrong, it appointed as members of the commission persons who had retired, and who were expected to give only part-time service. He was Chief Commissioner of Railways in New South Wales during the difficult years of the depression, having left his assured and more remunerative position with Tooth and Company Limited, to accept the burden of public service.  His  services were terminated by the Lang Government because he had dismissed, for corruption, a senior officer who had found favour with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> and who was thereupon put into <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. deary's</inline> position. Upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> dismissal from office, a royal commission found the charges against this officer proved, and he was dismissed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> then, at the invitation of the Government, returned for a few months to assist the Government in the reconstruction of the service, and then resigned, not desiring to be associated with the changes which had been made by the Lang Government. That is a brief history of the man who has been traduced by honorable senators opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> repeated a charge that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> was to be paid a gratuity of £2,000 because he was being asked to do certain things for <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> did not make that charge, but I deplore the fact that he should have repeated what has been said in another quarter.I assure honorable senators that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary,</inline> who was supposed to devote only a portion of his time to the work of the commission, for months gave all of his time in establishing an effective organization to control wireless broadcasting throughout Australia. Those responsible for the control of broadcasting are subject to the criticism of musical authorities, who are, perhaps, the most critical of any, and listeners-in who are not more numerous than the diverse opinions they hold concerning the class of programmes that should be broadcast. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> had practically the whole responsibility of establishing this important organization, and those of us who have had commercial experience will realize the magnitude of his task. </para>

                            <para>- I am not arguing that point, but am answering the criticisms levelled at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> for receiving a gratuity which was small considering the service he had rendered. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> has never sought an increase of salary or a gratuity. I endorsed the recommendation to pay him an amount which has been paid, because I do not believe that a man should be sweated. </para>

                            <para>- I know that; but the honorable senator referred to the rumours that are current. I hear all sorts of rumours and criticisms concerning certain responsible officers in my department - I am told of nepotism, favouritism, musicians ignored, somebody refused a job, somebody's daughter unable to get an audition, and so on - and if I took notice of them all I should be a very busy man. From time to time, it is brought under our notice that musical and other artists have not been given an opportunity to display their talent, but as the commission has been appointed to deal with all such matters, it is only right that it should be given a free hand. Most of the criticisms are made by individuals who have a grievance because their talents have not been recognized or some particular class of music is not given sufficient prominence on theprogrammes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> also mentioned the fact that a certain competition had been adjudged overseas. I remember reading a statement to that effect, and at the time I thought how wise it was that that course had been adopted in order to avoid local jealousy. </para>

                        J. McLACHLAN.Possibly the commission did what was right; but I believe that the competitors had greater publicity in Australia than they would have had if their names had been published in the official report of the commission to Parliament. The results have been published throughout Australia. The non-employment of some of the persons interested is a matter for the expert members of the commission.

                    <para>The second member of the commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Brookes, graduated in engineering at the Melbourne University, and also served his country abroad. He rendered distinguished service on the Tariff Board, and also represented the Commonwealth in the United States of America. He has also been associated with many philanthropic works of a public character in Victoria, has a sound judgment, considerable culture and learning, and is equipped in a way that few men are equipped to pass judgment on the highest forms of art brought under his notice. </para>

He has served, as it were, an apprenticeship in a certain class of entertainment. He is a man of undoubted judgment, and possesses considerable ability. He was a member of the House of Representatives for many years. He is a good judge of public taste throughout Australia, and of the class of entertainment listeners require. Possibly his more popular tastes leaven the higher musical culture of the  chairman  and the second commissioner. </para>

I venture to "say that they do not, but they have a degree of culture; they have had careers ; they have character; they have been in touch with the people of this country in so many capacities that the Government, in appointing them, believed that it was getting a combination of talent which would work in the best interests of national broadcasting. </para>

                            <para>- I shall reach <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitto</inline> in a moment. I have been restraining myself for a considerable time concerning the gibes which are being directed by certain people against the members of the commission who, for a start, are underpaid. They are doing a big public service for Australia, dealing with one of the most difficult jobs in the Commonwealth to-day, and doing it with a considerableamount of success, so that the service is improving in the eyes of the public from day to day. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Couchman</inline> has travelled the world at her own expense inquiring into broadcasting. She went to America, Canada and Great Britain, making investigations to help in fulfilling the duties which had been cast upon her by this appointment. I am not going to recount the number of public positions she has held. I come now to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitto.</inline> The honorable senator asked why I did not keep him in the post office. Right gladly would I have kept him there; right gladly would we have availed ourselves of the services of a man who has served this country well, but the law did not allow me to keep him there, because he had reached the age at which he had to retire. But the commission gained an advantage by the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitto.</inline> There must be a close liaison between the officers of the Broadcasting Commission and the Postal Department with regard to their relays, telephone and telegraph trunk-line services, &amp;c. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitto</inline> has brought to bear upon the work of the commission an influence which has made it function more smoothly with the Postal Department than ever it functioned before. "We have had something like co-operation between the two departments. The honorable senator knows that there are certain things for the administration of which the 'post office is responsible and certain other things for which the Broadcasting Commission is responsible. It was very difficult, prior to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitto's</inline> presence on the commission, to arrange those things without friction and without a certain amount of trouble. He is familiar with the practices of the post office; he knows the business from A to Z, and has brought to bear in the commission his knowledge and experience, explaining to the various departmental heads what has to be done in order to bring about certain results,  what notice we must have in the post office in order to make lines available, and so on. Whilst we may differ from the decisions of the Broadcasting Commission, whilst we may think that they have gone too far in this direction or not far enough in another, I do want to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> that there is not one word of justification for the statement he made this morning that the commission was biased against Labour. I am amazed to hear such a statement. I have had complaints the other way, that far too much liberty is allowed to a certain class of broadcasting over the air. </para>

I cannot leap from limb to limb with the nimble agility of the honorable senator's 70 or SO years, and I do not propose to try. What I do propose to do is to deal with these matters in the order in which he has dealt with them. The honorable senator suggested that certain decisions the commission made with regard to the coming elections were not fair. He referred to certain speeches in Brisbane, but I do not think that case indicates any evidence of - a prejudice against Labour, because the Prime Minister was treated in exactly the same way as was the Premier of Queensland. Neither of them was broadcast. In an endeavour to hold the scales evenly between the contending factions which are going out to fight an election in a few weeks, the commission in its wisdom saw fit 'to make certain decisions. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is evading the issue. When a few weeks ago, I was broadcasting on fish and tobacco, I was attacked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> the Leader of the Labour party in the House of Represent:1 fives, for getting an undue advantage in obtaining an opportunity where the Government word went forth. Although there was not one word of politics from one end of those addresses" to the other and although all the credit was given by me to the Australian Parliament, still <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> took exception. I offered to let him  broadcast on fish, flesh or fowl, and I said jocularly that I expected that it would be mostly " foul. " He said " no " and I think there is a good deal of substance in his objection, although personally I did. not see it at first. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> said to the Prime Minister, "What reason is there for McLachlan to talk about tobacco; why does he not let <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dickson</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Prescott</inline> talk?" The answer is that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thompson</inline> is much more learned than I am in fish, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dickson</inline> much more learned than I am about tobacco, but those gentleman are not so well or perhaps not so unfavorably known as 1 am, and they would not be listened to. Our objective was to endeavour to stimulate those two industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> replied "Yes, I agree, but the very fact that you are Postmaster-General in the Lyons Administration is giving your Government at this particular moment an advantage over my party." That is the point that has been influencing the commission. Whatever has been done has not been intended as a humiliation or slight to members of Parliament. The honorable senator can «oe that this problem has grown year by year; he remembers the difficulties that the commisison  had at the time of the last election with three parties - the Country party, the United Australia party and the Labour party - in the field. The leaders of each of those had a broadcast. The honorable senator sees the difficulty that arises tori ay. I think honorable senators should rather bear with this commission which is endeavouring to do a good job of work- and not intending to cast any slur on public men. Because a practice has grown up in our midst of trying to institute a school, of fair play amongst ourselves, the commission, endeavouring to give effect to it, ha3 perhaps, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> said, gone a little too far. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator requires a great deal too much teaching. This matter was brought under the notice of the commission, and that is all I ever attempt to do with regard to this body, which Parliament has made supreme. I think it was on the 2nd September, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> put a number of questions to me here, and the commission's reply was that it was recently decided as a general policy that no talks by parliamentarians, except political speeches for which time would be allotted to the party leaders or their deputies during the forthcoming federal election campaign, would be pre.mitted over the national stations until after the elections. The object of that was to avoid giving an undue advantage to any party or individual candidate. Since that general rule was formulated, the commission  has decided that its main objective could still be achieved - and this is the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> brought out, - by confining the restriction to candidates for the election concerned instead of applying it to all parliamentarians. This later decision of the commission has been conveyed to the executive committee of the anniversary body concerned. </para>

I have seen a little of it from the outside. I have seen some of its troubles; I have them brought to me frequently, but I do beg of honorable senators, in. the interests of this concern, which is likely to grow into a very big thing in the national interests, to give it a chance. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> pointed out, it may be that the conception we have to-day of having part-time people on the commission will ultimately prove to he wrong. It may be that they should be much more highly remunerated and employed as whole-time officers. I am not quarrelling with that at all, but this is what Parliament has done, and it cannot be undone until the time expires. We can then review the whole position. One or two things have been said about the B class stations in the same connexion. </para>

The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Archdale Parkhill),</inline> who represents me in .the House of Representatives, supplied on the 25th August full information to an honorable member who had made allegations similar to those voiced by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He said that there were 90 broadcasting licences in force, and of these 39 are held by companies which have no interest in other stations. Eight stations were owned by individual companies, which were interested in or controlled the activities of two stations in each case. Advertiser Newspapers Limited controls the licence for 5 AD Adelaide, and controls companies holding licences for 5MU Murray Bridge, 5 PI Crystal Brook, and 5SE Mount Gambier. It also holds 112,732 shares out of a total of 365,327 in News Limited, which controls the licence of 2BH Broken Hill.

Therefore, under present conditions, it is impossible for any company to obtain a monopoly of wireless broadcasting without the knowledge of the department, with which power ultimately rests regarding the licensing of stations. </para>

There is in existence a Radio Research Board, consisting of Professor Madsen, a most distinguished scientist of the University of Sydney, Professor Laby of the University of Melbourne, and technical officers of my own department, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> P. Brown. This board is continually watching developments. A considerable sum of money has been made available for radio research in all its branches. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> left for England, I discussed with him this very interesting development. He told -me that when he was abroad he would make investigations and probably would return with some information of value. I have culled from the press of the United Kingdom reports of interviews with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> giving his impressions of the television broadcast in connexion with the Coronation of  His  Majesty the King. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> said - </para>

He expresses the opinion that for commercial purposes in Australia, we shall have to wait a long time before television can be introduced under present known conditions. But with the rapid progress of wireless broadcasting - changes take place from month to month, if not from clay to day - and with improvements in aerials, and technical methods, I doubt that any one is in a position to say definitely what the future holds for us. Wireless broadcasting is one of the most important of Govern men - tal activities, and I plead that it be allowed to function without undue interference or unjust and perhaps uninformed, criticism. In the interests of Australian fair play, and in justice to those men. and that lady who have devoted so much, of their time for comparatively little remuneration to the entertainment and enlightenment of the listening public, I ask honorable senators to give the Broadcasting Commission a reasonable chance to carry on its important work. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- In reply to an interjection which I made when the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> was speaking of invalid and old-age pensions, the honorable gentleman stated that I had said that there were other persons in the community to whom restoration of amounts taken from them in the dark days of the depression, had not been made. I alluded to those persons who, during their working years, had saved money to provide a competency for themselves in their declining years, so that they would not be a burden on the community. Many of them were men and women of advanced years, who were living on incomes of £150 or £200 a year derived from savings accumulated during their working years. They suffered the drastic reduction of 22-J per cent, of their incomes. It was called a voluntary . reduction, but there was a considerable measure of compulsion about it. Those people have been given no relief. Not only did they suffer a reduction of interest, but they were also forced to pay a super income tax, in which no exemptions were allowed. That super tax has now been taken off, but the interest rate has not been restored, and is not likely to be. Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition has no sympathy with these people, notwithstanding that public servants, members of Parliament and other sections of the community who made sacrifices, have had full restoration made to them. </para>

The class on whose behalf I have spoken are much more deserving of consideration than are some pensioners. No one is more favorable than I am to the payment of pensions to deserving people. I admit that it is difficult to distinguish between those who are deserving and those who are not; but I ask the Government to give earnest consideration to my representations on behalf of those people with small incomes who have been so badly treated. </para>

                    <para>For several years we have been told that the income tax returns would be simplified, but if the returns which have had to be filled in by taxpayers lately represent the department's idea of simplicity, I should hate to encounter a form that it regarded as complicated. Every year, more and more information is asked for, thereby increasing the difficulty of filling in the returns. This year an entirely new difficulty "was experienced by persons acting as attorneys for others. I have acted for years as attorney for persons, some of whom are residents of Australia; others are nonresidents. The department refused to accept my signature on the returns as attorney or agent, and insisted on the principals for whom I acted signing the returns in person. In some instances that was practically impossible, and in most cases it served no good purpose because the principals were not as well qualified to certify to the correctness of the returns* as I was. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the sales tax returns also, the department is constantly adding to its requirements. When the department spoke of simplification it evidently had in mind simplification from its own point pf view, not from that of the persons submitting the returns. Sales tax returns are so complicated that many companies and firms have to employ special clerks to make them out. It is bad enough to have to pay the tax, but it is worse when the returns have to be made out on a basis that alters almost every month. </para>
                    <para>In to-day's <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> reference is made to the shortage of steel in Australia. I asked a question on this subject a few days ago, and received the reply that there was no shortage of steel in Australia, and that figures relating to delivery were not a true indication of the position. Only yesterday, a new customs schedule was tabled in the House of Representatives. A glance at it indicates that there has been a shortage of steel, particularly steel for motor car panels, and that the statement that there was difficulty in obtaining supplies was justified. That bears out the complaint by Richards and Company, of Adelaide, that they could not get sufficient panels for their requirements, and that workmen had to be put off. When the complaint was made, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> said that he would have something to say about the companies, .financed by American money, which distributed Chrysler and Dodge cars in Australia. I have made inquiries, and find that not one penny of American money is invested in those companies. It is financed entirely by companies in Australia which sell cars of those makes. They had experienced difficulty in obtaining continuity of supplies of motor car bodies, although chassis were arriving regularly from the United States of America. The selling companies in Australia - companies financed with Australian capital and using Australian labour, decided to take an interest in the body-building company in Adelaide in order to ensure regular supplies of motor car bodies. They were only too willing to use Australian steel if they could obtain it. The latest relaxation in regard to the duty on steel panels suggests that there was something in the contention that it was almost impossible to obtain them. </para>
                    <para>I congratulate the Government on its defence proposals. Honorable senators know that I have never had a high opinion of the League of Nations as an influence in maintening the peace of the world. I regard the British Commonwealth of Nations as the body most likely to protect the British Empire and maintain peace throughout the world. After doing everything possible to bring about disarmament, Great Britain found that it must re-arm in the interests of peace, and it is now spending millions of pounds on re-armament. Australia must follow Great Britain's example in this respect. I join issue with the Labour party regarding the defence of Australia. I do not agree with that party that we should not take action to defend Australia until the enemy has reached our shores. - That is the fatal defect in the Labour party's defence policy. It is far better that an enemy should be kept at a distance than tha t we should, fight him on our own territory. How can we in Australia expect Great Britain to assist in our defence if we say that we will not go to the assistance of the Old Country in time of trouble? Unfortunately, it appears that we have to face the possibility of war sooner or later, and in that event we shall be called on to do our share to protect our part of the Empire. That does not mean that there would be conscription. I believe in the voluntary defence of Australia, but I also believe that it is better to defend this country beyond its shores than to wait for an enemy to land here. </para>
                    <para>The Australian Broadcasting Commission has done excellent work generally, but I do not agree with all that* it has done. Five or six years ago, the commission decided to build a studio, at Hobart. It bought a valuable block of land on which was a residence occupied by a doctor. He and his family were turned out, and the building was demolished. No new building has been erected on the site, which is vacant. It has been said that the commission is waiting for fuller information regarding further improvements of broadcasting studios before erecting a new studio at Hobart, but I doubt this. In addition to buying the block to which I have referred, the commission bought another block on which was an occupied residence. The occupants were turned out and the building has remained empty for several years. The first block purchased is a disgrace to the commission, because it has never even been cleaned up. The commission has displayed no business acumen in its transactions in Hobart. I understand that it has approximately  £93,000  available for building operations, yet, although Hobart has been waiting for years for a new studio, there seems to be no more chance of getting it to-day than there was five or six years ago. What excuse  has the  commission to offer for this delay? Questions have been asked repeatedly in this chamber as to when the new studio will be constructed, but no satisfactory reply has over been given. </para>
                    <para>I congratulate the Government on the provision in the budget for the continuance of the apple and pear bounty. The amount proposed to be made available this year, however, is lower than that provided last year. Although, no doubt, the orchardists will be grateful for the bounty which it is proposed to pay this year, I am of opinion that at a time like this, when costs are rising, the amount should not have been reduced. I suggest that the Government might consider approaching the' shipping companies for a reduction of the freight on apples and pears. Although' a reduction of 3d. is to, be made next year, it must not be forgotten that the companies have increased freight rates generally from Great Britain to Australia by 10 per cent. The excess freight they will thus collect will offset many times over the small reduction of freight on apples and pears shipped from Tasmania. As the steamship companies will benefit from the proposal to reduce light dues by £75,000 next year, the Government might very well approach them for a substantial reduction of the freight on apples and pears shipped overseas. As honorable senators are aware the shipping companies load their freight rates with a surcharge of 18 per cent, for exchange. We all know that not all the money paid in freight in Australia is sent to England; a great part of it is spent in Australia on the purchase of ships' supplies, oil, and- other expenses of running their businesses in Australia, and, therefore, the surcharge is unwarranted, particularly in view of the fact that the freight must be paid before the vessel leaves Australian shores. In the event of fruit arriving at its destination in a bad condition, due to a protracted voyage, no responsibility is accepted by the shipping companies, and no rebate of freight is made. I ask that the apple and pear growers of Tasmania be given an increased direct grant. I strongly urge the Government to endeavour to secure for them a reduction of overseas freights. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Government proposes to make a large sum of money available for the development of the Newnes shale oilfields, yet apparently nothing is being done to assist in the development of the shale oil deposits at Latrobe in Tasmania: Only a little while ago the company proposing to work the shale deposits at Latrobe had considerable difficulty in securing a reduction of duty on the treatment plant necessary to carry on its operations. At first requested concessions were not entertained, but I am glad to say that the Government has since seen the reasonableness of the requests made, and has agreed to permit such machinery to be landed in Tasmania duty free. The company does not ask for direct assistance, either from the State Government or the Commonwealth Government; therefore, everything possible should be done to assist it towards the profitable production of oil which would be so vital to our welfare in time of war.  </para>

                    <para>I am very pleased that the Government is pushing ahead with its proposal to. institute a system of national insurance in this country, and to that end has placed £75,000 on the Estimates for the purpose of defraying the initial expenses of such a scheme. It may be claimed that the Commonwealth is not ready to go on with the proposal, but the longer we put it off, the more acute will the position become. Invalid and old-age pensions this year will cost approximately £16,000,000, a sum in excess of the whole of the direct taxes levied by the Commonwealth. It is evident, therefore, that we shall have to take early steps to inaugurate a system of national insurance on some stable basis. When a concrete proposal is placed before this Parliament, I trust that, in the interests of the whole of Australia, we shall be able to put it into operation with the least possible delay. </para>

                        <para>. -  I was pleased to hear the references made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> to the  taxation laws. I believe that they could bc considerably improved. One improvement which I suggest is that primary producers be assessed on the average income derived during the three previous years. At present a taxpayer with an income from personal exertion of £500 pays a tax of £6 7s. 9d., or a total, over three years, of £19 3s. 3d., whereas an unfortunate pastoralist or agriculturalist who for two years has no income at all, but in the third year derives an income of £1,500, has to pay in tax £29 7s. 6d. for that one year, or £10 more than the total tax paid on a regular income of £500 from personal exertion for three years. I suggest that the Government should give serious consideration to the desirability of permitting primary producers to bo assessed on the average income of the preceding three years. </para>

                        McLachlan made a well-founded appeal on behalf of the primary producers. I endorse every word he said. We hear and read a good deal about the prosperity which is said to have returned to this country. I do not deny that a certain amount of prosperity now exists, but little of it is enjoyed by the primary producers, who produce the real wealth of this country. In saying that, I have no desire to come into conflict with my friend,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline>
                        who is a high protectionist. I fully appreciate the value of secondary industries in this country, but the great bulk of the wealth of Australia is produced by the men engaged in pastoral and agricultural pursuits. That cannot be denied. It has been said that the value of buildings erected in the cities of Australia has increased from £S,000,000 five or six years ago to £40,000,000 this year. I like to see the cities improve and advance and made more beautiful, but I shudder to think what will happen to these buildings if the present policy is pursued. Unless there be prosperity in the outback areas, there can be no assured prosperity in the cities. Therefore, it behoves the Government to draft some long-range policy that will give to the people engaged in the great primary industries of this country some security for the future. It is evident from the enormous building operations carried out in the cities during the last six years that the big financial institu tions have found it more profitable - though it is a short-sighted policy - to finance the erection of urban buildings than to assist those engaged in the primary industries outback. If those who produce the real wealth of the country are neglected the whole country must suffer in consequence. I contend that the financial institutions have not "played the game " during the last six years. Time after time they have refused assistance to men on the land. I speak from experience because I, myself, have been through the mill and know what it is to scratch for a few shillings with which to carry on. Wow that the tide of prosperity has turned I hope that people generally will realize where the real wealth of this country is produced, and that they will be a little more generous in their outlook. The return of prosperity, which is said to he greater now than it has been for many years, immediately creates a desire on the part of the financial institutions to increase rates of interest. Interest rates and exchange rates should be fixed by the Commonwealth Bank, and I hope that the recommendations of the Royal Commission oh Monetary and Banking Reform, in that respect, will be accepted, and that the Government will make a determined effort to see that interest rates are kept as low as possible. The establishment of a long-term mortgage branch of the bank will help primary and secondary industries materially.

                        <para>It is generally admitted, also, by exports in all countries that an adequate defence force depends on a nice balance between and thu co-operation of the navy, the array and the air force. Like many who ate devoid of all military knowledge, Messrs. Curtin and Co. interpret defence' as sitting serenely and waiting to be attacked. They render lip service to the ideal of Imperial co-operation in defence but propose to make Australia's co-operation abortive at the outset by insisting that no Australian troops should be called upon to servo overseas, except by the will of the people. </para>
                        <para>In other words, if New Zealand, South Africa or Singapore are attacked, we must hold a referendum before we decide to send a single platoon to the aid of a sister dominion or another part of the Empire; and the enemy will obligingly inarch at ease until we do so.

                    <para class="block">When the blue book of the Labour party is available to the people of Australia they will realize that in the matter of defence they can expect very little from that party. Until recently I hoped that the three Labour senators in this chamber would be returned after the next general el notion, but having studied that publi- cation in detail I have alteredmy mind. I regret that the Leader of the Opposition should have made a determined attack upon certain honorable senators this morning. It appears to me that he thinks that while he may attack them indiscriminately they should not have the right to criticize him or the policy of his party. I believe that his tongue was working quicker than his brain. I am pleased to learn that the Government proposes to establish munition factories and other essential defence works, and I trust that some of the expenditure in that direction will be incurred in the less populous States of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. It has been suggested, for instance, that the shale deposits in Tasmania should be developed. Further, inquiries should also be made into the possibility of producing power alcohol, which I believe can be undertaken commercially in various parts of Australia, and particularly in Queensland. A partially constructed naval base costing approximately £1,000,000 is lying at Fremantle. There may be good reasons why that work has not been proceeded with, but if such a base is likely to be of value to Australia the work which commenced some years ago should be completed. Further, more adequate provision will have to he made for bases for the storage of fuel oil in Western Australia, which has a tremen dous coastline. Such a base could be established at Albany, which possesses one of the most beautiful natural harbours on the Australian coast, and no expenditure on it would be necessary. Yesterday I asked a question concerning H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> and the Minister in reply said that there was nothing in the suggestion which I had brought under his notice. I direct his attention to the following report in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 7th September - </para>

                        <para>During the debate on the Supply Bill in the Senate this morning. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> referred to a case in which a. claimant had a reversionary interest in an estate. The estate is worth £14,000 and the claimant's share will be £900. Claimant is, however, destitute at present, but notwithstanding this, a pension has been refused. Tlie case is that of Emily J. Stanley., of Wynnum, Queensland, concerning which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> recently made representations to this office.  The claimant is 02 yeans of age. The life tenant is 83 years of age. Allowing for interest at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum, the present value of claimant's reversionary interest (£900) is <inline font-style="italic">£610.</inline> As the limit of property is £400, claimant is disqualified. A reversionary interest in the estate of a deceased person is property for the purposes of the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act, even though it  may  not be returning income to a claimant. In that respect only does it differ from government securities, fixed deposits, bank shares, and the like. An interest in a reversionary estate can be disposed of or can be used as security for a loan. There are firms which transact this class of business. </para>

                    <para>I wish to say something about the many interesting subjects that have been raised  in  this debate. First  of  all, I share the disappointment of other honorable senators at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings'</inline> failure to elaborate the so-called defence policy of the Labour party. I thought that he would seize the opportunity, after the criticism he heard the other day, to tell us what it really means. </para>

                        <para>Labour's defence platform is clear-cut and unequivocal. Broadly, it may be summarized thus : </para>
                        <para>Adequate home defence against possible foreign aggression. </para>
                        <para>No raising of forces for service outside the Commonwealth, or participation or promise of participation in any future overseas war except by decision of the people. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That raising of forces obviously docs not relate to conscription, because, during the Great "War, Australia raised a force of over 300,000 men without conscription. They volunteered for service overseas, and, therefore, the meaning of this must be that even if the citizens of Australia were willing and desirous to take part in an expedition overseas for the defence of Australia, that is outside the 3-mile limit, the honorable senator's party would not allow them to go, until first they had obtained the consent of the people. They could obtain that consent in only one of two ways - either by an election or by a referendum. Surely it is a practical thing to consider how such a policy would operate in these days of sudden warfare, in fact, of aggression without a declaration of war? We have seen several instances of that lately. There  i3  a conflict going on in the East to-day in which, up till now, there has been no declaration of war, although thousands of people have been killed. It is of no use to shut our eyes, to these cruel facts. We have to recognize them. The honorable senator was good enough to let me peruse the proofs of his remarks to-day, as I happened to be absent when he was speaking, and I noticed that he referred to the foundation of the Australian Navy by the Fisher Labour Government. I was the* Minister for Defence in that Government, and I well remember the strenuous work that devolved on me in the preparations that had to be made to obtain and equip the first ships, and raise the necessary crews. The honorable senator says that the policy of the Labour party is the same as that of the Fisher Labour Government. He says that it has not altered, tout the naval defence policy of the Fisher Labour Government made specific provision to enable those ships to go to any part of the world. As the Labour Minister for Defence in 1911, I attended an imperial conference, and, with the authority of the Labour Government, and the consent of the Labour party, I signed an agreement by which - not merely in a time of war. but in a time of emergency - those ships could be placed at the disposal 'of the Admiralty to fee sent anywhere. As a matter of fact, the agreement drawn up by the Fisher Labour Government was operated when the Great War broke out. As soon as the British Government notified the Australian Government that ' a state of emergency had arisen, those ships were at once placed by the Aus-  tralian- Government under the orders of the British Admiralty, and remained under those orders for the whole period of the war. </para>

                        say that the policy of the Labour party of to-day is on' all fours with the policy of the Fisher Labour Government? It differs fundamentally on that very point. It is obvious that, if a policy such as that of Labour at present is to operate, it can only operate when war takes place on our own soil - when the enemy has already landed!. We have only to look at the horrible pictures published recently, showing the wreckage of Chinese towns, to appreciate what might- happen. Does the honorable senator want that sort of thing to take place before the men of Australia can go to the defence of their homes, wives and children?

                        PEARCE.The Leaders of the Labour party have deprecated the value of out Navy, and that is why they are confining themselves to, and finding such great virtue in, an air force. I too have a great belief in what an air force can do. I notice that honorable senators speak of bombers. What are they going to bomb? Bombers are not very ornamental machines, and cannot be there just for ornament. I take it that the Labour party are not going to bomb their own cities, towns or ships. I should imagine that they would want bombers to attack the enemy's ships1 that were approaching our shores'. Are they going to wait until the enemy's ships come inside the three-mile limit?'

                            <para>- They must, under this policy, because although we have enlisted men in the air forces for service outside the Commonwealth, they say in this blue book, "No raising of forces for service outside the Commonwealth."' As soon as ever one of these planes gets outside the three-mile limit, it will be outside the Commonwealth. Therefore, the Labour party is enlisting the air force for service outside the Commonwealth, unless it says that the planes shall not bomb any enemy ship until it comes within the three-mile limit. </para>

When they see those nine-Inch guns, let them ask the officer what their range is, and they will find that, if the bombers are to be of any service at adi, they will have to operate some 20 miles or more from the coast of Australia. </para>

                        PEARCE.The honorable gentleman gave us what he claimed were the views of other dominion leaders, but he stripped them from their context, and so misrepresented them. I am sure he did not accurately state the opinion of a gentleman like General Smuts. That distinguished Empire statesman would be the last to suggest that the best place to fight, an enemy is in one's own territory. Having had .experience of war on his native soil, I am certain that he would prefer to meet an enemy on the borders of Egypt instead of in the Union of South Africa.

                            <para>- But Labour does so differentiate. And  i3  there any reason why Labour should not abhor the Nazi system of government in Germany? That, also, is a dictatorship, and, therefore, is opposed to our parliamentary form of government. Also, can the Leader of the Opposition seriously argue that the Communist Soviet Republic is a democratic system of government? Actually, it is just as absolute a dictatorship as is fascism in Italy or nazi-ism in Germany. This being so, I am wondering why Labour singles out fascism, and remains silent about communism and nazi-ism. </para>

                    <para>The attitude of the Labour party towards fascism reminds me of the story told of a young preacher who had an engagement to preach in a country town of South Australia. In conversation with a wily old gentleman who was one of the church elders, he announced his intention to denounce a number of things that were nice but wrong,, including racing. The local church leader heard him patiently, and then said, " I would not say too much against racing, because racing is so popular in this town." "When the young preacher said he would denounce some other local evil, he again met with the warning not to say too much about it. "But," added the old gentleman, "you will be on safe ground in denouncing the publicans because there are only two of them in this town." Thus it would seem that the Labour party, in declaring its abhorrence of war and fascism, displayed a certain amount of craft, because every one abhors war and comparatively few people in Australia believe in fascism. But again I ask, why is the Labour party silent about communism and nazi-ism? </para>

                        PEARCE.That boast is on a par with the claim  of  the present Labour party that the present Australian Labour party enacted the legislation establishing the Commonwealth Bank and giving to the people  of  this country the invalid and old-age pensions law. To liken the nebulous and equivocal policy of the present Labour party to the policy of the Labour party in 1911 is to suggest, that black is white. Labour's policy in 1911 was so definite that the wayfaring man could understand it. Because it was so positive and definite  the people of Australia entrusted the Labour party of that day with power in this Parliament. I am quite sure that they will not put in power the present Labour party because its alleged policy, as outlined in this blue book, is merely a nebulous and meaningless abstraction.

                    <para>The provision granted by Parliament in June last in Supply Act (No. 1) for 1937-38 covered the first two months of the financial year. The bill now before the Senate provides for an appropriation of £8,323,000 from revenue to cover expenditure for a further four months up to the end of December next. It is based on the appropriations for the last financial year, and the items represent approximately one-third of those appropriations with two exceptions. The first relates to the salaries of the Public Service. As in the case of Supply Act (No. 1) allowance has been made in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act and other regulations to meet increases due to the rise of the cost of living. The second exception relates to the cost of elections, for which it has been found necessary to provide in this hill for the full amount required, namely, £115,000. The amount shown in the bill for ordinary services may be summarized as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>. - In view of the fact that the Estimates are not likely to be before the Senate for several months, can the Minister supply some information regarding several items associated with the meteorological branch, the solar observatory, and the forestry branch? </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As regards the meteorological branch, it appears that several items appear for the first time. It will be within the memory of honorable senators that some years ago it was suggested that some of the State meteorological branches should cease to exist, and that only three should remain, of which the Commonwealth branch should be one. Can the Minister say whether that proposal has gone any further ? It was generally agreed that there was no necessity for so many branches, beyond the fact that no State wished to give up its own meteorological service. Apparently, some members of the central and Victorian staffs have disappeared, for the numbers have been reduced, whereas in other places the members remain substantially the same. </para>
                    <para>Can the Minister supply any information about the meteorological station in the Northern Territory? Is it to be  replaced by an aviation section? That may be an excellent idea, but it represents au increase of  £17,032  a year, and the employment of  51  new officers. An explanation of the intentions of the Government would be appreciated. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will .remember that I have repeatedly urged that the higher personnel of the Solar Observatory should be brought up to establishment. That has not been the case since the commencement of the observatory. The first director, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Duffield,</inline> died during the depression, and his place has not been filled. It is not easy to fill it, because of the special knowledge required. I understand that the observatory has been carried on under the direction of the gentleman who was <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Duffield's</inline> second assistant. Probably he has some assistance; but I do not think that any of the men under him has specialized and skilled knowledge. I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is useless to employ a number of hands at a solar observatory unless there is expert guidance from the top. There must be a first class man at the head of it. The number of the staff remains the same. The amount which was voted for the last year was not reached, and a somewhat similar vote is being made for this year, but the number of temporary and casual employees is increasing. Except for the purpose of providing employment, it is useless to have additional casual and temporary employees. t This is a highly skilled occupation, and there  are few trained people capable of carrying out the duties. Unless there are at the top highly-skilled men, the observatory might as well be closed down, and the special instruments, some of which were given to us, returned to the donors. </para>
                    <para>I should like some information also about the Forestry Branch. There have been suggestions that this branch should be closed, and what one may call petitions and counter-petitions -have been presented. Will the Leader of the Senate be good enough to say where the matter now stands? </para>

                        <para>[30.23]. -  I shall deal first with the Meteorological Branch. The number of permanent positions provided for under the aviation plan has increased from  92  in  1936-37  to  151  in  1937-38.  The list shows one meteorological assistant for Port Darwin, so it is evident that the station there is not being abandoned. The expenditure under aviation last year was  £30,008.  The increase for  1937-38,  which is approximately  £18,500,  is almost entirely due to the creation of the new positions referred to. They have been made by the establishment of aviation meteorological sections to assist in developing and protecting, as far as possible, civil and military aviation activities. The officers are to undergo special training in forecasting and research, and will ultimately be stationed at various aerodromes throughout the Commonwealth. The amount of  £48,500  includes provision for automatic increases, increases under arbitration awards and adjustments under Public Service regulations.. An amount of  £800  has been included for payment to officers on retirement. </para>

Provision for such buildings would be made in a  works bill. The asterisk shown against subdivision B of division 79 indicates that the £94,180 is to be paid to the credit of various trust funds. The money will be used for the purchase of materials, and to meet expenditure incurred in connexion with the process of manufacture.. It will not be used for buildings.

" Recently, I was approached by a very poor woman who, being illiterate and unaware of the requirements of the regulations that application must be made for a maternity allowance within three months of the date of the birth of a child, failed to lodge her application in respect of the birth of one of her children within the prescribed time. Is the provision in the Supply Bill for the payment of maternity allowances under special circumstances inserted to cover cases such as this? I trust that the Leader of the Senate can give me some hope that provision will be made for this unfortunate woman, notwithstanding the fact that her claim for the allowance was not rendered in strict accordance with the law. </para>

                        (New South Wales)  [10.35J. -  Some time ago a break of gauge device registered as Patent No.  19,952  of  1934,  was demonstrated in this building. It was claimed by the inventor that the device would successfully overcome the difficulties associated with the breaks of gauge in the railway system throughout the Commonwealth, and that its use. would save the expenditure of many millions of pounds for the reconstruction of lines in order to secure a uniform gauge throughout. Is the Leader of the Senate able to give honorable senators any information as to what has been done in regard to this device?  1  understand that the inventor was given an undertaking by the Minister for the Interior that an order would be placed for the construction of a demonstration model of full size in order to test its efficacy. Have the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner and his experts found the invention satisfactory or otherwise, and will the Leader of the Senate obtain a report as to the position in regard to it at the present time ?
