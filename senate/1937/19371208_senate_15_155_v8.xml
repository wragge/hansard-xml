                            <para>The substitution of air transport for the carriage of first-class mails, instead of by surface means, is a world-wide development which is taking place over heavily loaded mail routes, and is justifiable because of the saving in time which can beeffected in the delivery of a very large volume of correspondence, so long as the additional cost entailed is of a reasonable amount when compared with the extent of the benefits resulting from the change. </para>

                    <para>It has previously been indicated that policy is being developed to utilize air transportation for the whole of the first-class mails over routes connecting State capitals, and where the volume of correspondence is very heavy. The establishment of the Tasmania air service carrying all first-class mail matter is the first stage in the development of this policy, and it is hoped that, along with other States, Western Australia will benefit similarly by the East-West connexion which will form a part of the general plan. </para>
                    <para>The honorable senators will recognize the impracticability of developing a more extensive network for the carriage of mail without surcharge over long distance routes, where the volume of correspondence to be dealt with is of small dimensions and consequently where the cost would be out of proportion to the extent of the benefit which might result. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is hoped that British and American co-operation in matters of trade will make a substantial contribution to the promotion of world trade generally. It is now intended, primarily, to discuss the Ottawa agreement, revision of which cannot be long delayed. It is necessary for the effective discussion of that agreement that something should be said about the historical background, and the general principles affecting Empire trade and the trade of the world. Before the Ottawa agreement, Empire preference, though existent, was not widely organized on a reciprocal basis. The adoption by Great Britain in 1931 of a- protective tariff system clearly facilitated an Empire reciprocal preferential system. The immediate result was the Ottawa Conference. When it met, trade had fallen away disastrously, and prices of primary products were at a low level. The Empire countries came together to see how far they could protect each other against a world depression, and, after much hard work, the conference succeeded. The greatest immediate material result, from ah Australian point of view, was the United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement of 1932, which is commonly referred to as the Ottawa agreement. It is unnecessary to refer to the details of that agreement, except to say that under it Australian exports obtained substantial preference in the United Kingdom market. At the same time British exports secured systematized advantages in&#34; the Australian market. By the articles of the agreement certain limitations were placed upon Australian tariff autonomy, a result which is, perhaps, the inevitable consequence of every international trade treaty, and must, therefore, not be exaggerated, although its precise nature requires to be examined. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has publicly stated that a revision of . the agreement will shortly be initiated. -The recent commencement, of the AngloAmerican trade negotiations, which may possibly impinge upon, and be affected by, the British preferential system, renders it inevitable that the revision of Ottawa should, to some extent at least, be discussed concurrently with those negotiations. In effect, we are shortly to be called upon to clarify our minds in respect of the complex and interrelated problems of our own national development, Empire preferences, and the revival of world trade. It is difficult to formulate precise plans; negotiations may be hampered by too great definition. Certain &#39; general principles must, however, be borne in mind, in the first place, it will be admitted that our own all-round industrial development is the essential condition, not only of our growth, but also of our existence. The vital problem of populating Australia cannot be solved within a measurable period of time without . migration. The attraction and absorption of migrants will depend essentially upon the increasing growth of Australian industrial activity. Our protective policy, therefore, is not mere proof of either selfishness, or self-sufficiency ; it is the basic condition of our national safety. A great service is done to Great Britain and to the whole British world by making our country strong, well-balanced, and self-reliant. </para>
                    <para>The articles of the Ottawa, agreement will require review in the light of this fundamental principle. It is true that the not unfavorable interpretation of the agreement by the Australian Tariff Board, the sturdy Australianism with which that Board has invariably com ducted its inquiries, and other circumstances, including the exchange position, have prevented some of the articles from having any untoward results. But disputes on interpretation have occurred, and we must endeavour to avoid them in future. It is, for example, difficult as a matter of literal interpretation to see how we can have &#34;protection &#34; by a tariff which, under Article  10,  &#34;shall not exceed such a level as will give United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable competition &#34;. since the object of a protective tariff, when applied to an efficiently conducted industry, is to help that industry by excluding the competition of overseas suppliers. Article  12  also has been criticized on the ground that the tariff will of the Commonwealth Parliament may be subordinated to the decision of an administrative tribunal, and that if such were the case, the sound general principle of independent and expert tariff investigation would be carried beyond the realm of domestic political policy into that  of  international obligation. The whole  of.  the articles will be reconsidered in  the  light of experience and with the aid  of  valuable comments and suggestions made from time to time by interested and  representative  bodies. </para>
                    <para>Apart from the development of our own resources, our policy ha3 been and is one of Empire preference - that is of the essence of Ottawa  -  but we must consider the working of our Empire preferential system in its relation to the genera&#34; prosperity of the world; we must also be prepared to ask ourselves plain questions, and we must not avoid  th,  answering of them. In the Ottawa year. British Empire trade was  27.5  per cent of the total world trade; by  1936,  it  hae  risen to  31  per cent. In the Ottawa year. intra-Empire trade was  25.7  per cent,  oi  the total trade of the British Empire countries; by  3935,  it had risen to  30.4  per cent. In other words, the Empire&#39;s share of the total world trade has increased, and Empire countries have conducted among themselves an increasing share of their total trade. Insofar as this growth is clue to the more rapid economic recovery of the Empire during the  past  few years, and insofar as it demonstrates Empire co-operation and the sense of family partnership, it is a good and satisfying thing. But if it could be shown that Empire trade had grown at the  expense  of world trade, and that Ave  were  pursuing exclusive policies calculated to encourage the growth of economic nationalism in Europe, the immediate statistics would not comfort us for  very  long. </para>
                    <para>The question of our Empire preferential system has been raised because it  may  be that we are reaching a point in economic history when a rigid insistence upon the fullest measure of Empire  preference  may prevent the British countries from taking their proper part in  a  groat movement for world appeasement through the revival of trade. It is, however, impossible to dogmatize; the situation must just be watched and studied, and the Government must be ready to diacuss and consider. We are too conscious  of  the value of the Empire and its preferential system to make even a modification of that system unless we are driven to it by a real prospect of compensating benefit. The British market has been and is our best market, and our policies, both before and after Ottawa, have recognized that fact. But it may be that the United Kingdom and the United States  of  &#34;America in the long run cannot-reach agreement without some modification of dominion preference in the United Kingdom, or United Kingdom preferences in the dominions; it may be that the United States of America would be prepared to facilitate such modification by making concessions in its own market to the dominions. In such an eventuality, the Australian Government might not consider that it, any more than the Government of the United Kingdom, should blindly adhere to the complete sanctity of the preference system as it now stands, but might be willing to discuss the matter as a whole with the other British countries and with the United States of America. </para>
                    <para>It. will be recalled that during the last ten years, Australia&#39;s commodity trade with other Empire countries has shown a passive balance of about &#163;6,000,000 a year, which becomes much larger when the invisible items are considered. Our active balances are largely with foreign countries. Indeed, it is not too much to say that if we apply immediatematerial standards, Australia is at present a greater contributor to Empire trade than a beneficiary from it. That does not mean that complete balance is either necessary or desirable; but it is a factor to be considered when the Ottawa agreement is under review, and the future of world trade is being discussed. </para>
                    <para>Reference has already been made to the necessity for .ill-round industrial development in this country. Our manufactures have been instanced. At this stage, further reference may be made to our primary products. Many millions of pounds have been spent in Australia on water supply schemes, the development of the means of transport, and the provision of facilities for greatly expanded production. For example, the Murray Valley is merely at the beginning of its production of fruit and fat lambs. Where outside of Australia are they to be sold? The United Kingdom has always been Australia&#39;s best market; it has been increasingly so since the Ottawa Conference, and the valuable meat agreements of the last three years. But it is impossible to believe that Great Britain, with all its good-will, can continue indefinitely to absorb more and more, of Australia&#39;s surplus production. We are guilty of no want of appreciation of the Empire spirit and what it has done for us, or of the supreme value of the British market, when we say that this young country, on the threshold of its development must look to the whole world for its markets. That is why the negotiations with the United States of America are approached by us in a helpful spirit. Should the negotiations between Great Britain and the United States of America lead to some effective financial and commercial rapprochement with Germany, so that that country becomes once more a large buyer of the natural products of other countries, the effect on_Aust.ra.lia. because of the intensification of its development, would be remarkable. </para>
                    <para>It is, of course, realized that international negotiations must inevitably involve compromises on everything except national security and vital principles. In order that its consideration of the details may be wise and well-informed, the Government will take every opportunity to consult with representatives of both primary and secondary industries. </para>

                        abandonment of the principle of preference is foreshadowed. The principle is sound; but the interests of the British people as a whole require that it should be our servant, not our master. There will always be room for that kind of preference in trade, which recognizes that all British people are of one family, that their ties are many and varied, that they have instincts and interests in common, and that the growth and safety of each section is of moment to the others. But preferences must not be so rigid that they constitute an. unnecessary challenge to the rest of the world. That does  not  mean that we are to throw down our walls; it simply means that we  must  occasionally be prepared to step over them  to do business with the man on the other side.
                    </para>
                    <para>It is in this spirit that we must approach the delicate negotiation&#39;s of the next few months. Our mutual preferences, though they must continue to be real and substantial, must be sufficiently elastic to permit British people the world over to seize every opportunity to encourage the nations of the world to forget old quarrels, suspicions, fears, and grievances, and come back into that full commercial life which can do so much to turn men&#39;s thoughts into the paths of peace. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know that I have ever felt more sympathy with the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> than I have this afternoon while listening to the statement which he has just read. It was the finest bit of word spinning to which I have ever listened in this chamber. I imagine that an army of legal experts was commissioned to draft a document which would take a quarter of an hour or so to read and would convey nothing definite or worthwhile, or even intelligible, to any person who heard it I have heard debates in this chamber in which it was suggested that  greater safeguards should be employed in order to ensure that regulations or ordinances should be made water-tight, but I guarantee that no lawyer, or body of lawyers, can make the statement read to-day water-tight in any of its numerous sections. I did intend to make notes as the Minister proceeded with his reading, but I got lost in a maze of impossibilities, because he no sooner said one thing than he contradicted it in his next statement. Towards the conclusion of the statement the Minister said something to the effect that Australia must look to the whole world for its markets. Surely he knows that the whole world is becoming more and more contracted so far as its capacity to consume Australian surplus products is concerned. Obviously, each of the countries with which Australia might negotiate for a trade treaty must, because of actions which it is taking to protect its own interests, become less capable of giving any advantage to Australia or to any other contracting party. Consequently the Government which is respon sible for the statement read by the Leader of the Senate this afternoon is merelydoing what it always does, namely, running around the problem and definitely, and I admit adroitly, refusing to face the facts.&#39; I am not convinced that there is any value in the introduction of this document into the Senate this afternoon. Although I am taking part in the discussion of it, I am doing so because the reading of the statement means that the gauntlet has been thrown down and discussion is asked for. As the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber I do not propose to allow any statement made on behalf of the Government, which I think is worthy of notice, to pass without scrutiny. Nevertheless, I believe that the whole discussion, whatever its quality, will be futile. We all know that whatever the Government desires to do with regard to the Ottawa agreement will be done, and that whatever decision it cornea to in relation to any Anglo-American pact will be given effect. All the grandiloquent assurances given in the House of Representatives that any agreement which may tentatively be made cannot be ratified until it has first been submitted to the Parliament amount only to so much political deceit, because we know that when the agreement reaches Parliament, members will be told, as they have been told on other occasions, that they must either accept or reject the agreement, because they cannot amend it. Consequently, I repeat that this discussion is a futility. It is a futility for the further reason that the Cabinet is peculiarly constituted. I am almost disposed to sympathize with the Government in its present predicament. During the last week a valiant attempt has been made to reconcile the discordant elements represented by the different political parties which constitute the , composite Government. </para>

                            <para>- There is no member of the Labour party in the Ministry in Victoria, and the honorable senator knows it. What the Government is attempting in that connexion is absolutely impossible. I am delighted to see it. I extend to the Government my sympathy and hope its political demise will be hastened as the result of the indecent alliance which has been made. When I say &#34; indecent &#34; I mean, of course, politically indecent, but, obviously, the right phrase is &#34; tremendously inconvenient&#34;. Before I proceed further, I should like to know to which Minister I am to direct my remarks, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan represents the Department for External Affairs, which we were old yesterday is always called into consultation before any agreement is finally consummated, SenatorFoll represents the Department of Trade and Customs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald represents the Department of Commerce. In spite of the assurances given in another place, we know that no such thing as harmony exists in the Cabinet. War to the knife is going on to decide whether the Department of Commerce or the Department of Trade and Customs shall be the dominating authority in trade agreements. I extend my sympathy to the Government, but, at the same time, I am delighted, because I know that in building the Cabinet it was merely constructing its own political coffin. It cannot carry on much longer with these disintegrating influences at work. In order to show how disintegrating they are, I suggest that the war now raging on the other side of the chamber as to which Minister I am to address is also being waged as to which Minister is to lead the delegation to London. If <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page is sent, a great deal of difficulty will be caused, and he workers of the nation will be cast into despondency. </para>

I have not had to dig very far back into political history to find something coming from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page which I think is both disturbing and startling. That honorable gentleman, in his policy speech in 1934, when Minister for Commerce, as he is now, said that, in his opinion, it was essential that there should be a drastic reduction of the then existing tariff to the level of 1921-28. An extract from page 111 ofHansard of the 1st November, 1934, little more than three years ago, is as follows :  - </para>

These figures indicate thai the unction of the Leader of the Senate concerning/the trend of trade since the making of the Ottawa agreement is hardly justified.

                    <quote>
                        <para>The main purpose of the Ottawa agreement, as expressed&#39; in its earlier clauses, was an attempt to aid the primary producer. There are few producers in our big staple rural industries of meat butter and wheat who would not care to claim that much more than a very limited objective has been reached in this direction. Yet, in return for these limited benefits, substantial sacrifices have been made by the Australian manufacturer in the whittling down of the protection which he was previously accorded. A brief summary of this  whittling-down  process may be stated as follows : - </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">We know that at such conferences it has been declared repeatedly that the Ottawa agreement, instead of being of benefit, has been disastrous to primary industries. There must be a continual whittling down of the preferences which Australian industries now enjoy. For example, how is the Tariff&#39; Board to decide what industries are likely to become stable and economical ? Only time can prove whether industries &#34; are reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success&#34;; yet the Tariff Board has, willy nilly, to decide this important point. The importers of British goods appear before the Tariff Board, and ask for reduced duties in favour of manufacturers in the United Kingdom. It is impossible for the Tariff Board to determine whether any Australian industry in its initial stages is likely to become a stable undertaking. The quotation continues- </para>

                    <para>When a trade diversion policywas before this Parliament, we were told that its adoption would enable adverse trade balances with other countries to be adjusted. We know what happened. In its desire to adjust the trade with Japan, the Government seriously affected the wool-growing industry, and those dependent upon it. Yesterday, the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs read a statement concerning licences, for the importation in respect of motor car chassis, which, owing to the rate at which it was read, I could not understand. I have since had an opportunity to peruse his remarks, and I maintain that, no intelligent man can understand it, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> might. Yesterday, the honorable member  for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> made a serious charge in respect of moneys which should have been placed in a trust fund and asked the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> what he proposed to do in the matter. If I made the charge made by that honorable member, who was once the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, and it is well founded, my seat in this chamber would he declared vacant, and I would be serving a term of imprisonment in one of His Majesty&#39;s gaols. </para>

                            <para>- It is not. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett was a Minister the Government decided to impose a special tax of .7d. per lb. on imported motor chassis which represented between &#163;5 and &#163;7 on each car, the proceeds of which were to be placed in a trust fund for the purpose of aiding the establishment in Australia of the manufacture of motor vehicles. Instead of the money being placed to the credit of such a fund it was put into Consolidated Revenue, and enabled the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> to career around the country, attending banquets, and declaring with pride that the &#39;Government had shown a surplus. About &#163;400,000 has been collected by means of this tax, which has gone into Consolidated Revenue. What would happen if the Tariff Board recommended that the project be abandoned ? That is a conundrum which I am quite incapable of answering. I ask the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Allan MacDonald)</inline> to ascertain from Cabinet how it should he answered. </para>

The Commonwealth has the right to ask the Government of the United Kingdom not to conclude any such pact until Australia has been consulted. I believe that the Australian Government has already been consulted - that negotiations have been conducted by cable and otherwise on this very matter.

I object that we, as intelligent legislators, are asked to take part in this debate without having been taken into the confidence of the Government. With all due respect to the Leader of the Senate, I say that his statement this afternoon was such a jumble of words, vague and meaningless, that it was not worthy of the Government or himself, and it was an insult to the collective intelligence of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition commenced his speech by suggesting the uselessness of bringing this matter before the Senate at this stage. He then proceeded to say that if the Government went on with this pact and committed itself to a renewal of the Ottawa agreement, Parliament would be told that it could accept or reject those arrangements, but in no circumstances could it amend them. If such be the case, it is a sound reason why this matter should come before the Senate at this stage and why honorable senators should be given the opportunity to voice their opinions for the guidance of the Government before it enters into any pact or agreement. I submit that the Government would have been absolutely recreant to its duty had it not given this chamber an opportunity to discuss this matter. In fact, the Senate would have been belittled in the eyes of Australians if, after giving to members of the House of Representatives an opportunity to debate this matter for a full day, the Government had declined to give to this chamber a similar opportunity, particularly in view of the fact that this matter is one of the most important proposals that has yet been brought before this Parliament. I am not sure whether the </para>

                    <para class="block">Government will, as the Leader of the Opposition suggests, be in a position to say to this Parliament later that it must accept willy-nilly any pact or agreement or reject the arrangement in its entirety, but I do not believe that that will be the case. The Government has acted properly in giving honorable senators an opportunity, before such a difficulty arises, to say at least : &#34; Well, in. certain ways we believe in this proposed agreement, but do not make any serious mistakes in your negotiations; if you can take notice of what we say, do not place us in the position of having to vote against the proposals which will result from your negotiations on the other side of the world.&#34; It seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition has very little confidence in the strength of his cohort, which will be in this chamber after June next. I believe that the honorable senator is viewing this matter in the light of the strength of the Opposition in this chamber at the present time. I imagine, however, that any agreement which may be entered into by the Government will not be consummated, or will not be placed before Parliament for its consideration until after next June. </para>

I say, advisedly, that this is one of the most important matters with which the Australian Parliament has been called upon to deal. To some extent, I believe, with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> that the statement made by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> this afternoon, although couched in attractive language, meant very little. </para>

                    <para class="block">Apparently it -was meant to re-assure honorable senators, but it was interspersed with so. many qualifications that almost any one would find it easy to point out that it did not actually contain any definite promises. </para>
                    <para>Before proceeding to deal in detail with the proposed Anglo-American pact, and the proposed amendments of the Ottawa agreement, I suggest that it is absolutely a waste of time to rely on figures in order to determine the effect of the Ottawa agreement on our trade from 1932 to 1937. That agreement has been in operation during a period of extraordinary economic stress throughout the world. It came into being when the depression was at its nadir; without it, Australia would have returned to normal. The fact that it may not have done any harm to the secondary industries means nothing, because the factories in all countries, with the possible exception of Japan, have been during the latter part of that period in full operation. Their own markets have been full, with the result that they have not attempted in any way to flood Australia with articles which, in ordinary circumstances, they might have attempted to send in. But, if present circumstances on the other side of the world disappear,&#39; as they must within a very short period, when the armaments flood has run its full course, and conditions in those countries return to normal, engineering and other factories will find their output decreasing on account of the completion of the armaments programmes, and they will look around for fresh markets. The circumstances then will not be similar to those which we have experienced during the last few years. We must, therefore, view with a great measure of reservation, the facts which it is suggested that trade figures in relation to the Ottawa agreement prove. In view of all the circumstances which I have mentioned they prove very little indeed. In respect of these negotiations, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> on behalf of the Government, has given assurances that both our primary and secondary industries will be consulted in order that their interests may not be endangered. I believe that he and his Ministers are sincere in that respect, and that even members of the Country party have assumed a new soul in regard to this matter. Perhaps I should not go to that extreme, but I suggest that members of the Country party realize that the welfare of the secondary industries of Australia is essential to the prosperity of this country. That change of outlook on their part has been brought about, I believe, by the large amount of employment given by secondary industries. They appreciate that those industries, almost, .if not entirely, solved the problem of unemployment during the depression years, and, at the same time, provided primary producers with a profitable local market. From conversations which I have had with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> and other members of his party  I am confirmed in this view; I believe that these men are beginning to realize that the primary industries are not the only pebbles on the economic beach in Australia, and that it is essential that both sections of industry should be encouraged side by side. I am glad to say that during recent years such a policy has proved its worth by establishing a well-balanced economic system in Australia, and that the view is now held by both sections represented in the Government that it is only through such a policy that we can recover prosperity, and give increased employment. The Prime Minister .has assured us -that the interests of the secondary industries will be consulted before the delegation goes abroad. I hope that that assurance will&#34; be very liberally interpreted. I disagree with the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition that Australia has been committed in any way in respect of any Anglo-American pact. I know that some criticism has been voiced in this respect, but I cannot imagine for one moment that it is justified. It would be absolutely inconsistent with this Government&#39;s policy to enter into any agreement which involved our adherence at all costs to anything decided upon by Great Britain and the&#39; United States of America. It would not acquiesce merely by saying, &#34; Whatever you do, Australia will follow you.&#34; I hope that the Prime Minister will place a liberal interpretation on his undertaking to consult those engaged in both primary and secondary industries before the delegation leaves Australia. In this matter, I want to leave no room for misunderstanding. Last week representatives of manufacturers from all over Australia were in Canberra in order to present certain resolutions to the Prime Minister. </para>

The presence of these gentlemen in Canberra will enable the Prime Minister to say later, if he so desires, that he did consult with the representatives of both primary and secondary industries during the second week of December, 1937, and that by so doing he had fulfilled his promise. I do not think that the Prime Minister will take that stand; but the way is open for such a. claim.

                            <para>- No. One of my complaints is that the Government did not voluntarily present to the Senate the statement which its Leader read to-day; it acted, only as the result of what happened here yesterday. After all. there is not a great deal of difference between the desires of the primary producer and those engaged in secondary industries so far as the Ottawa agreement is concerned. Both interests desire an alteration of the verbiage of the agreement, particularly the words &#34; reasonable competition &#34;. Those words have caused, and are still causing a good deal of trouble. The position should be made clear. Had the article containing those words been administered according to its literal meaning, at least 30 per cent, of the factories of Australia would have had to close down. The primary producing interests also have cause to complain about the interpretation placed on those words. In this connexion, the Tariff Board is to be commended, for it has practically said that the words do not mean what they say, and have to be interpreted in the light of attendant circumstances. There have been charges of bad faith on both sides. In any new agreement which may be entered into, there should be no room for such charges. Nothing causes bad feeling between friends so quickly as does a loose business arrangement. Article 10 of the agreement, which provides that manufacturers in the United Kingdom are to be given equal opportunities for reasonable competition with manufacturers in Australia, means, if it means anything at all, that 50 per cent, of the goods of any particular line that are consumed in Australia shall be manufactured in Australian factories, and the balance in Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- I am advising the Government against the inclusion of any such provision; I am telling it what the secondary industries of this country, desire in this connexion. The alteration of the verbiage will probably not alter the practice of the Tariff Board and of Parliament in regard to the agreement, but it will leave no room for any misunderstanding in the future. I hope that full effect, will be given to the Prime Minister&#39;s promise before he goes away. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. But I do know of a gentleman whose leadership of the delegation would be acceptable to those engaged in secondary industries. I could, in fact, mention the names of two or three men who would make acceptable leaders ; and I could also mention others who would not be acceptable. The Government knows as well as I do the men who would not be acceptable to the secondary industries. I trust that it will not outrage public opinion in this matter by sending as leader of the delegation a man who is suspect as to the value he places on Australian secondary industries. </para>

                    <para>The Commerce Department is supposed to negotiate and administer trade treaties; but, whilst I do not undervalue its achievements, I point out that ever since its establishment its function has been to deal solely with primary products. Obviously, therefore, the Minister in charge of that department is not the man to lead a delegation which will be authorised to negotiate treaties affecting Australian secondary industries. </para>

                            <para>- It was not until 1.935-36 that wool prices showed any considerable advance; and those prices continued for only  one year. Secondary industries, however, continued to put more and more men into jobs. For some years wool prices fluctuated, but, in 1937,  they  again rose, as did also the prices of other primary products, including butter, wheat, and metals. I emphasize that right from the beginning of the depression in 1931-32, the number of men employed, in Australian factories, as well as the output of those factories, increased, and that the improvement was mot due to better prices for primary products. </para>

                            <para>- Not to any great extent, but there is opportunity for expansion. Australia already supplies practically all the iron and steel requirements of New Zealand, it sends large quantities of manufactured goods to South Africa, and is in a position to export agricultural machinery. At the moment, Australia could sell galvanized iron in a number of countries at below world prices, but as the output is not sufficient for Australian requirements, the export trade has not been developed. However, when Lysaght&#39;s new &#163;1,000,000 factory at Port Kembla is finished an export trade in galvanized iron should commence. On previous occasions I have quoted figures to show that the prices of pig iron, steel bars, and other steel products, are at least 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, cheaper in Australia than in Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- About 5 per cent. I remind the honorable senator of my earlier statement that trade figures for the last five or six years must be accepted with caution, because they do not prove what they set out to prove. I do not want to labour this matter, but I was glad to hear the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> acknowledge that certain limitations had been placed on tariff autonomy. That is what some of us in this chamber have said on many occasions. Since, admittedly, there has been a limitation of tariff autonomy, it is evident that Parliament is not supreme in these matters. When tariff schedules have been under discussion the Government has claimed that in such matters Parliament could do what it liked; but this statement admits that the Parliament has been subject to limitations. The words used are very nice, although perhaps they may not sound impressive, but their actual meaning is that to a certain extent Parliament has handed to an outside body its right to be the final arbiter in tariff matters. . The secondary industries of Australia, and I believe the people generally, will be quite content with two or three rather small amendments- of the Ottawa agreement, and I do not think that there will be any difficulty in getting them. At the same time, the task is going to be bigger than it was before, because, instead of the parties to the agreement being Great Britain and the dominions, including Australia, the United States of America has in some way come into the picture, and we may be asked to make sacrifices which we may not regard as in our best interests. </para>

I have, always thought the licensing system a very bad one. I regarded it as a mistake at the time, but the Government went on with it, and certain results have followed, one of which is that extra capital has been employed or is in process of being employed in Australia-. Something over &#163;3,000.000 has been invested in new enterprises or in expanding old enterprises as a consequence of the Government&#39;s trade diversion policy, &#39;and the prevention of products of the United States of A&#39;merica from  entering  Australia. I do not know the exact effect of the statement made by the Minister for Trade and Customs in the House of Representatives yesterday with regard to the alteration of the Government&#39;s policy towards America, but, whatever is done, the Government must be most careful that the &#163;3,000,000 of new capital invested in our industries as a result of trade diversion is not thrown into the gutter. </para>

                            <para>- I was not looking at the matter so much from the point of view of its effect upon the primary producer. As I said, the policy of issuing licences is a great mistake from many points of view. It is hard to get officials in every State to administer it in the same manne&#93;-, and it would be easy for any unscrupulous person to manipulate it 10 his own advantage. For half a dozen other reasons the policy is a bad one in essence, and should not be resorted to unless no other means of averting an evil can be found. It must also bc remembered that the trade diversion policy had the effect of giving other countries the trade which America had with Australia. According to the answers given to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline> Henry Gullett, Australia gained ?764,000 worth of the trade diverted from America, the United Kingdom ?802,000 worth,&#39; Canada ?169,000 worth, Germany ?225,000 worth, and Belgium. ?88.000 worth, whilst France, Japan and other foreign countries shared the  balance.  As regards the motor, car business, although the increase of imports from the United Kingdom into Australia was ?638,000 about ?400,000 worth of it was due to our trade diversion policy, which kept out many American cars. For all these reasons, the Government, in altering that policy, is faced with something which I hope it has considered from all aspects, and to the fullest possible extent. It must remember first that the trade has been diverted to a certain extent to Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Belgium, and other countries, as well as Australia; and, secondly, that in Australia it has brought about the expenditure of over ?3,000,000 in establishing new enterprises or extending old ones. All that capital would be lost if steps were not taken to preserve the protection afforded to the industries in which it is invested. I think the matter of economic internationalism, if honorable senators prefer that term, is being worked to death. There seems to be an idea, that a freetrade policy all over the world would lead to a better understanding between nations, and ultimately to peace. My belief is that, if such a thing came about, it would lead to the biggest economic fights thai the world has ever seen. A low-wage country like Japan, especially with its new acquisition .of Chinese territory, would absolutely flood us out. The people of Great Britain and Australia could no; afford to allow such goods to enter on a freetrade basis. There is too much high  falutin&#39;  about economic internationalism, and too much blame is put upon economic nationalism. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Geoffrey</inline> Clarke, in his presidential address to the British Chambers Of Commerce at Manchester, said - </para>

These are. noble sentiments, but let us be honest with ourselves. Do wo really desire a general reduction of tariffs or an  abolition  of quotas? Is it not to tariffs mid quotas that we owe much of our present industrial prosperity? Would manufacturers welcome their abolition? World-wide agreement on this profound question is a magnificent conception but the successive failures of world economic conferences suggest that success will not attend efforts on such a basis, and the only course now open to Great Britain, as thu biggest importer in the world, is bilateral  agreement  by which she must insist on the right to sell to countries from which she purchases. </para>

                    <para>It appears, therefore, that the people of Great Britain are gradually catching up to the conception of economic nationalism as understood in Australia. We believe here in a balanced economy, with secondary industries providing work for the toilet&#39;s of Australia, helping to create the wealth that keeps industry going, and maintaining the standard of living. I hope first, that the Government will make no mistake as to the quality of the leader and personnel of the delegation to be sent to the other side of the world; secondly, that, remembering that our secondary industries desire to help the primary industries in every possible way, it will so qualify the wording of the Ottawa agreement that there will be 11 0 misunderstanding between parties in Australia, or between Australia and Great Britain; And thirdly, that in any negotiations that may take place between the delegates representing the three governments the greatest care will be taken to see that the welfare of the secondary and&#39; primary industries, as well as the interests of the workers in Australia, have first consideration. We believe that the interests of Australia should be the chief concern of the Australian delegation, and that the interests of Great Britain and the other dominions should receive attention in their natural order. After these considerations are met, we shall approve of any arrangement to deal, on the easiest possible terms, with other friendly countries. </para>

                        <para>. - I welcome this opportunity to make a few observations concerning the proposed revision of the Ottawa agreement. There is no doubt that the Government&#39;s decision to submit the agreement to a conference for revision has caused alarm to those engaged in our primary industries, and, after listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> this afternoon, we now know that concern also is felt in our secondary industries. In these days of economic nationalism, there is always the fear that any revision of existing trade agreements will further restrict the markets open to our primary producers. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>My principal object in speaking this afternoon is to express the hope that in any revision of the Ottawa agreement, the valuable preference enjoyed by Australian producers in the British market will be retained, because that is our best overseas market. I hope, also, that there will be no curtailment of the very limited opportunities given to British industries in Australia. If our export industries are to be maintained in a healthy condition, and expanded, the United Kingdom market must be retained. </para>
                    <para>I was interested in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> That honorable senator gave me the impression that, if he had his way, those articles in the Ottawa agreement which give to British industries reasonable opportunity to compete in the Australian market would be eliminated, although I note that he is in favour, as I am, of retaining for Australian primary producers the British market. Our friends in the Labour movement will have to realize that we cannot indefinitely continue to sell to other countries, including Great Britain, unless we are prepared to buy from them a reasonable quantity of their products. I believe in two-way trade. </para>
                    <para>I would not approve of a condition of affairs under which we should be sending from our shores ships filled with Australian primary products and expecting them to return in ballast. I desire full reciprocal trade with Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- We have heard a good deal about the need for the encouragement of Australia&#39;s secondary industries. All my life I have seen them given encouragement in the form of protective duties and other aids. They have been afforded more than reasonable protection. I do not forget that some of our secondary industries have developed into powerful mono;  polies,  and I believe that the measure of competition provided under the Ottawa agreement can do them no harm. At all events, I stand for the continuance of the principles in the existing agreement, in order to ensure ready access to British markets for our surplus primary production, and I am prepared to take a fair proportion of British manufactures in exchange. The Country party stands solidly for the principle of Empire preference, and desires also to increase the opportunities for marketing our products in the United Kingdom. </para>

                    <para>The present rate of exchange between Great Britain and Australia enabled our primary producers to survive during the depression, with its accompanying low prices in overseas markets. I do not know whether exchange will be considered at the forthcoming conference in London, because the rate is determined by the Commonwealth Bank, although I remember that the Bank of New South Wales some years ago gave a useful lead in this matter; but I wish to make it clear to whoever leads the Australian delegation that it is the earnest wish of the Country party that the present rate of exchange shall be retained. This is of vital importance to our primary producers. </para>
                    <para>I was amazed at some of the criticism directed against the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> particularly in connexion with the suggestion that he may lead the Australian delegation. I understand why the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and his supporters raised  this issue. Their wish is to create discord between the parties represented in the composite Government; but I cannot understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> should also offer objection. If hip remarks under this head were directed against <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, they were entirely unwarranted, because that gentleman is one of the trusted leaders of the composite Government. </para>

                            <para>- No; the definite purpose of the conference is to strengthen and broaden the commercial ties between the three governments to be represented at it, and to develop Empire preferential trade, with the introduction of the United States of America to the agreement. </para>

                    <para class="block">It has been objected that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page is a low tariffist  and therefore should not lead the delegation. I have never held that view of his fiscal policy. He does not share the very low tariff views of the Western Australian Country party. For the last five and a half years as a senior member of the composite government, he has held the balance evenly between our primary and secondary industries. During the last! three years the Country party has made substantial progress in this Parliament. Wherever 1 look I see the Country party gaining fresh laurels in the form of rural constituencies in the various Parliaments. In this Parliament, for instance, we now have Country party men representing Darling Downs in Queensland, Bendigo in Victoria, and Grey, in South Australia. </para>
                    <para>Although personally I have no reason to complain of the existing system, T am hoping that one day we shall see adopted in connexion with  the elections for the Senate, a system under which Country party electors will return their own candidates on their own votes. The Minister for Commerce is the natural and proper leader for this delegation. </para>
                    <para>I hope it will be possible for the Government to invite representatives of our great primary industries to take part in the forthcoming conference, if not as delegates, perhaps in an advisory capacity. The selection of men with a .complete knowledge of our wool, wheat, meat, butter and fruit-producing industries, would greatly strengthen the hands of the Australian delegation. It should easily be possible to draw from the ranks of our co-operative associations, two or three gentlemen with the requisite knowledge of these industries. The welfare of all sections of Australian industries, as well as the interests of the people generally, will, I hope, be watched carefully when the agreement is being revised or, as I prefer to think, renewed. </para>
                    <para>The agreement has been of very great value to the Australian export industries and I hope that the principle of Empire preferential trade will be preserved and extended. I was pleased to read in the report of the debate last night in the House of Representatives, that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> declared that the Government would not drop the present substance of the Ottawa agreement for the shadow. I take it this means that the Government will not agree to any lessening of the advantages which the agreement has given to Australian primary producers, and I feel sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page leads the delegation the interests of both primary and secondary industries will be carefully safeguarded. </para>

                        <para>. - As the Senate has already had numerous opportunities to discuss, in general terms, the Ottawa agreement, it is not necessary that I should now occupy the time of this chamber for very long. The views of honorable senators are fairly well known. I cannot say that I was very much surprised by anything contained in the speech of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> or in that of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> Nor was I surprised at the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> I regret that the honorable gentleman is not at the moment in the chamber. I have always thought, and have endeavoured to act accordingly, that when one expresses one&#39;s views, it is desirable to listen to one or two succeeding speakers in order to ascertain what they have to say by way of reply. </para>

                    <para>Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> expressed some concern at the possibility of the Minister for External Affairs &#34;buttingm&#34; T  to the province of the Minister for Commerce or the Minister for Trade and Customs. The honorable senator was afraid, that the Minister for External Affairs might have some share in framing a trade treaty, but to-day he has altered his ground a good deal.  His  chief anxiety now seems to be to prevent certain Ministers, who do not hold the opinions he holds, from representing Australia at the conference. In other words, he favours the selection of Ministers favorable to his view, which is purely the view of those engaged in secondary production. I do not think that I have ever .heard the honorable senator utter a single word to indicate that he appreciates the difficulties of the primary producers. He has invariably ignored the fact that over-emphasis on the secondary industries constitutes one of the greatest dangers to the primary industries in Australia to-day. </para>
                    <para class="block">I agree to some extent with the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that the proper persons to make a commercial treaty would appear to be the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> and, I think, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White).</inline> They are Ministers who ought to have at their disposal all the information required. I maintain that it is not desirable for certain Ministers to be constantly running to and from the other side of the world. I am in favour of occasional visits being made by prominent Ministers-, but they have their duties in Australia to perform, and it is inadvisable for them to travel to and from Great Britain practically every year. Munsters who have been placed in charge of the Trade and Commerce Departments to carry out responsible work should conduct negotiations in respect of trade treaties. </para>

I was about to say that if no gentlemen representing special interests were in attendance, no great harm, would be donn. At Ottawa, there was a large and distinguished delegation of persons representing different industries, who went there largely to look after their own interests and to counteract the actions of others. I do not think that the forthcoming conference would be improved by the presence of representatives of any special interests. Their views are definitely known to the Ministers before they leave Australia. I say with all respect that, in the long run, such persons must occupy a good deal of Ministers&#39; time without serving any useful purpose. </para>

                            <para>- Surely that is not so. Australia was founded about 150 years ago, and I think I am right in saying that when I was a young man there were approximately 5,000,000 persons in Australia, and that during the last half-century, the population of Australia has increased by only one-half. Moreover, .in the early days, one of the most important States operated under a free trade policy. </para>

                            <para>- I hope to deal with that point as I proceed. I do not wish to evade the question, which I have dealt with on previous occasions, but I should like to take my remarks in their order. The migration policy which the Minister mentioned is actually non-existent. <inline font-style="italic">British</inline> people are leaving Australia <inline font-style="italic">more</inline> rapidly than they are arriving, and the only additions to the population consist mainly of a few Italians, a number of whom have been settling in Australia within the last few years; to them I do not object. A migration policy which, as I have said, is non-existent is, according to the Minister, stimulated by our secondary industries. These industries have reduced unemployment to a rate lower than it was before the depression, but what effect have they had upon migration ? Migration does not exist, and unless more active steps are taken than those indicated in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, it will continue to bo ineffective in future. </para>

Of course if we are to take the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> that the Tariff Board is right in reading the agreement in a sense contrary to the meaning of its words, the actios of the Government may be justified. The article, however, says &#34; To reduce or remove- primage duty as soon as the finances of Australia will allow &#34;. Taking the legal view, we might, I suppose, claim that we have the alternative of reducing- or removing primage duty; but surely the obvious meaning of those words is that primage duty will be reduced and removed as soon as possible. The Government has not complied with that provision, neither has it carried out other undertakings decided upon at Ottawa. For years too, it was laid down most definitely in government policy, that there would be no alteration without a recommendation from the Tariff Board ; yet when the trade diversion policy was brought in that undertaking was ignored. Is that a consistent policy? We have made no complaint to Great Britain, on the other hand, and so far as I know that country has not at any time failed to carry out its part of the agreement. </para>

                    <para>Great Britain, in making a definite complaint concerning cement, said that we were not adhering to the agreement. There are some who say that we must  have additional protection to produce certain commodities in the interests of defence. The only defence plan which is really essential to us is the defence which is provided by the mother country. That is the only essential defence that we require, and to speak about the necessity to produce this and that trifling article because it is essential to defence is absurd. 1 notice that in one way and another we are establishing numerous new forms of secondary industries because it is said that they are essential for defence purposes. That argument was first put forward about fifteen years ago, I think, by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Gepp, but it is now continually used as . a means to promote a variety of secondary industries which are said to be essential to defence. I do not hold that view. 1 think that a great many of these things which are foisted upon us in the guise of defence measures cannot possibly bc justified. We come back to the old conflict between primary and secondary industries. Some say that they march arm in ann, while others contend that they march hand in pocket. </para>
                    <para>The Minister also said that we must look to the whole world as our market, but in the main that must surely be for the marketing of our primary products, because an enormous majority of the products sold overseas is produced by primary industries. We must look to the world as our market for primary products to assist our people, because we cannot expect to dispose of our secondary products overseas. Speaking broadly nobody wishes to buy them. Obviously the failure on our part to comply completely with the Ottawa agreement means that we cannot object if some of our preferences are reduced, and it is quite likely that - subject to what I shrill say in a moment - the reductions will be in respect of our primary products. That of course is exactly what we have expected and what we have said repeatedly in this chamber must eventually happen. One-half of the Government supporters have said that if secondary production is encouraged unduly it must eventually affect primary production. It has commenced to do that. I am certain that Great Britain has not the slightest desire to retaliate in respect of anything that we may or may not have done in connexion with the Ottawa agreement, but I feel that what </para>
                    <para class="block">I have said will happen; and if we have not complied with our part of the agreement our right to complain has gone.

                    <para>My opinion has always been that it is better to employ our. people in natural activities rather than in artificial or unnatural undertakings. For the past six years we have all endeavoured to restore employment, but the Government believing that it can be done, as indeed it seems it can be most  rapidly,  by concentrating on our secondary industries, has now produced in this country a state of affairs where secondary industries are for all practical purposes primary industries. These secondary industries, which are fully protected by law, have gradually taken the position which was formerly occupied by natural industries, with the result that there are hundreds of thousands of men engaged in secondary production who, in my judgment and in the judgment of others, should be distributed throughout the country on wheat farms, orchards, and small holdings. Wool and wheat are, at least, industries which are standing on their own feet, and if they get hit the reaction is bound to affect secondary industry, and possibly cause unparalleled unemployment. What on earth are all these factories to turn out, supposing we experience a really severe depression and the people have not the wherewithal to buy their wares! </para>

                            <para>- No ; when it is only a case of keeping in employment a few men here and there, primary industry will make an effort to retain them. A man engaged in rural employment is more easily kept on in times of depression than is a man employed in secondary industry, because the former to a great extent consumes what is produced in the area in  which  he works; he consumes to a much greater extent what he produces. That is my answer to the honorable senator. Briefly, the economic history of the world shows that natural industries are preferable to the artificial. In some cases, I admit, the latter may even become totally independent of aid ; if that happens, it is all to the good ; but it happens very seldom. </para>

                    <para>I have explained that if anything is to be taken from us as the result of these negotiations, it is likely to be some of the preferences which we now enjoy for our &#39; primary products. If that happens, we must not be surprised ; indeed, it seems inevitable. I suppose, however, that there is one wider possibility, and that is some general agreement as to a lowering all round of tariffs. Such a movement probably will be only slight. On a past occasion I and about a dozen other honorable senators voted to restore the old 1921-1928 tariff, and if a lowering of duties should come to pass, not only as between Australia, Great Britain, and the United States of America, hut also on a wider basis, I  should  be very glad. Surely we are not going to &#39;take the view, as one or two honorable senators suggest, that we should militate against the future peace of the world by refusing to surrender any advantage which we now possess. Let us consider this aspect, for example, in regard to boots which used to bc largely supplied by Great Britain. To-day 99 per cent, of the boots worn in this country are manufactured here. Are we not prepared to concede another 1 per cent, of the trade in boots if such action would help, even in a slight degree, to avoid war? My personal view is that the general objective of stimulating international trade and promoting good feeling between countries makes general concessions in trade not only justifiable, but also essential. I hope, therefore, that the Government will send to this conference emissaries representative of both sections of the ministerial party; they can argue the matter out when they get to Great Britain and do the best they can for Australia. Perhaps I should say for the benefit of honorable senators opposite that I am not a freetrader; I am a reasonable protectionist, and that is the only kind of protectionist who should exist. Whatever the Government  may  do, I have no fear that it will have any desire to do harm to either the primary or secondary industries of Australia, but 1 know that its policy during the last few years makes it very likely that if harm falls upon anybody it will fall upon the primary producers. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator &#39;that trade antagonisms lead to war, but when I listen to the rhetorical rubbish voiced by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> it makes me wonder whether those honorable senators really believe what they say. We shall certainly be sorry to lose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> when he retires from thi3 chamber, but just now we have heard him holding forth to the effect that if we can only concede to some other country 1 per cent, of the trade in boots, we shall be able to wave the olive branch to every other country, and by such action give a lead in the preservation of peace. The Mussolinis and Hitlers apparently will retire into their rabbit-holes, or sheathe their swords, and the lion will lay down with the lamb, simply because some reciprocal trade agreement is made between Australia and the United States of America. Such assertions are pathetic; they make one wonder whether honorable senators who make them have not altogether lost their perspective. We have no hope of ensuring the peace of the world merely by reducing our tariff duties, and it is useless, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has said, to continue to &#34; pull our own legs &#34; in that respect. We are merely clouding the issue by imagining that we shall bring in an era of world peace, by reciprocal trade agreements. As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> stated that the Ottawa agreement had been broken in many respects by the Australian Government. He said that we had not fully carried out that agreement. </para>

                        expressed a similar view. We have been similarly accused by Great Britain. In negotiations of this kind, when representatives of different countries enter the conference room, it is a case of diamond cut diamond; an agreement having been signed Australia&#39;s representatives will apparently return with it although the Government will have no intention of fully carrying it out. Regardless of whether or not the Government has any such intention, the agreement will not be carried out. That is the position. I do not know whether we have accused Great Britain of failure to honour in full the present Ottawaagreement, but that country has certainly made such an accusation against Australia. In any case, as honorable senators opposite admitted this afternoon that Australia has not fully carried out its obligations under that compact, what faith can we place in this Government when it says it is going to send delegates abroad to make, not only a fresh agreement with Great Britain, but also a pact with the. United States of America in which it proposes to give certain concessions in order to ensure the peace of the world ? If we have failed to carry out an agreement made between ourselves and the Old Country, how can honorable senators on this side of the chamber believe that the Government will carry out the agreement it proposes to negotiate with the United States of America ?

                    <para>I entirely agree with my Leader when he says that this Parliament should have the right to lay down the principles upon which an agreement with another country should be made. Admittedly we cannot go into all the details; if we could there would be no necessity to send delegates to conferences overseas to negotiate such agreements. But we should definitely lay down the principles upon which an agreement may be made. </para>

                            <para>- Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> supports the Government in its efforts to arrange a new agreement along similar lines, and, I take it, by his silence, he is prepared that it should embody these three articles. The honorable senator, together with other honorable senators opposite, does not agree with articles 10,11,12 and 14 of the Ottawa agreement. As my Leader has pointed out, article 3.2 makes this Parliament subordinate to the Tariff Board, a tribunal of its own making. Many members of this Parliament, apart from members of the Labour party, are opposed to these articles, and would like to see them eliminated. We contend that they are pernicious, and, in view of the fact that supporters of the Government also contend that they are wrong in principle, Parliament should make a definite pronouncement in regard to them, so that any delegation journeying overseas to confer with American and British representatives will know that Australia does not desire articles similar to these to be embodied in any further agreement that may be arrived at. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator previously said that the present wording of this provision was essential. Unlike the honorable senator, we of the Opposition are in no doubt as to what we mean; we contend that article 12 is derogatory of the Australian Parliament, and should never have been embodied in any agreement. The Labour party is opposed to any delegation - whether led by the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> or the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> - signing an agreement in which will be embodied provisions similar to those contained in Articles 10, 11 and 12 of the Ottawa agreement. Our position is perfectly plain, and admits of no misunderstanding. We on this side do not hold that the mere making of a trade agreement will usher in that era of peace and prosperity of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> spoke. </para>

                            <para>- But he meant it.  1 have heard the honorable senator speak on the subject of boots before. On a previous occasion when I followed him in addressing the chamber, I referred to the enormous output of the Bata Company in Czechoslovakia and quoted the statement of Professor Copland that by making full use of their machinery, three firms already&#34; operating in Australia could produce all the boots required in this country. If the manufacturers in the United States of America were to work their machinery day and night, they could produce all the boots required by the people of the world. In the light of those facts, honorable senators -should see the complete absurdity of the Government entering into an agree- . ment with the United States of America to reduce the tariff on boots. Why do not honorable senators opposite see that it is impossible to overcome all our economic disabilities merely by playing at the game of treaty-making? The real cause of the trouble is that under the existing financial system it is  impossible  to distribute such abundant production. Only recently I pointed out that we shall not solve the problems confronting Australia by diverting trade from one country to another. However desirable a treaty with the United States of America may be as a contribution towards world peace, it will- not accomplish what honorable senators opposite say. </para>

                            <para>- Anything that prevents one country from trading with other countries must cause a certain amount of bitterness in the minds of. the people whose trade is impeded. That happens with almost every country whoso product has increased as a result of competition between country and country, and also because of the fear of war and the desire te solve its own unemployment problems. We in Australia entertain a measure of bitterness against those countries which will not buy our goods. Similarly, producers in New Zealand are somewhat bitter because Australian producers arc competing with them in their own territory, and they are trying to convince their government of the wisdom of imposing a tariff on goods imported from Australia. Has the Ottawa agreement taken us one step towards the solution of our economic and defence problems? I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> that, had there been no Ottawa agreement, Australia&#39;s development would have been the same. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. &#34;The imposition of duties on certain commodities has resulted in the development of Australian industries. In, other words, Australia has taken steps towards a form of economic nationalism  similar  to thai adopted by other countries. That is an inevitable development of the modern system whereby each country, by means of a policy of economic decentralization, attempts to foster its own industries. The more industries that are developed in the various countries, the les3 chance there is of international trade. I should like the Leader of the Senate to give an assurance that any action taken by the delegation will not adversely affect any Australian industry. The honorable gentleman said that Australia may have to make certain minor sacrifices. The people of Australia would like to know the nature of those sacrifices and who will be called upon to make them. Instead of talking in a general way of the probable results of a trade agreement, the Government should be more definite as to the line of action it proposes to take, the nature of the sacrifices that will have to be made, and the sections of the community that will make them. The Senate should not be satisfied with the generalities contained in the Minister&#39;s statement. Unfortunately, we on this side cannot trust the Government. </para>

                            <para>- Only a few months ago, the Government inaugurated a trade diversion policy which adversely affected the United States of America and Japan. Yesterday, we were told that that policy had been set&#34; aside. Since that policy, which was a form of economic nationalism was inaugurated, &#163;400,000 has been extracted from the people, ostensibly for the purpose of establishing a fund to assist in the manufacture of motor engines in Australia. That money was not, however, put into a trust fund, but was credited to Consolidated Revenue. The policy aimed at making Australia less dependent on other  countries  for certain types of machinery, hut it has now been discarded. In the light of that experience, how can we trust the Government? It speaks glibly of what it will do in the interests of Australia, but, within eighteen months of the inauguration of a new policy, it announces a change which involves the making of minor sacrifices. The people are told that it is done in the interests of world peace. </para>

                            <para>- Honestly, I do not think our trade diversion policy worried America more than a fly does a horse, or a flea a dog. It might have done a small amount of injury, but we in Australia have, a wrong impression and a distorted perspective. Those who have travelled the world, as I have, know that a relatively small country like this cannot have upon America or the British Empire or the rest of the world the effect that some people here imagine. Whilst an agreement may assist in a measure to further the interests of Australia, it will not do what some honorable senators would like to mislead the people into believing that it will do.

We on this side of the Senate say that the main object of the Government should be the internal development of Australia. Our eyes should be turned first to Australia itself. We should not give the people the impression that, by making agreements with foreign countries, we shall promote Australian internal development and create a state of affairs in which all our workers&#34; will be employed, and the enterprising leaders of industry receive their due reward. It is hopeless to expect to put back the economic clock, and it is useless for Australia to imagine that it will place itself on an even economic keelmerely by sending another delegation to London, to enter into another agreement such as the one I now hold. </para>

                            <para>- No; I have on several occasions made the clear, concise statement that the Labour movement, understanding the evolutionary development of the world, stands first and foremost for the development of Australia to the highest pitch, and the prosperity of its primary and secondary industries. We shall not give way one iota in that regard. That is contrary to the Minister&#39;s statement, which calls upon the industrialists of this country, whether primary or secondary, to make minor sacrifices. We claim that the making of those sacrifices will not achieve what the Government expects. We say that they should not be made by any Australian industry. We make that clear, concise statement to the world, so that the position of Australia may not be misunderstood. It is absurd, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> said, to &#34; kid &#34; to the people, and to pull their legs, but that is what the Government is doing in telling them that, by making these agreements, Australia will advance a long way towards a happy solution of its problems. Development is going on in every country. In respect of what production are our people to be asked to make a sacrifice? Only a few years ago, the American Government actually paid its farmers to kill their pigs and cows, to plough in their&#39; cotton, and to refrain from growing many other products. Are any of those commodities to be included in an agreement? How absurd it all is! What commodity is to be asked to make a minor sacrifice? America can practically flood the world with most of the commodities it needs. What a trumpery tale is this to put before the Australian people ! I object to giving them the impression that such wonders can be achieved merely by making an agreement with regard to certain commodities that can be produced in abundance in America. What commodity could we send to America that it cannot produce? </para>

There may be minor matters on which some agreement can be come to, but they are very minor, and very few. The making of an agreement to send South Australian wine to the United States of America, will not take us one step towards world appeasement orworld peace. Is there any other commodity that honorable senators would like to mention? </para>

                            <para>- Why does it not buy our wool now? We are producing wool in great quantities, and its price has been reduced. The stupid action of a stupid government in its trade diversion policy caused Australia to lose nearly &#163;7,000,000 on its wool crop. Only a few weeks ago many graziers in Southern Queensland assured me that they had lost hundreds of pounds as the result of that policy. The Government&#39;s economic proposals will not take us very far towards world peace. </para>

The portion of the earlier bill relating to the ports to which the act applies has, however^ been omitted: from this measure which deals with one matter only, namely, the cancellation of licences. e </para>

The amendment in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> relates to subsection 3, which reads as follows : - - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Where a licence issued to any person is cancelled under this section, the licensing officer by whom the licence is cancelled .shall, by writing under his hand, fix a period, not being less than six months nor more than twelve months from the date of cancellation, during which the person shall be ineligible to receive a licence under this&#39; part, and the person shall, subject to this part, thereupon be ineligible accordingly. </para>

                    <para class="block">By that provision, a licensing officer cannot cancel a licence for a period of less than six months. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the proposed amendment relates to subsection 6, which reads - </para>

                        <para>Upon the hearing of an appeal, the court may as it thinks fit, confirm the cancellation or order the restoration of the licence, or, where it confirms the cancellation, may vary the period during which the appellant is ineligible to receive a fresh licence, but so that the period of ineligibility is not less than six nor more than twelve months. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>A restraint is placed upon the licensing officer in that he cannot suspend a licence for less than six months, and, further, if an aggrieved waterside worker appeals and is successful to the extent that he convinces the magistrate that his. offence was of a trifling nature, the magistrate, none the less, cannot reduce the term of suspension to less than six. months. Under the proposed amendment, the licensing officer may cancel a waterside worker&#39;s licence for any period not less than one month, nor more than twelve months, and the magistrate, on appeal, may vary the sentence so long as he does not reduce the period of suspension to less than one month. </para>
                    <para>The amendment in paragraph c of clause 2 is intended to deal with existing cases of cancellation. As the amendments are ameliorative in character, I ask honorable senators to agree to the speedy passage of the measure. </para>

                        <para>.- It is not my intention to debate the bill at length. When it was before the Senate previously I secured from the Minister in charge a definite assurance that the only purpose of the measure was to ameliorate the conditions regarding the cancellation of licences. I have since been advised that it will do something more, and I wish to have that matter placed beyond doubt. I understand that at pre&#39;sent it is possible to alter the application of the act by regulation, and that if this bill is passed, this may not be achieved except by the passing of another measure. I think it is well known to honorable senators that when a Labour government is returned to office it will repeal the act. </para>

I was in charge of the bill at that time. It did not then contain the provisions to be found in proposed new sub-section 6a. When I informed the Leader of the Opposition that the purpose of the bill was purely ameliorative, the statement was strictly correct. </para>

                            <para>- It was then intended to do two things; to permit the licensing officer to suspend a licence for a period of less than six months, and, in the &#39;event of a case being taken before a court of petty sessions on appeal, to enable the &#34;magistrate to reduce the period of suspension to a period less than the six months provided in the act. Proposed new section  6a is new. I have not had time to examine it, but I accept the assurance of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> that it has been inserted to meet the cases of persons who have already been dealt with, and have had their licences suspended for the minimum period. The intention of the Government, I understand, is that even if persons have been dealt with under the act as it stands, they may still receive more liberal treatment. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this measure is to increase the amount of the maternity allowance to &#163;7 10s. where there are three or more previous surviving children, and to provide for anall-round increase of &#163;26 per annum in the amount of allowable income. At the present time the amount of theallowance is &#163;4 10s. in respect of the first child and &#163;5 where there ; are any previous surviving children under the age of fourteen years. The amount of allowable income -is &#163;221 per annum, or &#163;4 5s. aweek, with an additional &#163;13 per annum in respect of each previous surviving child under the age of fourteen years up to a maximum of &#163;312 per annum, or &#163;6 a week. </para>
                    <para>It is nowproposed to liberalize the provisions of the act with a view to extending additional assistance where families are large, and where incomes are small. To meet these cases, it is proposed to increase the rate of the allowance to &#163;7 10s. for the fourth and each subsequent child. It is also proposed to increase the amount of allowable income from &#163;221 per annum, or &#163;4 5s. a week, to &#163;247 per annum, or &#163;4 15s. a week. The additional income allowance of &#163;13 per annum in respect of each previous surviving child under fourteen years of age is being retained with a limit of &#163;338 per annum, or &#163;6 10s. a week, in lieu of &#163;312 per annum, or &#163;6 a week, as at present. As the law stands, only the children of the mother are taken into account in determining the allowable income and the amount of the allowance. It is now proposed to amend the act to enable the inclusion of dependent children of the husband by a former marriage. In accordance with the existing requirements of the act, a claim for maternity allowance must be lodged within three months of the date of the birth. It is now proposed to provide for discretionary power to be vested in the Commissioner to extend the period where satisfactory reasons are furnished for the delay in lodging a claim. The total cost of the above liberalizations is estimated at &#163;96,000 per annum, or approximately &#163;50,000 for the balance of the current financial year. </para>

                    <para>SenatorCOLLINGS. - If I thought that the Government is preparing for the depression that some of us expect within the next two years I should probably express somewhat different views concerning some of its proposals. This is a niggardly proposition. Any one reading the billwill see the extraordinary lengths to which its framers have gone to see that nounfortunate mother gets even a fractional allowance beyond that  which she is entitled to receive. It would be simpler to submit a bill of a few lines providing that an allowance be made to mothers regardless of income, as was provided in the measure originally sponsored by the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>. - 1 followed with very close attention the speeches of honorable senators on this subject, and particularly that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> who contends that primary production is not responsible for Australia&#39;s financial and economic stability. Statistics disclose that the ratios of exports to total production are as follows: - Wool, 94 per cent.; butter, 45 per cent.; lamb and mutton, 26 per cent.; dried fruits, 72 per cent.; wheat, 72 per cent.; apples, 49 per cent.; canned fruits, 42 per cent.; dmi wines, 21 per cent. I do not propose to cite the exports of secondary products, but, as honorable senators are aware, the quantity is very small. Australia&#39;s stability can be assured only by meeting our overseas commitments, and that is done with the proceeds from the export of our primary products. I do not wish to disparage the. value of our secondary industries, because I realize that they assist to absorb a large portion of our population, and that those engaged in secondary production consume large quantities of primary products. These two sections must work together if we are to have a well-balanced population? Australian manufacturers are, I know, capable of producing commodities equal to those manufactured in other parts of the world, but the products of our secondary industries are used almost solely in Australia. I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> oppose a renewal of the Ottawa agreement. </para>

Practically all of the benefit resulting from the export of that 1,750,000 cwt. of meat  is  reaped by Queensland. I ask honorable senators opposite also to bear in mind that during the next two years our export quota for chilled meat can be expanded to a further 2,000,000 cwt. annually, representing a further &#163;3,000,000 in value. This makes a total of &#163;6,000,000 for chilled beef alone. </para>

                            <para>- At the moment, I am dealing with our export trade as it has been affected by our trade agreements generally with Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> apparently would deny to the producers of Queensland the benefit of the increased exportations to which I have referred.I draw attention also to the preference of &#163;15 a ton enjoyed by Australian butter on the British market as against Danish buttter; this has been a great help to our dairy farmers in disposing of their surplus. Instead of opposing the negotiation of agreements which confer such benefits on this country honorable senators opposite should welcome them. Developments during the last three years have proved definitely that our present trade agreement with Great Britain is the finest yet made by an Australian government; particularly can this be said in respect of the benefits it confers on Queensland industries. I cannot understand the contention of honorable senators opposite that the Government is proceeding along wrong lines in negotiating further agreements of this nature. </para>

                                said that the whole of our trade negotiations with Great Britain were useless, and contended that the Government, in negotiating further agreements, was giving other countries a cause for war. I prefer rather to stick to facts, and, consequently. I must endorse the Government&#39;s proposals. Honorable senators have endeavoured to cast suspicion on the intentions of the representatives who may be selected by this Government to go abroad to negotiate new agreements.

A favourite expression of condemnation used by a member of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, is that the Ottawa agreement is &#34;the greatest ramp ever put oyer Australia&#34;. I have heard him use that expression on a number of occasions. The Leader of the Opposition in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> now describes that agreement, or, at least, some of its provisions, as &#34;the greatest act of treachery ever perpetrated against Australia &#34;. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> who approaches the agreement with a great measure of timidity, does not say that it has wrought all the havoc suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, but he claims that nobody can determine with any degree of accuracy what proportion of the increased amount of prosperity enjoyed by Australia during  recent years has been due to the operation of the agreement. In respect of its effect on our primary industries, I accept the view just expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline> and as to the rest of the criticism, I merely say that those who attack the agreement are under some obligation to prove their charges. The onus rests upon them. The fact remains that in respect of whatever subjects the Ottawa agreement touches we could, if we had the timer to- go into the relevant figures, show that that agreement has conferred benefits upon Australia. The general attack made- upon- the agreement seems to be that Australia got nothing out of it and that- we- gave something away.. L do. not agree with that view for one moment. I accept the relevant figures, which show beyond doubt that we have gained distinct advantages as the result of its operation. </para>

                            <para>- I- am afraid that on &#39;more than one occasion the honorable senator himself has said so.. This afternoon he reminded us of his prophecy when the agreement was signed- that it would be of no use to Australia, despite the fact&#39; that developments-during the last five years prove the wisdom, of those who framed the., agreement. If. an agreement is being entered into between two countries, or individuals or. corporate bodies, no doubt both parties expect to get something out of it, and in respect of a trade agreement both parties may find their hopes justified ; it is quite possible,.and in the order of nature, that a trade agreement should prove of advantage to both parties to it. When critics of this agreement can bring forward nothing to substantiate their contentions, they fall back on articles 9 to 13. inclusive. To-day, the Leader of the Opposition, by some strange mischance, overlooked: article 9. I have no. doubt that he will take the earliest opportunity to repair the. oversight. In criticizing! an: agreement, one has got to take it as a whole, but. critics of this agreement do not take it as. a whole. After,&#39; an experience of its. operation over the. last five years, they have  not yet learned, that elementary method of construing, any agreement. They start at the middle of it, at article 9, or, should they happen, by mischance, like the Leader of the Opposition, to miss that article^ at a later article. An analysis of this agreement.show8 that,, up to article 9,. Great Britain gives, and from article 9 onwards, receives- benefits. Surely honorable senators&#39; opposite would not expect  Great  Britain to enter into, an agree-* ment in which it; would- be expected- to give everything and receive nothing. It is- only by giving as well as. taking that both parties- may benefit, from- an agreement. </para>

                    <para>He sneeringly referred to the Tariff Board as a body of public servants placed above Parliament. I ask him- if there is anything derogatory to Parliament in. Parliament itself conferring on another body the power which is contained in this article? The very fact that Parliament can confer the power is evidence that it has supreme power. Is there anything derogatory to Parliament in Parliament handing o~r entirely the administration, of justice to a body of judges,, and never interfering &#39; at all with their work! Similarly is there anything derogatory in Parliament providing, that, before duties are increased, there should be something in the nature of a judicial inquiry, in the interests not only of our English brothers,, but also of Australian consumers? </para>

                            <para>- Unless I am mistaken, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> himself said that this article led to bickering and quarrelling between friends. He expressed the hope that in any new agreement which may be framed article 10 would be so worded as to leave no room for disagreement. When we are dealing with a trade agreement between countries it is extremely difficult, and, if I may say so, extremely unwise, to attempt to impose limitations which are too narrow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> said that this Parliament should be given the opportunity to lay down the principles upon which any agreement that may be entered into shall be based. Does he not understand that the purpose of this discussion, and that which took place in the House of Representatives, is to give effect to the promise of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> that, before the delegation left Australia, representatives of primary and secondary industries would be consulted? Obviously, it is not practicable to take all the people of Australia to the other side of the world to thresh out the details of an agreement. The Government for the time being is the executive of the country. It is entitled to speak on behalf of the people, and to give effect to their sentiments in any agreement^ which may be entered into. When such an agreement has been drawn up, it is impossible for this Parliament to amend it. Parliament may do one of two things; it may either reject the agreement as a whole, or accept it as a whole. Prom the very nature of things, an agreement which has been drawn up as a result of a conference on the other side of the world cannot be amended on this side. </para>

                            <para>- That was the condition of affairs which existed when this agreement, providing for reference to the Tariff Board, was discussed. The Leader of the Opposition said this afternoon that the Scullin Government had to take strong action to remove a cancerous growth, and that its action saved Australia. I have no criticism to offer regarding the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> at a time of crisis for Australia, but I remind the honorable gentleman that the thing3 done by the Scullin Government were not thought necessary in New Zealand, although the conditions there were similar. In that dominion, although there were no surcharges, prohibitions, or primage duties, the imports fell away exactly as they did in Australia. The figures for Australia also disclose that the importation of goods which were not subject to special restrictions fell away just as much as in the case of goods to which the restrictions applied. </para>

                            <para>- Those supposedly obnoxious articles, Nos. 9 to 13, leave my withers unwrung. I see in them nothing of which any government responsible for framing them has reason to be ashamed. I have the greatest confidence that, whatever the personnel of the delegation which will go abroad to negotiate a new agreement, it will consider the interests of Australia as a whole, and do its best for Australian industries, both primary and secondary. The positive assertion of the Leader of the Opposition, that already Australia has been committed to follow Great Britain in whatever it does, is entirely without warrant, as he must know. </para>

My comment is that he made it without having the slightest ground upon which to base the allegation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> expressed, on behalf of the manufacturers, some fears about an agreement that may be entered into with the United States of America. I realize the necessity for the secondary as well as the primary industries to be prosperous. Any agreements which we may make with America may involve some changes, and may include something which affects the prosperity of this country. The Loader of the Senate using a not very happy phrase, said that they might &#34;involve sacrifices&#34;, but I can assure honorable senators opposite, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> that the maintenance of good relations with the United States of America&#39; to-day may have&#34; a direct bearing, not merely upon the prosperity of this country, but also upon its very existence- </para>

I believe the hope of the leading minds of Great Britain and America, and all who wish  civilization well in such a crisis as we are passing through, is that reciprocal agreements will help. We, however, have to listen to dismal Jeremiahs who say that nothing good can come from reciprocal agreements, and that we can live, as the Pitcairn Islanders existed, by taking in each other&#39;s washing. That is a policy which must inevitably fail, and on which I venture to think Australia will turn its back. What is the motive underlying the endeavour to get Great Britain, and the mighty United States of America together ? </para>

What did he mean by saying that reciprocal agreements can do nothing to solve world difficulties? He was dealingwith the subject-matter of the statement that I placed on the table this afternoon, and he knew full well,&#39; as every honorable senator should have known, that underlying it all are the <inline font-style="italic">rapprochement</inline> that is taking place, and the discussions that are now proceeding, with a view to bringing the United States of America and the Mother Country into some agreement. If that should come about, it should be one  of  the greatest steps forward in securing peace for the world, together with a certain amount of stability. If we can make  a  contribution to that end, surely this proposal should not be discussed in the terms of whether some of our industries, primary or secondary, may lose a few feathers. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator would like to reduce this issue to some individual industry which may be harmed. I think he heard enough from his Queensland colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> to-night in that regard, and I do not propose to discuss the matter on that basis at all. If there is any State that has benefited by the Ottawa, agreement, and all that has followed from it, it is Queensland, as witness the security for its sugar industry, and its advance in the production and export  of  meat. A preference of¾d. per lb. as against the Argentine represents on a 600-lb. bullock &#163;1 17s. 6d. If our producers are not in a position to handle the British trade successfully with that benefit, they should not be producing cattle at all. These are not the issues which I intended should emerge from those broad principles that I endeavoured to lay down in the statement placed before the Senate. I hoped that honorable senators would realize what all this means, what the best minds in Great Britain and the United States  of  America are desiring to bring about. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may find that observations of that, kind suit a street corner audience at South Brisbane, but when we are discussing a serious subject, upon which so much depends, I expect honorable senators to have a full sense of the responsibility that, rests upon them individually, as well as upon the people and the Parliament, at this critical juncture in world affairs. We have heard something about nations living in self containment. We know of the sufferings of some peoples by reason of restrictions placed by their rulers on world trade, and their desire to practise the principle of economic nationalism to the full, refusing to trade with their neighbours, conserving their cash, and arming to the teeth with no peaceful intentions towards the rest of the world. I venture to think that if we could bring the Mother Country and the United States of America into a closer alliance, and a better relationship than has hitherto prevailed, we should be taking an immense step forward. We know how difficult these matters are, and how the selfinterests of various industries, be they primary or secondary, emerge from time to time. We know how hard it has been for us to&#34; make an agreement with our fellow Australians across the Tasman Sea. Those New Zealanders are Australians to the core, their sentiments  and habits are Australian, a large percentage of them are related to our own  people,  and yet we are unable to bring about an agreement with them. The public men of the Mother Country and. the United States are faced with a herculean task, which they have taken upon themselves - a task which might mean the saving of civilization - and we, therefore, should be willing to make sacrifices in the interests, not only of our own selves, but of civilization as a whole. </para>

The honorable senator&#39;s question also connotes a further suggestion which emerged from some of the speeches this afternoon, namely, that Parliament should have an opportunity to discuss any agreement before it is finalized and signed. If any such procedure were adopted, no agreement would ever be made between nations. Interests of various kinds would arise, criticisms would come from them, attacks would be made on public men, and nothing could, be done. This thing must not be weighed on fine scales at all. We have to take the total good that is to come to the people of this country, to all the British communities, and to the whole world, because the principle underlying all these negotiations is the ultimate preservation of world peace.  </para>

                    <para>I assure the Leader of the Opposition that no pact has been arranged, there has been no suggestion of one, and no proposals have been made for one. The United Kingdom is to-day in a position to denounce the Ottawa agreement, with all its benefits to the Australian meat industry and all those other allied industries to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> has referred. If Australia took a small view, if it bothered about this or that small thing, if it wished to preserve this or that trifling interest, then I think things would go ill with us, having regard to the position in which we are placed with our tremendous primary production. </para>

                        was under the impression that the Government yesterday announced a change in its trade diversion policy, but I can assure him that the safeguards for Australian industries still remain. If he will examine the statement made yesterday by the Attorney-General, he will see that those principles which have &#39; governed our fiscal policy in the past - will be maintained in the future, in relation to all those items to which he has referred.

                            <para>- The Leader of the Opposition is wandering from the point at issue. He declines to face the stern facts that emerge from present world conditions. He refuses to realize the impotence of any single nation against the conditions that prevail in the East and the possibilities of even more devastating competition if the latent industrial forces of China are employed in the coming economic w.ar. This country, in order to preserve its economic independence, will then, be obliged either to resist by force the elements that threaten it, or yield to forces to which it has not hitherto given way. Thus I say that in the best interests of Australia we should do everything in our power to promote by friendly negotiations, a closer association with that great country of British origin, the United States of America, and endeavour to bring to bear in world affairs forces that will uphold the standards of living of the white races. This is the problem that confronts us and is influencing the leaders of thought in Great Britain and the United States of America. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> would denounce all these endeavours by the wisest statesmen of the old and new world to meet the difficulties caused by the spirit of economic nationalism. He would pit, his knowledge as an economist and a statesman against that of men who are nearest to the vital issues that are causing the world so much concern. He denounces all reciprocal agreements. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman definitely declared that reciprocal agreements were of no avail in solving the present world difficulties. But all this empty twittering by the honorable gentleman is as futile as the idle wind. If it be true that reciprocal agreements make no contribution to the cause of economic peace, then indeed the world is in a desperate condition. It is difficult to understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown&#39;s</inline> attitude to the economic problems that beset practically all countries. He and his friends preach the doctrine of economic nationalism, not realizing that in doing this they are depriving the people of Australia of the opportunity to enjoy the good things which can be furnished by other countries, and that this false economic policy leads to dictatorships of one form or another. The Government will enter into these negotiations with Great Britain with a full sense of its responsibility to every worthwhile Australian industry. As to the leadership of the delegation, despite the efforts of the Opposition and a number of government supporters to obtain from me the names of the Ministers who will attend the conference, I can only say that I cannot give them the desired information, because I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friends can rest assured that whoever may be the Minister appointed to lead the delegation, he will be a good Australian, and that the delegation will do its best in the interests of the people as a whole. I say, in all sincerity, that the future safety of Australia and all that we prize so much may depend upon the deliberations of the forthcoming conference. I regret that this morning, when I placed on the table of the Senate the official paper, I did not initiate the debate on a higher plane.I felt during the afternoon that it was a pity indeed that we did not apply ourselves more to the principles which have influenced the Governments of Great Britain and the United States of America to attempt to get together, because the combined forces of these two great nations will have a steadying influence on world affairs that was never more necessary than at this time. </para>

                    <para>The bill is to provide for raising &#163;2,500,000 by loan to meet the cost of a part of the defence programme of the Commonwealth for 1937-38. In the present state of international affairs it is scarcely necessary for me to deal at length with the urgency of the Government&#39;s enlarged defence programme. That aspect was fully covered by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> and the ex-Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Archdale Parkhill),</inline> during the last session of the last Parliament, and in the budget speech the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> outlined the sources from which the Government proposed to finance the defence provision. They are as follows: - </para>

As was stated in the Treasurer&#39;s budget speech, it is proposed in the first place that the funds required to cover that portion of the defence programme bo charged to a loan to he raised in London by means of treasury-bills to be issued to the Commonwealth Bank. The amount of those bills will he &#163;2,000,000 sterling, representing &#163;2,500,000 of Australian currency. In view of the urgency of the defence programme and the restricted field for borrowing in Australia, the Government believes that the present proposal represents the most reasonable and expedient method of raising the necessary funds. </para>
