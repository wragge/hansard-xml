                        <para>- The remuneration of officials in allowance post offices is fixed by a committee of officers in the central administration of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. A figure higher than the basic wage, whatever it may be, asfixed by the court, is takenas the datum line, and the officers assess the time that is required for each item of work that has to he done by allowance officers. Departmental records in connexion with this matter, extending over a period of years, are taken as a guide. Salaries of allowance post officers are arranged on the same basis throughout the Commonwealth.I shall have an inquiry made as to the effect on allowance post officers, of the recent addition to the basic wage, and advise the honorable senator whether any alterations are necessary. </para>

                        <para>Some five years ago, in deference to the wishes of the Hobart City Council and other interested parties, the Defence Department agreed to transfer the small arms range from Sandy Bay to Glenorchy. The terms and conditions of transfer, concerning which the honorable senator was advised some time ago, were accepted by the council during 1935. These were reduced to a formal deed of agreement between the two parties, the draft of which, with minor exceptions, the council recently accepted. These minor aspects of the agreement are now being discussed and the deed should be completed by the parties at an early date. </para>

                            <para>- Although the Imperial Conference was the most momentous effort that has been made in the interests of world peace since the Covenant of the League of Nations was signed, the Leader of the Opposition looks through party spectacles at the report of its proceedings. The underlying principle which emerges from  the  conference is that there should be  cooperation  between the Mother Country and the various dominions in an effort  to  secure the peace of the world - a peace which,  I  venture to say, would not  have  been disturbed so often had  not the  Motherland been insufficiently armed. </para>

If  anything untoward should happen  to  what we know as theBritish Commonwealth of Nations, God help the world. Mankind has endeavoured to secure the peace of the world in a variety of ways through the instrumentality of the League of Nations - an instrumentality that has not had from  the  Opposition that support which it, deserves, notwithstanding that the Opposition professes to believe in the principles upon which the League was founded. The League, however, has not been able to secure the peace at which it has aimed. </para>

                            <para>- I  regard the action now being taken  as of  pre-eminent importance to not only the British Commonwealth of Nations, but also civilization itself. What more momentous obligations could this commonwealth of nations have taken upon itself than to arm  in  the interests of peace? The dominant note in the policy  of the  British Commonwealth  of  Nations  is that  there shall be peace instead  of that savagery which for some time has ravished Europe and is now to be seen in a country not far from our northern shores. What is the spectacle confronting humanity to-day? We in Australia view these things from a distance; but I emphasize that that very isolation which in the past has been our security is to-day our danger. We have only to think of what would happen if New Zealand, with its 1,250,000 inhabitants and its tremendous coastline, were conquered by a foreign power, and there appeared almost at our door a foreign power, probably hostile to us. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the state of the world to-day, there is no necessity to name any power. The only hope that we have lies in a strong British Commonwealth of Nations working together for the good of humanity as in the past. There is no greater civilizing force in the world to-day, and no greater influence for peace, than the British Empire. The Imperial Conference endeavoured to secure co-operation between the component parts of the Empire in the interests of world peace. As I have said, no more momentous event has occurred since the Covenant of the League of Nations was signed. The Imperial Conference of 1937 will go down through history as an important world happening; yet it is being discussed in some quarters in a partisan spirit. Does it not appear that those who do so are overlooking the responsibility that they owe to civilization as well as to the people of this country? Are we so recreant to the trust reposed in every true citizen of the world that we pass by lightly a responsibility that we should accept in the interests of world peace? Either the Leader of the Opposition fails torealize what the resolutions of the conference meant or he is deliberately ignoring their implications. There are two reasons for the present disturbed state of the world. We see one nation endeavouring to impose its will as to economic conditions on another, and we see others striving for territorial expansion. It may be that, in some instances, expansion is necessary ; but, if we are to live up to the ideals of civilized people, such expansion cannot any longer be won at the point of the sword. <inline font-style="italic">. In</inline> various countries there is contention among the people themselves in regard to certain ideologies. We see contending factions striving for supremacy at the point of the sword. We who believe in democracy, with its spirit of freedom and fair play, tell the world that we intend to defend those things which we hold dear, and will do our utmost to establish a reign of peace throughout the world. </para>

It is the most anaemic, pointless, and vague declaration I have ever heard, and I believe that the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues, in their innermost hearts, sympathize with the policy of the Mother Country; but that they are afraid to declare their allegiance to what they know to be right. The Leader of the Opposition gave us, in abstract terms, some idea of the policy for which his party stands. </para>

                    <para class="block">The only constructive contribution in the policy for which the Labour party stands is the provision of bomb-proof shelters; otherwise there is nothing real, nothing substantive, in it; it is purely a political policy formulated to keep tied to their apron strings what honorable senators opposite are now pleased to call the left wing of their party. It has been couched in those terms, not because of a realization of their duty to the country, but on the ground of political expediency alone. The Leader of the Opposition will see that his party is already suspect by the people of Australia, and will remain suspect until the Labour party has seen fit to readjust its policy. The defence of Australia should not be regarded as a party matter. I have declared myself in and out of season as an adherent of peace, but when I see the craven attitude that has been adopted by the Labour party in relation to this important subject, I can only come to the, conclusion that the real reason for the announcement of this anaemic policy is a fear of offending those who are the real enemies of the Empire and of peace. The Leader of the Opposition has contented himself with mouthing sentences to tickle the ears of the groundlings, but with regard to the wider and deeper considerations which at a time like this should animate the action of every public man, he said nothing. While honorable senators opposite know the dangers of the situation in the world to-day, and what is happening at Shanghai, they are content to say that they will do all that is necessary for the &#34; adequate&#34; defence of Australia. What is there practical or sound in that? What is adequate defence? Only a navy that is worth while, and can defend both our coastline and our trade routes, can provide adequate defence. If our trade routes are not protected we shall be speedily brought to our knees. The isolation of this country was at one time its shield and buckler; to-day its isolation from the friendly countries of the world, which would help us, has become  a  terrible menace. What does the Leader of the Opposition suggest with regard to the defence of the trade routes of this country ? What would be said of us if we deserted our sister dominion across the Tasman Sea in times of need? I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to state the attitude of his party in regard to assisting New Zealand if that dominion were attacked. </para>

                            <para>- The navy is the one arm of defence upon which this country and New Zealand can rely - not a detached navy, but one working in co-operation with the powerful navies of Great Britain and the sister dominions in the interests of peace and our own national safety. If Auckland and Wellington were bombed, would the honorable senator send the Australian navy across the Tasman Sea? I see in the defence policy of the Labour party nothing that would help the sister dominion. Honorable senators opposite have framed their defence policy in a spirit of isolation. If such a policy were accepted, Australia would stand by and see its trade routes severed, its oil supplies cut off, and necessaries from overseas unable to reach its ports, and it would not strike a single blow until the enemy was within its gates. Then with the country under invasion Labour would  attempt to defend it, but not by cooperation with the Mother Country and the other dominions; it proposes that 7,000,000 people, including less than 2,000,000 fighting men, should alone defend this vast continent against an invasion, which may be made by one nation, or perhaps two, acting in combination. The futility and danger of this policy should appeal to the. Leader of the Opposition, because it is against Empire co-operation. It is a policy of isolation, to placate a certain section of the followers of the Opposition. It is not a policy that will be accepted by the people as contributing to the national safety. There is no escape from the fact that alone we perish. We have seen the slogan on Labour banners, &#34;United we stand, divided we fall,&#34; but the Opposition will be repudiating that creed if it does not stand for the unity of the British Commonwealth of Nations. </para>

                        J. McLACHLAN.Because I would desire that a man of the attainments of the Leader of the Opposition, and with a voice so ringing and convincing at times, should proceed along right lines in the interests of Australia, and of peace and civilization. We must arm or go under to certain forces which are at work in the world to-day. World peace cannot be maintained in any other way than by the effective arming of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
                    </para>
                    <para>The whole policy enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition is nebulous. &#34; The adequate defence of Australia ! &#34; A child in the street could say that. But there is something practical, constructive, and real, and something that goes to the hearts of the people, in co-operating with our kith and kin across the seas. There is something in that which makes us feel that living is worth while. It would be better for some of the unfortunate wretches in Europe and in Shanghai to-day were they beachcombers on one of the islands of the Pacific, for there they would at least have peace. In Australia we boast of our civilization. It would be an excellent thing if one could obtain the true opinion of Labour rather than this placard which is being put out, not because it expresses the real sentiment of true Labour men, but because their political leaders desire to win the votes of the left wing - the Communists who are their allies. </para>

The momentous subject of defence should be discussed on the highest possible plane. It should not be a political plaything, as the Leader of the Opposition has used it. Our very existence as a race may depend on the efficacy of the plan evolved in London. The old Mother Country has subscribed with blood and treasure to the principle of world peace, and it is to maintain that principle that it desires its dominions to participate in the Empire scheme of defence. That is the only con-  clusion one can draw from the statement read by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline></para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Has the Government received any guarantee from Amalgamated Wireless Limited and Philips Lamps Limited of Australia that they will supply radio valves to independent radio manufacturers at a price no higher than they could land equivalent types of imported valves into their stores duty paid, and also if the above two firms have guaranteed to have available a continuous and adequate supply of all necessary valves to fill independent radio manufacturers&#39; requirements? </para>
                </quote>
                <para>To that question I received this reply:- . </para>
                <para>Wireless valves of Australian manufacture are distributed to radio receiving set manufacturers at a lower price than similar types of overseas manufacture. The increased production brought about in Australia by the partial prohibition of imported valves has made it possible for prices of Australian-made valves to be reduced. In connexion with supplies of wireless valves, the Government is in close touch with local manufacturing developments. </para>
                <para>The Government is aware that the Australian wireless valve manufacturers are making valves available to users and purchasers in accordance with usual trade practice. There is no foundation for the belief that these manufacturers contemplate any departure from these trade practices. There has been no difficulty in the past in obtaining supplies of the types of wireless valves which are manufactured in Australia. </para>
                <para class="block">Since asking that question I have received letters from two radio manufacturers in Melbourne which do not sub stantiate the particulars contained in the reply furnished to me. One of the letters states - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The facts are that we are forced to pay 22&#189; per cent. more for local valves of obsolete types than we would have to pay for them if we landed them from America, even after paying exchange, duty, primage, &#38;c. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I have received another letter  to  the effect that the information given is inaccurate, and that unnecessarily high prices are being charged. If we are to give Australian manufacturers the sole right to make and distribute radio valves, we should have some guarantee that they will not exploit the manufacturers of wireless sets and the public because the price of valves has an important bearing on the cost of a complete wireless set. I understand that these firms have been in constant communication with the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White).</inline> I do not know whether that department is understaffed, but although one firm wrote on the 12th July, giving certain particulars required by the Customs Department, no reply has yet been received. Further communications were sent on the 11th and the 25th August, to which no reply has yet been received. Meanwhile, permission has not been granted to obtain valves of other types. Having had considerable experience of radio work, I have a good deal of sympathy with manufacturers, because I have been held up for weeks owing to my inability to obtain valves I required. There is a good deal of truth in the manufacturers&#39; complaints, and I shall hand the correspondence to the Minister in the hope that I shall receive a satisfactory reply. The Minister for Trade and Customs and his officers, are exercising far too much power. I trust that the matter will be given immediate attention, and that I shall be furnished with a reply at an early date. </para>

I trust that the right honorable gentleman will inquire whether there is any possibility of the construction of these, engines being expedited. Until they are in use, those using the line, particularly the people of Western Australia who do business by rail with the eastern States, cannot derive any advantage from the new section as the time taken on the journey from Perth to Adelaide cannot be reduced by 24 hours as was promised. </para>

I understand that the present range does not comply with the requirements of the Defence Department; certainly if the change could be made it would be a great benefit to the people of Hobart. </para>

                    <para>&#91;3.49&#93;.  -  I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Grant that the negotiations in regard to the .Sandy Bay Rifle Range have dragged on unduly. When I was Minister for Defence the Defence Department submitted certain terms and conditions to the Hobart City Council, which was to provide a certain amount of money to cover the cost of the transfer. Land for a new range had been acquired at Glenorchy; but I believe that the council has had difficulty in financing its share of the work incidental to the proposed transfer. I shall, however, bring the remarks of the honorable senator under the notice of the Minister for Defence. </para>

                <para>I shall also bring before the Minister for Defence the request made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that the suitability of the North-West Bay for the purposes of a naval base be considered. Perhaps, in connexion with this matter, I may be permitted to relate a little story. Honorable senators will remember that a distinguished Admiral visited Australia very many years ago to report on Commonwealth naval defences, one phase of which was the establishment of naval bases. As might have been expected, many letters were sent to the department from all parts of Australia, urging the claims of various ports and harbours for conversion into naval bases, and the old Admiral, who was something of a humourist, said  to me,&#34;I knew that Australia was a vastcountry with great potentialities; but I venture to say that it has more potential naval bases than any other country.&#34; It is, of course, true that we have a considerable number of potential naval bases. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming to that point. The Minister&#39;s reply was sent to the firms in question and later I received another communication so lengthy that I think the firms must employ a large staff of typists. Idiscovered that their second letter was largely a repetition of the first and contained the complaint that the Minister for Trade and Customs had not replied to their communication. When I spoke to the Minister about this matter he said he had forwarded a reply, but the firms continued the correspondence in which they repeated the statements and charges ; he did not see why he should continue sending them the same reply, because he had nothing to add to what he had already said. That, no doubt, explains why later letters from the firms did not elicit a reply from my colleague. There may be something fresh in the representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marwick</inline> but I can assure him that there is no monopoly in respect of wireless valves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has answered that charge. </para>

                <para>With regard to the representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald concerning locomotives for the transAustralian railway, it is a fact, as honorable senators are probably aware, that owing to the re-armament programme in Great Britain, the demand for steel is so great that it is difficult to secure the fulfilment of orders. However, I shall ascertain from the Minister for the Interior if anything can be done to expedite the completion of the order for locomotives, because I realize that existing arrangements interfere with the comfort of travellers on the trans- Australian railway. </para>
