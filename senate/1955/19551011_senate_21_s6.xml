With regard to the publicity programme which is being undertaken in the United Kingdom, it is too early yet to measure the impact which this programme will have on the sales of Australian dried vine fruit. The campaign is just getting under way, but preliminary reports indicate that the launching of the campaign has achieved a gratifying response from United Kingdom traders and consumers. The first of the major drives on dried fruits will be conducted in the pre-Christmas trading period. </para>

            <para>- I think that I need only indicate to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> and other interested Tasmanian senators the fact that the best offices of this Government have been directed towards the maintenance of an adequate shipping service to Tasmania, and that, during the last few years the Tasmanian service has been conducted at an average loss of &#163;250,000 per annum. The record of the Government in respect of Tasmanian shipping services, I suggest, indicates the importance which the Government attaches to this matter and which it will continue to attach to it in all future negotiations. </para>

Will the Minister take up this matter with his colleague, the Minister for Civil Aviation,, with a view to ascertaining whether the runway facilities at Forrest are adequate for emergency landings of large new aircraft, such as the Vickers Viscount and the DC6. which nightly make the journey between Western Australia and South Australia ? </para>

            <para>- The disability of a person admitted to a repatriation hospital must be caused or aggravated by war service, except in two categories. An ex-serviceman receiving 100 per cent, rate of pension for war service may receive medical attention and hospital treatment for disabilities other than those caused by war service to a certain degree. Chronic and similar illnesses are not accepted for such treatment, nor are certain other maladies. A pensioner can be admitted to a repatriation hospital for a period up to thirteen weeks. If the illness from which he is suffering is chronic or is likely to need hospital treatment for a lengthy period, the patient is then evacuated and a bed found for him in another hospital unless the transfer of the patient is likely to have any serious effect upon his health. In such a case, the patient is allowed to remain in the repatriation hospital for a longer period. This provision is not new. It has been in the relevant regulations for a number of years, and applies to disabilities other than those caused by war service. </para>

In general terms I can say that steel is being exported now only to New Zealand and to the Pacific islands, which are regarded as part of Australia for the purpose of supplying steel. Steel is not being exported to any other areas at present. Sometimes there is a surplus of a particular steel product that cannot be absorbed in Australia, New Zealand or the Pacific islands, and it can be exported to other places, but that is not being done at present. I shall obtain detailed figures for the honorable senator, but I am sure that they will verify my general statement. </para>

            <para>. - The bill now before the Senate is an exceedingly comprehensive one dealing with the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth for public purposes. It is a complicated and technical measure containing 64 clauses and covering 2G pages, and it deals with every aspect of transactions in land. This consolidation and revision - I think I may call it that - has been under consideration for a considerable period. I think it was first mentioned in 1952 in another place, when a bill to amend the Lands Acquisition Act &#34;was brought before the House of Representatives. After criticism, that bill was withdrawn and an undertaking was given that this consolidated measure would bc brought before the Senate. That was three years ago. The present measure was introduced in the House of Representatives in November, 1954, and it has lain there, and has been subject to desultory debate, ever since. It has been the subject of much consultation and conference, and it is rather interesting to note that it has been subjected to much amendment in the House of Representatives. I was delighted to find that the Government was prepared to accept amendments from private members. There was a very close debate, and the Government lost nothing from accepting the thoughts and amendments of private members of Parliament, when it found that they were well based. Although the measure is very comprehensive, it cannot specifically cover every situation and contingency that may arise in connexion with the acquisition of land. Accordingly, it is not surprising to find that many clauses confer unlimited power upon the courts to resolve the various intricate situations that may arise where there are conflicting or varying divergent interests in the land itself. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition approves the bill in an overall way. We recognize that there must be power in the Commonwealth to acquire land. When it comes to an exercise of legislative power, one immediately turns to the Constitution to find the head of power from which this purported exercise stems. This is found in placitum (xxxi.). It provides that the </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth is to have power to make laws with regard to the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. That is a power which may be exercised on either a permanent or a temporary basis. It is confined to land alone, although the word &#34;property&#34; has an exceedingly wide connotation. Honorable senators will recall that there have been occasions, particularly during the recent war, when property, apart from land, was acquired on a very wide scale. I remind the Senate of the acquisition of apples and pears, pineapples, ships and many of the munitions and supplies required in the war. All honorable senators will be familiar with the exercise of that power in war-time. </para>
          <para>Not only is there power to acquire land on a permanent basis; there is also power to acquire land temporarily. There is power to enter and examine land as well as merely to occupy it for use in connexion with adjoining land of the Commonwealth. The interests in land are multifarious, divided into leasehold, freehold, easement rights, and licences of various kinds. All of this range of rights and interest in land comes within the ambit of the measure now before us. The Senate will have noticed that there is an obligation to acquire the land &#34; upon just terms &#34;. The words &#34; just terms &#34; constitute a phrase that is well understood, and has been pronounced upon on many occasions by the High Court, and the broad principles of it are incorporated in the bill itself. </para>
          <para>When one realizes that, under the Constitution, this power to acquire land may be exercised only for the purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws, one wonders how far that carries it, because specific powers in the Constitution include the power of appropriation which is extraordinarily wide, and. the limits of which have never been determined with any degree of accuracy. It raises the interesting question of how far the Commonwealth may acquire land in relation to purposes which can be effected only by the appropriation of money itself. This has not been pronounced upon by the court, and I do not propose to pursue it at this stage. </para>
          <para>The bill provides for both compulsory acquisition, and acquisition by agreement. Although acquisition by agreement is not a matter that is disturbing, it is different from compulsory acquisition. That type of action by a government can do great  violence  to an individual or a corporation, ft can disturb lifelong associations and greatly offend personal feelings. It can gravely disrupt the future plans of companies and persons, also family arrangements, and it can ruin or disrupt a business and break through contracts. Therefore, although &#34; just terms &#34; are to be provided by way of compensation, the compulsory acquisition of land is a procedure not to be embarked upon lightly. lt ought to be a last resort. </para>
          <para>One must recognize the right of a government, particularly the Australian Government, in a developing country like our own, to move in and acquire land in key positions. It is rather interesting to note that this bill is probably as pure an example of socialism as could be presented in the Parliament, because in effect it subjugates the rights of the individual or  any  aggregation of individuals to the broad, social interest. It takes a complete and arbitrary power to acquire land, the i wi i  qualifications  being that just terms must be paid and that the acquisition must be relevant to some power exercisable by the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>
          <para>T commend the Government for its acceptance of the principle that the social good must prevail over the rights and aspirations of individuals or any collection of individuals. This bill was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> who, unfortunately, has passed on, and it represents one of his uncompleted tasks. Everybody on this side of the chamber deplores <inline font-style="italic">the fact that he</inline> is not here to steer it through its remaining stages. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, pointed out that the bill is not so much concerned with policy as with administration. Tt does not determine the principles upon which the Government will  embark  upon acquisition, but it does say what procedures shall be followed in the matter of acquisition, the rights of individuals and corporations from whom land is acquired, and generally, it proposes to improve vastly the procedures that have been in operation in the past. It will enlarge the ministerial power in voluntary acquisitions of land. </para>
          <para>Whereas, hitherto, the Minister might, without reference to the Executive Council, acquire land on behalf of the Commonwealth, so long as its value did not exceed &#163;50, that limit is now to be lifted to &#163;500. I think it will be conceded that that action has regard to the increasing values of land in the community. Having regard to the great increases that have taken place in recent years, the Government must accept that as a condemnation of its fiscal and financial policies. It is clear that the value of land has doubled, and in some cases trebled, and that that is one of the factors which is contributing to our present economic difficulties, in that it adds to the cost of goods, and it also adds to the cost of our exports, thereby contributing very largely to our balance of payments dilemma of the moment. All large voluntary acquisitions - that is, those in which the value of the land or interest acquired exceeds &#163;500 - and all compulsory acquisitions, must go to the Executive Council. That appears to ma to be regarded, in the terms of the bill, as some kind of safeguard. I confess that, as one with ministerial experience, I do not altogether subscribe to that view. My experience is that the Executive Council functions at the instance of a Minister, with another Minister making a formal quorum of two, and that the normal procedure at au Executive Council meeting is a very formal one indeed, at which a multiplicity of matters is dealt with, and at which no careful or detailed scrutiny is given to individual items. I think that a far greater safeguard would be provided by giving due publicity to acquisitions; in other words, that they must be gazetted, and that proper notice must be given to the persons whose interests are adversely affected. </para>
          <para>This bill will facilitate greatly the procedures for a claimant whose land has been acquired, either voluntarily or  compulsorily.  He may proceed to litigation concerning his claim with far more speed and less irritation. He will he able to go to the court if the claim he has made is not accepted within three months. To date, he could not go to the court if the Minister had refrained from making an offer - and he might continue to refrain for a matter of years - or had not notified him that he disputed the claim. Now, all that is to be brushed aside, which is excellent. Generally, there is to be a streamlining of procedures to enable a claim for compensation to be determined. There is to be a right of appeal from the court of first instance, and we of the Opposition approve that principle. </para>
          <para>There are to be new provisions concerning interest. There is also to be power of delegation in the Minister, which is not a new provision. The Minister is to be given power to delegate his powers under the act. One of those powers, of course, is the power to acquire land, or an interest in land, where the value of the land does not exceed &#163;500. I think it not unreasonable that there should be delegation. I say that, after having functioned for some lengthy periods as Minister for the Interior, in an acting capacity. During those periods I was rather terrified to find that  armfuls  of documents would be landed on my table, day after day, dealing with acquisitions and relatively minor and formal matters. I appreciate that it is impossible for the Minister for the Interior to keep his finger on the thousand and one things of this nature that are being dealt with month by month and year by year in his department. He must, of course, accept vicarious responsibility. The delegation of power ought not to be made indiscriminately. I should like from the Minister in charge of the bill an indication, if he is in a position to give it, of the type of officer to whom the delegation is proposed to be made. If consideration has been given to that matter, I think the Senate should have information about it. I put forward the view that that power ought not to be passed on to subordinate officers or to very junior officers. </para>
          <para>There are many interesting features of this bill that, I have no doubt, it would be profitable to debate. I feel that the draftsman, and all who have collaborated in producing the measure, have done an exceedingly fine piece of drafting, and that, whilst no doubt there are matters which could be expressed with more particularity, or with more clarity, it is impossible for any draftsman to encompass in one measure all the various complicated situations that may arise. At this stage, I think the best course is for honorable senators, who are interested in particular phases, to deal with them in committee. For the reason that we are not opposing the measure and that we have no amendments to propose, I do not intend, at this stage, to address myself further to it, but shall leave further discussion to my colleagues on this side of the chamber, and to other honorable senators who may wish to speak on particular aspects. </para>
          <para>The Minister in charge of the bill has circulated a schedule of amendments which I think I had the opportunity to peruse in non-printed form. To those, I have no objection. I have only just had placed in my hand proposed amendments, concerning new clauses, to be moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I am delighted to find that what happened in the House of Representatives is still afoot, and that at least one honorable senator is taking a very keen interest in this vastly important measure. I shall certainly address my mind to his amendments with real interest. It looks as though he has proposed quite a number of comprehensive amendments, and 1 think it is appropriate that a lawyer, living in practice, should find many of the difficulties that are not apparent to those who are out of practice and who have not figured in the courts in matters of compensation and acquisition. 1 appreciate that there are many difficulties, and personally, I have felt disposed to place some reliance upon two things: first, the fact that the Constitution demands that just terms shall be granted, but that nothing shall prevent a court from giving an interpretation of those words and determining what constitutes &#34; just terms &#34; ; and secondly, that the broad provisions of the bill throw very wide powers to the court to sort out the intricacies that are sure to arise in the administration of the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>.- I address myself to this bill with some encouragement after the remarks that have been generously made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna),</inline> because the legal profession does have actual experience of the impact of this kind of legislation upon the property of  the  people. With regard to land, we use the term - and it is used in this bill - as meaning all that goes &#34;with the land, including the buildings on it. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has indicated, that land becomes part of a man&#39;s being, from a sentimental point of view, if it is his home, and it becomes part of his economic being if it is his place of business or his farm. There is a very  laudable  body of thought in the community which rejoices in support of the idea that rights of property, considered in proper perspective, are the great safeguard of the standard of living of the people. Those rights are valued as precious by those who hold them, and I abjure any attempt to use them to the detriment of the public interest. </para>

          <para>When the Constitution was framed, it was realized that the new Commonwealth Parliament must be vested with a power to acquire property. The fathers of the Constitution very thoughtfully provided that that power should be exercised only on just terms. Those three little words  have  come to be interpreted by the High Court of Australia as a real safeguard against the acquisition of property on unjust terms.  Credit.  is due to those who have administered the relevant legislation because, over the years, undoubtedly a disposition has been shown by the courts to be entirely just to the dispossessed property owners whatever their property might be. It is idle and, indeed, wasteful of time to refer to the various principles that have been laid down by the courts to define compensation based upon just terms, but the Constitution requires that any land taken over compulsorily by the Commonwealth shall be acquired upon that basis. </para>
          <para>When this bill was introduced, reference was made to a recent decision of the High Court of Australia in the case of Grace Brothers. In that case, the Lands Acquisition Act of the Common wealth was challenged from the point of view of its constitutionality on the basis that it did not provide just terms. Part of that attack was founded upon the view that interest in proper measure was denied to the owner. The High Court rejected that contention, and pronounced that the legislation conformed to the Constitution. Although the legislation survived that attack, the Parliament should be grateful that the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department has seen fit to remould the measure and improve the machinery procedures of the bill to enable the legislation to operate with less delay and more convenience than some of the provisions of the old legislation required. </para>
          <para>Having said that, I wish to address myself to the rights of the land-owner. I remind the Senate that the procedures authorized by this bill are simply these: The Minister, in the case of land valued at less than  &#163;500,  and the GovernorinCouncil in the case of land in excess of that value, can deprive you or me of our property simply by signing a document or a proclamation of acquisition. </para>

            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has stated from his own experience as a Minister, the Minister in a centralized government like ours feels obliged to endorse what the department has done, and I would suggest that it is undeniable that, in  99  cases out of every  100,  the Minister does not know what property he is acquiring. No doubt he would inform himself in matters of importance, but I suggest that nobody could urge successfully that there is any real distinction between the act of the Governor-in-Council and the act of a Minister. The fact is that a Minister can dispossess me or anybody else of our property, simply by signing a document, putting it through the Executive Council and gazetting it. There need not be any further procedure or safeguard than this : When the proclamation has been gazetted, it is required to be laid upon the table in each House of the Parliament, and either House may pass a resolution disallowing the proclamation. Thereupon, the proposed acquisition is nullified. Honorable senators who have sat in this chamber for many years know with what complete formality that procedure is treated, and whether it acts as anything more than a formal safeguard for the owner. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When the proclamation has been dealt with in that way I, instead of owning my property, shall be entitled, under this bill and the Constitution, to claim from the Crown compensation in terms of money based upon just terms. Anybody with experience of land valuation cases knows the disputes and differences that are engendered with perfect bona fides, and how those differences tend to be prolonged. It is a costly business where the landowner is compelled to employ valuers, expert witnesses and members of the legal profession, because the fees of all of them - and I make no discrimination between valuers and counsel - are not insignificant. Naturally, the landowner is hesitant about going to court because the Crown pays into the court, or into the Treasury, a certain amount which it fixes as the value. The question then is whether the true value, to be determined by the court on just terms, exceeds that amount. The mere troublesome process of litigation deters the landowners, in a contest with the Government, from going to the courts and following the case right through to the bitter end. </para>

              <para>- That is another point with which we are not troubled, fortunately, in this connexion. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MeKenna</inline> has stated, the process concerned is capable of disturbing people&#39;s lives to their very foundations. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it is time that we considered the safeguards that are proper in order to ensure that these procedures are followed through with justice. I can call to mind cases that have caused the most intense hardship to the people concerned, especially in times of swiftly changing values, not only in the federal sphere but in the sphere of the States also. I remember a case in which a man and his wife who, having settled down in about their seventieth year after the husband had spent his life working arduously as a miner, had their cottage taken without notice, and no persuasion could induce the government concerned to relinquish that acquisition. In my own State that case caused great public outcry, and it was thought to be a real injustice. I mention that matter because I want it to be clearly understood that I do not speak primarily on behalf of the big owner who has the money to fight the Government to a finish. I have in mind another case concerning one of the most beautiful farming properties in the neighbourhood of a certain city in Tasmania. The property has been improved to the Nth degree, from the point of view of pasture and appearance, and the Government has issued a notice that it will acquire that property. For what purpose? In this instance it is for the purpose of housing. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The Government, before signing the proclamation to acquire) should give to the landowner 2S days&#39; notice of its intention to acquire. In explanation of that, may I say that not only governments have been given this power. In the industrial revolution of last century, when railways companies, harbour companies, waterworks companies, gas companies and other public utilities were establishing themselves for the public good, a general act was passed called the Land Clauses Act, and many special acts were passed in relation to particular projects, those acts incorporating the provisions of the Land  Clauses  Act, which gave certain powers to the various public utilities. For instance, if a railway company had the problem of establishing a certain railway line, it was empowered to acquire the necessary land. But in all those procedures Hie very first step to be taken was by the public utility concerned, which had to give to the owner a notice to quit. I shall  deal  with this matter more specifically in the committee stage, but I am asking the Senate to consider this aspect of land Requisition by the Australian Government, and especially to consider whether it is reasonable that the Minister should be required to give notice in writ ing to the land-owner for 28 days before the signing of &#39; &#39;the proclama&#39;tion that effects the acquisition of &#39;the land. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Another matter that the Senate might permit us to discuss is this : In relation to the acquisition of land, recent experience has disclosed ;the possibility of fraud on the part of acquiring a  uthorities.  We know that in these land transaction? there is great scope for secret payments, and it occurs to me that when a power that is arbitrary in its nature, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> described it, is entrusted to the recommendation of some official in the Department of the Interior, and i1exercised by nothing other than a signature on a piece of paper in the Minister&#39;s office, which is passed through the Executive Council and then gazetted, unless there is an opportunity for those concerned to ventilate publicly any allegations that they make of skullduggery here, or preference there, or some ill-will operating in regard to the next property, it is likely that injustice will occur. I am a great believer in the healthy practice of exposing matters concerning public transactions to the fresh air of public debate. That is one of the few values left in this chamber. The public has a conscience, and the public  conscience in the Australian community is a pretty fair index of where the  public  interest lies, once the matter has been fairly debated. </para>
          <para>There is a section in the New South Wales legislation which provides that in the case of an acquisition of importance, such as of a property valued at more than &#163;5,000, the land-owner shall have the right, within 28 days, to request a public inquiry as to whether that acquisition is in the public interest. I am not wedded to the figure of &#163;5,000: I merely used that figure as an illustration. That inquiry could be presided over by the  chairman  of the Land Valuation Board constituted under the Land Tax Assessment Act, an office still in existence and adorned by the present occupant, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr-. J.</inline> F. N&#34;. Murray. Apart from holding that office he, personally, would be an ideal man to decide not merely  questions of value but also matters which depend upon an intuitive discernment and consideration of public interest. He is an ideal person to preside over such, an inquiry, and I have no, doubt that his successor in due course would also do equal credit to the situation. I offer the view to the Senate that such a procedure would give a real sense of satisfaction to an owner who had a grievance. The only effect of that inquiry would be that the report that was prepared as a result of it would be laid on the table of each chamber of the Parliament together with the proclamation so that the Parliament then could, on that information, discharge its duty to determine whether or not the particular acquisition was in the public interest. Neither of those procedures would impede or prejudice the effectiveness of government acquisition of land, and as they would provide an opportunity for the public interest to be consulted, outside the Minister&#39;s office they would be great improvements upon the present arbitrary procedure. </para>
          <para>The reason why I think we should give consideration to these matters is because, as we all know, the scope of the operation of this bill has expanded terrifically over the last 50 years. The functions for which the Federal Government acquiresland to-day are naturally, and quite properly, very much more extensive and widespread than they were in 1900. This act now has a greater impact on the people. It affects very many more people to-day than it did years ago. Therefore, any improvement we can make in procedure will be in the interest of proper recognition of rights of property in land in the spirit in which the ordinary villager can call his cottage his castle and enjoy the security that British law accords to him within the confines of his property, a security which is one of the most precious possessions that a man can have. </para>

          <para class="block">Minister should be authorized to determine the compensation payable. Having had experience of law courts and of arbitration I am bound to say that any person who has a right to claim compensation should have the right to agree with the Minister, if the Minister is so authorized by this Parliament, that his compensation be determined by an arbitrator rather than by a court. Procedures of a court involve delay and are often more costly than arbitration ; and some people prefer arbitration as a more satisfactory and convenient way of adjusting these matters. That proposition should need no argument to win support. </para>

              <para>- That is so. Before concluding I should like to focus some attention on clause 33 of the bill. I have circulated no printed amendment to this clause, but I hope the committee will deal with it at some length. At this stage, I simply ask whether any honorable senator would sell me his property to-morrow on the terms of deferred payment expressed in that clause. We should consider whether in the case of a claim deferred for two years interest should be payable at a lower rate than in the case of a claim deferred for more than two years. It will be noticed that interest at 8 per cent, is provided for if a claim is settled within two years, and at 4$ per cent, if the determination of compensation takes longer than two years. I refer to that clause, without putting forward any definite proposition, in the hope that my colleagues or other honorable senators will take an interest in that point before the bill reaches the committee stage. I do not wish to delay the passage of the bill by making a further comment. I have put my observations in this form in order to detach the bill from the category which concerns only lawyers, and so that honorable senators will realize that the bill makes a very important impact upon the people&#39;s possessions, possessions which often represent a lifetime&#39;s work. Therefore, as we review this legislation to-day for the first time in fifty years we should prescribe procedures which will be improvements upon those prescribed in the principal act. </para>

            <para>. - I arn not sure whether the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> would like me to move for the adjourn  al  icnt of this debate in order to give honorable senators an opportunity to consider the suggestions made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> The amendments he has foreshadowed have just been circulated, and they appear to show that there is a rift in the lute on the Government side of the Senate. Judging by interjections and the reactions to the dramatic utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> the bill <inline font-style="italic">a*</inline> drafted might not go through. Perhaps the Government should give earnest consideration to some of the matters that have been brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> This debate has shown that a deep cleavage exists in the ideas of Government supporters about the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I heartily agree with some of the propositions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> For example, I can see no reason why there should not be a provision inserted in the bill, under which notice could be given to the owner of land when the Commonwealth wishes to acquire it. The period of 2S days&#39; notice suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> seems to be reasonable, although there would be no objection perhaps to making it fourteen days&#39; notice. I have had some contact with people whose land has been acquired by governments, and I remember one particular case where the land was taken over by the Federal Government. In that case, a man was renting the land from the owner. The land was acquired by the Department of Civil Aviation and, although the owner received compensation, the person who was renting thu land from the owner got nothing at all. in spite of the fact that he suffered considerably by having the land taken over by the Commonwealth. In a case such as that, if notice of resumption were given by the Commonwealth to the owner, the owner could make some arrangement for compensation t&#39;o the tenant. Perhaps the tenant could put in a claim for the damages that he would suffer if the land were acquired. </para>
          <para>Another matter that came to my attention was the acquisition of some land at the beginning of World War II. for some unspecified purpose. That land was not used at all by the Commonwealth. It was later disposed of by the Commonwealth, but the man from whom it has been acquired had no say in its disposal, and was not even given first offer of the land. If notice of acquisition were given to land-owners, they would know what was going to happen to their land and could institute some form of inquiry about why the Commonwealth wanted the land. Of course, such a procedure would delay the acquisition of land, and if it were required urgently the delay might operate against the interests of the nation. Nevertheless, I believe that in most cases the delay would allow some sort of inquiry into whether it was really necessary to acquire the land. </para>
          <para>Some of the amendments proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> were canvassed in another place, but the Government indicated that it was not prepared to alter this bill in any way. I suppose that the Government&#39;s attitude will be similar in this chamber. It is a usual attitude of governments to introduce legislation of the kind that it wants, and to take no notice at all of the wishes of anybody else. I do not blame the Government for that attitude, because it is common to all governments. Nevertheless, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> mentioned that the Government&#39;s attitude indicated that it would make some political capital out of the attitude of the Opposition if the legis-hi ti on were challenged. I am not opposed to the measure, although I again direct the attention of the Government to the cases that T have mentioned, and I suggest that all persons who have any interest in land that is acquired by the Commonwealth should get fair compensation for the loss of their interest in the land. I also suggest that, if the Government discovers, after having acquired land or property, that it is no longer needed, the original owner should be given an opportunity of taking it back at the price the Government paid him. </para>
          <para>I arn well aware that the Government acquired land years ago for specific purposes, but has never used it, and that it is now much more valuable than it  was when it was acquired. Even so, the original owner could be given an opportunity to take it back at a fair present-day valuation, if the Government no longer requires it. Honorable senators well know that for many owners the cost of taking a case to the courts to discover the reasonable value of their property is quite prohibitive. The land was sold, but it was not offered to the original owner at the price paid to him for it. The land was put on the market and sold at a much higher price than the original owner paid for it, and also for more than he received for it from the department. Some provision should be made to meet such cases. The original owner should be given the opportunity to buy the land back for the sum paid to him for it by the Government. If necessary, there could be some time limit, say five years, or something of that kind. I would not object to a provision of t,hat nature. </para>

              <para>- There may be cases of that kind, but those I have in mind relate to land on which the Government has made no improvements whatever. If improvements have been put on the land, naturally the purchaser of thu land should be required to pay for them; but those are not the cases I have in mind. I am speaking of land that has been acquired by the Government, but not used, and when found to be redundant has been sold at a profit. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The only other objection I have to the bill relates to the delegation of authority, to which the Leader of the Opposition drew attention. The Government ought to give consideration to this matter of the delegation of authority by a Minister, or the Governor-General, as the case may be. There have been instances of a person to whom certain powers have been delegated being made scapegoat, while the Minister who has delegated that authority goes free. There should be no delegation of power by a Minister where he can exercise his authority without any trouble at all. I admit that it may be necessary to delegate authority to some one in places like the Northern Territory, but even there there is an Administrator. In my opinion, there should be no delegation of authority to any person below one holding the position of Administrator of the Northern Territory. There should not be any delegation of authority in these matters by the Government to any person with less authority than that possessed by a Minister. Let me give an instance of the kind of case I have in mind. The Civil Aviation Department wants land for civil aviation purposes, and the Minister for the Interior, or the Minister for Civil Aviation, as the case may be, &#39;delegates his authority to some other person. In that way, the Minister would not come into the transaction at all. There have been numbers of cases in which the civil aviation authorities have acquired more land than they needed. In some cases trouble has arisen about approaches to such land. In the House of Representatives references have been made to complaints by owners of land in the vicinity of aerodromes that their property has depreciated in value because of its proximity to aerodromes. These people have no redress. There is no one, except the delegated authority, with whom they can deal ; and if he will not do anything, the result is that these land-owners lose money. Unfortunately, it is a  losing  proposition to own land in the vicinity of civil aviation fields. When land in excess of civil aviation requirements is acquired, but not used, and is never likely to be used because of advances made in civil aviation, and the land is then sold, it is possible for the person exercising the delegated authority to get into hot water, while the Minister escapes. The Minister ought to accept full responsibility for the acquisition of all land required by the Government. There should be no delegation of power at all, giving other persons authority to acquire land in the name of the Minister. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - It may be more convenient to leave until the committee stage is reached some of&#39; the matters that have been raised during the second-reading debate on this bill, but there are some general observations that I should like to make on the matters that have been mentioned by honorable senators. In the first place. I remind the Senate that this bill does not lay clown. any new principle in relation to the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth. This is a consolidating measure, which brings up to date legislation that has operated in the Commonwealth since about 1906. The methods of acquisition of land provided for in this bill are those which have been in operation in relation to the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth for over 50 years. When dealing with this subject, it is important r,o bear in mind, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> pointed out, that the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth is subject to the constitutional guarantee that such land shall be acquired on just terms. It is true, I suppose,  that almost any individual who becomes the subject of an acquisition order served on him by any government, more particularly a small property owner will feel very dissatisfied, and no amount of compensation will satisfy him if he feels, perhaps with some justification, that he has been unjustly deprived nf his home, or farm, or some other property to which he attaches a particular sentimental value. I suggest that, in the case of such people, no terms relating to the acquisition of their property would <inline font-style="italic">overcome</inline> that  feeling of injustice. No doubt that kind of thing could happen to any individual of this Senate if some part of his property became subject to acquisition payments. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The general scheme of the act, as it now operates, and will continue to operate if this bill becomes law, is that, first of all, a notice is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> which has the legal effect of compulsorily acquiring the property. After that proclamation is published, notice is given to the owner, and under a provision contained in the act and in this bill the compulsory acquisition may be- disallowed by either House of Parliament. Although honorable senators may say that this power of disallowance is never exercised, the protection is provided in the act. A person who receives notice of acquisition nan approach his local parliamentary representative, and if that honorable member feels that the acquisition is unjust he can bring the whole of the circumstances before either House of Parliament.  If  Parliament is not sitting, a time is specified - a certain number of sitting days in the next session of Parliament - within which he may do so. That procedure has operated for 50 years under this legislation, and, taken by and large, has given satisfaction. I concede that complete satisfaction will never be given to the owner who is deprived of property which he values when he discovers that it is to be taken over by the Government to be used for a purpose which he considers to be far less worthy than that towhich he was putting it. But if a person&#39;s property has been subject to a compulsory order he can, by the simple process I have referred to, bring the whole matter before either House of Parliament. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but if the acquisition were disallowed the Government&#39;s right to occupation would be negatived. It is important to have regard to the fact that acquisitions can be made by the Commonwealth for any of the purposes for which the Commonwealth has power to make laws. The Commonwealth possesses many important powers, and it may find it necessary from time to time to acquire land. </para>

              <para>- The Commonwealth must acquire land under this act for defence purposes whether in time of war or not. The property still has to be acquired on just terms. It is true that in war-time a series of regulations can be passed to facilitate the acquisition of land, but they would still have to provide for just terms. All that could be done in those regulations would be, perhaps, to shorten the times in which notices might have to be given to owners because of particular circumstances. Honorable senators should not overlook the fact that even in peace-time land may have to be acquired for defence purposes, and it may not always be possible or advisable to give public notice of the precise reason for acquiring that laud. One could imagine circumstances in which a Minister felt that it was desirable for some important defence project to acquire a piece of land, but it might be considered as being against the public interest to disclose what were the precise objectives that were to he achieved on that land when it was acquired. It seems more appropriate that a compulsory acquisition should be disallowed by either House of Parliament than that it should become the subject of inquiry by a board. Members of Parliament are more likely to handle the matter well than would be a board of inquiry constituted on the lines suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline></para>

              <para>- I should doubt that. It may be that it would be worthwhile to have a look at sub-clause (4.), to see whether it could not usefully be tightened up a little, but the purpose of it, whether it is expressed effectively or not. is quite sensible and logical - that either House of Parliament can disallow an acquisition, but not an acquisition which the whole Parliament has, in fact, approved. Whether that position is as adequately expressed in the clause as the honorable senator might like it to be expressed is another matter, and is one of those things that we might usefully discuss. </para>

          <para>The second matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred was the suggestion which, of course, is not un associated with his proposal for inquiry by a board of inquiry, that the owner of the land should get a notice to treat. I take this as being based, to some extent, upon procedure which has operated for some considerable time in England under the Land Clauses Act. If honorable senators look at the position under the Land Clauses Act in England, they will find that the notice to treat provisions are of a rather different character from the kind of thing contemplated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in his amendment, because the notice to treat, as I understand it, under the Land Clauses Act in England starts a process which ends, without any approval or disapproval by the owner of the land, in his losing the land and his receiving compensation. In other words, it is much the same process as we have, except that you do not, at the start, commence with a proclamation of compulsory acquisition. You give a notice to treat, but the notice to treat does not just mean that the owner is invited to come along and have a talk with you about whether he will or will not sell his land. The operation of the notice to treat is an indication to him that he is called upon to give particulars of his land and to negotiate as to its purchase, but if he does not carry on successful negotiations for its purchase, then the law will operate so as to leave him, in the end. with money compensation for his land. </para>

              <para>- The process we have at present has been in existence for 50 years and has operated pretty satisfactorily. I suggest that there may well be cases - not many, but some cases - in which it is absolutely essential that the Commonwealth should have a particular piece of land, that it should have it quickly, and that it should have complete legal title to the land. If, prior to any of that, happening, the Commonwealth first of all had to give notice to the owner, and give him an opportunity to treat, and all the rest of it, it might and could impose, in some circumstances, unnecessary and dangerous restraints upon what might be the exercise of a very important power. Reference has been made to the provision for notice to treat under the land laws in England. That is largely the sort of measure that would operate in the case of private companies to enable them to acquire land, for example, for railway purposes. </para>

              <para>- I agree, but it is difficult to put into the same category the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth Parliament for defence purposes and the acquisition of land by a railway company for the purpose of building a railway. They fall into different categories. I suggest that it would be unfortunate to insert limitations, which would apply in every case, because the Commonwealth may be called upon to acquire land in the public interest without being able to say the precise purpose to which the land will be put, and it may have to act with some speed. I repeat that it would be unfortunate to insert, such limitations when the fact is that the existing legislation has operated for more than 50 years without much opposition from the public. Further, the legislation does provide reasonable safeguards against unjust acquisition by enabling the matter to be dealt with, in appropriate cases, by the representatives of the people in either House of Parliament. </para>

          <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> made some reference to the delegation provisions which are provided for under clause 61. It is true that there is a wide power of delegation. That power has always been vested in the Minister administering the act and the Attorney-General. Both have wide powers. In relation to the power of delegation that I have, I believe that it should be delegated to the principal legal officers in the States. I believe that that would be true of any Attorney-General. </para>
          <para class="block">In other words, it would be exercised by the Crown Solicitor, the Solicitor-General or their deputies throughout the Com.monwealth. It would be for the purpose  of&#34; enabling them to execute, on behalf -of the Commonwealth, documents about which they knew far more than the Minister himself could possibly know - -documents covering transactions and dealings in which .they themselves were concerned on behalf of the Commonwealth. How the power of delegation of the Minister for the Interior would be used would be a matter for the Minister concerned at the time. I should think that the power of delegation there would be limited, probably to the chief property -officers in the States, perhaps the head of the department and one or two other persons in a similar position. To a large extent, that would be done for the purpose of relieving the Ministers of the tedious task of signing a number of documents of which they could know nothing. In the long run, it is far better that the person who knows something about the matter before him should be charged with the responsibility of performing the act of signing documents.

If the debate could be adjourned over the dinner hour, the committee might be able to make better progress, and the Opposition would have a better chance to study and follow the proposals of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I suggest that in the meantime we consider one or two other minor bills. </para>

            <para>. -  The bill now before the Senate deals with the acquisition of land in the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay. The position is entirely different from that which arises under the Lands Acquisition Act. There is absolute power in this Parliament to do as it wishes in the Australian Capital Territory. It is not bound, in acquiring land in the territory, to have regard to the necessity for providing just terms. I am speaking from memory and am open to correction, but I think it is section 122 of the Constitution  that  confers this exceedingly  wide power. The Landa Acquisition Bill chat we were considering a while ago will have complete application in the Territories, with a qualification which L shall point out in a moment. </para>

          <para>This bill seeks to amend five acts, the Seat of Government Act 1908, the Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909- </para>
          <quote>
            <para>L938,  the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910-1947, the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1930-  L955,  and the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915. It came as a shock to me, when I perused these acts that are sought to be amended, to find that in the Australian Capital Territory at present cbe basis of acquisition of land, if the Commonwealth decides to acquire it compulsorily, is to be taken as the value as at the Sth October, 1908. Later, that was altered so that the basis was the value as at the Sth October, 1908, with the value of improvements effected in the meantime, or the improvements as at the date of acquisition! Land in Jervis Bay, if acquired, has to be acquired at the value of the land as at the 1st January, 1914. Those two provisions, like all laws that are unjust, have fallen into disuse and contempt, and I find that, despite the fact that the law is as I have mentioned to the Senate, such acquisitions as have taken place in the Australian Capital Territory and in Jervis Bay have proceeded by ignoring those statutory provisions entirely, and, by and large, when an acquisition has occurred just terms have in fact been given. That may be open to question in one or two cases, but it is a matter of substantial justice being done and the statutes being ignored. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>When I refer to the bill, I am disturbed at a provision in clause 5 (1), where a new section is sought to be inserted. The proposed new section reads - 7a. The application  of  the Lands Acquisition \ct inn&#34;) in relation to land in the Territory does not prevent or affect the making or operation  of  a provision of an Ordinance or other law  of  the Territory (including an Ordinance or other law  made  before the commencement  of  this section) for or in relation to the resumption  if  land held under leases granted hy or on behalf of the Crown. </para>
          <para class="block">If  I may paraphrase that somewhat  loosely,  it says that despite the fact that the Lands Acquisition Act, imposing an obligation upon the Commonwealth to grant just terms, is applied in the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay,, nevertheless the Commonwealth in those places may, by ordinance or regulation, in relation to any land which is held on lease from the Crown, make any provision it likes, whether on just terms or not. That puts it crudely. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I meant to indicate that. This clause with which 1 am dealing applies to the resumption of land held under Crown leases. I point out to the Senate that the great bulk of land in these two areas is so held under leases. There would be some freehold in the Australian Capital Territory at the time when the Territory became the property of the Commonwealth, but thegreat bulk of the land is let under lease, in the case of agricultural leases for 25 years, or, in the case of town and home sites, for 99 years. If the great bulk of the land is so held under Crown leases, then when we deal with the resumption of land under Crown lease we are making a provision that affects the bulk of the land in the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay. The proposed new section that I have quoted purports to say that although the Lands Acquisition Act does apply in the Territory, that is not to affect any ordinance or regulation that may be </para>

          <para>Mia de in the Territory regarding the resumption of land held under Crown lease. I point out that that clearly confers upon the administration the power to resume the great bulk of the land in the Territory, without being under the obligation to provide just terms, and in fact expressly negativing that obligation. </para>
          <para>Due to the courtesy of the appropriate Ministers I have had the advantage of taking this matter up with the officers of the departments, and with the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s officers. When I first saw that provision I put my view to them, and the Attorney-General has been good enough to indicate that the Government accepts that view, and that the position ought not to be created under the legislation that we are now considering, in which the Commonwealth should be free to provide other than just terms in relation to the great bulk nf land in this Territory if it is resumed. Accordingly, the Senate will </para>

              <para>- There must have been a mistake in the distribution, but the amendment I shall put to the Senate when that later bill is being dealt with is in exactly similar terms. There is a similar difficulty, and there will be an exactly similar amendment. In view of the  acquiesence  of the Government in what I have mooted and in what I am putting to the Senate, I do not propose to labour this matter further, other than to draw attention to the provisions of the leases in the Australian Capital Territory. There is no provision for the resumption of leases relating to town sites or home sites, but in relation to grazing and agricultural leases of 25 years, there are really very stringent provisions. I refer to clause 3 on page 8 of the lease that is used for that purpose. It is a very terrifying document and it smacks of the vintage of 1908. It is exceedingly verbose and exceedingly severe in its terms. I do not know whether any of the lawyers in this chamber have had a look at it, but &#91; make the comment to the appropriate Minister that he should consider redrafting this lease from the point of view of both brevity and clarity. </para>

              <para>- I would suggest it is awfully coercive when one gets no lease unless he signs this document, and there is uo compensation at all in respect of the land once it is taken from the lessee. There is a very generous provision that once the land is taken from him he has seven days in which to remove his fixtures. 1 1 is not obligatory upon the lessee to take them away. It very kindly says he does not have to, but he has seven days in which to remove them and if he does any damage in taking them away he has to make that good to the Commonwealth. Need I argue any further to the Senate that somebody ought to have a good look at this lease from the viewpoint of drafting, simplicity and clarity; and, secondly, as I said earlier, from the viewpoint of providing something far more just. </para>

              <para>- I have come to the conclusion after reading this document that so far as rural areas are concerned people blithely enter into these agreements in the belief that Canberra has been well settled and its development determined for many years. They are confident that the=e classes will not he invoked and that they will  iW V  deprived nf their land. When one looks at some of the prices that are realised on the sales of leases in the Australian Capital Territory one comes to the conclusion  that  there must be a lot of trusting people  who  are confident that these clauses will  not  be invoked. </para>

              <para>- Just prior to the suspension of the sitting, I was referring to the ordinances and regulations made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act, and my remarks applied to agricultural leases in the Australian Capital Territory, which are for the term of  25  years only as against a term of  99  years for the leases of town and home sites. Another point of distinction is that whereas the regulations and ordinances relating to rural leases in the Territory mention resumptions of those leases, there is no provision in the ordinances, or in the leases relating to town and home sites, for probable resumption. Apparently, it is not contemplated that the Commonwealth will need to resume home and business sites. It seems that they are in areas that have been predetermined, and the areas are not likely to be disturbed for Commonwealth purposes. </para>

          <para>The whole matter indicates that there should be a complete review of the rural leases, in the ordinances, in the regulations and in the leases themselves. The ordinances dealing with agricultural leases contain no provision whatsoever for resumptions,, yet the regulations deal particularly with that matter. It seems that that particular provision in the regulations is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the ordinances. That is apparently the view of the Government, because in one of the clauses of the bill now before the Senate there is a provision to validate all that has been done under the ordinances and the regulations. By and large, no government has anything to be proud of regarding the state in which the ordinances, the regulations and the question of resumptions in the Territory generally remain. </para>
          <para>In the committee stages of this measure I propose to move to the effect that, except where there is. an agreement in a lease between the Commonwealth and the lessee to provide for terms and resumptions - which is a matter of agreement between the two. parties - we should write into the. bill a mandatory requirement that just terms shall be given in the event of a resumption. I have discussed this matter with officers of the Department of the Interior, and with the Attorney-General. Those authorities have acknowledged the need for an amendment of the character that I propose to&#39; move, and have been good enough to collaborate with me in drawing up an amendment which is mutually satisfactory to us.

              <para>- No, it would not. lt. purports to preserve all rights to all parties under the existing leases. This is not the proper place to break into a contract between parties. I believe that the whole matter of the leases in the Australian Capital Territory that have been made under the ordinances should be reviewed. I gave to the Senate examples of the enormous prolixity of the language in the leases, and a description of their provisions and how adverse they are to a lessee. Indeed, I have no hesitation in saying that they are unfair. I suggest that there should be at least a provision in the lease that if the whole oi&#39; any portion of the land leased is resumed, the lessee should have the option to require the Commonwealth to - take over the improvements at a value to be determined on just terms. That should certainly be written into the leases, and I. believe that after the debate has concluded these leases will not long remain as they are. The leases are due for review and should have written into them a. provision, or provisions, that will ensure that if resumption takes place it shall take place only on just terms - the sort of terms that this Parliament is in process of making applicable to land outside the Territories. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>It is not a true answer to my argument to say that the parties have agreed to the leases, because the lessees would not be given leases unless they accepted the present form of agreement. Indeed, I suggest that there are very few lessees in the Territory who have read their leases or understood the import of them. I venture to say that the  great  majority of the lessees, if they attempted to read their leases, would be asleep before they had got half way through them. Land in the rural and agricultural areas of the Australian Capital Territory is not likely to be required by Commonwealth authorities, because the shape of the city has been determined many years in advance. Therefore, the people who have taken the leases have a strong expectation that their tenancies will not be disturbed, despite what is in the agreement, and despite the enormous power of confiscation that remains vested in the Commonwealth. I suggest that this is not a. proper place to adjust the contract between the two parties. That is a matteroutside the bill altogether. I propose only to allow the leases to remain pending:the consideration that I hope will takeplace, and also to ensure that resumptionsshall take place upon just terms. </para>

In the caseof a lease, for a term of 25 years, containing a provision that the Commonwealth may resume the land at any time,. I believe that fair compensation should be paid if the Commonwealth resumes the  land before the expiry of 25 years. That compensation should have relation.. to the length of time by which the lease is cut short of the full 25 years. I realize that if a person has a lease for- 25 years, and the lease runs its full term, the lessee obtains no compensation forany improvements he has effected. I understand that under the legislation in force in one of the States, if a building  iserect,ed  ou Crown land for which a lease - has been granted, it must run its term, but there are other instances of Crown lands being let on the basis of a permissive occupancy, that is, for a term of a month, or perhaps three or six; months-- </para>

            <para>- I am speaking of eases with which I am acquainted, where the permissive occupancy isgenerally for one month at a time, because the rent is paid on a monthly basis. If, for some reason, the occupier of the land desires to leave it, or if  any  buildings on it cannot be used for thepurposes for which they were erected, those buildings automatically become the property of the Crown. That is the position in relation to a large number of&#34; factories on the south side of the river Yarra opposite Flinders-street stationMelbourne, and I take it that the position is the same in the Australian Capital&#39; Territory. I believe that if a person has a lease for 25 years, he is entitled toerect whatever buildings he desires to-* erect on that land, because he knows full well that at the end of the term of&#34;  the lease those buildings will revert to the Crown. If, however, the Commonwealth, for some reason, desires to resume either the whole or a portion of that area before the 25 years&#39; term has expired, the lessee should be compensated for any building he has erected on the land. I trust that the lease will stand as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. I marvel at the department allowing such a lease to be printed and submitted to the people. I hope that the other point that I have mentioned will be rectified to cover those who desire new leases, or a renewal of their leases when they expire. </para>

            <para>. - The bill now before the Senate deals with the acquisition of land in the Northern Territory, and is a twin of the bill relating to the acquisition of land in the Australian Capital Territory with which the Senate has just dealt, and consequently much of what I said on the earlier bill is applicable also to this measure. There is, however, less legislation operative in the Northern Territory. Section 9 of the principal act, which this bill is to repeal, provides that the Lands Acquisition Act shall apply to land in the Northern Territory, but that in determining compensation for land resumed, &#34; the value of that land shall be taken not to exceed the unimproved value of the land, or the interest therein of the -owner, at the date of the passing of this -act &#34;, which is a date in 1910. It is an act which is of ancient vintage and has long been due for an overhaul. The act has been disregarded by the administration ; I am informed that resumptions have taken place, not on the basis of the statute, which is mandatory, but on the basis of something as near as the department can get to just terms. As an ethical matter, one cannot quarrel with the action taken by the department in deviating from the words of the statute, but it is a bad thing when practice and the statute are so far apart. The opportunity is now being taken to adjust that matter, and the Lands Acquisition Act will, in due course, apply in the Northern Territory. As the bulk of the land there is leased, we run into the same difficulty in this bill as we encountered in the earlier measure. If honorable senators will refer to clause 3 (2.) they will find that there is a similar provision. The operation of ordinances and regulations in relation  to  crown leases which are resumed in the Territory shall carry on, and the application of the Lands Acquisition Act is negatived concerning that. The principle  of  &#34; just terms &#34; which we have sought to apply throughout the whole of Australis should not be denied in relation to resumptions of land in the Northern Territory. The principle has been determined,  first  of all, by our Constitution in relation  to  the whole of Australia, apart from the territories. It is a. matter of justice. The principle is well defined both in the Land? Acquisition Act and by the High Court. At the appropriate stage, I propose  to  move an amendment similar to that which I moved in relation to the Australian Capital Territory. My arguments in itfavour are identical. </para>

            <para>. - During his brief remarks at the secondreading stage, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> said that, in recent years, the department had not operated in accordance with the act in relation to lands leased in the Northern Territory. If that is so, an amendment should be inserted in this hill to validate any action taken by the department not in accordance with the statute. Although it may have acted in accordance with moral justice by reasoning that it was not fair to put a 1910 price on land leased in 1950, I ask the Minister whether it is not proper to make provision in this bill to validate what was done? </para>

            <para>. -  It is clear that even if too much compensation were paid the validity of any acquisition is not affected. Consequently, there is no need to insert an amendment to validate, retrospectively, any acquisition. Opinions may vary as to the value of a piece of land to-day, as compared with 1911. Commonwealth money spent in this way has been spent in accordance with parliamentary appropriations, and there is no need to put into legal form any action that might otherwise be regarded as invalid. </para>

I am more impressed with the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> But once an act is in operation its provisions should be carried out by the departmen tal officers administering it. If,  in this  case, certain land is leased and  the  act provides that the price must be somewhere in conformity with the 1910 value and that is now outmoded, surely  the  Minister must see the wisdom of amending the act to bring it up to date. If  this  sort of practice can happen in one small matter it can happen in others. I  am  not doubting the honesty of the officers administering this act, but if our laws are outmoded it  is  only right that  they  should be brought up to date, and  that  can be done without much trouble. </para>

        <para>I am very much indebted to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> for his remarks and observations on this clause, and I want to occupy the time of the committee with a very dispassionate discussion of the arguments presented by him. I repeat that this clause simply requires that, as a preliminary to the proclamation of acquisition, the Minister, before recommending the actual acquisition, should give notice to the owner. It amazes me to think that the most excellent intellect in the chamber could invent an excuse to evade the force of such a simple statement as that. That the owner should be entitled to be notified of the Minister&#39;s intention to acquire the land seems to me to be common courtesy to be accorded even by sovereigns. </para>
        <para>As I pointed out this afternoon, when Parliament, in implementation of the great campaign of expansion during the industrial revolution of the last century, accorded specific legislative powers to public utilities to acquire land, it did so by a process, the beginning of which, as the Attorney-General emphasized in his speech, was a notice to treat. That notice was not of 28 days&#39; duration, but of&#34; six months&#39; duration. I have abridged it to 28 days in order to eliminate any possible answer on the ground of unreasonableness. Although the learned Attorney-General began by making an assertion that the difference between the Crown and a public utility was obvious, at the conclusion of his argument he made the contrary assertion that they were the same thing. I noted him as saying that he did not see any great difference between their position and our own. I submit, when the Government is acquiring land, from the point of view of the land-owner and the public interest, it is essentially the same proposition. If it is a railway company in England, it can give the owner notice of its intention to acquire, and so, too, can the Australian Government give notice. </para>
        <para>The next point made by the AttorneyGeneral concerned the composition of the board. He said that this notice to treat was associated with the board of inquiry mentioned in the other proposed subclause. I point out. that the two are dissociated. </para>
        <para>I ask the committee to accept first the simple requirement that a Minister should give 28 days&#39; notice to treat. Whether it accepts the other provision that during that period of 28 days the owner should have the right to insist upon a public inquiry, is an entirely different matter. Therefore, even if there were validity in the contention of the Attorney-General that the board of inquiry expressed in that provision is not so apt, as a chamber of the Parliament would be, to consider this position, then I say that that is irrelevant, because the two provisions are not necessarily associated. With regard to the broad subject-matter - a piece of land - a board of inquiry is infinitely more capable of sensing the interests of the public in connexion with an  acquisi-tion  than is a chamber assembled in the isolation of Canberra. </para>
        <para>I proceed, with the utmost brevity of which I am capable, to the next argument of the Attorney-General in connexion with which he said that, in any case, the land-owner had his remedy. Suppose the Minister arbitrarily and without notice - in the dead of night, so to speak - signed his proclamation and gazetted it. The land-owner would learn of it, and he might approach a politician in the neighbourhood. </para>

            <para>- He gets a  notice that  the land has been acquired, and I direct attention to the words &#34; has been acquired &#34;. A politician, possibly a supporter of the Government, might have the matter referred to him, and he would then be met with the situation that the Government had taken executive action. The responsibility would thus be placed upon the individual member of the Parliament of bucking the Government in respect of a piece of executive administration. Thai is not the function of an individual member of this chamber, nor is it a proper function of a House of the Parliament, except in the matter of a vital principle. In such a case, I shall never be backward in supporting a move, even to buck sh,Government. but what a problem of responsibility would be posed for an individual member of the Parliament if he were asked to act in the case of an individual transaction of an executive nature upon which the Government had declared itself ready to stand by the Minister. Therefore, I urge that it is quite proper that notice should be given before acquisition is made as part of the preliminary procedure, so that the land-owner can then alert his elected representative of the Parliament and get busy with representations to the Minister before the Minister&#39;s decision is committed to an administrative act. </para>

        <para>The Attorney-General then invoked the aid of clause 11 of the bill, because he said the power of the Houses of Parliament could be used to void a proclamation. I propose to adopt the argument that was advanced impromptu by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> on the basis of sub-clause (4.) of clause 11. If honorable senators study that subclause, they will see to what narrow limits we have reduced our power as a House of Parliament to cancel one of these proclamations because our power is denied to us - where moneys  have been appropriated by the Parliament for or towards . . . </para>
        <para class="block">Not the acquisition of the land, but for or towards - the purpose for which the land was acquired; </para>
        <para class="block">So  if we pass a vote of &#163;1,000,000 in the name of defence to construct the Snowy Mountains project, the Minister may select the required area. Whose farm would he choose? It matters not. That is irrelevant. Suppose we take, as another example, the aluminium project. Part of the plant is located at Bell Bay in Tasmania, and let us suppose that the Australian Aluminium Production Commission then looks around for a site for  the  reduction plant which is part of the project. It considers sites in New South Wales and elsewhere. It would have power to acquire any of those sites. Once proclamations had been issued, by reason of the appropriation of money by the Parliament for the purpose for which the land was to be acquired, we would have no power as a chamber, under clause 11, to cancel that proclamation, f invite honorable senators to consider the next portion of sub-clause (4.) of clause 11 which states - where the Governor-General has authorized the  construction  or carrying out of the work or undertaking in respect of which the land was  acquired  and moneys are legally available for lim purpose; </para>
        <para class="block">Suppose we passed a vote of &#163;100,000 for the erection of an arbitration court. Under this power the Attorney-General is gi ven <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> to acquire any site for the arbitration court and under clause 11, the Parliament has no power to cancel the proclamation. Therefore, I ask the Attorney-General to consider whether, on an examination of these matters, the arguments that have been advanced are valid. I submit that they have no validity, and a simple&#39; proposition such as that expressed in this amendment permits of no answer. </para>
        <para>The other matter advanced by the Attorney-General was that in war-time we might wish to make an acquisition <inline font-style="italic">instanter.</inline> I propose to deal with the proposition that might arise in war-time without overlooking the application of the argument to peace-time. &#39;Should the misfortune of war be inflicted upon us, it would be common, as it has been in the past, to pass national security legislation giving the Government the power to make regulations under which it could do anything. In such cases, it must, of necessity, comply with the constitutional requirement regarding acquisition on just terms. In war-time, therefore, we can trust to our own thoughtfulness to provide ourselves with power to act instantly, but we have not a statute like this providing for peace-time.  As to acquisition for defence in peace-time, if the Minister just announces his intention to acquire for a public purpose, he is complying with this section and does not have to announce the particular purpose of defence for which he is going to make the acquisition. He is not required to disclose his secrets at all under this section. I can deal further with this argument when the committee is considering the next amendment, but this one only requires that the Minister should notify the owner 28 days before that he intends to acquire land for a public Commonwealth purpose. So that I contend that the argument is ill founded. I go further, and say that if that is a valid argument, and if the Minister should not be delayed in peace-time, because of the importance of the acquisition, even for a period of 28 days, I would be quite prepared to include a provision to th* effect that the section shall not apply to any case in which the Minister certifies that there are special reasons why it should not so apply. That would place specifically on the Minister the responsibility for giving a certificate to Parliament that there are special reasons associated with the acquisition which he thinks justify him in not giving what we, as a Parliament, declare is the regular notice of 2S days to the land-owner, the provision for such notice having been made in the interest of justice to the land-owner and in the public interest- </para>

          <para>. - Before the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> replies, if he proposes to do so, I should like to make one or two comments, particularly in regard to the proposed new clause 8a. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment seeks that notice be given before there is any compulsory acquisition, that certain procedures should take place and certain times elapse. I put it to the Attorney-General that in practice that is exactly what happens in the great majority of cases. Probably in 90 per cent, of cases a site is pegged out by departmental officers, they search the title, they go and talk to the owner, and negotiations proceed for quite a considerable time. If that is the practice in 90 per cent, of the cases, I ask the Attorney-General what is the objection to crystallizing that procedure in proper form in an act. That appears to be the practice at present, and it is certainly my experience that that is the practice, so why should we not write into the act what is the practice at present? </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The second point that I wish to mention, and the only one that concerns me in relation to this matter, was dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> not in the amendment, but in his comments upon it. I feel, like the Attorney-General, that a situation might well arise in which the Commonwealth must act quickly and without delay. I can imagine a number of situations in which that could happen, even in peace-time. The AttorneyGeneral indicated himself that there might be situations of that nature. I should be happy if he would indicate the type of case that he has in mind that could arise. As to defence, I can see that it may be necessary to resume land  quickly, not necessarily when we are meeting the enemy or setting out to attack the enemy, but in the interests of defence preparations. A situation may develop in which it may be necessary to enter, to occupy, to lease, or to acquire on a permanent basis, and in such a situation there may not be time to seek people out and give 28 days5 notice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> suggests that if the Minister certifies that for special reasons it is undesirable that there should be delay, he would be prepared to include a clause in those terms. I am not wedded to his exact words, and I do not think the honorable senator is at present. A qualifying provision of that nature or to that effect would amply satisfy me. </para>
        <para>Reverting to the matter of defence preparations, the Attorney-General will recall the <inline font-style="italic">Capital Issues</inline> case under, I think, the Defence Preparations Act, in which the High Court indicated that there was a vast scope for the exercise of extreme defence powers, even in a period of peace, in the name of defence preparations. As regards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> suggestion that the Minister furnish a certi ficate in cases where it is not advisable to give the usual notice, I suggest that the honorable senator might perhaps confine his qualifications to defence preparations, matters connected with defence, or other circumstances which the Attorney-General certifies that it would not be in the public interest to disclose. I merely make that suggestion without putting it in technical form. </para>
        <para>Those are the three lines of thought that run through my mind in regard to the amendment. Having made those remarks, I express my personal view when I say that I would be prepared to support the amendment. Unfortunately, I cannot speak for all honorable senators on this side, because there has been no opportunity for consultation. </para>

          <para>.- We have heard in this debate, so far, statements made by people who are well versed in the law. I would like to approach the matter from the point of view of a layman who knows not all the legal ramifications and implications of this amendment. I do approach the matter as one who believes that it is our duty in this Parliament to see that we give to the citizens of this country every possible protection and advantage consistent with the national interest. Therefore, I am immediately attracted to a proposal such as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> which requires that a man be told that his property is going to be acquired, rather than be told, as is the case at present, that his property has been acquired. Because it does give a man that advantage, I am disposed to favour this amendment. It has been suggested by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> that this advantage is really more apparent than real, that the indication to a man that his property is going to be acquired may not, in the long run, prevent it from being acquired, and that there is, therefore, no really significant advantage. But I suggest that there may be a significant advantage. The notification that his property is going to be acquired gives the owner the opportunity, during four weeks, to offer objections to the Minister, through his parliamentary representative, which is the channel which the AttorneyGeneral suggested he should use. It gives him the opportunity to plead his case if he feels that he has been subjected to some injustice. While he is doing all those things he is allowed to remain in possession of his land instead of being, in effect, evicted, as is the case at present. </para>

            <para>-  His  legal title has passed before he begins to plead his case publicly or to make use of such channels as are open to him. I think it better that his legal title should remain for four weeks in his possession while he makes his objections. Indeed, it seemed to me that the only significant objection which the Attorney-General put to this chamber was that there might, in some unspecified instances which I cannot imagine, apart from war, be occasions upon which a delay of four weeks would dangerously impede the Commonwealth in carrying out some action that it desired to carry out. I suppose that if one scratched the bottom of one&#39;s memory or imagination one could think of some case in which that could happen, but it is surely a bad principle to make a law affecting all the people of this Commonwealth merely because, in some tenuous case, there might possibly be a chance that the Commonwealth would be held up for four weeks. So I find myself, from the point of view of a layman, endeavouring to protect the citizens of Australia. In the face of the arguments which have so far been put up against this amendment, unless they are substantially buttressed, I am committed to support the amendment. </para>

I earnestly ask the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> to give serious consideration to accepting it in the form proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in his final remarks. I am not going to canvass the arguments put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> or by the Attorney-General in rebuttal, except to say that I was under the impression that the Attorney-General in discussing this matter this afternoon said, in effect, that the present provision had been in existence for some 50 years and had worked  very well, and, therefore, no procedural change was warranted. With great respect I admit that the procedure has been in existence for some 50 years, but I join issue with him when he says that it has worked well. I deny that and suggest that many lawyers will quite freely offer the suggestion to him that this procedure has not worked well; that it has worked anything but well. We should put ourselves in the shoes of a man whose land has been taken. The procedure is to publish a notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> that land is being taken, but the courtesy is not extended to the owner of informing him of the decision. I do not agree that, that is good procedure. </para>

            <para>- I doubt whether many would, certainly not people who own land. In my limited experience of this particular law I have seen consternation and frustration exhibited by people who have learned indirectly that their land has been resumed. They have been presented with a <inline font-style="italic">fait accompli.</inline> I suggest the Attorney-General has been wrongly advised when he says that for some 50 years this procedure has worked well. On the contrary, it has not worked well at all; and that is why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has moved this amendment. </para>

        <para>The learned attorney is making another rather fatal mistake. This is merely a notice to treat and he is confusing it with a re-possession order. This is purely the first step in what could quite well be a very amicable arrangement between the Crown and the owner for the purchase of the land. It is in every respect complementary to the amendment which the Attorney-General has agreed to accept in respect of arbitration proceedings. This notice to treat is complementary to that  arbitration clause which he has already agreed to accept. I cannot see how he can be consistent if, on the one hand, he says, &#34; We will agree with the arbitration amendment &#34;, and, on the other hand, he says, &#34; We will not agree with this proposed amendment in respect of a notice to treat &#34;. </para>
        <para>Finally, the Attorney-General joined issue with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in connexion with the procedure in Great Britain. He was quite right in saying that in Great Britain a notice to treat is, in effect, a resumption notice, but he then went on to argue - illogically, I suggest - that in Australia a notice to treat would not be a very practical thing if it concerned the taking of land for defence purposes. In answer to that I say that in Great Britain land is taken for defence purposes by a notice to treat. </para>

          <para>.- As a layman, there are two points on which I should like the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> to give me some information. What happens in a case in which notice is given to a landowner that the Government is going to acquire his land, if during that four weeks, he takes steps to alter the land materially? Is it in the public or national interest to give four weeks&#39; notice of intention to acquire when, in fact, a landowner during that four weeks can so alter the whole value of his property that it will cost the nation a great deal more money or, perhaps, render the property valueless for the purpose for which it is being acquired ? I should like some information on that point. Secondly, in connexion with a matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> there are circumstances in which the Crown might be called upon to acquire land immediately. An illustration of that is the case of floods when the Government may desire to acquire a property immediately for diversion purposes in order to prevent other properties from being damaged. Hilder this amendment would it be necessary to give four weeks&#39; notice in such circumstances? </para>

          <para>. -  I urge the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> to give consideration to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment, particularly now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has, I understand, intimated that he will seek to add certain additional words to his amendment. The Government should ensure by this legislation that the Minister of the day will act justly and also appear to act justly. The Constitution definitely provides that the Parliament can make laws with relation to the acquisition of property, but all acquisitions must be on just terms. I believe that it is in the spirit of the Constitution that the terms should be completely just, and should also appear to be just. Common courtesy demands the type of notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has envisaged in his amendment. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> has said, such notice is always given of proposed administrative acts by a well-run government department. I. urge that the Attorney-General shall not withstand the suggestion to incorporate in the legislation something that happens in normal procedure throughout the length and breadth of the land. That is, that before any legal action is taken, there shall be a preliminary notice of that action. The Government could well consider adopting this amendment. </para>

There may be some compelling reason in practical administration which is determining the attitude of the Government and the Attorney-General. I can see no other justification for their persistence. The Attorney-General owes it to this chamber to state the reason. I have  beforeme at present a copy of parallel legislation in Queensland. It is called the Public Works LandResumption Act 1906, and in that legislation the Crown or statutory authorities, within the constitutional powers of the State, are empowered to resume land for stated purposes. </para>

In view of that, and in view of the length of time involved and the success that has attended the operation of such provisions, I believe that the Attorney-General must have very compelling reasons for resisting the obvious desire of this chamber. I suggest that he might put those reasons before us at the earliest opportunity. </para>

          <para>.- The remark of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> to the effect that the person whose land is required has, for his protection, the title deeds, has brought me to my feet. The case that I intend to deal with occurred in one of the States, but I understand that the land acquisition rules in the States closely follow the Commonwealth laws. In about October, 1954, very large tracts of. land in Western Australia were taken from the people who had established homes and farms on them. They were taken by the Minister for Housing in the Government of Western Australia, and no payment has yet been made for the land. It should also be remembered that the people whose land has been taken, have no recourse to any court of appeal, as the Minister&#39;s word is the last word. When a widow with two children appealed to the Minister about the acquisition of her land, she told him that as she held the title deeds he would not be able to touch it. He said, &#34; You may tear up the title deeds to the land; they are of no further use to you because the Government can take, and will take, whatever land it requires&#34;. Therefore, it seems to me that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will afford one way in -which persons whose land has been acquired can he protected. I support the amendment. </para>

          <para>.- During the secondreading debate on this measure, I stated that j&#91; .could see nothing wrong with <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> .amendment. I still can see mo thing wrong with it, and I therefore support it. However, I hope that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> will take notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> stated that not only must the law .be just, but it must also appear to be just. I suggest that there is uo question of appearance with regard to laws. They are either just or unjust, and any suggestion that they should appear just is merely introducing politics into the law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has said that he would raise no objection to a system under which a special certificate is given by the Minister for a specific purpose. I understand that the Attorney-General has said that lie would agree to have the definition cover the arbitration aspect. If honorable senators will study the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in clause 6, they will find that it includes the words &#34;between the owner and the Minister, oi-, in the absence of agreement, by action by the owner against the Commonwealth in a court of competent jurisdiction &#34;. I suggest that any decision by .an arbitrator should apply here, as in other parts of the legislation. It is hard for a layman to understand legislation of this kind, but the fact remains that it provides for notice to be given by the Minister before he acquires the land, and not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> has pointed out, that some ona should walk on the land, and say that the Government owns it, and then go on as if the Government did, in fact, own it. Provision should be made for the giving of notice. The legislation also provides that the owner of the land shall supply certain particulars. If something happens that is not provided for in the agreement, the parties have to fall back on the practice of going to the court, whereas the Attorney-General has suggested that arbitration proceedings should be provided for in order -to arrive at a just settlement. A provision along those lines should be added, so that the arbitration machinery could -be resorted to instead of the owner having to go to the expense of fighting the Government in a court. In my second-reading speech I suggested to the Attorney-General that the -matter should be &#39;deferred and given further consideration. I wonder whether, in the meantime, the Attorney-General has given the matter further consideration, and whether any of the amendments will be accepted by him. I think that the matter justifies further consideration being given to it. </para>

          <para>.- I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to persist with his original amendment because to me, as a layman, it appears that the qualification which he now proposes to accept will destroy the whole purpose of his amendment. Later in this measure we shall come to a provision empowering the Minister to delegate his authority. If the suggestion mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is accepted, I believe that the Minister will know no more about the special reasons than if no such provision were contained in the bill. What will happen will be that the Ministea&#39; will delegate powers to some officer of his department, and then that officer may declare that, for some unexpected reason, it is not necessary to give the required notice. That would mean that we would be still in a position that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> wishes shall no longer exist. I think the original amendment is an admirable one, because it gives protection to the owners of property that is about to be acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes. </para>

        <para>I cannot conceive of events happening to cause such haste as has been spoken of to-night, and necessitating intervention by the Government. Due consideration should be given to these matters, and a longer period than that now contemplated should be provided for before a property is acquired. When hasty decisions are made, there is always the risk of wrong being inflicted on the owner of a property. We know what happened during the war when very junior officers acted in a hurry. According to them, matters were urgent, but later events have shown that there was no hurry. These young men in their violent hurry walked on to properties and put the owners out on the street. They confiscated the owner&#39;s property and machinery, all because they were in a hurry. They said that the nation was in peril, but later it was found that the only panic was in the minds of these officious officers. The same thing will happen if the amendment is qualified in the way proposed. I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> for the excellent case that he has put up to-day. I regard this as one of the best debates that has taken place in this Senate since I became a member. The amendment seeks to protect the rights of the people of this country. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who followed him, expressed fine sentiments in the interest of the people. I hope that the amendment will remain without qualification. </para>

          <para>. -  I agree completely with the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline><inline font-style="italic">I</inline> approach this subject believing that, all the time, the scales are weighted against the individual and the public. When either an individual or the public clashes with the Government, the Government generally wins, and therefore we must give to individuals as much opportunity to obtain justice as lies in the hands of the Parliament to give them. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> has said, we have had many examples of young men acting in a hurry. Frequently, proposals, even if sent to the Minister, are not studied by him, or if be studies them it is only after the property has been resumed. In many instances great hardship is done to the public. This bill provides an opportunity to bring up to date an act of Parliament that was originally passed in 1906, and has had little alteration in the meantime. The attitude of the Government should be that it is not sufficient for some junior officer in the Attorney-General&#39;s Department to get the idea that it is time the Lands Acquisition Act was brought up to date. I give officers full marks for their interest in these matters, but our attitude should be that we shall make .the legislation that comes before us such that it will not need amendment for ten, or even twenty years. But what happens? When a bil&#93; is brought down in these circumstances, if a member proposes an amend ment, irrespective of whether he is on the Opposition side or the Government side of the House, he is immediately viewed with grave suspicion. He is regarded as  a  rebel - a terrible word in these days - and his proposition is examined as with a magnifying glass to detect any possible flaws. The Government should encourage every angle of consideration on this legislation so that by the time the bill is through the committee stage it is as near perfect as possible. This is not the first time within the past twelve or eighteen months that the Government has brought into this chamber acts of Parliament that have not been amended for many years, but when logical alterations have been suggested they have been refused. The reason is that departmental officers have not bothered to examine the points covered by the amendments which are the fruit of careful consideration. The amendments proposed this evening by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> are examples, and one of the most important features is that they are in the public interest. No suggestion has been made from the Government side that this amendment for 28 days&#39; notice is not in the public interest. We are not worthy of being regarded as public men if we do not consider the public interest as a matter of paramount importance. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There always seems a doubt about the wisdom of a Minister accepting an amendment on the floor of the chamber, and I should never criticize a Minister who was frank enough to say that he was not prepared to accept the amendment immediately, but would seek an adjournment for a day or so to enable him to consider it and come to a proper decision. I have seen too many hasty decisions made without regard to justice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> rightly referred to the actions of junior departmental officials clothed with a little brief authority who have proved to at least one group in Australia - the men on the land - what will happen if they dare to resist. The officials proceed to take most harsh measures. </para>
        <para>I remind honorable senators of the attitude of the Government concerning the acquisition of public park lands throughout Australia. The Commonwealth  is squatting on public parks in every State of the Commonwealth, and will not vacate them. Possession of them was taken during the war, but it cannot be argued that the Commonwealth has any right to remain. The war ended ten years ago. I cannot imagine any public servant making a move to release these park lands. Ministers and public servants with a direct responsibility for doing so have defended their inaction by saying they are unable to find alternative accommodation. That is not true, and if they really wanted to do the right thing they would vacate or the Minister would direct them to do so. </para>
        <para>The whole problem of land acquisition must be dealt with on the basis of protecting the public. The Government has enormous powers in many acts. For example, the Supply and Development Act gives the Minister for Supply and Development wide power to take over land in war-time and in peace-time. If an emergency arises - which would be rare in times of peace - the period of 28 days could mean the difference between the success and failure of a proposition for resumption. I agree wholeheartedly with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> that the 28 days&#39; notice would give time for reflection, and could be responsible for the prevention of unnecessary action. One of the first jobs of every Minister for &#34;Works and Housing should be to obtain a schedule of the land which has been held by the Government for ten, fifteen, or twenty years, and is not being used for any purpose. It may have been resumed during the war or previously for a purpose which has since been forgotten, and it lies idle in the hands of the Government. No one knows, except perhaps an odd employee in the Department of Works or in the Department of the Interior or in the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department, why that land was acquired. </para>
        <para>Any proposal to safeguard the publicinterest cannot be lightly refused by the Minister. He must examine it very closely. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> that the Minister will have to advance strong arguments to refute the suggestion that 28 days&#39; notice will hurt the Government in any way. That notice will give the individual member of the community fairer treatment and a little more chance in the almost hopeless fight in which he will become engaged if the Government moves in to take his property. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with honorable senators who have expressed the opinion that this debate has been most useful. It is appropriate that this chamber should examine closely the provisions of the present measure, and if it sees ways of improving it to take suitable action. In considering the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> the general principles of the legislation must be kept in view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> directed attention to the fact that in practice, in nine cases our of ten, the department communicates with the owner of land before action is taken for compulsory acquisition. If the owner  is prepared to sell at a price which is acceptable to the Crown that ends the matter, and compulsory acquisition is not necessary. The parties are not obliged to agree, but in practice they often do. </para>

            <para>asked that 28 days&#39; notice should be given in all cases, and he wanted to have that provision included in the act in an inflexible form. The qualification which he later suggested, making an acquisition subject to a declaration by the Minister in special circumstances, certainly makes his amendment more acceptable. No one can deny that there may yet be circumstances in which the interests of the Commonwealth - which are the interests of the public - could be prejudiced by the requirement that 28 days&#39; notice must first be given, having regard to the nature of the powers which the Commonwealth exercises. I could imagine that happening in the case of land that was being sought for particular defence purposes. It might be essential to obtain it almost at once because other people are &#34;nibbling&#34; at it to use it for other purposes. The virtue of the existing act, from the point of view of the Commonwealth, is that the legal action of acquisition becomes effective upon the publication in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of an announcement that the acquisition has been made. What is the position in the course of the 28 days, during which notice must be given to the owner under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment? Is the then owner free to sell that land to some one else during the 28 days? </para>

Honorable senators may treat them all as fanciful if they like, but the virtue of the law, as it stands at present, from the Commonwealth point of view, is that the acquisition becomes effective, if the Commonwealth wishes it so, upon the announcement in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette;</inline> and no jiggerypokery by the people who own the land, after that event, can possibly affect the value which attaches to it and which will be ascertained by evidence at the moment that it is acquired.

If the effect of the notice to treat is to prevent the owner of the land, from that moment onwards, from having any dealings with his land, then he is in exactly the same position as if he had received a notice and the land had been compulsorily acquired, because a notice to treat is the first step in the inevitable process of compulsory acquisition. In other words, it is precisely the same as a notice to treat in England. </para>

            <para>- I appreciate that. I suppose it is possible to rescind a compulsory acquisition notice, so that the same effect could be achieved in that way.

            <para>- We have heard very few complaints about the actual operation of the system. True, if the matter is looked at baldly and coldly, it is a harsh kind of business to compulsorily acquire a man&#39;s land - that is the legal effect of it - by publishing a notice in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> but that is the first step in a process of acquiring the land from him, either by compensation which is agreed between the parties, or by compensation which is settled by a court of law. Its virtue, I suggest - and this is the test which the committee has to apply - as against the advantages to be gained from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> scheme, is that the land vests in the Commonwealth as from the time of the publication of the acquisition notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> That fixes the time when the value&#39; is to be ascertained. There cannot be any trouble about who was the owner of the land at that time ; the owner is a certainty. He is dealt with, and he then looks for compensation from the Commonwealth, in accordance with the act. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> proposals, you give notice to one owner to-day, and in 2S days&#39; time there may be another owner. Presumably, you then have to start all over again. What happens if, for instance, the owner dies in the course of the 2S days? </para>

        <para class="block">I am most obliged to the committee of the Senate because there are 40 or 50 honorable senators present. That is a tribute to the interest that has been accorded to an issue to which our individual judgments can be applied. I hope I shall not be testing the patience of the committee too far if I ask for continued close consideration to be given to the proposed new clause, because this is a proposal which will accord a great measure of justice and satisfaction to a dispossessed land-owner. The amendment, as I have indicated, provides certain procedure where an owner has an interest in land exceeding &#163;5,000 in value. The Minister would not be troubled with this procedure in all the small cases of acquisition. This proposed new clause provides that where the notice to treat has been served, and agreement has not been reached for the sale of the interest to the Commonwealth, the owner may, not less than 28 days after the service of the notice to treat, request the Minister in writing to cause a public inquiry to be held as to whether the acquisition of the land by the Commonwealth is in the public interest. Upon the receipt of that notice, the Minister may refer the question to a board of inquiry or decide to withdraw the notice to treat. </para>
        <para>The board of inquiry will consist of a  chairman,  who is the  chairman  of a valuation board appointed under the Taxation Administration Act 1953-1955, and two other members appointed by the Minister. Their function is simply to make a report. It is further provided that the report shall be tabled with any acquisition that follows it. The idea is that the report should form the basis of the consideration by members of the House of Parliament to discharge their duties under the section to which the committee previously gave its attention, and under which each House of Parliament has the right to make void an acquisition that has been made. </para>
        <para>I wish to make it quite clear to the committee that I have avoided giving any operative effect to the report of the public inquiry. I did that in deference to the idea that it is an executive act to acquire land, and the decision on that point is left to the Minister. Obviously, any Minister, under our constitutional set-up of responsible government, will feel himself bound to consult the terms of that report, and base upon it his decision, either to withdraw from the acquisition or to pursue it according to the terms of the report. If he decides to go on with the acquisition, then he will run the gauntlet of debate in the House based, not upon a total absence of information, but upon the information which the report would provide. Therefore, the report of the public inquiry is to be without operative effect. It will only inform the Minister and the Houses of Parliament. </para>
        <para>The other value I attach to it is that sense of satisfaction it will afford to  a  land-owner who feels that he has  a  grievance and is prepared to go to the inconvenience and cost of supporting his case before the public inquiry. The purpose of it also is obviously that those who attempt fraud will be intimidated by this section in the vast majority of cases. Those who attempt either preference or prejudice to a particular owner will be deterred because of the possibility that they will have to run the gauntlet of a public inquiry, if the land-owner, feeling a sense of grievance, asks for a public inquiry to be undertaken at his own cost, so far as he is concerned. </para>
        <para>My original idea as to the constitution of the board was that it should consist of the  chairman  mentioned, one nominee of the Minister and one other person nominated by the local government of the area, shire or municipality in which the land concerned was situated. There were difficulties about drafting that particular provision, but we have a board constituted wholly on government nomination to which we have committee quasi-judicial functions. The Board of Review under the Income Tax Act consists of three members. I believe that they have a tenure of seven years, but I am subject to correction on that point. All are nominees of the Government. Coming closer home, the board of appeal under the Gift Duties Assessment Act consists of the  chairman  I have selected and two other members, both appointed by the government. In practice, having regard to the nature of that jurisdiction, the government always appoints a public accountant, I believe, as the third member of the board. Therefore, from the point of view of this amendment, I would be content to leave the nomination of the board to the Minister, because I do not believe any chicanery would be attempted in any but the most rare and extraordinary case. </para>

No permanent cost would be involved. It is a question of giving a sounding board to a land-owner who has a grievance.

The mere fact that there is the right of a public inquiry at the instance of the laud-owner will eliminate the exercise of the powers of the section in every case but the odd one in which the landowner might think, as in the case of the Pye brothers, that he would like the comfort of the returned soldiers and farmers in the district coming along to the inquiry and saying, &#34; This is monstrous &#34;.

            <para>- No, and the whole purpose of the proposal is to give him a quasi-judicial procedure which he can use instead of resorting to force and self-help. If there is any suggestion that the inquiry could be prolonged so as to prevent the immediate implementation of the Government&#39;s purpose, I would indicate immediately that I think it proper to add exactly the same provision as we have just inserted in new clause 8a. That is, that the section shall not apply in any case in which the Minister takes the responsibility of making a direct certificate that for special reasons it should not apply. The Minister will then bp faced with a specific matter that affects his conscience, and he must certify that there are special reasons why the landowner should not have a public inquiry. </para>

            <para>- It is a compliment to be asked my view in regard to this matter. I have looked at section  61  and, with some hesitation, I offer the suggestion, that no Minister would take the view that the power to certify under this section is ca pable of being delegated. The language in the section is general. It authorizes the Minister to delegate any of his powers and functions. It is language capable of including this power, but there is a doubt as te that. I think we can rest upon the assurance that a Minister would be very reluctant to regard such a special power as this, to be exercised for special reasons, as coming within the general power to delegate. </para>

If he puts his suggestion as a matter of principle, then why does ho commence at properties worth  &#163;5,000?  If there is a principle involved, a person is entitled to be protected whether his property is a small cottage, or anything else. Tor that reason, the amendment appears to amount to class legislation, and I do not agree with the minimum stipulation of  &#163;5,000.  I suggest that the protection should be available regardless of the value of the property. </para>

            <para>- That is so. Within 28 days, which may mean on the twenty-seventh day, he has to advise the Minister that he desires a board of inquiry to be formed. Then it is provided that the Minister must put the inquiry in motion within  60  days. But there is no provision as to how long the inquiry should proceed. I do not want to hamstring the inquiry at all. I want to give every one an opportunity to say what he wishes, but on the other hand I do not want it to be a &#34; Kathleen Mavourneen &#34;, which it could easily become if some person is not anxious to get rid of his land. With the greatest respect to the legal fraternity, both inside and outside this chamber, I suggest that lawyers have a habit of seeing that these things take a long time; and, after all, the affairs of the country must proceed. Therefore, my two main concerns are in regard to the minimum value of a property, and the time that may be taken by the inquiry. I do not want to be unreasonable in the matter of time. I do not know why it is suggested that a person must advise the Minister within 2S days that he wants an inquiry, but that the Minister may take anything up to  60  days to start the inquiry. Is the Minister so overworked that he must be given  60  days? </para>

        <para>After hearing the Minister&#39;s remarks on the bill, it seemed to me that he was suggesting some hypothetical cases in which this amendment would delay the carrying-out of some very important function&#39; of the Crown. I, personally, think that  60  days is much too long. There should be at least some opportunity to have an inquiry. I recall an instance in Victoria in which land was compulsorily acquired under powers given  to the Housing Commission and portion of it was not used. I understand, too, that on one portion of it an hotel was erected. To that I say &#34; shame ! &#34; - and I mean it. Where it can reasonably be argued that the ordinary work of the Commonwealth is not interfered with there should be an inquiry. A person may desire to submit a case why one block as against another one should not be resumed, bearing in mind as I said previously that that right may be overruled in time of war. Protection is also given under the clause in as much as the Minister accepts responsibility to certify whether the conditions justify an inquiry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> should at least ask that the consideration of this clause be adjourned, along with others, with a view to meeting the points I have raised. </para>

          <para>. - Without having very firm views I feel disposed at first glance to oppose the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> While we are conscious at all times of the need to give complete justice to the private individual against an all-powerful State, we must also at all times take into consideration the practical policies of day to day public administration and try, so far as we can, to reconcile the two. This amendment might greatly impede practical public administration. </para>

        <para>My first point is that new clause 8a, dealing with treating, appeared to me to go only to the question of quantum. Sub-clause (3) of the new clause reads - </para>

        <para class="block">Apparently, the idea is that that amendment goes only to the question of quantum, that the person who is resisting the resumption would have some figure in his mind which he would specifically state. However, in proposed now clause 8b, which is now before the Chair, the principle is inserted that a person who is given an opportunity to treat, and who again rests his resistance on the matter of quantum, can completely change his ground and resist resumption altogether if he finds that there is no agreement on the matter of quantum. That is how I read proposed new clause 8b, which reads - (1.) Where the owner of an interest in land, being an interest the value of which exceeds Five thousand pounds - </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">

            <para>has not reached agreement with the Minister for the sale of the interest to the Commonwealth, the owner may, not later than 28 days after the service on him of the notice to treat, request the Minister in writing to cause a public inquiry to be held as to whether the acquisition of the land by the Commonwealth is in the public interest. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">It is obvious then there has been a complete change of ground from a question of adequacy to a question of whether public interest is involved at all. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> when he is replying to this debate will advert to that point. It may entail writing something into new clause 8a to which the committee has just agreed. </para>
        <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> was speaking he referred to the matter of &#163;5,000, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> interjected that that could be reduced to &#163;500, which, apparently, is the line of demarcation elsewhere. Again we come up against the problem of practical public administration. We can well imagine the Government being faced with a series of small resumptions, possibly 20 or 30 of them, involving more than &#163;500. Each person resisting resumption would have the same right to have his case determined by a public inquiry. Obviously, what was in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> mind when he mentioned the bigger figure was that new clause 8a would not apply in small cases. If it did. the resumption of a number of individual units would be almost completely impracticable. If the honorable senator as he indicated, agrees that the figure  of &#163;500 could be substituted for &#163;5,000. that would lend point to my observation that this proposed amendment could make public administration extremely difficult. 0&#187;  that question I do npt, know whether any body other, than the resuming authority, should, have power to determine. whether a proposed, resumption is. in the public interest. If, for instance, the Department of Civil Aviation proposed to resume a property for the purpose of air approaches or. beacons, or something of that character., it would be quite inappropriate for- some extraneous authority, no matter how competent or well intentioned it might be, to. come in and sit in judgment on the expert opinion of the department. On that ground I would resist this proposed amendment, well intentioned though it is, and obviously directed to protect individuals against the State. That is a protection which in most Clr.cumstances I should like to give, but the proposed amendment I think would set the balance heavily against practical administration, and for those reasons I feel disposed to oppose it. </para>

          <para>. -  Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> I am somewhat troubled by this proposed amend.ment. First, with great respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> I suggest it is, to a point, an attempt to take away some executive function from the Government. The amendment proposes to set up a board qf inquiry. While the recommendation of the board need not necessarily be accepted by the Minister, this procedure, up to that stage, would take away from the executive arm of the Government the responsibility in respect of a function for which the Minister is very properly given responsibility by the Parliament. Therefore, it cuts right across my idea of responsible Government. It is true, of course, that we have many boards of inquiry investigating alleged misdemeanours of the Government. For example, we have the Public Accounts Committ.ee, which, of course, is not quite the same kind of body. This is an attempt to cut across government responsibility, and to that extent I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> proposed amendment. If it is argued that it is not an attempt to cut across a function of government, there is a second reason why the proposal lacks some merit. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> with all due respect, that it is no;t a very realistic or practical proposition, because on the one hand he asks a board to put a Minister or department on trial on an issue as to whether or not some particular acquisition is in the public interest, and on the other hand the only persons who can say that the acquisition is in the public interest are the Minister, or departmental officials. Consider, for example, that the Minister for. Civil Aviation requires land as a site for an aerodrome. If this amendment were to be carried, the owner could ask for. a board of inquiry to ascertain whether the acquisition is in the public interest. But the only persons who can say that the action is in the public interest are the Minister for Civil Aviation and the officials of the Department of Civil Aviation. If they say before the public inquiry that they want that particular land in the public interest, and that they are not interested in any other land, that would place the board in a very invidious position; because it must accept the evidence of the Minister or department. Therefore, honorable senators will perceive that there is no great merit in the proposed amendment, which is really a matter of Peter trying Peter. The department is placed in issue to establish that the acquisition is in the public interest, and the board must accept the department&#39;s statement on that aspect of the matter. The inquiry would get nowhere, and consequently perhaps the proposal does lack realism. For that reason, even if the proposition does not cut across the function of executive government, I cannot support the amendment. </para>

          <para>. -  T have been greatly interested in the answers given to the questions that were asked by the honorable senators who preceded me in this debate. They have all been pertinent .to the issue, and I rise to add my contribution to the remarks that have gone before. It is proposed that .the  chairman  pf the board of inquiry should be a person who is a  chairman  of a valuation board under the Taxation Administration Act. He is a governmental officer a,t a governmental level and. as  chairman,  has to join with two others - who ar.e unspecified - to pronounce on whether a particular acquisition is in accordance with -the public interest. That,  is a decision at the highest policy level, which I suggest should not be given by the  chairman  of a board who is at the departmental or lower level. I can see grave difficulties there. With all due respect to the  chairman,  one could imagine a bias on his part in favour of the Government. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The board, as proposed, does not convey that aura of complete detachment and impartiality that should apply in a case like this. It is rather difficult to find a body, whether it be a board of inquiry or otherwise, which would be competent to set itself up to determine whether a government or a Minister had acted in the public interest. After all, when a Minister does so act, his act involves his whole government, and the parties who sit behind the Government in the Parliament are also deemed to have given their approval to what has been done. </para>
        <para>I am of opinion that a board at the level proposed in the amendment would not be a proper tribunal. In saying that, I am casting no reflection at all on whoever may be  chairman  of the valuation board. I believe that I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Murray</inline> some time earlier to-day. I have the highest respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Murray,</inline> and I completely agree with the honorable senator&#39;s encomiums of him. Nevertheless, I do not see how a person, no matter how skilled or efficient he may be in the art and principles of valuing land could even begin to be qualified by that fact to determine whether a particular project requiring land is one that is or is not in the public interest. </para>

            <para>- I submit tha&#39;, it gets very close to it. I believe that that  chairman,  however experienced he may be in land valuation, is not the type of person who would be qualified to determine whether it is a matter of public interest that one particular site should be acquired as against another. That is a. job for a person with a policy-making mind, and with a complete knowledge of the whole project involved. Such a determination involves a great deal more than the consideration of a site, although I appreciate honorable senators&#39; comments on that particular aspect. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I must confess that I have a bias against anything that reduces ministerial responsibility, and the honorable senator has met that objection by providing thai the Minister may prevent a matter from going to a board on the ground that he accepts complete responsibility for certifying that there are special circumstances that should operate against that being done. All Ministers and governments must take responsibility, and when they offend, their sanction is a political sanction. One can imagine cases such as those mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> where various pieces of land of lower value than &#163;500, that is, of lower value than would justify reference to a board, are involved in an acquisition. Therefore, might it not be wise to provide for some amalgamation of interests where there is a joint project of that nature? </para>

I should feel happier if, in the substantive provision rather than under the regulation-making power, there were some clear provision that separate interests in relation to one main project could be combined.
