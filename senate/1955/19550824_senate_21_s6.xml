          <para>. - The record of former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major-General Sir Thomas</inline> William Glasgow, read by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan),</inline> is a most imposing one. He was a man who served in many fields. Not only in the Senate, but in other fields also he had the distinction of winning through to the top flight. In the parliamentary sphere he became a Minister, holding the important posts of Minister for Home and Territories and Minister for Defence. Similar success attended him in his career in the Army for there, too, he reached a high position because of his high qualities of mind and character. Finally, he acquitted himself with very great distinction in the diplomatic capacity of High Commissioner for Canada. I, personally, did not have the pleasure of knowing him, but I do know his record quite well, and I believe that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has done ample justice to it in the course of the comments that he has made. I support the terms of the motion, and all my colleagues join with me in conveying our sympathy to the relatives who survive the deceased. </para>

General Glasgow arrived at Gallipoli as second in command of the 2nd Light Horse, and left the peninsula as Lieutenant-Colonel in command of the regiment. Most honorable senators are aware of the subsequent distinguished service he rendered in World War I., where he rose to the rank of general, and commanded the 13 th Infantry Brigade. He was honoured by King George V. by being made Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. One of the most outstanding achievements during the period he was in command of this brigade was the capture of Villers Brettoneux. On that occasion his brigade, together with the brigade commanded by the late General Pompey Elliott, also a former honorable senator, encircled the town and caused its capture. This feat was described by the late General Monash as the turning point in the war. </para>

As already indicated by the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition, he was a man of outstanding integrity, and one who will always be remembered as one of Australia&#39;s greatest citizens. My political remembrance of the late senator is of a very friendly nature, as he was particularly helpful to me when I entered the Senate as a new member in 1928. It is my privilege to support the resolution and, on behalf of the members of the Australian Country party, to express our sincere condolences to Lady Glasgow and members of the late senator&#39;s family. </para>

Thelate senator was associated with politics for a great many years. For fourteen years he was State organizer of the Australian Labour party. He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Council for two years from 1920, and in 1931 was elected to the Senate. He became Leader of the Opposition in this chamber in 1935, which office he held until 1941. He was a  member  of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances from 1935 to 1937. He was Leader of the Government in the Senate from 3941 to 1943, Minister of the Interior from 1941 to 1945 and Minister in charge of the Allied Works Council from 1942 to 1945. He was Vice-President of the Executive Council from July, 1945, to November, 1946. He was President of the River Murray Commission from 1941 to 1945, and Chairman of the Board of Management of the Australian War Memorial during that period. In 1946 he led the Australian delegation to the International Labour Conference on Social Services in Canada. </para>

          <para>I second the motion on behalf of the Opposition. I think I may correctly say that no more picturesque figure and personality ever came out of Queensland into this Parliament than Joseph Silver Collings. He was an extraordinary man with the most amazing strength of mind and body. His passing at the ripe old age of 90 brought to a conclusion a full, complete and very active life. It is consoling to know that he maintained his faculties right up to the end along with that indomitable spirit that marked the whole of his behaviour. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He served the cause of Labour loyally and well throughout his long association with it, and those of us who knew him well, as many of us did, will miss his presence in the Australian community. He was an influence for good in the party and in the nation. He will be long remembered by all of us of the Opposition. I and my colleagues join with the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> in paying tribute to his magnificent community work, and also in expressing regret at his passing. We join, too, with him in conveying to the surviving relatives of Joseph Silver Collings our deep sympathy with them in their sad loss. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to add a few words in support of this motion as I have known the late senator for a great number of years. In fact the late senator entered the Senate in 1932 following the defeat of the then Senate team of which I was a member. He was always a man of outstanding and vital personality, with strong views, and one who observed very high standards. I should say he was a man who held the strongest views on the ideals of the Labour party and who never wavered in those views and in his effort to implement Labour policy. Although we were on different sides of politics and had different political views, we were always the best of friends and I had the very greatest esteem for the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings.</inline> I should like to express my sincere condolence to his daughter, Miss Collings, and to the other members of his family. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I desire to inform the Senate that henceforth I shall represent in this chamber the Anti-Communist Australian Labour party led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua,</inline> M.P., who is the leader of the party in another place. I regret that, through certain circumstances, I am forced to sever political associations with honorable senators on this side of the chamber, although many of them think and feel along the same lines as myself. They find it more politic, or perhaps better tactics, to remain and fight within the Labour party. I have joined with the other members of this Parliament who refused to accept the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> and the pro-Communist policies laid down by an unconstitutional rump conference held at Hobart earlier this year. </para>

              <para>- As regards my own case, it came to a head, of course, in the Hobart conference, where not only I, but sixteen other delegates from practically every State in Australia, did certain things in order to stand up for the justice that they expected. People know what happened in Hobart, where the federal executive tried to take, and did take, from the hands of the federal conference its right to determine its own policy. We decided that we could not entertain such flagrant injustice, and we refused to attend. I was one of those who refused. I do not know why, but I was chosen to receive the axe. I wonder why. At that conference we saw members representing Victoria afraid of the outcome of the conference. They did not think that theywould have the numbers if they did not force the issue of allowing what was known as the new Victorian delegation to enter that conference. So they did everything possible. They could not follow past precedent and allow the other five States to determine who should represent Victoria at that conference. In fact, they locked the doors and refused to permit delegates to enter the conference. They were afraid. It amused me to see some of the delegates cringing back in the corners, because they were afraid some physical force might be used. The person who would have exerted the physical force was Fred Riley, from Victoria. He is the man who stood up and said, &#34; If anybody is going to enter that conference, I am going to be the one &#34;. He is over 70 years of age, but he has always shown &#34; guts &#34; throughout his political career. He was one of the men who chained themselves to the post, so that they could say their piece and not be taken away. He was the man who was going to exert all the physical force of which some of the members of the Victorian delegation were afraid. </para>

          <para>So I took that stand in Tasmania, for justice, knowing full well that there was a Tasmanian conference to he held within the next week, at which I could be judged. I went along to that conference. What was the result? For the next federal conference, in respect of which an election took place, I received the highest vote of any person at the conference, including the then federal president of the Australian Labour party. </para>

              <para>- I know where the stacking came from. The honorable senator was one of those responsible for it.  His  idea was to run about the night before and see that the stacking was done. As I have said, I topped the poll. Then they said, &#34;That was under the Hare-Clank system, under which you do not have to get a full majority&#34;. They come along and say, &#34; You were not given a complete majority from the conference itself &#34;, but they forget that, after the election, the adoption of the report of the election is brought before conference. If conference did not wish me, unless I got a majority of votes, to be on the federal conference, it could have moved that I be not allowed on the federal conference. That was not done. The motion for the adoption of the election report was carried unanimously. &#34;We come now to the events that happened later. The Tasmanian executive, of which I was an elected member, waited until after the Victorian election. They did not hold a meeting of the executive after the conference itself, as any reasonable body would have done, but waited for nearly two months, until after the Victorian election. </para>

              <para>- That would not be necessary in the case of the honorable senator who has interjected. Then they moved in and, for certain reasons, broke the rules of their own conference and overrode the decisions of the Tasmanian conference, the result being that they suspended me. They were not game to come straight out and expel me. Instead, they suspended me, with the idea that I would remain quiet and not say or do anything until the next State conference; otherwise I would be expelled automatically at the next State conference. Since I am not easily intimidated, I would not accept that. Consequently, I will express my views in this chamber concerning the pro-Communist attitude of the Evatt group within the party. It is now obvious that there have infiltrated the Labour party a number of believers in Marxism and Leninism - those philosophies which are fostering class hatred - and these people must be removed from the Labour party before it will gain the confidence of the Australian people. The Labour party should be governing Australia because its policy is most closely related to the every-day needs of the people. &#34;While there is suspicion, how ever, attaching to&#39; even the highest officials of the party, Labour has no chance of gaining these government benches, which its representatives should rightly occupy. </para>

          <para>The group I represent belongs to the Australian Labour party, but we have designated ourselves the anti-Communist section. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> the present leader of the party - or of what I will call the Evatt section - has, for a considerable time, been following a policy of assistance and support of Communists both inside Australia and abroad. My section will continue the struggle for social justice as the party has always done, but it will try to protect the trade unions and other free institutions from the subversion of communism. We will also alert the nation to the Evatt-Burton proCommunist policy, especially in the face of the perilous situation in South-East Asia. </para>
          <para>I have certain principles to uphold, and I shall not deviate from them either in the party or in this chamber. I will endeavour always to give a true indication of Labour policy. One system that Labour does not - or should not - stand for, is co-existence with Communist principles. That is one of the planks of the Australian Labour party, but it is being flouted in Victoria at the present time, as is shown by the fact that the Cain Labour party and the Communists have a unity ticket in connexion with the ballot for election of officers of the Australian Railways Union. Honorable senators will see in that example that there is co-existence between those two parties. While such a state of affairs exists we cannot expect the Labour party to be strong, or to command the respect and confidence of the people. The position is much the same in Tasmania. In the district in which I live - I refer to the electorate of Braddon, which was formerly Darwin - there is no confidence in the Labour party. That is shown by the fact that at the last election the party lost the seat by 300 votes and also by the fact that no Labour candidate has yet been found willing to stand for the seat at the forthcoming election. </para>

              <para>- I repeat that the people of Tasmania have no confidence in the Labour party under present conditions. I suppose efforts will be made to secure a candidate for the Braddon electorate, but there will have to be some running around if one is to be found. My task in this chamber will be to put forward the ideals to which I have referred, and I hope that my colleagues from Tasmania will take heed of what has happened in New South Wales. That State has pointed the way for honorable senators to follow, and I hope that they will follow the lead that has been given. I hope, too, that that lead will be followed in all the States, because until Labour gets rid of the pernicious influence in its ranks the party <inline font-style="italic">will</inline> never have a chance to become the government of Australia. Labour&#39;s proper place is on the government bench, but unless it gets rid of the causes of suspicion and lack of confidence in it on the part of the people it will remain on the outer too long for the welfare of Australia. </para>

I have already conferred with the harbour authorities in Tasmania in regard to certain aspects of this service, and have also been in consultation with technical officers on the subject. The question of appointing a committee is under consideration. I shall be pleased to give honorable senators from Tasmania any information and details that I can, because I am sure that when they see the plans and specifications of the proposed vessel they will appreciate that a step forward is being taken.

The honorable senator is under a misapprehension regarding the term of office of members of the Tariff Board. There is no statutory retiring age for its members. Members of the Public Service- who are also members of the Tariff Board, cease to be members of the Public Service on reaching the statutory retiring age, but that does not automatically bring about their retirement from the Tariff Board. The honorable senator may rest assured that the Government will continue to ensure that the Tariff Board will be afforded every facility to carry on the splendid work that it has done in the past. The Tariff Board is engaged in work of great national importance which it has carried out with great credit to its members and to. the satisfaction of the Australian people: </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is it the intention of the Government to make available to honorable senators a precis or <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of the principal papers delivered at the recent Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva? If so, what is the earliest date upon which these will be available for study by senators? Will the Minister consider making a statement on behalf of the Government at an early date in the Senate about the implications of this conference for Australia? In particular, will he deal with the reported statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cockroft, head of Britain&#39;s atomic research programme, to the effect that nuclear power could bring industry and population to remote and waterless parts of Australia? If such a statement i&#38; made by the Minister, would facilities be made available for debate on the important matter relating to the development of our north? </para>

As it must be recognized that elections to the Australian Parliament are of greater significance than elections to which I have already referred, will the Minister urge the -Minister for the Interior to consider whether or not the open admission of the Australian Labour party that malpractice can occur, should cause more adequate precautions to be taken in the future to ensure the complete safety of ballot-papers in parliamentary elections? </para>

            <para>- I shall preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services with an explanation to make the subject-matter clear to the &#39;Senate. In some cases, pensioners who have become ill and have been admitted to hospitals have been deprived of Commonwealth payments or such benefits as are enjoyed by all other pensioners, such as free hospital treatment. Will the Minister make inquiries about pensioners committed to institutions and receiving hospital treatment in those institutions, and ensure that they shall be treated on the same basis as pensioners who are not in institutions, but who receive hospital treatment; that is, that they shall get free treatment, free medicine and free hospital accommodation? Will the Minister make inquiries to ascertain whether in some institutions pensioners are being charged for hospital accommodation and treatment, and if he finds that there are such cases, will he have the necessary administrative arrangements made to have such institutions registered, if they are capable of being registered, and in any case take action to allow pensioners in institutions to get hospital accommodation, medical treatment and medicine free of charge? </para>

            <para>- The Commonwealth Transport Advisory Council met in Brisbane and considered proposals made by several organizations in Australia interested in a national roads policy. Consideration was also given to the problem by State and Federal Ministers and it was agreed to hold a special conference in Melbourne on Monday, the 29th August, to consider the proposals made by such organizations. At that meeting the proposals will be considered by the various State and Federal Ministers. I point out that most of the powers under our constitutional set-up reside with the States and that this council is purely of an advisory nature. However, I believe that much useful work has already been done and that an important step forward has been taken by dealing with this problem on a national basis. </para>

            <para>- Is the PostmasterGeneral aware that there is decided dissatisfaction among the lower-paid members of the Australian Postal &#34;Workers Union in Western Australia as the result of the policy of the Postmaster-General in paying to an -employee known as a conduit worker in the terms of the employment of that department a lesser rate than it pays elsewhere for equivalent work? Will the Minister see that differentiation in payment for similar classes of work is not made as between the various States in an Australia-wide department such as the Postal Department? Will he place the conduit worker in the Australian Postal Workers Union in Western Australia on the same rate as is paid to men doing the same class of work in other States? Does the Minister consider that in a Commonwealth department there should be any differentiation in payment to employees doing the same class of work and who are working under the same classification? </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Supply. Has the Minister for Supply given any consideration to the advisability of installing rolling mills to operate in connexion with the Australian Aluminium Commission&#39;s works at Bell Bay ? Is it a fact that if rolling mills are not established at Bell Bay, the main plant for the production of ingot aluminium, costing over &#163;10,000,000, will provide a comparatively small return for such a large investment, as ingots command a much lower price than aluminium sheets? Would the establishment of rolling mills on the site of the main plant greatly increase the revenue from the industry and provide- a sound investment? </para>

The first of those statements was that the responsibility for the selection of a suitable site was that of the Port Augusta local authority whilst the second, which was given to the mayor of Port Augusta, was that as there was already an uptodate airport at Port Pirie the Government did not consider it necessary to provide another aerodrome in that region. </para>

I point out that recently during a visit by members of the Parliament to the Northern Territory my attention was directed to what I consider to be a very grave injustice to a member of the Royal Australian Air Force in Darwin under a Northern Territory ordinance which is in operation at the present time and which should, in all justice, be examined very closely by this Parliament which is responsible for the administration of that Territory. I ask the Leader of the Government whether he is in a position to advise the Senate whether the Government has made any move to amend the Northern Territory ordinance relating to the supply of liquor to aborigines, which has caused an obvious injustice to this member of the Royal Australian Air Force in Darwin who was sentenced to six months&#39; imprisonment. Has the Government considered the remarks of tho magistrate and those of the judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Kriewaldt, both of whom referred to the injustice of the ordinance and said that it had operated harshly on this member of the Royal Australian Air Force? </para>

          <para class="block">The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> is now delivering in another place his budget speech for 1955-56. Copies of the Treasurer&#39;s speech will shortly be available to honorable senators. Meanwhile, I should like to bring to the notice of .honorable senators some of the main features of the budget and of the economic context within which it has been framed. </para>
          <para>For several years past Australia has enjoyed substantial and increasing prosperity. Throughout last financial year, the run of good times continued unbroken. Total employment rose by 83,000 to record heights. National income was &#163;191,000,000, or 5 per cent, greater than the year before. Output improved further. Spending on consumer goods and services was 9 per cent, higher than in the previous year and high profits were made by many businesses. At the same time, the year 1954-55 brought gathering signs of strain in the economy. Labour shortages became general and, in some fields, acute. Wages and other elements in costs began to rise again and this led to upward pressure on prices. The deficit in our external trade widened rapidly and our overseas exchange reserves ran down. By the end of the financial year there were unmistakable signs of active inflation. </para>
          <para>It is still a mild form of inflation if compared with our experience in the period up to 1952. The rise in costs and prices has not yet gone very far, and although there have been some minor and local shortages, supplies have been more or less sufficient, whilst in some quarters it appears that stocks have actually increased. Nevertheless, once the costprice spiral begins it tends to accelerate and then it becomes very difficult to halt. If there have so far been no major shortages, that is only because we have been importing much more heavily from abroad than our overseas earnings can justify. </para>
          <para>During 1954-55 the cost of imports, including freight, exceeded the value of exports by &#163;173,000,000. When net payments abroad for other items such as interest and dividends are included there was a deficit on current account of no less than &#163;256,000,000. After allowing for various loans and other capital transactions, the net deficiency on the whole of our external transactions for the year was &#163;142,000,000 and this was the extent to which our international reserves were reduced. At the 30th June last those reserves stood at &#163;428,000,000. </para>
          <para>Exports, it is true, were &#163;49,000,000 less than in the previous year, but total export income was still &#163;763,000,000 which is quite a good level of income by comparison with most earlier years. The main cause of the deterioration in the balance of payments was the rise in imports which, on an f.o.b. basis, reached &#163;846,000,000 as compared with &#163;683,000,000 in 1953-54. Thus imports cost an additional &#163;163,000,000 or &#163;184,000,000 if freight is included, and this despite the fact that throughout the whole year a considerable part of our imports were under strict licensing control. If restrictions had not applied the rise in imports would of course have been much larger. </para>
          <para>The great rise in the demand for imports is a clear indication of the trend within the economy, and it confirms what other indicators have suggested. For some time past, something of a boom has been getting under way, a boom chiefly in consumer spending and in private investment. Personal spending on goods and services rose last year by &#163;268,000,000, or 9 per cent., whilst it is estimated that expenditure on capital equipment was &#163;108,000,000, or 15 per cent., greater than in 1953-54. These increases followed upon large increases in the previous year. There have been, as we all know, some great industrial projects in train, such as the oil refinery programmes and extensions of the iron and steel mills. Homebuilding has been running at a high level - about 75,000 houses a year. The most conspicuous growth, however, has been in purchases of motor vehicles, particularly cars, and in commercial and industrial buildings. Purchases of motor vehicles rose from 15,000 a month in 1953-54 to an average of 19,200 a month last year, an increase of 28 per cent., while expenditure on commercial and industrial buildings rose by 25 per cent. </para>
          <para>On the other hand, expenditure on public works has been relatively stable during recent years. Last year it rose by &#163;15,000,000 but that should be compared with the increase of &#163;108,000,000 in private capital expenditure. Similarly, public expenditure as a whole remained stable until a year ago; but during 1.954-55 it rose appreciably, so adding in its own field to the demand for goods and services. </para>
          <para>In the main, however, the expansion has occurred on the side of private expenditure. During the past two years the annual rate of expenditure on personal consumption and private investment, taken together, has increased by some &#163;760,000,000. This upsurge of spending has been facilitated by a large expansion of credit on the part of the banking system, together with the rapid growth of hire purchase finance. </para>
          <para>Herein lies the chief reason for the tensions and pressures in our economy that will, unless corrected, produce open inflation. Demand has thrust ahead much too fast for the growth of our resources, and so there are, on the one hand, labour shortages and rising costs and, on the other hand, excessive pressure to obtain supplies from overseas. </para>
          <para>Views differ as to the responsibilities of a government in a situation of this kind. Some would say that the Government should intervene to control the economy and its workings through whatever powers and devices it may possess. The Government does not share this view. There is another course a government can take. Its operations are, in the aggregate, very large and they pervade every section of the economy. According to the bias it gives to those operations, they will influence the general trend of the economy one way or the other. Thus, for several years past, the steady policy of the Government has been to keep a firm hand on the public sector of the economy. It has endeavoured to prevent public expenditure from rising unduly and it has sought in particular to maintain a stable, though adequate, rate of spending on public works. </para>
          <para>By this policy the Government has kept to a minimum the additional calls made by the public sector upon the available resources of the economy. It has done this with the conscious object of providing a counter-balance in a time when rapid expansion was going on elsewhere. Concurrently, the Government has ensured that the whole of its commitments have been met from current receipts, so that its operations have made no net additions to the spending power of the community. As and when additional revenue and other resources became available, the Government has reduced taxation, step by step, and the burden of taxation is now substantially lighter than it was before the Government took office. </para>
          <para>If this broad policy of restraint and careful husbanding of resources has been justified in the years just past, it must be doubly justified under present circumstances. This means that the demands on resources to be made by the Government should be kept down to absolute bedrock. Some increases in expenditure are, no doubt, inescapable. There is an obligation, for example, to assist civil and war pensioners and to make some contribution also to the increasing needs of the State governments. There can be no justification, however, for embarking on new forms of expenditure and the most searching economy must be practised over the whole field of expenditures already established. </para>
          <para>The need for restraint under present conditions is not confined to public authorities alone. Obviously, such restraining influence as government policy can exert will easily be overborne if the private sector continues on a headlong expansive course. The current need is for restraint on the part of the banking system, on the part of business, on the part of every one who has money to spend. </para>
          <para>This is not to say that plans should be abandoned or that enterprise should be throttled back, but simply that, by common consent, the things which we are all trying to do should be brought within the compass of our practical capacity for doing them. In the very broadest terms we confront to-day, in yet another of its ever-varying forms, the problem of preserving stability in our economy. </para>
          <para>A somewhat higher level of employment this year and a considerably higher level of earnings will benefit income tax collections from pay-as-you-earn instalments. On the other hand, the lower rates of tax introduced in last year&#39;s budget will this year apply for a full twelve months. Primary producers&#39; incomes were lower last year and this, together with the reduction in tax rates, will reduce the revenue from that source. Business and professional incomes, on the other hand, were substantially higher. Companies, again, had a good year in 1954-55 and revenue will benefit accordingly. After taking these various factors into account, income tax collections in 1955-56 are estimated at &#163;577,000,000 or &#163;44,000,000 more than last year. </para>
          <para>The import restrictions imposed last April will tend to reduce customs revenue, whilst less refined petrol is now being imported. Customs revenue is, therefore, estimated to fall by &#163;13,000,000. </para>
          <para>A further increase is expected in 1955-56 in the consumption of beer, tobacco and cigarettes. The output of locally refined petrol subject to excise will also be greater. A rise of &#163;16,000,000 is, therefore, expected in excise revenue. </para>
          <para>Sales tax is estimated at &#163;106,000,000, which is approximately &#163;5,500,000 above last year, whilst receipts from pay-roll tax are expected to increase by &#163;5,000,000. </para>
          <para>Total revenue from taxation is estimated at &#163;988,500,000, which represents an increase of &#163;58,000,000 over revenue last year. </para>
          <para>Miscellaneous revenue is expected to fall this year by &#163;9,000,000, the chief reason being that last year &#163;8,200,000 was transferred from surplus balances of certain trust accounts. Post Office revenue is expected to rise by nearly &#163;6,000,000. </para>
          <para>Total revenue from all sources in 1955-56 is estimated at &#163;1,114,775,000, an amount greater than last year&#39;s revenue by some &#163;56,000,000. </para>
          <para>Actual cash expenditure on defence last year was &#163;177,500,000, a short-fall of &#163;22,500,000 on the original budget estimate. The man-power and supply difficulties which caused the lag in spending last year will doubtless continue to prevail, at least for the time being. Every effort is being made, however, to build up the strength of the services and to push on with defence projects, and the Government has, therefore, decided to provide a total amount of &#163;190,000,000 in the budget for defence. </para>
          <para>The Government proposes to increase war and service pensions and certain other repatriation benefits. The special rate war pension for cases of total and permanent incapacity will be increased by 10s. a week, making the pension &#163;9 15s. a week; the 100 per cent, general rate war pension will be increased by 5s. a week, with proportionate increases for pensioners in receipt of a partial general rate pension ; and the service pension will be increased by 10s. a week to &#163;4 a week. Similarly, war widows&#39; pensions will be increased by 10s. to &#163;4 10s. a week. This increase will apply both to those war widows who receive a domestic allowance in addition to a war pension, and to those widows, of whom there are about 2,000, who are not eligible to receive a domestic allowance. The Government has also decided to remove entirely the &#34;ceiling limits &#34; on the amount of service pension which may be received by a person in addition to a war pension. </para>
          <para>The new rates will be paid from the first pension pay-day after the necessary legislation has been passed. It is estimated that these and certain minor proposals will involve an additional expenditure of &#163;2,337,000 in a full year and &#163;1,753,000 in 1955-56. </para>
          <para>Age and invalid pensions will he increased by 10s. a week to a new maximum of &#163;4 a week. The same increase will be granted in widows&#39; pensions, so raising the pension for widows who have one or more children to &#163;4 5s. a week, and for other classes of widows to &#163;3 7s. 6d. a week. </para>
          <para>The maximum permissible income, inclusive of pension, will thus rise from &#163;7 to &#163;7 10s. a week for a single pensioner, and from &#163;14 to &#163;15 a week for a married couple. There will be a corresponding increase in the maximum permissible income, inclusive of pension, for all classes of widow pensioners. </para>
          <para>Allowances payable to single and married sufferers from tuberculosis will be increased by 10s. a week to &#163;6 2s. 6d. and &#163;9 12s. 6d. a week respectively. </para>
          <para>These pension increases will become payable on the first pension pay-day after the amending legislation is passed. </para>
          <para>In addition to the other repatriation benefits already mentioned, the Government proposes to remove the ceiling limits on the total amount which may be received by way of age, invalid or widows&#39; pension in addition to a war pension. </para>
          <para>The increases in rates I have just mentioned are expected to cost &#163;14,933,000 for a full year and &#163;11,200,000 this year. After taking into account the normal growth in the numbers of social service beneficiaries, the expansion of national health services and the making of five quarterly payments of child endowment this year, the total outlay from the National Welfare Fund is expected to reach &#163;218,000,000, which is &#163;29,000,000 more than actual expenditure last year. </para>
          <para>Total payments to the States this year are estimated at &#163;220,000,000, &#39; or &#163;21.000,000 more than last year. The Government proposes again this year to pay the States a special financial assistance grant, sufficient to bring the total tax reimbursement payments for the year  to  &#163;157,000,000, or &#163;7,000,000 more than last year. This includes a special pay-&#39; ment of &#163;2,000.000 to New South Wales in recognition of the special needs of that State arising from extensive flood damage. </para>
          <para>Special grants to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania will amount to &#163;18,500,000, or &#163;6,200,000 more than last year. This follows the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. </para>
          <para>Payments under the new Commonwealth Aid Roads legislation, which was introduced last year, are estimated at &#163;26,500,000. An amount of &#163;22,360,000 was provided from Consolidated Revenue for this purpose last year. </para>
          <para>This year, provision is being made for the first time for Commonwealth financial assistance towards the capital expenditure incurred by the States on mental institutions. An amount of &#163;1,000,000 has been included in the estimates for this purpose. </para>
          <para>The estimates for capital works and services this year amount to &#163;104,000,000, compared with an appropriation last year of &#163;104,633,000 and actual expenditure of &#163;95,676,000. The estimate of expenditure on the Snowy Mountains scheme is &#163;14,600,000, compared with expenditure last year of &#163;13,200,000. Total expenditure on post office works and equipment is estimated at &#163;30,069,000, as compared with actual expenditure of &#163;25,839,000 in 1954-55&#39;. </para>
          <para>Departmental expenditure is estimated at &#163;50,532,000, an increase of &#163;945,000 over last year. Expenditure of the business undertakings is expected to rise by &#163;7,873,000, including &#163;7,019,000 provided for the post office. </para>
          <para>The estimate for ordinary services in the territories is &#163;15,090,000, compared with actual expenditure of &#163;12,971,000 in 1954-55. This provides for an increase of &#163;1,622,000 in the grant to the administration of Papua and New Guinea. </para>
          <para>Expenditure on bounties and subsidies is expected to fall by &#163;4,279,000. The main savings relate to the tea subsidy and the dairy products bounty. </para>
          <para>An estimated increase of &#163;1,523,000 in expenditure on immigration reflects the higher immigration target of 125,000 adopted for the current year. </para>
          <para>The amount provided for international development and relief is &#163;5,500,000, compared with actual expenditure last year of &#163;3,429,000. Expenditure this year under the Colombo plan is expected to total &#163;4,890,000. </para>
          <para>The estimates of expenditure which I have just given relate to items ordinarilycharged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. These estimates amount to &#163;1,066,105,000, as compared with total estimated revenue of &#163;1,114,775,000. There would thus be an apparent excess of revenue over expenditure in the Consolidated Revenue Fund - traditionally called the budget - amounting to &#163;48,670,000. </para>
          <para>There are, however, a number of other items of Commonwealth expenditure not regularly charged to Consolidated Revenue for which finance will have to be provided. These include &#163;8,500,000 for war service land settlement, &#163;8,000,000 for redemption of savings certificates, and &#163;3,500,000 for emergency wheat storage. </para>
          <para>Besides these items, there is an indeterminate but potentially quite large commitment to assist the State works and housing programmes for 1955-56 from Commonwealth resources. The borrowing programme for State works and housing programmes amounts to &#163;190,000,000 and the Commonwealth has undertaken to make advances on that basis for the first six months, arrangements for the rest of the year to be determined thereafter. &#34;We have in sight some &#163;20,000,000 from the International Bank, but for the rest, it depends on what we can borrow either overseas - at best a minor sum - or on the local market, and there the amount is much more likely to be under than over the &#163;123,000,000 we raised last year. </para>
          <para>In practical terms, the finance to meet these other Commonwealth expenditures and to provide assistance for the Loan Council programme could come only from one of two sources. It could come from central bank credit against the issue of treasury bills. I mention that source only to dismiss it as unthinkable under present circumstances. The other source is the budget, and it is plain that this is the only practicable source. If we are to be in a position to meet these commitments as and when they occur, then we must make provision now for doing so. If we are to regard ourselves as covering our potential requirements, then we must, in all honesty, appropriate for the purpose such as a sum as we now believe will be needed. </para>
          <para>That, in effect, is what the Government proposes to do. It will appropriate an amount of &#163;48,500,000 from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to a trust account to be named the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. Legislation will be brought down later in the sessional period to establish this trust account and define its purposes. The amount so appropriated to the reserve will be available there as a source of funds for the Commonwealth items of expenditure I have mentioned, such as war service land settlement. Investments will also be made from the reserve in loans to assist the Loan Council programme. After this appropriation has been made, there will remain a small surplus in Consolidated Revenue of &#163;170,000. </para>
          <para>It is clear from the foregoing that the budget for this year offers no scope for tax reductions. In any case, even if tax reductions were possible, it would not be in the best interest of the economy, under prevailing economic conditions, to make them. Tax reductions would add to current spending power and there is already a spending boom in progress. Similarly, tax concessions of certain kinds would give a further stimulus to investment, which is already making demands upon available labour and materials greater than can be fulfilled. </para>
          <para>It is primarily from this stand-point that the Government has had to consider the question of allowances for depreciation under the income tax law. The Commonwealth Committee on Rates of Depreciation has produced a most able report containing recommendations which have gained a very wide measure of support. The cost of the recommendations, in terms of revenue foregone, is estimated to be something approaching &#163;40,000,000 a year on current levels of investment and rates of taxation. Although the main revenue effect would not be felt until some time later, the economic impact of the proposals would be immediate. The Government has, therefore, had to consider the possible impact upon the economy of a major move on depreciation at this juncture </para>
          <para class="block">As it is clearly evident that investment in plant, buildings and the like is at present running at levels too high for general stability, the Government has decided that the wisest course would be to defer action on depreciation at this stage. </para>
          <para>I began by saying that, for several years - past, Australia has enjoyed substantial and increasing prosperity. I have since traversed the problems which now beset us and I have indicated the broad course of policy and action which the Government believes must be followed if these problems are to be overcome. Let me sum it all up by saying briefly that the main task before us is to hold our prosperity and to ensure that our prosperity will not be thrown away in the pursuit of short-term policies of greater superficial attractiveness. </para>
