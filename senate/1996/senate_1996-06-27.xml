<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the leave of the Senate, I wish to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  a short statement which is in response to the comments made by Mr Ross Cameron, the new member for Parramatta, during the adjournment debate in the other place on Thursday, 20 June. I am sorry that my statement has been circulated fairly late. The honourable member's comments were highly critical of the Parliament House art collection and of my role in promoting its development. I have not got any other time to incorporate this statement, so I would like to do it now in the interests of the speed of business.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RESPONSE TO MR ROSS CAMERON MP</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I rise to respond to the comments made by Mr Ross Cameron, the new member for Parramatta, during the adjournment debate in the other place on Thursday 20 June. His comments were highly critical of the Parliament House Art Collection and of my role in promoting its development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cameron's dissatisfaction with the collection appears to stem from the art shown to him recently when he was selecting works for his office. He apparently feels, based on this viewing, that the art collection "systematically discriminates against anything vaguely traditional" which would not be included in the collection because they "would not conform to the strict, elitist and completely arbitrary criteria of those selecting the artworks of this parliament".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the member for Parramatta's comments are not based on the overall balance of the collection. What he saw were the works of art remaining after all of the many, much more senior, Senators and Members before him had made their selections. Perhaps when he has been in Parliament a little longer he may find the selection available to him more to his liking. I am advised that the Member for Parramatta has now decorated his office with the portraits of former Governors&hyphen;General. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as I can tell, Mr Cameron is worried that the collection contains many abstract works of art. In his comments Mr Cameron approvingly quoted from an earlier letter to me from Senator Woods who said that "we have a collection almost entirely devoted to the avant&hyphen;garde". But this is mistaken. The avant&hyphen;garde in any field refers to works that are in the vanguard of recent developments. Abstract art has been made for most of this century and is an established style, regarded as deadly conservative by the practitioners of the more radical forms of conceptual, installation and performance art, none of which are represented in Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The member for Parramatta appears to be ignorant of the background to the collection so I will briefly outline it here. The Art Advisory Committee of the Parliament House Construction Authority was the only advisory committee set up by the Authority and included some of the most senior and expert members of the Australian visual arts community as well as parliamentarians. The Authority reported in detail to the Joint Standing Committee on the New parliament House which established a subcommittee to allow closer parliamentary scrutiny of the art program. The Joint Standing Committee approved not only the direction of the collection but also much of its detail. The original budget for works of art for the offices of Senators and Members was however much reduced as a result of budget cuts in 1986 and this resulted in a reduced collection which lacked some of the intended range and balance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The collection was, and is, intended to complement and evolve organically from the building's form, function and symbolism, rather than being added as a decorative dressing. In the words of Aldo Giurgola, the Senior Design Architect for Parliament House:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as the building is intended to express strong convictions while remaining flexible as a workplace over the coming years, so also is the art program intentionally formulated to provide a clear sense of order and direction while nevertheless allowing for the varying points of view, styles, and accretion of works which will occur throughout the country's future</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cameron also sought to articulate his position by quoting general comments by two arts writers. Neither of them discussed particular works of art to illustrate their cases. Had they done so Mr Cameroon would have found that art critic Giles Auty approves of many artists in the collection which Mr Cameron would find `beyond the pale', including Clifford Possum, Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Joy Hester, Godfrey Miller and Roger Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second writer Mr Cameron quoted was Terence Maloon, senior education officer at the Art Gallery <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of New South Wales and recently a member of the Visual Arts/Craft Board of the Australia Council. The article from which Mr Cameron quoted was actually written in defence of contemporary art. In the article he plays the devils' advocate, setting out the popular case against cotemporary art (the parts quoted by Mr Cameron) and then providing a considered rebuttal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Terence Maloon makes the obvious point that of the great variety of art being made, a considerable quantity will be of poor quality. The difficulty he sees for many people is that they are unable to separate the good from the bad and resent the idea that others can, preferring to dismiss the whole endeavour instead of learning  to discriminate for themselves. Some people seem to believe that of all areas of human endeavour, only the products of visual artists must be accessible to all people without effort. Its like insisting that all English literature is rubbish because you can't read English.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the member for Parramatta notes I reinstituted the acquisition program in early 1995. I did so because the 1986 cut had left the collection unbalanced and too small, but the responsibility for approving particular works rests with an art advisory committee to which a consultant curator recommends individual works. The advisory committee, which I Chair, is composed of the Presiding Officers and two members of the Joint House Committee. We provide parliamentary scrutiny and represent the collection's main client group as well as what might be called non&hyphen;expert taste. Four other members of the Committee are expert members, including the senior curator of Australian art from the National Gallery; a senior member of the Visual Arts/Craft Board; the partner in Mitchell/Giurgola Thorp Architects who co&hyphen;conceived of the collection and co&hyphen;ordinated its development in the 1980s; and a younger practising artist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acquisitions policy is far from being strict, elitist or arbitrary. It is instead designed to be fairly open so as to encompass the best of the work being made at any time. In this way the recent acquisitions for the collection reflect the return of  figuration as a dominant style after the predominence of abstraction during the 1980s. Some of our criteria are that works speak with a clear and fresh voice; are of high quality; represent the multiplicity of visions in Australia; and ensure an evolving contemporaneity in the collection. How effectively these criteria are being applied I leave to you all to decide when viewing the exhibition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously not all of the works acquired will be to the taste of individual Members and Senators, but even Mr Cameron conceded that "there are some works of obvious ability and interest" in the current exhibition of new acquisitions. I would be the first to agree. Indeed there is vigorous competition <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2314"> among some members and senators to snap up the works in the exhibition. For example, the painting by Lin Onus he referred to in his comments usually hangs in the office of the Deputy Prime Minister; an individual who few of us would accuse of having radical or pretentious tastes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The business of the parliament is to provide for the interests of all Australians in coming to terms with the challenges of contemporary life and to shape our common future. This is not a place for relaxation and basking in the reflected glory of past achievement. By trying to select the best work of the emerging and established artists of our time we are bring into this building their perspectives on Australian society. As in all endeavours, our success will be gauged by those generations who follow us. We are building a collection for the future not one that mimics the past.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT></DEBATE>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in answer to a question, advised that an instrument made under the Native Title Act 1993 on 24 December 1993, which was the very day that the act received assent, was never tabled. The Prime Minister advised that the effect of the failure to table could well cast a legal doubt over a large number of acts affecting the Aboriginal community, the pastoral industry and the mining industry. The Prime Minister further advised that a fresh determination would be tabled later in the week. The states and other affected bodies would be consulted on remedial matters needed to, as the Prime Minister expressed it, patch up the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2319">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the original and the amending determinations are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which requires the determinations to be tabled in both houses within 15 sitting days of making, failing which they cease to have effect. This was the position with the original determination. Then, two years later, the original determination was amended. Although the amending determination was validly tabled, its practical effect would be little or none, because its only substantive provisions purport to amend the invalid earlier determination. It is ironic that the explanatory statement for the second determination advises that its purpose is to address what it terms `problems', `uncertainty', `difficulties' and an `unintentional result' in the original.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This omission was in fact first detected by the staff of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances who at once alerted the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who up until then were unaware of the failure to table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, 26 June 1996, a fresh determination was tabled with the object of correcting the situation. This determination was made, gazetted and tabled on the same day, which showed an alacrity not usually noticeable in the actions of the executive relating to delegated legislation. The committee will scrutinise this instrument in the usual way and take any appropriate action. In the meantime, however, it is disappointing that the explanatory statement for the new determination does not acknowledge the actions of the committee, without which this matter would never have come to light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This example illustrates the need for administrators to be aware of, and to apply, the requirements relating to delegated legislation. In the present case this committee was able to detect the damage only after it had been done. In this context, agencies should familiarise themselves with the annual reports and special reports of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, which should enable pitfalls such as the present one to be avoided. I thank the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996 contains three changes which were announced by the previous Government in the 1995/96 Budget as a response to a small number of recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The bill also includes consequential changes to child support legislation to reflect changes made in the Social Security Act 1991, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The package of measures included in the Bill is aimed at increasing flexibility, reducing the level of intrusiveness, and improving certainty and clarity in the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">USE OF ELECTION WHERE INCOME HAS CHANGED</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a child support liability has been created by an administrative assessment, a parent is able to apply to have the Registrar vary the amount of their liability by lodging an income estimate election. An income estimate election often results in a paying parent being entitled to a refund of monies already paid to the person receiving child support. This causes significant inconvenience for persons receiving child support where the amount of child support has already been spent for the benefit of the children. It also means that the parent paying child support often has to repay most, if not all, of the amount refunded over the remainder of the year&mdash;at a time when they have less capacity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the effect of an income estimate election to make it less likely that a person receiving child support will be asked to repay amounts in the future and to make the effect of an income estimate election a more accurate reflection of a paying parent's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised income estimate will be used to recalculate the amount of the child support properly payable for the year. However, amounts payable prior to the date of lodgment of an estimate will generally be left undisturbed and will be taken into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2325"> account in arriving at the future liabilities for the remaining period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only time that amounts payable prior to the lodgment of an estimate will be disturbed is where, after calculating the amount properly payable and the amounts charged to the date of the estimate, the parent has already been charged too much for the year.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is conscious that the implications may be severe for children where a payer defaults. The Registrar's primary responsibility will continue to be to ensure the collection of child support in a timely manner. In making the proposed change the Government will ensure that there are strict safeguards in the event of default.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event of default, the Registrar will be able to require that child support be withheld from a person's employer in the future and a payer will not be able to make another election until a period of 6 months has elapsed from the date the Registrar was required to make arrangements with a person's employer.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing law, where a person is voluntarily paying child support without an assessment of his child support liability, the amounts paid or to be paid under such arrangements cannot be taken into account by the Court in making orders in either property or spousal maintenance proceedings. This may result in Courts making orders which do not adequately reflect the true circumstances of the party who is to pay child support. This also means that parties must apply for an assessment even where they wish to make private arrangements regarding child support for the Court to take into account these commitments when making orders regarding property or spousal maintenance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, NBEET comprises the Australian Language and Literacy Council, the Australian Research Council, the Employment and Skills Council, the Higher Education Council and the Schools Council which all report to the minister through the National Board. The Board and Councils are supported by a series of committees including the Australian International Education Foundation Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our policy statement on higher education Quality, diversity and choice we announced that we would abolish NBEET and establish independent Councils to advise on higher education and research. This bill is the first step in that process. It provides for the abolition of the National Board, the Australian Language and Literacy Council, the Employment and Skills Council and the Schools Council. The Higher Education Council and the Australian Research Council will continue as independent Councils with similar functions reporting directly to the minister. Following con <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> sultation with the sector new legislation will be presented to establish the successors to the Higher Education Council and the Australian Research Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I move now to the major provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Board, the Australian Language and Literacy Council, the Employment and Skills Council and the Schools Council will cease to exist when this legislation is proclaimed and appointments to those bodies will be terminated. The Higher Education Council and the Australian Research Council will continue with their membership unchanged. The remaining Councils will provide advice to the minister on matters already referred to them by the minister. Any committees currently established to serve the two Councils will continue with their existing membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the previous legislation each Council had specific functions and the Board had functions which included and extended the functions of the Councils. The general functions of the Board which related to the work of the Higher Education Council and the Australian Research Council are now functions of the respective Councils. The minister can create and abolish committees to assist the Councils to carry out their functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Previously advice and reports from the Councils were filtered through the National Board before going to the minister. In line with the government's intention to create more independent Councils, each Council will now provide advice and reports direct to the minister and will also take responsibility for promoting informed public debate and for granting financial assistance for innovative projects. There is also provision for Councils to co&hyphen;operate to provide advice to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A final report on the work of the Board and all Councils will be prepared and tabled. Each remaining Council will report to the minister annually on their operations; these reports will be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments go to administrative matters such as removing definitions no longer required under the act and retaining the position of Director to service the remaining Councils. There are also transitional provisions to provide for continuity of membership of the remaining Councils, and the Counsellors and committees which assist them.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (INDUSTRY ACCESS CODES) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill amends the Trade Practices Act 1974 (the principal act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of the bill is to simplify and streamline the procedures for approving access arrangements to infrastructure services in network <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2327"> industries. The bill will amend the principal act to incorporate a general industry access code approval process as a basis for access undertakings in network industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal act currently includes provisions whereby third parties can seek access to services provided by essential infrastructure facilities of national significance. These provisions are an important feature of Australia's national competition policy reforms. They promote competitive markets, in order to improve efficiency and service delivery in infrastructure industries such as electricity and gas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the principal act a service provider can volunteer to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the Commission) an access `undertaking' which sets out the terms and conditions on which the service provider will offer access to any third party. The Commission must publish the proposed undertaking and go through a public consultation process before accepting each undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In network industries, such as electricity, the emerging pattern is for an industry code to be developed governing access arrangements within the industry which will form the basis of undertakings to the Commission by individual service providers. Under this approach, the principal act currently requires the Commission to undertake multiple public consultation processes&mdash;one in relation to the access code, if it is necessary to authorise the code, and others in relation to the access undertakings of individual access providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The absence of a single access code approval process for network industries in the principal act leads to two principal shortcomings. Firstly, the unnecessary duplication of the public consultation process is an inefficient way of processing access undertakings in network industries and runs the risk of unduly delaying progress towards more competitive infrastructure industries. Secondly, it may be difficult for the Commission to assess whether separate access undertakings will achieve coherent industry&hyphen;wide access arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will address these shortcomings by allowing acceptance of an industry-wide access code with a single public consultation process. Industry participants will be able to develop an access code for their industry. The access code would set out details about access for the industry and be approved by the Commission after public consultation. Undertakings from individual access providers which conform with the access code could then be approved by the Commission without a further public consultation process, thereby reducing the burden on industry. Moreover, the Commission will be able to consider whether an undertaking is in accordance with the industry access code, which should enhance the coherence of the industry-wide <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access arrangements. Industry access codes can be prepared by an industry body which, in each case, will be prescribed in Regulations made for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also include a provision to preserve the integrity of the competitive conduct and authorisation rules of the principal act. The bill provides that the access provisions in the principal act will not affect liability of the relevant parties for contraventions of the competitive conduct rules in the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost to revenue of the proposed amendments is expected to be nil.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not every Australian has had recourse to use the office of the Ombudsman and, in terms of commonwealth agencies, it is a very modest office costing a little over $8 million per year. I should say to the Senate that in 1994&hyphen;95&mdash;4,465 written complaints and 12,444 oral complaints were received, making a total of 17,010 of our fellow Australians who sought to use the services of the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office of the Ombudsman is one of the important cornerstones of our human rights infrastructure in Australia. It is fair to say that the following quote from the parliamentary report illustrates this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most honourable Senators on either side, and Members for that matter, support human rights in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite a few Senators and Members are particularly concerned about newspaper reports that the resources of the Office of the Ombudsman may be cut quite severely in the up&hyphen;coming August budget. The Ombudsman has been quite outspoken and consistent in criticising the operation of, amongst other areas, the Child Support Agency. The issues raised in these criticisms have, to date, been largely neglected by the parliament and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks to redress some of the concerns surrounding the Ombudsman, a statutory office holder, and the tabling of her Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably there is no committee of the parliament that actually looks at the Ombudsman's report. This parliament could quite easily set up a joint committee&mdash;and it is not proposed that there be a permanent secretariat&mdash;which would meet the needs of receiving the Ombudsman's report and ensuring that appropriate action is taken. Over 40,000 of our fellow Australians have contacted the Ombudsman in 1994&hyphen;95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman's recent report is extremely useful, and to highlight I would like to quote a few relevant lines. The Report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an externally independent review agency, the Ombudsman can and does, to use the words of Jus <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tice Lee, bring the lamp of scrutiny to otherwise dark places, even over the resistance to those who would draw the blinds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here we are talking about public service departments, commonwealth agencies, ordinary citizens and, it should be said, small business&mdash;who, if you have read this report, have been forced as a matter of final resort to contact the Ombudsman to secure their rights under the law&mdash;simply because the Ombudsman insists that public administration must be consistent with the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than that, the Ombudsman emphasises shortcomings in her powers or in the trends of the law. For example, in her latest report, the Ombudsman notes that `there is much contracting out within the commonwealth public sector'. She does not object to that notion but highlights the fact that these are creating new areas of concern and that legislation is deficient. Something needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately I can not report to the Senate that anything is being done about this report. What I can say however is that this bill will redress the situation. The Ombudsman points out where people have exceeded their powers, for example, in relation to customs search. When ordinary citizens or small business approach the Ombudsman, they are not going to a chamber magistrate and they do not engage a barrister or solicitor because the service provided by the Ombudsman is free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The heart of this private member's bill is this: it is not the Ombudsman who has failed the parliament; it is the parliament who has failed the Ombudsman and the 40,000 of our fellow Australians who have contacted her office seeking assistance. We, the parliament, are not listening to the needs of the people who have contacted the Ombudsman.</PARA>

The effect of this motion would be to add a constituency to a committee which is essentially a scientific advisory committee. There are no other members of this committee who represent a body, a constituency or a particular segment of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The individuals on ADEC, who are all of the very highest reputation and who have contributed to making ADEC an international body of enormously high repute, are there because of individual abilities. I understand the motivation behind this move is to make sure that the committee has consumer representation. But this is an advisory committee; it does not make any decisions. Consumer representation is therefore less important here; the committee does not require that constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's view is that there is a major role for community consumer groups having input into the whole process of evaluating and looking at drugs, PBAC and a range of other issues. The question is where that input should occur. We believe very firmly that the previous Labor government, which mucked up the appointment of consumer representatives to this committee, has made the wrong point on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This committee should stand alone and be based on scientific merit and integrity. If this change were so important, why, in the 13 years of the former Labor government, did it not fix either this committee or its predecessors? At the last moment they have decided to make this gesture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This move has the potential to undermine the integrity of the committee and, therefore, the ability of the international community to accept advice and information from it. We believe very strongly that there is a role for consumer input into this process&mdash;nobody is denying that&mdash;but this is the wrong committee for it. We accept that there are pressures on the legislative program today so we will not object to this notice being taken as formal. We will vote against the motion on the voices only. </PARA>

However, we should reflect on what is occurring because, as I understand it, this is the first time that such permission has been sought from the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chris Evans wants to move that the Senate give permission for Mr Robert King, who in 1994 was secretary of the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations, to give evidence at the hearing in the matter of Alston against Carr, which is listed for hearing in the County Court in Melbourne on 12 August 1996 as matter No. MC9500490. In other words, permission is being sought from the Senate for an official of the Senate to give evidence in litigation being conducted in the court between two senators. It is necessary for the Senate to give such permission in a matter of a procedural or formal nature because of standing order 183, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Senator or officer of the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is the relevant designation in this instance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or a person involved in recording the proceedings of the Senate or a committee, may not give evidence elsewhere in respect of proceedings of the Senate or the committee, without the permission of the Senate, or, if the President is authorised to give that permission, of the President.</PARA>
<PARA>In agreeing to the passage of this motion, I understand that what is being sought is permission under standing order 183 for Mr King to be able to give evidence in respect of the proceedings of the Senate or a committee&mdash;in this instance, a committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make is that this in no way affects the provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. That act was introduced for a vitally important purpose&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is, to protect the public and members of parliament. It ensures that senators, members and the public are able to engage in parliamentary processes, which includes committees, without the fear of action following what they might say or do within such processes. That protection is specifically set out in section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not read that section in full, but the point I am wishing to make and put on the record is that, whilst we are agreeing to let this official attend the court to give evidence of a formal or procedural nature, as that is what is being sought by one of the senators, we are in no way&mdash;even if we had the power to do so, which I do not think we do&mdash;agreeing to waive principles of parliamentary privilege as they might exist in the common law or as they have been codified within the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My interpretation of those privileges is that the immunity prevents evidence of parliamentary proceedings being used in any substantive way in proceedings before the court or the tribunal, either to support an action or to provide a defence. It would be an intolerable situation if officials of the parliament were being called to help build a case for either the plaintiff or the defendant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That situation would put officials of the parliament in impossible positions, because they simply would not be able to carry on their work in the future in a way we would expect of them. They would not be able to give advice to senators in a way we would expect of them. It would inhibit their work in such a way that the proceedings of the parliament, either in the Senate or through its committees, would become unworkable. I put on the record that we expect parliamentary privileges and the full conditions of the act to continue, notwithstanding this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The speed with which genetic technology has gained enormous power has been both dramatic and extremely challenging. Yet around the world governments have failed to come to terms with these challenges even though the influence of this technology over the destiny of all life on the planet, including human life, poses very great potential threats. Indeed, at a meeting late last year of the parliamentary Amnesty Group, attended by a number in this chamber, Mr Justice Kirby, said he believed that the power of this technology, and also its potential threats, was greater than that of the nuclear enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the intersection of this technology with commerce lies the patents legislation, legislation which is grounded in a 400 year history but which draws its present broad principles from the economics and business arrangements that evolved in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is time we rethought how this powerful technology can best be harnessed to the long term benefit of all life rather than the sectional interests of some present commercial enterprises. The matter is urgent. This very week a case began in the Federal Court of Australia, the background to which underscores the failure of governments to adequately legislate, and the outcome of which has very serious long term consequences for the welfare of humanity. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2332"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, very legitimate concern has been expressed by Aboriginal groups in both Queensland and Tasmania, regarding the collection of blood by American interests. The blood, part of a collection from indigenous people around the world, will be analysed for its genetic content. Under the law as it stands this genetic information and the genes on which it is based may be patentable and therefore owned by commercial interests and exploited for commercial purposes. The extraordinarily complex and fundamental questions posed by these developments, as well as their more practical consequences are not well dealt with within the confines of patent law. They should be excluded from patent law and dealt with elsewhere. It is this that the present bill seeks to do.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The case before the Federal Court illustrates several of the dangers of the law as it stands. In 1987, Dr Michael Houghton of Chiron Corporation isolated a Hepatitis C virus. Chiron Corporation has claimed very wide ranging patents over all aspects of Hepatitis C research and its applications; from the virus itself to diagnostic kits used in its detection, to the development of vaccines. It has restricted the number of other companies and laboratories that it has licensed to three or four world wide. The effect of this has been that many laboratories have discontinued work, or not begun work, on Hepatitis C for fear of falling foul of Chiron's patent. Many eminent researchers have expressed the view that this has seriously limited the quality and variety of work on Hepatitis C and comparison is made with work on the HIV virus in which no such limitation was or is in place and a much larger number of laboratories are involved in research. This is highly significant as Hepatitis C may prove to be far more dangerous to humanity than HIV. The small number of laboratories working on Hepatitis C is therefore of great concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, it is estimated that 150,000 Australians are already infected with Hepatitis C and that this number increases by 8&hyphen;10,000 each year. Approximately 20% of these people will go on to develop life threatening liver disease including liver failure and liver cancer. Like HIV, Hepatitis C has a long incubation period in which the infected person may suffer no ill health and yet may be passing the virus on to others. The costs, both human and economic, are very large and likely to grow much larger.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the original isolation of the virus by Chiron in 1987, now called strain 1A, a number of other strains of the virus have been identified, approximately 12 in all. It is claimed that the diagnostic test developed by Chiron, and based on strain 1A, fails to detect these other strains. Chiron contests this claim. Another company, Murex Diagnostics, has independently developed tests based on other strains which it independently isolated. It claims its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> test is capable of detecting a wider range of strains. Chiron is challenging Murex, claiming that Murex is infringing Chiron's comprehensive patent on Hepatitis C. Since the advent of the Murex diagnostic kit the cost of Chiron's diagnostic kit has been reduced by 30%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This case illustrates several of the adverse consequences of allowing the patenting of genes and naturally occurring sequences of genes including whole living organisms. Research is directed toward those applications that appear most profitable rather than those for which the need is greatest, applications are then constrained to fit the profit needs of the patent holder and costs to the consumer, in this case the patient, are high so as to recoup investment in research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, in addition, much more fundamental philosophical and moral reasons why the patenting of genes, naturally occurring sequences of genes, including whole naturally occurring living organisms should be excluded from the realm of patentability. On one reading of the patent legislation, these items are not patentable because naturally occurring things do not possess the qualities of either novelty or inventiveness. This bill seeks to make this quite explicit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995 the Labor government proposed amendments to the Patents Bill of 1989. When the latter legislation was debated my predecessor, Dr John Coulter argued vigorously for genes and living things not to be patentable. He sent the legislation to a committee of the Senate and despite strong representations in support of his amendments from all the mainstream churches and conservation groups as well as many others including scientists and ethicists, the amendments were defeated by a combined government and opposition vote. The amending bill which the government introduced in 1995, although designed merely to tidy up a few loose ends, provided another opportunity to address the serious ethical and moral problems posed by the patenting of life. This bill has not been proceeded with and it is this reason I am introducing these amendments as a private member's bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the passage of the 1989 act, there has been a growing and vigorous debate about certain aspects of patenting of genes and genetic information. We see this debate coming to the fore in Australia in the Chiron vs Murex litigation in the Federal Court and in the concern expressed by Aboriginal groups over the patenting of their genes. This bill provides an opportunity to advance our legislation in this area in line with developments in international thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A great many people around the world: scientists, ethicists, religious leaders, politicians and ordinary people have been troubled by rapid developments in the field of genetic manipulation, the control of much of this technology by commercial interests <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2333"> through patenting and the consequent direction of much of the research. This broad range of people has been asking searching questions about the morality of owning life, and of research and development in this area being driven primarily by the profit motive. There is also the broader question about whether information about the very basis of life is not the property of all humankind and not the exclusive property of a pharmaceutical company to share or withhold as it chooses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union meeting in Madrid in April last year parliamentarians from 114 national parliaments called for a prohibition on the patenting of human genes. The resolution underlined the `urgent need to ban the patenting of human genes. . . (and) prohibit all financial gain from the human body or parts thereof, subject to exceptions provided for by law'. Australian parliamentarians were a party to this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of parliament from around the world were reflecting the concern of their constituents to a very important issue. Very many people find it distasteful that human body parts, including genes should be commodified and become merely articles of trade. The distaste springs from several sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, there is the repugnance at the notion of ownership as such. This is based on and arises from a sense of respect of life and life processes. For the religious this has expressed itself as respect for God's creation. Body parts, including genes are not like other materials to be owned and traded in the market place as common commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, there is concern that the ownership and commercial exploitation of humans and human parts is abhorrent to the principle of equity. Surely, it is said, knowledge of ourselves should not become the province of the `commercial in confidence' and access to both the parts and knowledge about the parts should not be determined by the ability to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scientists have expressed more pragmatic concerns. Will the patenting of genes and gene sequences inhibit the free flow of information on which science and the advance of science ultimately depends? Many scientists think it has and point to the legal wrangle that has arisen in relation to claims over the ownership of the gene content of Hepatitis C. As mentioned above this has caused other potential researchers in this area to vacate work on hepatitis C, its diagnosis, treatment or cure for fear of falling foul of the patents or of having to pay royalties on their own research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill I move is both simple and self&hyphen;evident. Two general principles involved in the patenting of something are that the item being patented should possess the properties of inventiveness and novelty. It would seem to follow from this that something that occurs spontaneously and naturally in nature <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot be patented. After all, every cell in our bodies is packed with the same DNA and the cells in every other person's body is packed with practically identical DNA. With about 100 million cells in each human body and about 5 billion human beings on the planet there are about (5 followed by 23 zeros) 500,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000 copies of human genes at any one time available&mdash;hardly anything novel about that!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same could be said of the genes of other species. They are not novel; they do not possess the quality of novelty. Moreover these molecules occur in nature. Genes and gene sequences occur naturally; they are in every respect like other naturally occurring molecules. Who ever thought that water or oxygen could be patentable? It should be self&hyphen;evident that naturally occurring molecules like DNA which are so widespread in nature could not posses the qualities of inventiveness or novelty. The question of patenting should not logically arise. But it has and somehow some people have confused the process of extraction and use of the genes with the genes themselves&mdash;perhaps deliberately or perhaps because they did not understand the naturalness and the commonness of genes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My bill seeks merely to make this point explicit so that there can be no confusion in future. If carried it would mean that genes or gene sequences could not themselves be patented. However the processes by which the genes are extracted from the cells, or the processes by which the extracted genes are manipulated or the specific uses to which the genes may be put, provided one or other of these showed the qualities of novelty and inventiveness in sufficient degree, would be patentable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier, I pointed to the IPU Conference in Madrid in April last year. The resolution passed at the conference referred to human genes and said that human genes should not be patentable. My amendment refers to genes generally and not just human genes. One way of demonstrating the structure, nature and function of genes is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Genes are the library of the cell. Every living cell contains the genes which carries the information to tell the cell precisely what to do, what to make, and how to make it. Unlike human languages, such as English and Russian, which are written with different words using very different characters the characters and words of the genetic library are the same in every living cell from bacteria and plants right through to humans. I could not go into a Russian or Japanese library and begin to read the books. The characters and the words are very different from English.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the reading mechanism which reads the information in my genes in my cells could instantly recognise and read the genetic information in the cell of a mouse, or a eucalypt or a mushroom. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2334"> Similarly the reading mechanism in each of the cells of these other organisms could read the genetic code in any of my cells. It is precisely this commonality of language that makes genetic engineering possible; for example, the placing of the gene for human insulin into a bacterium and the production of human insulin by that bacterium. The bacterium has no way of knowing that it is reading a human gene and not one of its own genes! This is because the characters and words which describe the structure of human insulin have the same meaning as the characters and words which tell the bacterium how to make one of its own proteins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Humans share perhaps 95% of their genes with chimpanzees. Only a small proportion of genes code for uniquely human functions. The genes that code for very basic or fundamental cellular functions have remained, often unchanged, throughout very long periods of evolutionary history.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus most human genes could be found in a very wide variety of other species. Certainly, very long DNA sequences could be found in very diverse species. It is for this reason that it is illogical to seek to prevent the patenting of human genes while allowing the patenting of genes from other species. If the Senate is convinced that human genes should not be patentable then it must see that it follows that naturally occurring genes and gene sequences from any source should not be patentable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A defence for the patenting of genes is often made on the ground that research will not be conducted without profit as a motive. Chiron, for example, claims that it would not have done the work on Hepatitis C without the protection of a patent at the end of the road if its work proved successful. This defence is hollow. The money that pharmaceutical companies invest in research ultimately comes from the community via product charges. Whether that investment is made by commercial interests driven by the profit incentive, in this very sensitive area, or whether it is made through publicly funded research, directed by a broader range of considerations is the question that needs to be clearly answered. Separating, and disallowing the patenting of genes, gene sequences, including whole living organisms, from specific and defined techniques for manipulating these materials, and allowing the latter provides a solution to this dilemma.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only is there support for legislation of this sort in the IPU but when former Senator John Coulter moved similar amendments to the Patents Bill in 1989 they were supported by all the mainstream churches and the national environment groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be both morally repugnant and clearly dangerous to continue to allow the patenting of genes or gene sequences or the information contained in genes or gene sequences and I commend the Amending bill to the Senate. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June 1994, the Committee tabled its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Breast Cancer Screening and Treatment</EMPHASIS>  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">in Australia</EMPHASIS> . The report examined the effectiveness of the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer and made certain recommendations for improving the effectiveness of that Program. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2336"> The National Program, which is a joint Commonwealth&hyphen;State and Territory funded initiative, provides mammographic screening for women aged 40 years and over, with a special attention given to women aged 50&hyphen;69 years  the age group most at risk of developing breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Late in the last Parliament, the Committee wrote to Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments requesting information on the progress made in implementing the recommendations contained in the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responses indicated that most of the Committee's recommendations  which primarily addressed matters related to access to screening services, workforce issues, the collection  and dissemination of data and additional research needs  have, or are in the process of being, implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to access to the Program, a national advertising campaign promoting the Program and encouraging women to attend screening services was initiated in February 1995. In addition, all States and Territories have, or are in the process of, implementing measures to improve access for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and women living in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of workforce issues, the States and Territories regularly monitor the supply of radiographers and radiologists available to the National Program. The Commonwealth and the States have initiated a number of  measures, including the provision of information packages and seminars, to encourage the role of GPs in their recruitment and support functions under the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendations relating to data collection and dissemination have also been addressed. Issues relating to uniformity in data collection and the timeliness of national cancer incidence reporting are currently being addressed by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in conjunction with State and Territory cancer registries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for additional research into breast cancer has also been recognised by the Commonwealth Government. Specific funding was provided in the 1994 budget for the establishment of the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation for Breast Cancer Research. Ongoing funding for research into breast cancer will also be provided through the National Health and Medical Research Council.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just tabled&mdash;Report 344&mdash;is the latest report produced by the JCPA in fulfilment of that responsibility. It is the result of the Committee's examination of the audit reports which were tabled in the financial years 1993&hyphen;94 and 1994&hyphen;95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should make clear at the outset that this report is largely the work of the former JCPA&mdash;the Committee established in the last Parliament under the chairmanship of the former Member for Oxley, Mr Les Scott. Although the current Committee has approved the report, the report was prepared by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2337"> former Committee on the basis of evidence it sought and received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the period covered by this report the Auditor&hyphen;General presented 75 audit reports. A good number of them have already been reviewed by parliamentary committees. During the last Parliament the JCPA tabled 5 reports which reviewed or commented on reports of the Auditor&hyphen;General. These were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Report 332, on the operation of the Australian Government Credit Card system;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Report 333, on the sale of Aussat;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Report 338, on accrual reporting and accounting;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Report 340, on cash management; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Report 341, on the administration of specific purpose payments (or tied grants).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, 10 other audit reports were referred to and considered by other parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Report 344, which I have just tabled, the Committee comments on the most significant issues emerging from those audit reports which have not previously been considered by the JCPA or by other parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the majority of cases, agencies which were the subject of audit findings in the years under review have responded positively and promptly to the Auditor&hyphen;General's recommendations. There are, however, some cases where action has not been taken to correct management failures or where performance can be further improved. It is these cases which are referred to in Report 344.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report contains five recommendations for further action. The recommendations are directed to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in relation to any new program developed to replace the former National Priority (Reserve) Fund&mdash;which provided funding to educational institutions for management improvement projects;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Australian Taxation Office, in relation to work it has underway to identify the true cost of its review and litigation activities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to the Department of Health and Family Services, in relation to its program of validating nursing home funding; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to the Department of Defence in relation to two aspects of its procedures for managing defence procurement contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latter two are the most significant of these recommendations and I would like to outline briefly the reasons behind the Committee's recommendations. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning first to the nursing home validation program administered by the Department of Health and Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The validation of nursing home payments is an important part of the accountability framework for nursing homes. It provides an assurance that Commonwealth monies have been disbursed in accordance with the agreed funding arrangements for nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some years now the Department of Health has been endeavouring to clear a substantial backlog in its validation program. Advice received during the review was that 5 000 validations were outstanding in mid&hyphen;1994. The Department has repeatedly given assurances to Parliament that it has action in hand to complete all outstanding validations by the end of 1996&hyphen;97. The latest advice in this regard was given to the Committee in a submission dated 9 January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, advice from the Australian National Audit Office indicates that there is a substantial risk that the Department will not complete its validation program by the end of 1996&hyphen;97 and will not recover significant sums of money owing to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department claims a continuing commitment to completing all outstanding validations and the ANAO has acknowledged that there have been substantial improvements in the management and administration of the validation program. The Committee is encouraged by the priority being given to the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also acknowledges that it is appropriate for the Department to adopt a risk management approach in undertaking the validations. The cost of eliminating risk entirely would almost certainly be prohibitive, and prudent risks will of course need to be taken in order to clear the backlog in a cost&hyphen;effective manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, given the concerns raised by the ANAO, the Committee believes it is appropriate, at this point in time, for the Department to provide the Parliament with a complete, clear and unambiguous statement of the strategy it is employing to achieve its goal of clearing the backlog by the end of 1996&hyphen;97. The Committee has made a lengthy recommendation to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should make it clear that the Committee is not commenting on the policy behind the validation program, nor is it encouraging the Department to `get tough' with nursing homes. We are merely seeking to ensure that the Department is held to its promises and clearly explains the risk management strategies it is employing to achieve the targets it has set.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also like to highlight the Committee's comments on external scrutiny of major defence contracts. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2338"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the report the Committee argues that the quality of external scrutiny of major defence contracts would be enhanced if the Australian National Audit Office were allowed access to the costing and pricing records of defence contractors. This is a position which the Committee first argued in Report 337, in relation to the contractual arrangements for the new submarine project, and which the ANAO has supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence has in the past rejected these calls, asserting that such access would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> come at a cost premium for the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">risk disclosure of commercially sensitive contractor records; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> add to the time taken to complete defence projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is not persuaded that these objections are necessarily valid and, in any event, that they outweigh the potential benefits of allowing ANAO access. The Committee stands by the views expressed in Report 337 that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it is not unreasonable to require contractors involved in major projects to provide accurate and complete information in support of quotes and claims; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it is not unreasonable that the Auditor&hyphen;General be able to verify those claims through access to contractor records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week's revelations about the delays and apparently unusual payment patterns to contractors involved in the Jindalee Operational Radar Network project does not reassure me that the Commonwealth's interests are well protected by the current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In concluding, Mr President, I would like to advise the Senate that the JCPA has recently decided to change the focus of its audit report review procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past most audit reports were subject to a `desk review' where agencies were asked to provide written submissions to the Committee. These desk reviews resulted in compendium reports, like the report I have just tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the timeliness and effectiveness of its services would be enhanced if instead of conducting `desk reviews', it conducted public hearings every three months to examine the findings of significant audit reports tabled in the previous quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under these new procedures, witnesses from the Australian National Audit Office and from each audited agency will be called to give evidence on the nature and appropriateness of the audit findings and of the responses from audited agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as increasing the initial impact of audit reports and resulting in more timely and effective <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliamentary scrutiny of audit reports, these new processes will strengthen the Auditor&hyphen;General's hand in any follow&hyphen;up audits. The Auditor&hyphen;General will be able to test the future performance of agencies against commitments given to the Committee at these public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new procedures are confirmation of the JCPA's commitment to ensuring that the community receives full value from the work of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank all those people who contributed to the Committee's review of the 1993&hyphen;94 and 1994&hyphen;95 audit reports: people who prepared submissions; and people who gave evidence at public hearings.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the documents I have just tabled represent the responses from Executive agencies to three recent reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is a brief but positive response to a report which examined the early work of the Tax Law Improvement Project (TLIP) in rewriting the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report contained two recommendations&mdash;one directed to TLIP (about a preferred approach to delivering rewritten tax law to the Parliament) and the other to the Treasury (calling on Treasury to improve its consultative processes in relation to developing and considering tax policy issues). The recommendations were accepted by both agencies. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2339"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second Finance Minute contains responses to 12 of the 15 recommendations contained in<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Report 337, A Focus on Accountability: Review of Auditor&hyphen;General's Reports 1992&hyphen;93</EMPHASIS> . The remaining three recommendations were directed to the Australian National Audit Office, which has responded separately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report 337 contained a series of minor recommendations in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the work of the Health Insurance Commission in combatting Medicare fraud and overservicing;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the valuation of outstanding compensation claims by the Joint Coal Board; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> verification of payments to childcare providers for JET participants requiring childcare,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all of which were accepted by the relevant agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant recommendations in the report were the nine recommendations dealing with the management by the Department of Defence of the new submarine project. Some of these recommendations were agreed to while others were rejected. It is interesting to note that a number of the themes in the Committee's report (such as, the quantum and timing of advance payments to contractors; the recovery of advance payments which have not been used in accordance with the contract; the assessment and management of opportunity costs; and allowing ANAO access to contractor pricing records) also feature in the recent audit report on the management of the Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is keen to explore these issues further in relation to the JORN project and will be holding hearings on the matter over the next few months</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last of the Finance Minutes concerns the Committee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 340, Cash Matters: Cash Management in the Commonwealth</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Finance Minute, which was prepared mostly by the Departments of Finance and the Treasury, is quite critical of the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, Mr President , it is worth noting that there are a number of recommendations in the report which have been accepted&mdash;I cite two examples:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first, that all agencies will from now on create and maintain their own registers of all the bank accounts they operate (the Committee had found that are there were in excess of 2 000 bank accounts operated by Commonwealth agencies and that many agencies had inadequate records of the existence of these accounts, or of the amount of money held in them); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">secondly, that the Department of Finance, the Australian Taxation Office and the Reserve Bank <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will expedite the development of agency banking arrangements with Australia Post to allow tax receipts to be credited with the Reserve Bank on the day of deposit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasury has also reported that it has commissioned a consultancy to examine options for institutional and resourcing arrangements for the Commonwealth's debt management function, including aspects of Treasury's current cash management operation. This appears to be in response to a suggestion from the Committee that the scope for contracting out the cash management function be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Committee will be examining these Finance Minutes closely (particularly the response to the cash management report) and if necessary and appropriate will report to the Parliament on any issues which require further action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats believe it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to fully recover its contribution to the International Telecommunications Union from carriers, and to do so by increasing annual carrier licence fees by about $0.9 million in 1996&hyphen;97 as the government has proposed, with each carrier contributing in accordance with their share of timed traffic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would like to state, however, that the payment of carrier licence fees provides an excellent vehicle for raising funds for research into the health and safety concerns about electromagnetic radiation. Presently, there is a significantly less than optimal amount of such research being conducted. In June 1994, Dr Barnett from the Ultrasonics Laboratory of the CSIRO Division of Radiophysics wrote a comprehensive report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Status of the research on the biological effects and safety of electromagnetic radiation</EMPHASIS> in which he states that research on biological effects and development of safety standards always lagged many years behind technological development, due to limited availability of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that the telecommunications industry is under no obligation to conduct research into the health effects of its rapidly developing technology. Nor is the government spending any of the considerable funds it raises from the industry on such research. Concern over the possible effects of electromagnetic radiation is continually <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2345"> mounting. Let me give a couple of examples. The first is that in 1994, a CSIRO report found that the possible adverse effects on human health of exposure to radiofrequency and microwave electromagnetic fields and radiation are of public concern. Secondly, in Sydney last year a study by Dr Bruce Hocking found that within four kilometres of a television tower in a residential area rates of childhood leukaemia were 60 per cent higher than in another area away from the tower, and mortality rates from the illness were 100 per cent higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, in the USA, Motorola has developed a policy of not siting radio antennas on school property because of growing public opposition. Moreover, after it was suggested that a person's head can absorb as much as 60 per cent of the radiation emitted from a mobile phone, Motorola made the extraordinary announcement that users should not operate mobile phones close to their heads because it was not using power in an `efficient manner'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 3 June this year, a group of international scientists issued a warning on BBC television in the UK about the health dangers posed by mobile phones. Finally, in last November's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS>, it was reported that millions of people may face an increased risk of cancer and degenerative diseases because they are exposed to electromagnetic radiation from power lines and household electrical appliances. Ross Adey, Chair of the US Government's National Council on Radiation Protection, is reported as stating that there is now `a powerful body of impressive evidence' to suggest that very low exposures to EMFs has subtle, long&hyphen;term effects on human health. A report prepared by the council which highlights the findings of a number of pertinent studies on the health impacts of weak EMFs says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These findings appear to warrant a substantive national commitment to further research, and the serious attention of regulatory agencies and of the general public.</PARA>
<PARA>It is true that this evidence is not conclusive. It is speculative. We do not know for certain whether electromagnetic radiation causes cancer. The problem is that we have thrown ourselves forward into an epoch of rapid <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> technological change without adequately assessing the impact. The reasonable path is to traverse a policy gap between the scaremongering Luddites and those who believe in technological advancement at any price. Neither of those leads to genuine progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that we cannot and should not feel confident until sufficient research is being conducted. We need to ensure that an adequate level of research is conducted in Australia, thereby enhancing our contribution to the growing body of research being conducted in other countries. For that reason the Democrats would like to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add ", but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should set aside a proportion of the fees it collects to establish an Australian fund for research into the health effects of electromagnetic radiation".</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the difficulty we have with making this a responsibility of the carriers is that the carriers are not the only users of the radiofrequency spectrum. Any proposal, therefore, to make them solely responsible for carriage of the health issue would be inequitable. Electromagnetic energy health concerns of some members of the community relate to a range of radiocommunications installations, including radar, broadcasting, base stations, as well as telecommunications installations and devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate also that in line with our concerns to properly address this issue, the government has established a committee of officials on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2346"> electromagnetic energy public health issues to examine and advise on the adequacy of health exposure standards, compliance procedures and national and international research findings. The committee is also tasked with consulting and providing information to the public. The committee consists of representatives from the Department of Communications and the Arts, the Department of Health and Family Services, the Spectrum Management Agency, Austel, the Australian Radiation Laboratories, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also participating in the World Health Organisation's international electromagnetic field project which commenced this year. The project will establish a database on research literature, scientists and projects; publish interim reports on substantiated important findings as soon as possible; prepare detailed international scientific reviews and guidance documents, including on radiofrequency fields, risk communication and management and public and occupational health policy; and publish information brochures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government considers that the information gained through participating in this international project will add substantially to our present knowledge of the EME health effects issue, enabling decisions and actions to be based on substantiated scientific knowledge drawn from a worldwide base. The government is currently examining the scope for further research into the EME public health issue to be undertaken in Australia, including options for a research program and disseminating information to the public. However, as I have indicated, this examination is entirely separate from the proposed carrier licence fee increase to cover Australia's contribution to the ITU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply conclude by saying that we do not think it is appropriate in this instance, but I certainly agree with Senator Bourne that it is very important that we deal with the matter in a responsible fashion. There will always be people who get a bit hysterical about even the slightest prospect. As they always say to me, science cannot prove a negative. The overwhelming weight of evidence to date suggests <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that if there is any electromagnetic impact on human beings, it is at a very low level of intensity. In many respects, the radiation that you might receive from a tower will be much lower than that you would receive from standing near a toaster or other electrical instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to make sure that we get the balance right. We do not want to simply downplay those concerns because currently there is not sufficient scientific evidence to justify any intervention. I think it is an issue that must continue to be monitored and investigated as thoroughly as possible. The actions that we have taken will hopefully do precisely what Senator Bourne wants. Obviously, when these reports come forward, we will have a further discussion and we will be in a better position then to judge whether the parliament ought to take further action. On that basis, we will not be supporting the amendment, but we certainly share Senator Bourne's concern.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The opposition will be supporting this telecommunications bill. This bill was prepared by the previous Labor government. Its principal purpose was to allow for the regulations under the act to be amended so that the government may recover the telecommunications carriers' full share of the Commonwealth's contribution to the budget of the International Telecommunications Union. I think the effect of that in 1996 is about $5.8 million. The opposition believes that the essential features of this bill are non-controversial and should be carried without amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that Senator Schacht cannot be here today because he is attending the launch of the Optus local call service in Sydney. This is yet another initiative of the previous Labor government being fulfilled in the telecommunications industry. This is a significant step forward for competition in telecommunications in Australia. Australia has already seen many of the benefits of competition in telecommunications with strong competition in mobile telephony, international and STD calls, and a number of pricing plans offering flexibility to consumers, including a wide array of flexiplans.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2347">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's Australians will be offered an alternative carrier for their local calls. We are likely to see substantial reductions in local call prices. All of this is occurring because the former Labor government introduced competition into telecommunications with the passage of the current Telecommunications Act 1991. Competition is delivering and will continue to deliver the goods to Australian consumers without the necessity of selling off a valuable Australian asset. We maintain that it is competition rather than privatisation that delivers real benefits to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not support the amendment that has been moved by Senator Bourne. However, we do recognise the concerns that are being expressed in the community about these matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not oppose the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Bill 1996. This bill arises because the government made a decision to change the salary structure for ministers. The legislation to have that effect has been passed in both chambers and it resulted in a reduction in salary for non-cabinet ministers of $10,000 per annum. This bill arises because there is a consequential change to pensions and to superannuation from the knock-on effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given how superannuation operates for Commonwealth parliamentarians, the cutting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of salaries of non-cabinet ministers has, as I said, a knock-on effect to the superannuation scheme. This affects people who are existing beneficiaries of that superannuation scheme&mdash;that is, people who are retired and in receipt of pensions&mdash;and it also affects the entitlements of serving members and senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction would arise for current superannuants with non-cabinet ministerial experience, because the superannuants are paid with reference to their past service and to the current salary levels that are applicable to that service. Therefore, there would be a reduction in pension payments from the pre-2 May level. This reduction would continue until such time as, if ever, non-cabinet minister salaries increased to the pre-2 May level. Similarly, the value of superannuation entitlements of current members with non-cabinet ministerial experience would be reduced should they retire or die prior to the non-cabinet ministerial salary again returning to the 2 May level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the bill before the Senate proposes to insulate existing superannuants from the effects of salary reduction, basically, by maintaining current pension payments and by maintaining the value of the superannuation entitlements of existing members by ensuring that the formula remains as it previously was. That is a way of saying that there is a general principle here and that general principle, accepted by all governments, is that changes to superannuation should grandfather existing recipients. Adherence to that principle simply means that the rules should not be changed retrospectively to the detriment of superannuants. This legislation abides by that principle, and that is the reason the opposition will support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to the reduction in salaries of ministers not of cabinet rank, in effect there will be a minor saving. The reduction in costs as a consequence in 1996&hyphen;97 in relation to existing pensioners would have been approximately $80,000, but that saving will erode over time as the salary of non&hyphen;cabinet ministers increases. We support the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

The bill will have the effect of maintaining the level of expenditure on current pension payments under the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accrued benefits of some serving members who previously had non&hyphen;cabinet ministerial service would also have been reduced, and the bill will prevent these decreases by maintaining the benefit levels until the actual salary payable to non&hyphen;cabinet ministers overtakes the salary before it was reduced. Benefits will then increase in line with future salary increases. If the salaries on which benefits are based should decrease in the future, the bill will prevent any consequent reductions in pensions and serving members' accrued benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate on the Customs Amendment Bill 1996 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I would like to make a couple of comments in regard to the contributions by honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills have been introduced by the government to satisfy an election commitment made in the `Meeting our commitments' document. They are designed to pay for various government programs. It should be pointed out that in fact the previous Labor government intended to impose a five per cent tariff on all policy by&hyphen;law and tariff concession orders for the business sector. During the election campaign the now government in principle supported that approach but said that it would discuss the matter with business organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of those discussions, it became perfectly obvious that going down the Labor Party line posed particular problems in regard to consumption goods. It was the view during those discussions that, by not applying the three per cent that this government was applying&mdash;rather than the five per cent of the previous Labor government&mdash;this could well be unworkable because it would probably be impossible at the time of a tariff concession application or a policy by&hyphen;law application to determine whether the goods being imported were for business or consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose good examples of this would be things like radios&mdash;whether a radio was for domestic use or to go into a motel. What would be the eventual end use of even a simple thing like a mobile telephone? For that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2349"> reason, the government decided to apply the three per cent figure to all goods being imported. I will address that in a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to doing that, I will respond very briefly to the approach of the Democrats, which I found&mdash;and I am sure the opposition did&mdash;totally confusing. On one hand, they were saying that you should not have a three per cent tariff on capital goods being imported for business; on the other hand they were saying we should not reduce the tariffs&mdash;in other words, increase the tariffs on all the goods coming into Australia. I suppose that is fairly typical of the Democrat approach to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just by way of clarification, I notice that the opposition have said that they will support the first bill but move an amendment to the second bill; basically they are saying, `Send it back and do it all over again.' The opposition's approach is that they are strongly of the opinion that the tariff should not apply to consumption goods. The Democrats have made the position even more difficult for us by saying that they will go along with the government's proposal providing we apply it only to luxury goods. If we had definitional problems previously, this enhances those definitional problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the position taken by the opposition, and in view of the importance we place on this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1), I foreshadow&mdash;I believe there have been some discussions with the opposition on this&mdash;certain amendments which will be debated in the committee stage. The amendments offer a compromise position to the government's proposed three per cent tariff concession rate increase for all tariff concession goods, principally to quarantine consumer goods from the tariff rate increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes this will pick up the substantive theme of the opposition's second reading amendment circulated by Senator Cook on behalf of the opposition during the debate yesterday afternoon. The principal amendment in the schedule of three proposed by the government is amendment No. 2, which removes consumption goods from the three per cent tariff rate increase for tariff concession goods. This amendment will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> restore the tariff rate for those tariff concession goods. While it is conceded that the amendment does not implement the complete rate increase proposed by the government, the government believes it is an acceptable and workable compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quarantining of consumption goods from the rate increase has been able to be achieved without introducing a split in the tariff concession decision making process along the consumer versus business input lines. The government has always maintained, as indeed did the previous government, that a decision as to whether or not a tariff concession order should be issued should be dependent on whether or not the tariff concession order tests have been met and not whether the goods are consumer goods or business inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once a decision on the granting of the concession is made, however, then the duty to apply to goods imported under  the concession instrument can proceed, if necessary, on the determination of whether the goods are classified as consumption goods or not. That is the essence of the proposed amendment No. 2. Consumer goods referred to as consumption goods are removed from the three per cent tariff rate increase on the basis of an international tariff classification and harmonisation document prepared by the United Nations and applied to the Australian tariff by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in accordance with the international guidelines set out in the United Nations paper. The United Nations papers classify all internationally traded goods as consumption goods, intermediate goods or capital goods. It is these documents which are used to define consumption goods in the government's proposed amendment No. 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendments which are proposed by the government, Nos 1 and 3, deal with several minor matters which have arisen during the course of parliamentary debates on these bills. Depending on the outcome of the second reading debate, I would be happy to further detail the matters in respect of the other amendments at the committee stage of the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2350">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I just say in conclusion that, while it is not something we would prefer in view of our `Meeting our commitments' document prior to the last election, we believe we have found a way that does satisfy the opposition concerns in respect of consumption goods. It is a way that does not create the definitional problems which would have occurred if we had gone down the opposition's previous route, and that was for some determination to be made when the application was made for the tariff concession without knowing whether those particular goods&mdash;there are a lot of them, some 23,000&mdash;would actually be used for capital requirements or for consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under any circumstances we would not have supported the opposition's amendment, but under these circumstances we ask the opposition to rethink this matter. They have not had as much time as we would have liked to give them to consider this matter, but I believe this is a satisfactory outcome which addresses the opposition's concerns. It removes the consumption goods from the application of a tariff in a way which is fair. It is at arm's length. It means that determinations are made by an independent body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These determinations do not change at great speed every six months. There are minor adjustments made at the fringes. It seems that this is the only way to approach it in order to satisfy the consumption good problem and, at the same time, get away from the complications that would have arisen with determinations having to be made when applications were made for these tariff concession orders. It might be helpful if Senator Cook responded to the compromise position I have outlined.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the order of the Senate of 29 November 1994, relating to the consideration of legislation, not apply to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment to the Migration Act proposed in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is in response to steps taken by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It highlights the inconsistencies between the Migration Act and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. The Victorian Refugee Advice and Casework Service requested access to detainees <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2351"> from the boat <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Teal</EMPHASIS>  who were brought to Australia from China. When it was refused access to the detainees&mdash;the detainees had not requested assistance&mdash;the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission delivered sealed envelopes to the detainees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs refused to deliver the sealed envelopes and the matter was then litigated&mdash;it went to the Federal Court. The amendment proposed in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks to resolve this situation of inconsistency between the Migration Act and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. If the bill is passed, the commission will only be able to deliver such sealed envelopes once contact has been initiated by the relevant detainee. Passage of the bill is urgently required as steps are in train to take advantage of this inconsistency once again. The Victorian Refugee Advice and Casework Service have requested access to another group of detainees and, presumably, will continue this process with all new arrivals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To delay the amendment to the Migration Act contained in the bill would mean that access would be possible to detainees who are already at Port Hedland but have not entered the decision making process&mdash;who have not claimed asylum&mdash;and any other boat people who might arrive in the next few months. If the bill is not passed, that access would be possible without the contact being initiated by the detainee as, in effect, is required under section 256 of the Migration Act. That would, in effect, run the risk of undermining our entry procedures and would certainly result in a highly unsatisfactory situation continuing over the next few months in the context of a large number of boat arrivals currently taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is a specific measure to address a specific problem which was highlighted in the recent court case and by the actions of the Refugee Advice and Casework Service since that case. The bill does not seek to address broader issues&mdash;I stress that&mdash;that could possibly arise. It is a bill which contains a specific measure to address a specific problem that we now have.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the bill does not seek to address broader issues that could possibly arise, but where existing legislation has proved adequate to date&mdash;of course, we are not tackling that in this bill&mdash;the government is undertaking a review of its migration&hyphen;immigration decision making and any wider issues will be considered in that context. I think it is very important that the Senate be aware that the government is undertaking this review of migration decision making. This bill will not, of course, affect that. To the extent that it affects it at all, what it does is maintain the integrity of the Migration Act, particularly so far as the whole procedures relating to refugee processing are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, the government urges the Senate to permit this bill to go forward to conclusion this session. If the passage of the bill is delayed beyond the end of this session, that is, beyond the end of tomorrow, we will face then a hiatus situation of at least a couple of months. That could prove very serious indeed to the undermining of the integrity of Australia's entry requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate legal and constitutional committee has, I understand, considered the bill in the last couple of days. It has done it urgently and I thank the committee for its cooperation in that respect. I understand the committee's report is to be tabled shortly. I look forward to hearing the outcome of the committee's deliberations. On that basis, given that all procedures have been followed as fully as possible in the Senate processes up to date, I urge the opposition, the Australian Democrats and the Greens to support the removal of the cut&hyphen;off requirement. If we do not do that, as I say, potentially we will have a very big problem over the next few months and I think most Australians would regard that situation as unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to repeat again, particularly to those who have concerns about the bill, that the government is in no way wishing to abrogate the procedures that are laid down in Australia, and in most other countries, under the refugee convention in terms of the processing of refugee or asylum claims. They are completely protected in the Migration Act and this bill does not, in any way, contravene the requirements and the processes that are contained in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2352"> the Migration Act. That is an additional reason for the government to hope and expect the cooperation of the Senate in this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill is passed, to the shame of this parliament and to the shame of the two parties that will be supporting it, I forecast that we will have an appeal to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. Just as they told us that we are still in the Middle Ages in relation to certain laws in Tasmania, they will ask us again, `What are you doing? Are you a civilised nation?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At last night's committee hearing I put to the committee a number of statements by the United Nations Human Rights Committee which showed quite clearly that the human rights committee interprets article 9 of the ICCPR as obliging countries to provide information in various areas&mdash;and not in just <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the criminal area. It raised a number of areas where information needs to be provided, and it included immigration legislation very specifically. Information falling into that area needs to be and must be provided to individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are denying here a very important basic human right, and what for? The Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), says the heavens will fall in and we will have thousands of people clogging up our courts. Minister, could you tell us how many? I think it would be about 30 at most&mdash;probably less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told that 15 per cent of asylum seekers applying for refugee status would possibly go to court. So for that miserable little number we are prepared to throw to the winds a basic principle of justice that our courts should uphold, that this parliament should uphold. Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Minister? The Democrats will certainly oppose this move.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be supporting this motion, as has been indicated by Senator Carr. I listened to Senator Spindler, and I must confess that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) certainly does raise some very important issues. As I understand it, this bill seeks to make sure that people cannot tell others of their legal rights. That seems to me to be a matter of some moment. Can I perhaps read a passage from the decision of Blackpool Corporation v. Locker, which was decided in the Court of Appeal in 1947. Lord Justice Scott said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maxim that ignorance of the law does not excuse any subject represents the working hypothesis on which the rule of law rests in British democracy. That maxim applies in legal theory just as much to written as to unwritten law, i.e., to statute law as much as to common law or equity. But the very justification for that basic maxim is that the whole of our law, written or unwritten, is accessible to the public&mdash;in the sense, of course, that, at any rate, its legal advisers have access to it, at any moment, as of right.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that passage sums up the law as has been practised over the years. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, but then the law makers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2353"> should ensure that people know the law so that they can obey it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to the debate in here, it would seem that the thrust of this legislation is to interdict information going to people about their rights. That seems to be a very serious issue. We in this country pride ourselves on living under the rule of law, which overarches the parliament, the executive and the judiciary and indeed overarches in certain ways the constitution. In listening to Senator Short, who was very lucid in these matters, it does seem that we are going to take a very dramatic step and a step that will put people to a disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to have laws, certainly people should be able to take advantage of those. It seems to me that this is an issue of not whether a particular law should operate but whether people should be able to give people who they seem to think may need the law an opportunity to know it. There is no doubt that solicitors in Melbourne, my home town, in Victoria advertise. They go to the press about their services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) was before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee last night and evidence of a wide-ranging nature was put before the committee. The committee took evidence from not only the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs but also Mr Ross McDougall, from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service; Father Frank Brennan, from the Jesuit Social <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2354"> Justice Centre; Mr David Bitel, President of the Refugee Council of Australia; Mrs Marion Le, from the Independent Council for Refugee Advocacy Australia; the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Mr Sidoti; and the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Ms Philippa Smith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time available the committee was able to take wide-ranging views and evidence on this matter. Indeed, during the course of the hearing the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Mr Sidoti, and the Ombudsman, Ms Smith, made an offer to the government that they would pursue their duties as if the bill had been passed for a period leading up to 20 September this year. That offer was made, albeit genuinely, in an effort to have more time for consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably the government could not take this offer up because the offer could not be guaranteed. In the view of the government members of the committee, the human rights commissioner and the Ombudsman in their public office could not resist an application of writ of mandamus by a third party forcing them to carry out their duties. So those who might say, `The government was offered a way out here'&mdash;that is, that the Ombudsman and the human rights commissioner would not pursue their duties in relation to this matter as if the bill had been passed so that the government could be offered that sanctuary, so to speak, until 20 September&mdash;really miss the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not been given a guarantee. I believe that those two officers intended it to be genuine. Nonetheless, there was not the guarantee offered to the government. So the government had no choice but to pursue the passage of this bill on an urgent basis and for the reasons that Senator Short has outlined in detail; I will not go over them again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of evidence there were questions put as to whether this bill transgressed or cut across any existing litigation. There was no evidence that it did. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee report&mdash;this bill has also been before that committee, which is chaired by Senator Cooney&mdash;was put before <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the committee and that said that there was some limited aspect of retrospectivity and that there was some concern over the aspect of access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The departments that I mentioned were questioned on these two aspects and they did not see any great problem with either of those issues. Mr Henry Burmester, from the Attorney&hyphen;General's department, who is counsel of note, said that he did not think that this bill transgressed Australia's international obligations. Indeed, article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, referred to in Senator Spindler's dissenting report, states that anyone who is deprived of liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of the detention and order release if the detention be not lawful. Nothing in the bill deprives anyone of the right to take such action. As Senator Short outlined, there is nothing to stop an unauthorised person in detention from making an application for legal aid and bringing proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to the recent case brought by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the government has had to respond with this bill, which is rather narrow in its application. It will provide that no unsolicited legal advice is offered to detainees under the provisions of the ombudsman's legislation or the human rights and equal opportunity legislation. Those organisations have the ability, once a complaint has been made to them, to communicate with the complainant by means of a sealed envelope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was put to the committee by the departments that, firstly, this measure does not offend our international obligations; secondly, if this bill be not passed forthwith, there would be a hiatus in the administration of our immigration policy dealing with unauthorised entries and that betwixt now and the next sittings there could be all sorts of problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, there is a degree of urgency with this matter. I commend the staff of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for the urgent attention they have given this matter. In particular, I refer to Neil Bessell, the secretary to the committee, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2355"> Catherine Hawkins, who both did a great job with such short notice.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking to the motion to exempt the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 from the normal procedure of the cut&hyphen;off motion, which would see it adjourned to the first day of the next session because it has been only recently introduced into this place. The question before us is whether this is an urgent matter and whether it has received sufficient scrutiny, not only from this chamber and this parliament but also by the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The content of the legislation is only indirectly relevant to the issue, although some speakers have attempted to illustrate that the content could be considered relevant to its urgency. It seems to me that the three major reasons for the government and the ALP supporting the exemption of this bill from the cut&hyphen;off have not been given. I will now deal with those three reasons, though not necessarily in order of importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first reason is one that Senator Short referred to, and that is that it appears once again that the immigration department has acted in a way that the courts have found to be illegal and against the human rights of some people detained at Port Hedland. The department seems to have prevailed upon this government to enforce the inhumane and brutalising policies of the previous government and which were supported by the present government when the legislation was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the opposition are supporting a government department's attempt to block the hole it perceives in our courts. That hole is the Federal Court's determination that the immigration department has a duty to deliver a sealed letter from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to some detainees in Port Hedland informing them of their rights. In order to exempt the department from obeying the lawful order of the Federal Court, against which the department sought a 14&hyphen;day stay, the government is seeking to change the legislation. That is an utter disgrace. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter has been canvassed in this place. Senator Spindler spoke to it. Senator Cooney is in the invidious situation of having to support his party when he has a clear understanding of the difficulties with and complexities of the law in this area. Senator Ellison, because he has been very constructive in his role as chair of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, is also well aware of the legal complexities of this case. Both he and Senator Cooney have added in a valuable way to the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, one reason this matter is urgent is that the parliament wants to do something that is presently illegal. It has to do it fast because it wants to protect a government department which&mdash;I have to give this to the department&mdash;is seeking to comply with legislation previously enacted in this place in order to prevent people in this country having access to and information about their human and civil rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department is simply doing its job, carrying out the legislative burden placed upon it by this parliament. It is a chicken and egg situation. This parliament was forced into creating the earlier legislation, to use Senator Short's words, in order to preserve the integrity of our borders&mdash;as though we preserve integrity by denying people coming to our shores by whatever means their human and civil rights!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the first reason that has been put for supporting this motion. We have to suddenly make something that has been found illegal legal, so we had better act fast. Heaven knows how that affects the separation of powers. We can talk until we are blue in the face about that, because apparently this is likely to go ahead by dint of numbers rather than by content and arguments. I think there are three reasons why this exemption motion is being supported. The Labor Party is probably supporting this motion for two reasons. Firstly, the cloud which has been over their heads because of the previous legislation they passed means that they have some kind of obligation to support this new government, to push it even further and close up any loopholes that might have appeared in their previous policies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2356">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That might be one reason, but there is another reason for supporting the exemption motion. The previous government had no commitment whatsoever to the cut&hyphen;off motion. I believe they are seeking to undermine it by supporting as many exemptions as they can. In that way if by chance in the next election they gain government they will not have to bother with a Senate that demands appropriate scrutiny both in the community and in the parliament of legislation that is passed to it from the House of Representatives. I think that is a very disturbing reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I think the former minister for immigration, Senator Bolkus, could have some face saving intentions in supporting the exemption motion, in not voting against the bill and in trying to expedite the bill as quickly as possible. But I think there is another agenda. I have been very discouraged in this session, which is nearly at an end, to see that the Labor Party has not declared total support for the principle of introducing a bill one session and debating it the next in order to ensure that this practice does not continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third reason for supporting this motion comes from the government and it is on a more human level. They need this exemption motion brought on not only because of the matter to which I referred earlier but also because they are really stuck with their program. They have moved that we have another day of sitting tomorrow, they have some time left until 2 o'clock today to spend and they have no bills left. So they would quite like to see us debate at length this highly controversial bill. They know that there will be considerable debate from the Democrats and the Greens in this chamber. They know that it will be a lengthy procedure, and it will get them out of a very embarrassing situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are probably very pleased that I am taking this time to speak to the exemption motion, because that fills up some time about which they will not have to be embarrassed when the program collapses upon them. We have had a lot of rhetoric right through this session about how busy we are going to be and how we are going to have extra days of sitting. We have already given <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you an extra Friday, and we are giving you another one tomorrow. Apart from all this evening being filled up with valedictory speeches you have not got a program left. So that is another reason for rushing on the bill. I do not think that is a very good reason at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to share with senators in this chamber something with which those who have been here before will not be totally unfamiliar, and that is the history of this procedural motion. The reason for this procedural motion goes back to 1992-93. Prior to the first session of the 1993 parliament, a log jam of legislation would come into the Senate in the last week, particularly on the last day. I think I have some graphs showing the numbers of bills that came through which I might incorporate later in my speech. I can remember that on 17 December, 1992 the Senate sat on the Thursday right through to beyond 5 o'clock on the Friday morning. I went home quickly, packed my things and got on the plane. I think I spoke at 2.00 a.m. and 4.00 a.m. and we did not start valedictories until very late. We were debating bills that had been introduced into the chamber only that very day. It was shameful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation was being pushed through without senators having any grasp whatsoever of what they were voting on. A lot of that legislation in the previous session went by the board. It had to be amended for inaccuracies, some aspects had to be recommitted and some disappeared from the scene indefinitely. A member in the other house, Mr Wilson Tuckey, had observed that for many years. I think this is the first time I have put on the public record why this procedural motion came about. When he noticed that, after the election in 1993, the two Greens would share the balance of power with the Democrats, he rang me up and said, `Senator, have you got any interest in the decorum and the correct procedures within the Senate?' I replied, `I certainly have and I would love to reform it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said, `Well, have you noticed that there is a terrible log jam of legislation&mdash;a disgraceful log jam&mdash;that this government pushes through the House of Representatives, which, by dint of numbers, it can do nothing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2357"> about, and then it pushes it through the Senate by pressure of the last hours of the session?' I said,` Yes, and I would be happy to move a procedural motion to address that, but I have no anticipation of getting the numbers of support in the Senate chamber.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said, very helpfully, `Well, leave that to me, Senator. I will speak to my colleagues in the Senate and persuade them that, if they have any aspirations to be statesmen and to have the Senate take its due and rightful role in the scrutiny of legislation, they should perhaps consider supporting your motion.' That was how it came about. I think it was one of the first times the `unholy alliance' phrase was used. I know it was raised with great wrath in the House of Representatives, and may even have come to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that, a procedural motion was put in place on 18 August 1993, which was supported by the coalition, which allowed the principle of legislation which had been introduced in the House of Representatives very late in the session coming into the Senate, but being immediately adjourned to the first day of the next session. Of course, that was not greeted with great enthusiasm by the Prime Minister of the day. In fact, he called it a `constitutional impertinence' that we in the Senate should be telling the House of Representatives how they should conduct their business. As I pointed out to him, we were not doing that at all. We were simply making sure that we conducted our business with decorum, and whether they chose to or not was their responsibility. Nevertheless, if they were tardy in introducing legislation, they could not expect the Senate to suddenly push it through without doing its proper role as the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just in passing, it might interest people that he said that not only was it a constitutional impertinence but also it could precipitate a constitutional crisis like that of 1975, and it could even bring down the government. I assured Mr Keating that my little procedural motion could not cause a constitutional crisis or bring down the government. His reaction to it possibly could, but my procedural motion could not.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then had a very important series of debates in the Senate, with which people here are probably very familiar, where Gareth Evans was at pains to say that the measure was not needed, that it was a constitutional impertinence and that it would be the end of the world as we know it. In fact, maybe it was, for the Senate, because, reluctantly, the government came around to the view that it was sensible to take into consideration that it did not have the numbers in the Senate, and that it did have some responsibility to give due warning on legislation if it expected it to receive consideration and not be referred to a committee or be adjourned to the next session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That principle of a cut&hyphen;off motion then got translated into a procedural principle, which Gareth Evans enunciated, I think, on 25 August 1994&mdash;the principle that any legislation that was introduced in one session would be considered in the next session. That was a very beneficial thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there have been some notable exceptions to that all the way along the line, and that is where migration legislation comes in. My main reason for being concerned about the log jam of legislation in the last days was not the log jam per se, but the fact that the government had a very backdoor, underhand way of slipping through legislation which the parliament would not understand in its implications in relation to Federal Court matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 May 1992, it had already done it. Some detainees in Port Hedland had a case that supported that they had been detained illegally upheld by the court. In order to pre-empt them being able to go on with an appeal, the government wanted to overturn that and make it mandatory to detain everyone when they set foot in this land. We did that on 6 May, with the coalition supporting the then government, with very strong and vocal opposition from the Democrats. I particularly remember former Senator Coulter, Senator Brian Harradine and I opposing that, but of course we were not able to prevent it, and that legislation came through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same thing happened on 17 December 1992 in relation to compensation that might <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2358"> be an entitlement of people who were illegally detained for the tight period between when they arrived, when their boats got destroyed and when the law was passed on 6 May. The government wanted to prevent them. I  think we have had another one since then with the outrageous `dollar a day determination' that says that the compensation for illegal detention by the government is a dollar a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see is a very shameful history within migration legislation. It shows that there is something very wrong in this country's approach to asylum seekers and refugees who come to this country. Of course, we do not know, when a boat arrives on this shore, who are legitimate refugees and who are not. We have to assume that on those boats there are asylum seekers and refugees, and if we deprive them of their civil rights and their access to courts, we are, in my view, violating every commitment we have made to the international covenants on civil and political rights and the treatment of refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My belief is that we are persisting down a very wrongful track, and to exempt this legislation is to put yet another episode into this shameful saga. My understanding is&mdash;we will discuss this more when the motion comes to pass because, regrettably, dint of numbers will make it come to pass, unless we had a conscience vote, which would be a rather wonderful thing to see in this chamber&mdash;that the principles underlying this particular case are that a boat named <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Teal</EMPHASIS>, for the purposes of customs and immigration, had some detainees at Port Hedland who were allowed by the court to be handed a letter from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner which allowed them information as to legal advice that could be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, that we should be considering exempting a bill in order to prevent the department of immigration carrying out the order of the Federal Court is an unutterably dishonourable position. I will not speak further on this. I am sure I could have spent another 10 minutes elaborating but I will spare my listeners. I am also hoping that there will be people who have been sufficiently stirred by some of the matters I have raised <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to give consideration&mdash;even to rebut it; I do not mind&mdash;to what we are doing in this place. It is disgraceful. If it allows an opportunity for other speakers, it is appropriate that I conclude my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have to say in the strongest possible terms that the Greens could not ever support the exemption of a piece of legislation for the unworthy motives that are being presented today: not only to pre&hyphen;empt the court and interfere with what I believe is a very important concept of the separation of powers by intruding the parliamentary will, but also for the unworthy motives of filling up the program and of undermining the very important principle that we introduce legislation with enough time for the community to give feedback and for the parliament to understand what it is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community has given feedback&mdash;and it could not be more strong in opposing the exemption of this bill from the cut&hyphen;off. It is not as though we have to wait for the community to realise how wrong this is; it has been saying it. What we have to do is honour the community's voice and defer this motion to its rightful place, which is to the first day of the next session when the immigration department will have carried out its order. It can put up whatever shameful legislation it likes and we can give it consideration. But we should not be exempting this bill now, in order to pre&hyphen;empt a decision of the Federal Court.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate at the moment is debating whether the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is urgent enough for us to debate it today. I am sure the government wants to do it today because I have just received a speakers list for the bill. It is a little pre&hyphen;emptive as we have not yet had a vote on whether we will debate it. It is a very short speakers list which we have not yet been invited to add our names to. There is only one name on the list from the Australian Democrats but I can assure you that there will be more.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question as to whether this bill is urgent has a very obvious answer; and the obvious answer is that, no, this bill is not urgent. If this bill does go through in the next day and a half, what will happen? What is so urgent? What has to be stopped to make sure that this bill goes through in the next day and a half? Why is it so desperately urgent that we have to have a piece of legislation that takes away the human rights of people in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that the reason it is so desperately urgent is that it will cost money if this does not happen. It probably will cost a bit of money but it will not cost a lot of money. There are not people coming in on boats from outside every day. Of those who do come in on boats from outside only 15 per cent ever try to challenge what comes from the immigration department about their fate. That means that 85 per cent of those people do not challenge it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if we get more boat people coming in before August or September, when this would come up again, maybe a maximum of 15 per cent of them might challenge what is going on. How many people is that? It is only a very few people. You are taking away their rights; I am not going to take away their rights. Why is it urgent to take away their rights, right now? Why can't we take away their rights in August?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with the question of urgency, something we should also look at is the drafting of this bill. We should look at the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum. To save the Senate doing that, the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills has already done that. They have done a very good job at looking at that. Let me remind senators of what they said, because it is very important when we consider how urgent this bill is. Let me quote from page 14 of the Senate scrutiny of bills committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> No. 4 1996. The Senate scrutiny of bills committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implications of section 256</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The substantive amendments to the Migration Act 1958 which are made by this bill appear to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee to be predicated on an inaccurate view of section 256 of that Act. Section 256 provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a person is in immigration detention under this Act, the person responsible for his or her immigration detention shall,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at the request of the person in immigration detention, afford to him or her all reasonable facilities for making a statutory declaration for the purposes of this Act or for obtaining legal advice or taking legal proceedings in relation to his or her immigration detention.</PARA>
<PARA>That is section 256. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This section places a positive obligation on the person responsible for the immigration detention of a person to give access to obtaining legal advice if the detained person requests it. It does not say that this section is an exhaustive code of all the ways in which such a detainee may have access to legal advice. Yet paragraph 2 on page 2 of the explanatory memorandum&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in relation to section 256&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">asserts that section 256 establishes that a person in immigration detention has a right to access legal advice only when they request it. Equally the second reading speech speaks of an onus on unlawful non&hyphen;citizens to advise officials if they wish to seek legal advice and speaks of section 256 as making provision for access to legal advice but only where the detainees request legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 256 for the detainee is an enabling section ensuring a right to access legal advice if the detainee requests it. Section 256 for the custodian imposes a positive obligation to provide that access if it is requested.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that&mdash;if it is requested. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Section 256 is not restrictive in the sense that it denies all access to legal advice except through section 256. It is an unwarranted conclusion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>say the members of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that because the Migration Act 1958 is otherwise silent on the matter of legal access to this class of person, that no other right to access legal advice exists and that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Act 1958</EMPHASIS>  exhibits an intention to exclude all other access.</PARA>
<PARA>Very good words. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament's intention in passing an Act is to be found in the interpretation which a court puts on the meaning of the words. It is true that in cases of ambiguity a court may use other documentary material. But, absent an ambiguity, no one can say the intention of an Act is other than what a court finds to be the express or implied meaning of the words. In this instance, the Federal Court in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2360"> Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Another v Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs</EMPHASIS>  (unreported, 7 June 1996, Lindgren J. NG 268 of 1996) has put the matter beyond doubt.</PARA>
<PARA>Okay, the matter is beyond doubt. How are these people going to know they have that right, that they can ask for legal advice, if they are not told that? And they are not told that. They have to ask for it. That is what we are contemplating whether we consider to be urgent. Let me go on referring to what the Scrutiny of Bills Committee said, so that no&hyphen;one has any ambiguity about what you are doing if you make sure this goes through as urgent. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second reading speech can also be seen mistakenly to assume that there is some hierarchy in Acts of Parliament. It mentions that certain provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ombudsman Act 1976</EMPHASIS>  and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986</EMPHASIS>  could be used:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to undermine the intention of section 256 of the Migration Act.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a human rights act that is undermining the intention of the Migration Act. Isn't that appalling? Right, well, let's take away their human rights! The immigration department has to be much more important than human rights, as we all know, as we have seen in this chamber before. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we have seen above, the section does not exhibit an intention to exclude the operation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ombudsman Act 1976</EMPHASIS>  and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986</EMPHASIS> . So the argument that the effect of those Acts should be legislated away cannot be based on an assumption that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration</EMPHASIS>  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Act 1958</EMPHASIS>  is somehow more important than the other Acts and therefore should not be undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of the Federal Court case that has prompted this legislation is clear proof that the intention of Parliament, as found by the only institution that can authoritatively say what that intention is, in passing the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ombudsman Act 1976</EMPHASIS>  and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986</EMPHASIS>  was to provide a method of access to legal advice alternative to that provided in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Act 1958</EMPHASIS> . Any impression that somehow Parliament made a mistake that now has to be fixed is quite false.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot agree with that more. If that is the case, where is the urgency in this bill? There is another section of the report by the Scru <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tiny of Bills Committee which I will quote to senators so that they will know what they are doing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The right to knowledge</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As we have seen from this very good <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS>  from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and as we can see if we just read the bill, there is no urgency. Senator Harradine is being denied that right because we have a collusion, not between all members of the government and all members of the opposition; we have a collusion between some members of the government and some members of the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that there is a former immigration ministers club. They have probably got a tie and they probably wear it proudly. They ensure that what happens with the Migration Act is that, if any money may have to be spent, they do not like money being spent. If anybody's basic human rights are being trampled on, they seem to like that. I hope to goodness I am wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been thinking of designs for the former immigration ministers club tie. I am thinking of having a few made up and sent around to them so they can wear them with pride. But if they see what design is on them, maybe they will not want to wear them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Don't tempt me again, Senator Chamarette. I am not going to tell you what I thought of. This week is refugee week. What fabulous timing for the urgency of this bill! There was a forum in Parliament House all day yesterday that discussed the rights and the lack of rights of refugees. They do not have an awful lot of rights in this country, and this is taking away one of the basic ones urgently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand how anybody could vote for this. Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps people will not vote for this. Perhaps the government and the opposition will not use torture on their members who believe in human rights by forcing them to vote on this. But I am sure that is what they are going to do. I may be wrong. I hope to goodness I am wrong. I look forward to being wrong if that happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week is refugee week. When Human Rights Commissioner Chris Sidoti went down to Hobart to launch refugee week, he had just found out about this bill being introduced. Let me remind senators of when this bill was introduced. It was introduced last Thursday about 10 minutes before we rose. There was no opportunity for any other debate because we were not sitting on Friday. The government and the opposition have been trying ever since to make sure it is voted on and it is passed with as much alacrity as possible and with as little debate as possible, as is usual with these sorts of amendments to the immigration act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are in refugee week. The refugee week summit has had enormous amounts of discussion in one of the Senate committee rooms. Yesterday the rights of refugees were discussed and found to be wanting. That was even without this. Will they be found to be wanting after this goes through, if it goes through? I still live in hope that the urgency will be denied for this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2362">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who come to our shores will not know if they are entitled to these basic human rights. Why do you think these people are getting in a boat? These people are coming from countries where their human rights are not looked after. Of course some of them are economic refugees and some of them are genuine humanitarian refugees. This is only going to affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess they are supposed to dream the night before they come to our shores that God says to them, `When you get to those shores, you have a right to ask for legal representation.' If God, Budda or whoever doesn't come to them in that dream and tell them that, then they do not know that. They have to ask for it. They come from countries where this is not ordinarily the case. If you or I were getting in a boat and going to another country, we would know this because we come from a country where it ordinarily is the case that we do have a right to access the law. These people are coming from countries where that is not the case. Therefore, this is a totally illusory right on their part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to say that these people have an absolute right to do this. Yes, they do have an absolute right to do this. But if they do not know they have the absolute right to do this, how on earth are they supposed to ask for it? They probably do not even speak English. It is just outrageous that this chamber is even considering that this bill will be urgent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you what will happen if this bill does not end up being urgent. I have spoken to the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Chris Sidoti, about this and he believes that there is an opportunity before August, when we get back, for himself and for the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Miss Philippa Smith&mdash;I have not spoken to her, but I am sure she would agree with this&mdash;to sit down with officers of the immigration department and discuss the problems that have been identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Perhaps there are problems here that I do not see&mdash;if there are, they are not being fixed by this bill. So Mr Chris Sidoti is willing to sit down with officers of the immigration department to talk about whether there are problems with the immigration act and wheth er there are problems with people being given knowledge of their human rights in this country, their basic and what should be inalienable human rights in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is willing to sit down with immigration department officials, Attorney-General department officials and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials&mdash;there is another interesting point; I will go on to that in a minute&mdash;to discuss at length how that can be fixed. He is sure that there is a solution that can be agreed to by all sides. He is sure that can happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If somebody can tell me why making sure that 15 per cent of those people who may or may not arrive on these shores before the 20 August do not have the right to ask for legal access because they do not know about it is more urgent than the Human Rights Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman sitting down with officials of the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Immigration and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and discussing ways that we can solve this problem without going to these lengths, without taking away these human rights, then I will be pleased to hear it. But I have not heard it yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a section which is involved in international law and which looks at our international covenants. I know about these matters because I am a member of the foreign affairs subcommittee and the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which, I am very pleased to say, has been reconstituted. That section of the department does some very good work. If this bill becomes an urgent bill, I will have several pages of questions I will be wishing to ask as part of what will be a very extensive debate in the committee stage. I will certainly ask whether the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was consulted about what will happen should this bill be passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2363"> Between when the court case came to its conclusion and the introduction of this bill there has been an extraordinarily short amount of time. It is obviously not a very well written bill, according to the scrutiny of bills commit tee&mdash;and it is absolutely right. But I wonder whether officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in particular officers of the international organisations' branch of that department, were consulted about this. If they were consulted, I wonder what they came up with and what sort of advice they gave. I do not believe they would have advised that this does not transgress international treaties to which Australia is a party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might note that we now have a Joint Standing Committee on Treaties of which I am also a member. I am sure there will be many opportunities for that committee to discuss our immigration laws. Most certainly I will be bringing this up for discussion should this matter go through. Most certainly I will be looking at whether the implications of this law transgress any of the human rights treaties or other international obligations to which Australia is a party. This is something we should all consider very closely before we decide whether this bill should be regarded as urgent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, let me say that I do not believe this bill is urgent. I do not believe that taking away the basic human rights of people who land on our shores, whether they be Australians or not, is urgent. I do not believe that this bill, because it has been prepared so quickly, is particularly well written. I am not blaming anyone who has drafted the bill, but I believe it has been done with such haste because there is a desire to plug a leak. I am sure that is the case here. The Human Rights Commissioner has been exercising his right to look after the rights of others&mdash;which I hope he will always do&mdash;and that is the leak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that when we look at the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills; when we look at the way the Human Rights Commissioner has actually been prepared to sit down with the people concerned to discuss whether there is a problem; when we look at how many people will be affected by this between now and 20 August; when we look at how much money this will cost&mdash;which is always of paramount importance to some senators in this chamber; when we consider whether Senator Harradine should be entitled to speak on this matter&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we all know it is something of great importance to him; when we look at how much money this will cost between now and 20 August, then I am sure, when all those things happen, we will consider it and vote against it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this important issue. It is not a matter that should go through without full debate. We have been asked to exempt the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) from the cut off motion. Basically, the reasons given simply do not hold water. It has been suggested there is a degree of urgency regarding the government's program. From today's debate we realise that there is no urgency. This is designed to pre&hyphen;empt a decision which is being dealt with by the courts and to try to save a little bit of money. It seems to be operating on the principle that human rights and values should go out the window. Basically, we are being asked to pre&hyphen;empt any proper consideration of those human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of having a cut off motion is so that the community has time to consider what we have been asked to deliberate on. The media have a right to look through the issues too; they are the main means by which people find out about these issues. We should have the ability to consider these issues properly. This is hardly a cut and dried matter. There has been little indication of urgency, but it seems the government wants it now; it wants it out of the way. We could perhaps surmise there may be some embarrassment for the coalition since they want it out of the way, since they want nobody else to look at what they are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is certainly not the way we want to operate; it is certainly not the way we want Australia to be seen in international fora. However, this seems to be the pattern of this government. The pattern seems to be that you go for the powerless. Perhaps it might make the bean counters happy. Bean counters would probably say that human rights should be secondary to fiscal considerations. I am sure that the authors of the Commission of Audit report would be very pleased as it would seem the government is doing exactly what it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2364"> has been asked to do&mdash;that is, put any other consideration in a secondary position to the bottom line; get rid of embarrassments such as human rights, reasonable fair play and Australia's reputation in international fora.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that this seems to be the pattern of the government&mdash;to pick off the powerless, to take away their voice. We only have to see a few examples of where this fits into the pattern. The pattern is to take away the ability of the people to speak with an organised voice, that is, try to pick off unions, the organisations by which people who are working can get a voice and some kind of justice within the system of the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What people have been picked off in terms of the silent cuts&mdash;the cuts that have not been announced? The kind of people who have had their voice taken away are migrants, people who do not have the ability to fight back and whose position in Australian society might be considered to be tenuous on some issues. Let us look at the issue of refugees, which is what we are talking about now. How much voice do those people have in the political system? The voice is often only the voice that those people in this political system are prepared to give them. It is an easy target, and a cowardly target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us pick off the young; let us find their training programs and let us pick them off because we know that they do not have the ability to fight back. We know that we can take away training programs and we know that we can change the funding for their programs. We know that we can make them less powerful or less able to negotiate for their employment contracts. We know that we can threaten to dob them in if they do not take a rotten agreement that is offered to them. Let us pick on them as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us pick on the unemployed. When was the last time you saw 10,000 unemployed people marching in the streets of Australia? Exactly. That is a very easy target, so let us pick on them as well. Let us pick on the people who have had less voice but are trying to get a voice in this system. Let us pick on women's groups. Let us find networks of women and let us take away their funding or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> let us look at community groups who are hoping to do preventative community care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the groups who are actually trying to help themselves. Let us look at the regions. Let us look at those things that are happening in our society and the people who traditionally have not had a voice who are trying to help themselves so that we do not get into a situation of crisis care. Let us look at Aboriginal groups. Let us pick them off as well because it has been difficult for them to fight back. Let us face it: they have not been a popular issue. Let us pick on them as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go along in this pattern for as long as we can because that way we can be seen to be fixing the bottom line while at the same time we can get rid of the voice of all these troublesome minorities. Let us keep doing that and then we will make those people who wrote the Commission of Audit really, really happy. We will be putting the dollar before every other value in this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Senator Harradine, if he was here, would be making his voice felt very strongly on this issue. Not only would he be making his voice strong in relation to what the government is doing; he would be making his voice very strong in relation to the support which the opposition is giving on this issue. There are people we know who know that this is the wrong thing. We have seen, from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, that there are sufficient important substantive doubts about the legality of this. We certainly know there are substantive doubts about the ethics, and substantive doubts about the legality in terms of Australia's international obligations. And yet there is an urgency for us to ignore those obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should all be ashamed. I think that there are enough issues here that I should also, amongst other people, go on the speakers list for the second reading debate should this go through&mdash;should this shameful event occur today and should both major parties decide that this urgent removal of human rights is something this Senate should be putting their name to. I hope I do not see it. I can guarantee that, if it does happen, we will be debating this for a substantial amount of time in this chamber.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to the motion which seeks to exempt consideration of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which is considered urgent, from the order of the Senate of 29 November 1994. This concerns me very deeply. This legislation is not needed urgently because it is part of a debate that has been going on for 3,000 years. It is not a debate about legislation that has resulted in the last couple of days. It actually attacks a fundamental principle of the Judaeo-Christian ethic and that is why I am concerned about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a fundamental principle which is enshrined in a phrase which is constantly repeated throughout the whole of the Hebrew scriptures: `You shall care for the fatherless, the widow and the stranger.' The reminder to the Hebrew people is, `You were once strangers in Egypt; therefore you will care for the stranger in your midst.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Stranger' needs to be translated. What it really means is that, because the Israelites were refugees and immigrants in the land of Egypt and were mistreated there, when refugees and immigrants come into their own land they should remember the treatment they received and they should do differently. What they should do is care very much for the people within their midst&mdash;look after them, offer them succour and hospitality and go out of their way to treat them, if you like, even better than they would treat their own. That fundamental principle of the Judaeo-Christian ethic is surely one that ought to shape our attitude to the stranger, the immigrant, the refugee in our own land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am appalled that there should be any suggestion that we would enshrine in legislation a principle that absolutely contradicts a fundamental principle of that Judaeo-Christian ethic. If you look at the scriptures you will almost certainly come across this phrase. It is repeated in the historical books. It is repeated in the psalms and it is repeated in the wisdom literature of the Hebrew scriptures. Then it is carried forward into the New Testament. The same phrase, the same obligations, are laid upon the early Christians, the early disciples, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they should care for and not be partial and not discriminate against those who were strangers in their midst, those who were at the bottom of the heap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, the Democrats are opposed to seeing this legislation in any sense treated as urgent. We believe that if we are to pass legislation like this it needs very extensive consideration. The implications need to be understood. All the ramifications need to be understood. We need to know what we are doing to people. We need to know what we are doing to our reputation in the international community and we need to know what we are doing to the fundamental ethical principles upon which this nation was founded. If we tear up those principles we are not simply doing something in legislation which corrects an administrative problem; we are attacking the fundamental roots and principles upon which the nation was founded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I come to this debate&mdash;and I had to rush down to the chamber to be part of it&mdash;I am amazed that we even have to debate this point in this place. Contrary to what I really believed when I came into this place, I have seen that most senators do give very deep attention to these kinds of principles. They do care about what is happening in the community. I suspect that many senators in this place have really not understood what is going on. They have not understood the bureaucratic pressure which is forcing us into making a hasty decision. I am sure in the days and years ahead we will come to regret this decision when we come to understand what we will do if we force this legislation upon the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I speak strongly against the motion for this legislation to be urgently passed or debated. I trust that the Senate is going to pause and not force this legislation to be brought into this place. We know what will happen. If I thought we were going to bring it in here and debate it properly, then I  would not have so many concerns. We have been told&mdash;and I am sure it is correct&mdash;that the way the numbers are in the Senate it will not be debated properly. We want to spend a number of days on it because of its importance. It will not be debated properly and will be forced through. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2366"> The guillotine will be applied and it will be voted on and passed. That is an appalling prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My appeal to the Senate is that we not allow the legislation to be brought into this place now and that we give the legislation the consideration that is needed. We should come back in the budget session and allow the legislation to come into this place then. The guillotine would not be applied, we would have time to consider it and I would be able to put to the good senators all the things that we need to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the appeal I am making. I am not trying to beat you about the head&mdash;I will do that later when we get to a more extensive debate. I am simply making the appeal. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to the committee that the substitute amendments moved by the government are in the form of requests for amendments.

As <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been pointed out in earlier statements, this interpretation has not been accepted by the Senate. The question of the application of the relevant provision of section 53 is still under consideration by a Senate committee.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Notwithstanding the information Madam Temporary Chairman has just provided the committee, can I say that the opposition welcomes these amendments from the government. It is probably worth taking a minute of the chamber's time to remind it what is in fact happening here. `Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996' is a glorious and arcane title. Everyone, upon hearing a reading of that title, instantly knows what it deals with. What it deals with and what everyone knows it deals with is the provisional tax uplift factor&mdash;that is to say, the tax that is paid in advance by small business or those who receive income from investment in anticipation of what their earnings will be in the next tax year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a matter of high controversy in this chamber for some time. Indeed, it was a matter on which the election was fought in part. People will remember that in the election campaign the government, as the then opposition, featured the role of small business as an important driver in the Australian economy and made promises about what they would do for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the promises they made, and they made it at a clarion level, was that the provisional tax uplift factor, which had been set at eight per cent, would be reduced to six per cent. The bill that we considered before and returned to the House as unsatisfactory contained a provision that for the tax year 1996-97 the uplift factor would be six per cent but for all the other out&hyphen;years it would be 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition, the Australian Democrats and the Greens did was vote down the 10 per cent part for the out&hyphen;years while keeping the six per cent part for the next year. They did it for the very sound reason that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2368"> government had stood for election on a platform of making the uplift factor six per cent. They never said anything at all during the election campaign about 10 per cent for the out&hyphen;years. If one reads the fine print of their electoral documents, one can see the pledge was that the uplift factor in the 1996-97 year would be six per cent and the documents were silent thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was a complete surprise to all of us to see the government, so soon after its election, putting through a bill in which there was six per cent for one year and 10 per for the rest. Indeed, in the committee inquiry the Senate conducted into this matter, evidence adduced from industry organisations made it clear that they welcomed the change to six per cent but were astonished and dismayed about and in opposition to an elevation of the provisional tax uplift factor to 10 per cent thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened in this chamber is that the opposition, the Greens and the Democrats have voted out the 10 per cent, the bill has gone back to the House and the government has insisted on its changes but now in this chamber proposes to make an amendment. That amendment, which is a complex one, introduces for the out&hyphen;years a formula whereby GDP income growth for the out&hyphen;years will be the calculation upon which the provisional uplift factor will be based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speaking for the opposition, that seems to be a huge step away and a huge backward step from what the government's position was. We welcome their backdown. That clearly is what it is. It is a backdown to a more sensible formula which relates to income growth in GDP for any year. It is on the basis of relating the uplift factor taxing level to what the anticipated level of income might be for a company rather than setting it at a nominal 10 per cent level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in the first instance, we welcome this amendment and acknowledge the background against which this amendment is made. Once again it shows that the Senate has an important role in keeping the government honest, holding them to their election commitments and, in the event, staring them down and making them come back with a formula which expresses, at least in my view, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intent of that election commitment. So we support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this amendment will be welcomed by all in small business. This government&mdash;a government which small business trusted to deliver on their behalf&mdash;had put through within three months of its election a bill which did not do what small business anticipated it would do but it has now been required to do that. Small business will welcome this. Self&hyphen;funded retirees and those who get income from investments will welcome it too, and we will support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we are in the committee stage, I have a couple of questions for the minister. Minister, in order to clarify the record, I ask you to explain the operation of the formula. What is the government's estimate for the 1997-98 year, and on what data is that based?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effect of the amendment is to, as Senator Cook says, set a formula. In future years of income the provisional tax uplift factor will be a percentage determined by reference to the nominal increase in GDP&mdash;a figure published by the Commonwealth statistician&mdash;for the 12 months ending 31 December immediately before the relevant year of income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will still be open to the parliament to legislate a separate rate in respect of a particular year, but the default rate each year will be based on the nominal GDP in the preceding full calendar year. For example, if it was June 1997&mdash;that is, we were 12 months down the track&mdash;and we were looking at 1997-98, the default rate for that year would be whatever the figure is for the nominal GDP in the full calendar year 1996. It means you are in fact lagging one quarter behind the latest available GDP, depending on when the uplift factor was set. If it were set at, say, this time of the year for the following year, you would not have taken account of the March quarter GDP figure. The government believed it was more appropriate to have a full calendar year figure, which is a more commonly understood concept.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) are very pleased that the government has taken cognis <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2369"> ance of our argument that the provisional uplift factor should not be a fixed percentage but should be a percentage derived from economic indicators of growth in the economy. This argument has been put on a number of occasions in this chamber. If you check back in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  you will see that that is what we have been saying each time this matter has come up. As a result, we may actually avoid the annual battle as government seeks to alter a fixed rate to something more reasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of the income based GDP figures will probably give a fairly reasonable indication of what companies may expect in growth. There is of course the ability to alter the uplift, since provisional tax returns need not be filed for nine months, by which time businesses will have a pretty good idea of whether they will be making the amount expected under the tax uplift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that there is now a formula. It may over time be something that can be finetuned, but at least there will not be this fundamental battle on the way the figure is chosen. It gives a pretty good indication of the value of the Senate process in getting people together to try to get an outcome. I am pleased to see that there have been efforts in trying to move to that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel fairly certain that in the meantime, whilst this bill has gone back to the House of Representatives, the representatives of small business in Australia have been speaking to members, and especially ministers from the government, to let them know that they believe what is proposed here is a good idea and is a much better outcome than what was proposed earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also feel certain that there will be a number of honourable senators on the government side who will be pleased that the majority in the Senate chose to come together in this way and were fairly firm in relation to this, that we were not going to be quietly pushed on this issue. It is an issue that has come up again and again. It is time to make a commonsense decision rather than have the same argument each year in a situation which is less than satisfactory for all concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to the suggestion that the Australian Democrats' amendment is superfluous, and that the parliament has the capacity to review each year. It is important that this argument be conducted properly because for several years parliament has attempted to convince the government of the time that there was good reason to change the tax uplift factor. There have been many opportunities for parliament to take that and put it to the government but of course we have had great difficulty doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It sounds as if I am filibustering, and that is exactly what I am doing because I need the minister's attention to make this point properly. I assume that the opposition's shadow minister is at least with me on this, directing my remarks through you, Madam Chair. I also make the comment that the ALP was also difficult to move. When parliament expressed an opinion&mdash;at least in this chamber we were expressing the opinion&mdash;that the taxation uplift factor was out of kilter with the prevailing economic circumstances, with the rate of inflation and the other GDP measurements, we were unable, as a Senate, to impress the government at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will return to the theme and express it so that the minister can at least address himself to this argument now. Senator Short's comment that this would be superfluous illustrates the fact that for several years this chamber has attempted to bring this matter to the attention of the government of the day. This is not superfluous. This is a requirement that parliament at least be considered and that the government needs to defer to parliament in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope Senator Short recalls the attempts to bring the provisional tax uplift factor into a closer relationship with the prevailing economic circumstances. That failed for several years. Each time it was considered, the comments were made that it was the wrong moment to bring it up because the rates had been determined for the year, and that this is the wrong bill within which to conduct this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for the Australian Democrats' amendment is to ensure that parliament is taken into regard if there is something wrong with this calculation, and it does not have the desired effect and needs a little more than fine tuning. We support entirely the recognition that the taxation factor needs to be in concert with prevailing economic circumstances. To put in the front at (3), that `unless parliament otherwise provides,' at least we are paying regard to the fact that parliament should have the capacity to review it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunity should be taken because we have had the experience over a number of years of trying to do something about it here, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2371"> but it has been dismissed as being irrelevant. I do not think it will harm it. If, in your opinion, it is superfluous then surely it will not detract from the intention of your amendment, which we support as being a darned sight better than defaulting to a rate which is so far out of kilter from the reality of the economic situation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.05 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the formula is described in such words as `to remove the possibility of its being out of kilter with economic reality'. We have to acknowledge the government's wisdom in so rewording this. This default provision will overcome the fear of and the objection to the previous default figure having the capacity to be out of kilter with the economic reality of the time. What does concern me in this debate is that the opposition parties seem to have lost sight of the important issue. Each year the government sets the current year rate&mdash;in other words, the uplift factor is set annually&mdash;and this government is delivering, and has delivered now, on its election commitment to set the current rate at six per cent. We seem to have conveniently overlooked the fact that prior to today's amendment the default factor has not changed for many years. Suddenly we see a different approach by members opposite, now that they are in opposition, to this default factor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have studied and have been involved in numerous hearings on uplift factors over the years. No doubt this new mechanism is an improvement. It will create certainty from parliamentary manipulations. The minister indicated in his second reading speech that he will give expression to this formula in terms of a percentage, which will be useful in comparing the default figure with the figure that will continue to be set on an annual basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think, all round, the government is indeed to be congratulated on not adopting the tactics of the previous government, a government which indicated its refusal to listen to the Senate and thereby had the potential to place small business and self&hyphen;funded retirees at the higher penal rate of 10 per cent. It is important that the readers of this debate acknowledge that this coalition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approach is from a caring, listening government that is not prepared to adopt the bully&hyphen;boy tactics of the previous Labor Party government, when it was in power, of threatening to listen to the Senate, to take the uplift factor back to the House of Representatives and then threaten, `The opposition's failure to deliver will result in the penal rate applying to even the current year.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we articulate this difference in approach between this government and the Keating government. Because of that, last year the opposition was not prepared to put at risk all those hundreds of thousands of taxpayers who were subject to provisional tax applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate Senator Short and his advisers on coming up with this new formula. It will remove the need for the sort of lengthy debates that have occurred in this place in the past and it will put the uplift factor on a much more certain and rational plane. Over the years I have been a member of a number of committees examining this. In those days we were absolutely appalled, for example, that the Treasury was not able to come up with a formula, such as that which Senator Short put down in his amendment today, to give us some idea of how the rates were fixed. This lack of basic information from the previous government was something that caused a great deal of ire and concern, particularly in the small business community. I think the Liberal Party and National Party coalition is to be applauded for the very constructive way it has tackled this issue, not only for today but for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the Democrats I do not think I can say much more than I said before. I do think that it is unnecessary to have the words in because parliament always has the right to decide these things. Although there was no change&mdash;and Senator Bell, I think, talked about the fact that there was no change in recent years&mdash;it was not because the parliament did not have a chance; it was because the parliament, in its collective wisdom, decided not to make a change. But the principle was there that the parliament was able to decide, had it so chosen to vary it, and it will continue to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very important plus of what we are proposing here&mdash;and I would not want to undermine the importance of what we are proposing here&mdash;namely, the formula approach, is the good approach. It is reliable, it is understandable, and people know the situation. It gives an element of certainty to the scene which is necessary. For that reason&mdash;although, as I say, parliament does always have the right to change that&mdash;I would not want to give the impression that it was something that we were going to be mucking around with from one year to the other unless there were really very important circumstances. If there are very important circumstances  requiring us to look at changing the formula approach, then the parliament can do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make a point of clarification, just in case there was anything misunderstood in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what I said before in terms of the formula in response to Senator Cook when I said that it was one year over the GDP of the preceding year. It is, but just to make it quite clear as to how it works, you add up the four quarterly GDP numbers for this year and the preceding year. If we were doing it now, it would be the four quarters of each of 1995 and 1994 calendar years. You then multiply that by 100. That, I am told, would give you a factor. If you were using the statistics of those two years, the figure would be 5.7 per cent, as at the moment. It would be rounded to the nearest percentage. So 5.7 per cent would go to six per cent. If the formula had come out at, say, 5.4 or 5.5 per cent, it would have been rounded down to five per cent. I just want to make it clear that that is the way it works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I thank the government, the Democrats and the Greens for their generous support for this proposal. Let me say, though, at the outset that this is certainly no backdown on our part. The fact is that our election commitment was delivered in spades with the bill as originally presented when it came into the parliament, because our commitment was that we would reduce the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. That is what the bill did. We never did give any permanent commitment that it would be six per cent, because circumstances can change a great deal from one year to the next and it would be very foolish for any government to do that. But what we did say was that we wanted to do something that the former government had not been prepared to do in the past, and that was to pitch the uplift factor each year at a figure approximating nominal GDP growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that Labor governments had not been prepared to do that in the past caused great concern to provisional tax payers, particularly small businesses. It was having a significant detrimental cash flow effect on them from one year to the next because the uplift factor was at a rate in excess of the growth in the taxable incomes of many of them. What we have done is to meet fully the election commitment we made to small business because of the great damage that had been bestowed on small business, not just by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2373"> the application of the provisional uplift factor, but, more importantly, by the rest of the economic policies and the mismanagement of the former government. We all know the results of that. Tens of thousands of small businesses went out of business. They became bankrupt, insolvent and the like because of the policies of the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I stress that this compromise decision is not a backdown. I must say that we would have preferred, because we thought it made a lot of sense, to leave the default rate at 10 per cent. That would have been our first best choice, and that is why we had it in the bill. But we were very concerned at the amendment that was passed the other day, because to have the bill continue as it had been amended in the Senate the other day would have caused several very serious potential problems. What we have come up with now is a compromise, which I am very pleased to see is generally accepted. It makes a lot of sense. It provides stability and certainty so far as the calculation of the rate is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat that we have delivered on our promise to provide a cash flow benefit of something like $180 million in 1996&hyphen;97 to provisional tax payers and, therefore, particularly small business, as a result of the reduction of the uplift factor for next year from eight per cent to six per cent. Small business, I think, recognises the great value of that and the fact that the coalition has delivered fully on its promise in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank all the senators for their contribution to the debate. I am pleased to see that we will now have a sensible result, which, I think, will be for the benefit of all of us.</PARA></SPEECH>

I do not think anything that he said causes me to change my language, because on the formula, as he described it in the very same speech he has just made, he said that, if this formula had worked this year, the uplift factor would be six per cent and what he had in the out&hyphen;years was 10 per cent. So that is a significant change in the position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make, since he mentioned the former government, is that in my speech on the second reading I simply went to the statistics. The Bureau of Industry Economics' publication on industry trends in Australia shows that all of the employment growth in Australia over the last three years has been due to the growth of small business, and employment growth in Australia is at the highest level of any nation in the OECD. That is hardly a bad performance by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me have one last question&mdash;I think it is the last question&mdash;to Senator Short, and that is coming back to the formula that is now being proposed to be introduced. In view of the explanation of that formula, what is the position under the formula if the Statistician, as he often does, revises any of the estimates referred to in that formula? I am sure that Senator Short is aware that when the Statistician's reports come out, they come out as a sort of first round of the statistics. A complete case by case analysis is then done and, frequently, the Statistician puts out a revision. The first release attracts all the headlines; the revision often attracts none. But from a statistical point of view, when you are basing a formula like this on his returns, which ones apply: the initial release, or the revised estimates?</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. This bill started out with very clear understanding all around, but it has now come down to a degree of confusion. I have to apologise for that outcome to those with whom I have discussed this over the last few days. I must say that I feel that keenly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments, however, are&mdash;in view of the changes the government made just now to the bill during the committee stage&mdash;also necessary to be made. As the minister has said, and rightly, they relate to policy by&hyphen;laws. That is a description or a term that I am sure is clear to everyone. Policy by&hyphen;laws, in case it is not clear, are a device in which, for a particular product, an application can be made to the minister and the minister can hold, for circumstances relating to that product, that a by&hyphen;law should issue which would remove any tariff on the importation of that item.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the act says about the scope of the ministerial discretion here is important. If the discretion is to take the tariff down to zero, then, of course, no tariff would be paid. But, if the act provides that it can go down to, as the present bill would provide, three per cent, then the ministerial discretion is crimped, so that the minister is not in a position of being able to remove all tariffs on an imported good. What this debate is centred around really is&mdash;if I might describe it this way&mdash;on the part of the Democrats, a view that all of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the tariff concession orders should remain intact and that this bill is not necessary at all. I think that is largely the sentiment of the Greens too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the opposition, what this debate has been about is removing the extension by the government away from the concession orders to consumer items and imposing a three per cent tariff&mdash;that is to say, a three per cent tax&mdash;on the importation of items for consumer consumption. The changes that the government has incorporated, in the face of the Senate's initial rejection of its proposal, have accommodated to a large extent, but not entirely, the concerns of the opposition but, in my understanding, not the concerns of the Democrats and, I think, not the concerns necessarily of the Greens. So that is the background against which these amendments come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision here, though&mdash;if, as I hope, our amendment is supported&mdash;is for ministerial discretion to be allowed on three areas which are vital inputs to industry and on which, if a case is made under a by&hyphen;law application, the minister can grant a by&hyphen;law, meaning that that particular item can come into Australia without a tariff at all. As the bill stands, it could come in with a minimum three per cent tariff. Those items that we have earmarked are quite important items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three areas. The first one concerns machine tools for working advanced metals. That is item 55. The reason why we have put that up is that machine tools for working advanced metals are a high piece of technology. Australia, as an increasingly sophisticated manufacturing country, requires this technology. It is not made in Australia. If it is imported, then a tariff will have to paid on it. So, the cost of that technology being imported as an enabling technology for the development of our industry will be higher than it would otherwise be, simply because the government wishes to recoup revenue and impose a tax on industry inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would argue that machine tools for working advanced metals, item 55, ought to be included. That would, in addition, reflect the extension of the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act to cover these items. Under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2378"> the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1), the concessional rate will increase from zero to three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other two areas are high&hyphen;performance raw materials and intermediate goods. This is item 57. They would be chemicals, plastics and paper used in production which offer a performance advantage over substitutable goods produced in Australia. Under the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1), the concessional rate will increase from the zero that it currently is to three per cent. That is why it needs to be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area is high performance food packaging materials, item 60. These, basically, are metal materials and goods which offer a performance advantage over similar goods produced in Australia. Under this bill, the concessional rate would be increased from zero to three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these three areas&mdash;machine tools for working advanced metals, high performance raw materials and intermediate goods, and high performance food packaging material: items 55, 57, and 60, respectively&mdash;the effect of this bill would be to increase the concessional rate from zero to three per cent. We believe it should be at zero, and that if a case can be made sparking ministerial discretion to be exercised, then it is quite proper that the minister should have the scope to go down to zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are strategic industry sectors for Australia. These are sectors in which it is important for Australia to obtain a greater comparative advantage. These are sectors of growth in the Australian economy and they reflect the higher technological expertise of the Australian workforce. To tax them is to try and stunt their growth at the very time in which it is essential to the economy that we grow our manufacturing base, and that we grow it competitively. So it is a very odd thing for the government to do and we believe that if the bill stood, there would be a massive outcry from Australian industry, which would reject the government's action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to mark the spot that we are not in favour of that. We believe that these amendments should carry. I believe these amendments reflect, indeed, as I understand <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it, the intent of the position put by the minor parties in this debate. I have to say immediately, so that I do not misrepresent their position, that it does not reflect their entire case, but it reflects part of their case. I would hope, too, that they might find a way in which they can support these amendments. I commend them to the Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

Under the policy by&hyphen;law system, where we have a project of $10 million or more, they do qualify for the duty&hyphen;free entry. These are not project based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reducing the tariff from three per cent to zero under item 57 would cover things like raw materials&mdash;and I think that Senator Cook referred to plastics and things like that&mdash;where there was a demonstrable performance over substitutable goods produced in Australia. That attacks the very thing that the first bill provided, that where there are substitutable goods, and we do not use generic terms, this policy by&hyphen;law should not apply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, my question is addressed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collins for the question. Yesterday, senators will recall, I gave an undertaking that there would not be undue delays to the funding of organisations through the special auditor. Senators will recall that I explained the transitional arrangements put in place to ensure all organisations, other than those in serious breach of grant conditions, will receive funding up to a maximum of $300,000 for the first three months of the next financial year. The process involves ATSIC regional offices lodging applications with the special auditor, and after three weeks funding the organisations concerned for three months. This process was to begin from 4 June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In discussions with ATSIC this morning, I have been informed that some ATSIC regional offices have been unable to complete preparation of grant applications and are still in the process of lodging them with the special auditor. To ensure that there is no delay, I will issue a direction that the three&hyphen;week delay will not apply until after 1 October. The effects of this will be to allow, immediately on lodgment of a grant application with the special auditor, funding to be provided to that organisation on condition that the organisation is not in serious breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators might be interested to know that it appears that of the 1,600 organisations seeking grants, approximately 150 are in serious breach. By taking these steps I am ensuring that delays are kept to a minimum <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2380"> and that organisations not in serious breach will continue to receive funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also would like to reiterate this government's commitment to accountability. The special auditor is a key element of providing that accountability, and the government will not back away from that. Unlike the previous government, we will ensure that Aboriginal communities get a fair go and that funding achieves the goals of real improvements in health, housing and infrastructure.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade. In this my last question in the Senate, I refer to Australia's trade policy and recall the Governor-General's speech at the opening of this parliament when he spoke of trade with Asia as Australia's highest priority and emphasised `global trade liberalisation', such as through the WTO; a regional `focus', such as importantly through APEC; and new activities in `bilateral' trade negotiations. China was one of the particular countries mentioned. I ask the minister to outline the achievements and the current activities of the government in these areas. Also, I commend the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Mr Tim Fischer, for his significant visit earlier this month to Latin America to chair the Cairns Group and for his bilateral visits, not least to Chile. What were the significant outcomes of this visit?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not think of a more appropriate question to get from Senator Teague as his last question. It is probably the case that no individual senator has done more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2382"> to further Australia's foreign and trade relations with individual countries than Senator Teague, and he has visited them all on many occasion. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that, whilst we acknowledged the work that the government was doing in relation to multilateral trade negotiations when we were in opposition&mdash;through bodies such as the Cairns Group, in the former GATT negotiations and in other ways&mdash;we did hold the strong view that insufficient effort was being put into developing individual bilateral trade relations and insufficient structures were being placed within the department to facilitate those bilateral negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been heartening to see that Mr Fischer, the new trade minister, has followed up on the concerns we previously expressed and has made a real effort to contribute to the development of stronger bilateral trade relations since taking office. He has done this particularly&mdash;as you said, Senator Teague&mdash;through his recent visits to Asia. I refer to his visit to the Philippines, where he signed a bilateral agreement which will provide market access for tropical fruit to the Philippines. That has been in the pipeline for some eight years, yet it was Mr Fischer who was able to bring it to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fischer initialled a new bilateral trade agreement with Malaysia during Minister Rafidah's recent visit to Australia. He has also done work in relation to various latin American countries, which Senator Teague mentioned. I am not surprised that Senator Teague raised Latin America, because we all know the contribution he has made there&mdash;particularly to the Senate committee report on Australia's relations with Latin America, which is treated as the document that has contributed more to furthering our relationship with that part of the world than any other single document. That fact has been acknowledged by ambassadors to various Latin American countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fischer has followed up on that, I am pleased to say. I will mention just a few examples of where he facilitated bilateral trade development on his recent visit to Latin America. He visited Chile, where he signed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a special double taxation commitment and pursued trade policy matters in relation to the potential increased export of coal. I also mention the work he is doing in Chile to accelerate a bilateral air carriers agreement to better assist our trade and investment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On his visit to Brazil, Mr Fischer expressed Australia's serious concerns about Brazil's application for a 25 per cent shipping freight tax on Australian exporters, something that would work against our exporters. He also pursued trade opportunities in Brazil in relation to telecommunications, agribusiness, mining equipment and infrastructure. Finally, I mention Venezuela and the work Mr Fischer did to further facilitate BHP's joint venture with the Venezuelan company Sivensa. That could lead to a $US680 million investment in the construction of a new direct reduced iron plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new trade minister has taken up the challenge and is achieving what the former Labor government was unable to achieve, and that is in Australia's best interests. I take this opportunity to thank Senator Teague for all that he has contributed to bilateral relations, particularly with Latin America.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Don't they really want to know the answer? Aren't they seriously interested in these issues?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know Senator Schacht is a failed primary school teacher and a failed Telstra technician. He has every good reason to have reached the stage where he knows himself that there is nothing more he can learn about the subject. That is a personal tragedy for him, but I would have thought that his colleagues might be interested in knowing that there are companies like World Exchange who will be able to offer 40 per cent discounts over the next year or so after we get competition from 1 July next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is critically important is that Telstra should be able to match those cuts. It is very sad that not one person on the other side of the chamber is prepared to hold their head up and contest the arguments. In other words, that is a collective plea of guilty. That is what they are saying. They are saying, `We have no argument against what you are saying. We simply want to turn off and bury our heads in the sand, because we know our policy is wrong. We cannot defend it.' That is a tragedy because it is not in the best interests of Australian consumers or of Telstra. Telstra desperately needs a competitive cost structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I hope that Senator Kernot will actually address the implications of staff reductions because they can be very much in the long&hyphen;term interests of the industry, create more jobs in the wider environment and be very much in the interests of Telstra itself and consumers. If its cost structure is reduced significantly it has the capacity to compete with Optus. If it does not, then it will be trying to do that with one hand behind its back. All those people who somehow think that Telstra is impregnable&mdash;and no doubt the opposition's union mates are telling them that all the time&mdash;ought to read a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accidental Empires </EMPHASIS>which will tell them what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2384"> happens to even the biggest companies in the world who somehow bet the company on the wrong technology and find that they are virtually sidelined.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is addressed to Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Can the minister inform the Senate of any action he has taken in regard to the position of director of the National Gallery of Australia following last year's aborted attempts by the former arts minister to find a new director?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2390" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commence my answer by paying tribute to Senator Michael Baume following what I believe will be his last question in this place. As a former shadow minister for the arts, he has had a longstanding and passionate interest in cultural pursuits, and I think he will certainly be remembered for his contribution in that and a number of other even more or equally significant areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say that what Labor did last year in relation to the National Gallery not only was a fiasco as far as the gallery was concerned, but really made Australia an international laughing&hyphen;stock. There was a committee appointed by the former minister, Michael Lee, to recommend a replacement for Betty Churcher, whose term was due to expire last year. That committee made a unanimous recommendation in favour of the late Michael Lloyd, who, by any measure, was one of the world's outstanding curators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Lloyd was subject to great public humiliation and embarrassment which I thought he bore magnificently, and ultimately took the decision not to appoint him, I thought, in very good grace. I would just say in passing that the Turner Exhibition will forever be synonymous with the name of Michael Lloyd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important position. The National Gallery is very prestigious, even in international terms. It has a remarkable collection and, in Betty Churcher's time, it has certainly developed close cultural links with Asia. It has brought out a number of blockbuster exhibitions and it is very well poised to take <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2391"> Australia and Australia's cultural scene into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have in recent times discussed the question of Mrs Churcher's successor with Mr Kerry Stokes, the Chairman of the National Gallery of Australia, and we have agreed that a process should be put in place to find the best possible person to replace Mrs Churcher when her term expires in January of next year. I would certainly like to take this  opportunity to pay tribute to Mrs Churcher and the contribution she has made to the gallery. During her stewardship, it has certainly gone from strength to strength. There are very many achievements of which she ought to be very proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that decision will do in due course is ensure that the National Gallery is back on track, that it does recover from that very low level of morale that afflicted it last year thanks to Michael Lee's absolute political ineptitude. There is no doubt that you could not possibly have handled a decision worse if you tried, and then, to compound matters, Mr Lee consistently refused to provide reasons for the decision, so of course everyone had a field day. Some of the disaffected candidates felt compelled to go to the media. Michael Lloyd, I might say, conspicuously did not and, as a result, it was very damaging, I thought, for the gallery itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt now, that, with a smooth replacement for Mrs Churcher early next year, we can look forward to the gallery getting back on track. We can look forward hopefully to more Turners, although I have to say from a personal point of view I thought the Turner Exhibition was just about the best I have ever seen. One could not imagine a greater combination of colour, light and sheer mastery from one of the world's all&hyphen;time great cultural exponents, and that, I think, is a tribute to those who have run the gallery. I am sure that Mrs Churcher's successor will ensure that there are many more blockbusters to come.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA>The reason this censure needs to be moved&mdash;and if you needed any confirmation of it, we just had it in question time today&mdash;is that Senator Herron has been coming into the Senate and has been questioned on this closely every question time without exception for the last two weeks. For two weeks everybody will remember how he answered those questions. Senator Herron said that absolutely nothing was wrong. `There was not a problem,' said Senator Herron. `Nobody should be worried,' said Senator Herron. `It is all under control. There is not a problem,' said Senator Herron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was quite firm about it. He told the Senate in question time, with respect to concerns that I raised about problems that were being relayed to me, and not solicited by me, from Aboriginal communities across the whole top end of Australia&mdash;and I have now had two inquiries from South Australia&mdash;that they were extremely concerned that they could not get any clarification as to whether their funding for paying wages under CDEP would in fact continue:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Telecom Bonds have been quoted on the Stock Exchange since the early 1970s when they were first issued by the Australian Telecommunications Commission (ATC). These Telecom Bonds were issued under the Commonwealth inscribed stock regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) In 1991 Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) was formed and Telstra became a public company governed by the Corporations Law. At the same time the new company was listed on ASX and earlier Telecom Bonds lines were quoted in the name of the new entity. (Telecom Bonds issued under the Corporations Law are similar but not the same as those issued prior to 1991. In particular, some bonds issued enjoyed the benefit of a Commonwealth guarantee&mdash;see below).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obligations as a listed public company&mdash;continuous disclosure</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) As a listed public company Telstra must comply with continuous disclosure requirements contained in the Corporations Law and in the Stock <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Exchange listing rules. These are not obligations which apply to the Commonwealth as a shareholder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Under Listing Rule 3A (1) Telstra is required to disclose to ASX any information that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of Telecom Bonds or which may influence a person in deciding whether to buy or sell Telecom Bonds. Disclosure is therefore not limited to matters which will materially adversely affect investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Telstra must disclose this information to ASX before it is released to any other person (eg, media).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Telstra also has disclosure obligations arising out of its various debt issues in the US, UK and Europe. Any information disclosed by Telstra to ASX in compliance with its continuous disclosure obligations may need to be notified to, among others, the US Securities Exchange Commission and to the London Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Telstra has rigorous systems in place to ensure compliance with its Australian and overseas disclosure obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Guarantees/Underwriting applicable to Telecom Bonds</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Telecom Bonds are direct debts of Telstra and are unsecured notes under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Telecom Bonds rank equally regardless of issue or maturity date with all other unsecured debt obligations of Telstra. Telecom Bonds are not debts of the Commonwealth and are mostly not guaranteed by the Commonwealth. (As mentioned above, only a few very old inscribed stock lines enjoy such a guarantee. No Telecom Bonds issued under the Corporations Law are guaranteed.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) A change in Telstra's ownership will not affect the interest payments or other rights attached to Telecom Bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The information in (a) and (c) is clearly set out in each Telecom Bonds prospectus. Investors are also informed that there is no guarantee that government ownership of Telstra will be maintained until the maturity date of each Telecom Bonds sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Telecom Bonds issued under the Corporations Law have the benefit of a Trustee who must be informed on behalf of investors if any material adverse event has occurred in the last quarter which would affect their rights in Telecom Bonds (ie the right to be paid interest or have their capital returned on expiration of their fixed interest investment.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Proposed sale by Commonwealth</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As mentioned earlier, the obligation to notify the ASX of material price sensitive information is that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2395"> of Telstra and not the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I await your answer. It will be an interesting one. I draw <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> honourable senators' attention to the first paragraph of the general directions issued by the minister on 10 April. The first paragraph was a direction to the board of ATSIC telling them that they could not issue one single dollar of grant money to any organisation until after the special auditor&mdash;when that special auditor was appointed, which was 6 June&mdash;had cleared them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The special auditor was finally appointed, as I said, on 6 June. ATSIC staff were then provided with a thick document&mdash;the document I lifted up here today. I have read it cover to cover on many occasions, and I will bet large sums of money that the minister has not read it at all. He has been briefed on it, no doubt, by his office staff, but I bet he has not read it because he seems to be blissfully unaware of what it contains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the instructions for the completion of the reporting package which has been reported to me as `the bible; we are using it at the moment; it's gospel; we have to stick to it'. They have been preaching the gospel according to this bible to remote communities across the country. Unfortunately, no-one seems to have made the minister aware of his own gospel&mdash;if they did, it went in one ear and out the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It says that, if an organisation is clear and complying and has had only minor breaches over the past two financial years, then the $300,000 under the fast&hyphen;track process can be paid for the first three months of the new financial year, but it still needs to be cleared by the special auditor otherwise it is in breach of the ministerial directions that have been issued under section 12 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron, who is clearly completely unaware of what he set in train, has been giving everyone the impression there is a fast track that circumvents the special auditor process. Yes, there is a priority track. But let me tell the Senate how it works, because it is absolutely relevant to the statement that ATSIC put out last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is how it works: take a small regional office which is looking after 40 or 50 communities or organisations that are getting grants; it is the end of the financial year&mdash;something the minister did not bother about. If he had <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2398"> actually had the courtesy, as I said to him last Friday, to talk to ATSIC, they might have told him of what would happen once this special auditor was appointed and his directions were given, but he did not give them the opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every regional office in Australia is flat out. It is the worst time of the year for them, because they have to comply with all the accountability provisions that they have to do at the end of the financial year. Also, they are flat out assessing the grants for the next financial year so that they do not get a red light from the special auditor and be seen to be non-accountable. On top of that, out of left field&mdash;whack, whack&mdash;comes this direction: special auditor appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you how the fast track works. The conditions I have just read out are the fast track&mdash;a clear organisation, no particular problems, nothing wrong in the last two financial years; that goes to the special auditor, who then gives it a tick or a cross. That is a quick audit. That gives them three months funding and then in three months there is another look.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the ATSIC staff still have to do the work of getting to the point where they are satisfied that the organisation fits the fast track. That has to be done by real people, in real time and in real offices where they are flat out doing everything else. Minister, you appear to be utterly unaware that your precipitate action, which you have now acknowledged in your amendment to your own ministerial direction, has caused utter confusion in every ATSIC office around Australia and in many communities, who still do not know precisely what funding they will be getting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of this censure motion says that the minister failed `to properly explore alternative options for improving ATSIC accountability before his precipitate action in appointing the special auditor.' We have certainly established that the minister misled the Senate. I did not realise he was going to provide additional support to that by coming into the Senate in question time and admitting it himself.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part is even easier to make out. You did not give proper and careful consideration as a brand new minister in a brand new portfolio&mdash;on your own admission, and how could you say otherwise, publicly that you were very inexperienced. You were sworn in on 11 March as a minister. Cabinet made this decision on 10 April. On this point even the calendar condemns you. By the time you got around to your first cabinet meeting, you would barely have had an opportunity to get across the first round of briefings&mdash;and clearly, from your performance in here, you still have not managed to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that the calendar condemns you; but you were condemned out of your own mouth last Friday on this same issue. The chairperson of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, gave compelling evidence to the committee that she had complained about a large number of issues, which had been properly investigated by ATSIC, had these forwarded to the relevant agencies such as the Federal Police and the Corporate Affairs Commission and then had the frustration of not seeing all these attacks on ATSIC followed up. Also, she told the committee that ATSIC had been told in respect of this failure that there was a lack of resources in these organisations, that these affairs had a low priority for them and that they simply had not been pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you were asked directly, in the presence of the chair of ATSIC, whether she had spoken to you about these concerns. You confirmed that. You did not dispute the evidence she gave; in fact, you endorsed it. You were then asked whether you had followed up these concerns. To my total astonishment, you said to the committee, `Oh, yes, I did ask some questions and I couldn't get a satisfactory answer.' It is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. You then dropped it and rushed off to the cabinet room and got a special auditor. You were sworn in on 11 March, this decision was taken on 10 April and you said that you had not bothered to follow up the concerns the chair of ATSIC had raised with you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said in here earlier that I thought the minister's response to questions from Senator Kernot was the most appalling statement of the day.

This is such a profound failure of the minister not only because it is hard to imagine anything more offensive than appointing a special auditor to an organisation which knew absolutely nothing about it&mdash;the minister absolutely failed to consult them about it&mdash;but also because he then had the gross discourtesy of walking out of the barest briefing of the chair 30 minutes before the announcement; you had to trot off to the press conference of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Lois O'Donoghue&mdash;and I would like to hear one dissenting voice in this chamber&mdash;has been held up by everyone I know as one of the most distinguished Australians in public life ever. She was mortally offended, and that offence came <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> across loud and clear at the Senate committee hearing last Friday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason it was such a disgraceful effort is that if you had bothered to consult with ATSIC&mdash;that very large organisation that looks after thousands of small communities and, on your own evidence, $1 billion of public money&mdash;they might have been able to tell you of the trouble that you would get into, have got into and are now in. The need to amend your ministerial orders might never have arisen. This mess, as I said the other day and is now painfully obvious, was made entirely by you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not need to look past your own press release of 11 April to confirm this appalling lack of consultation. The press release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Senator Herron had not raised the proposals for the appointment of a Special Auditor and the reserve power to call in an ATSIC Administrator with Miss O'Donoghue until immediately prior to the Prime Minister's press conference yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>What a wonderful start for a new minister for Aboriginal affairs! We know the enormous importance that Aboriginal communities place on consultation, but even non&hyphen;Aboriginal people would be grossly offended by the fact that there was no consultation in this case. An administrator was to be appointed, a person that the minister could appoint to disable the entire commission&mdash;not just sack people but disable the commission and take over its powers&mdash;and he could not even be bothered telling the organisation he was going to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was impressed by the powerful and emotional evidence given by Miss O'Donoghue. She said that she was absolutely appalled that the new government at its first cabinet meeting chose to focus on an indigenous affairs matter that was not even part of the minister's submission to cabinet. Miss O'Donoghue said that this decision had caused not only a lot of offence to Aboriginal people but a lot of hurt as well.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy of the dislocation of the CDEP schemes goes far beyond dollars and cents. As has been pointed out again and again, under these schemes Aboriginal people are the only people in Australia who work for their unemployment benefit. They actually get less than the unemployment benefit. Why is that? Because they voluntarily give up a percentage of the unemployment benefit to be pooled to provide infrastructure&mdash;such as material to build sheds&mdash;for the community projects they are working on. People such as Senator Boswell are familiar with the way in which CDEP schemes work on the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not too many people who are entitled to go on unemployment benefits would volunteer for such a scheme, but over 300 of these work for the dole schemes have sprung up around the country. Minister, how much incentive is there for people to stay with these schemes when, after they have painfully put these things together, you dislocate the funding and force them to sign up for unemployment benefit so they can feed themselves and their kids?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I did not put you in this position; you put yourself there. Then you had to compound the matter by attacking the credibility of these organisations when you did not need to do so.

You pathetically claimed that it was just a matter of their making a phone call to your office, but you cannot escape the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the Junjuwa organisation wrote to you. They faxed a letter to your office on Monday. They did it again on Tuesday. And they did it yet again on Wednesday. When they spoke with your office on at least one occasion&mdash;they say it was two&mdash;they were told, `Your organisation is okay; you won't have any problems.' They pleaded with your office for some assistance. They rang back on the following morning and were told that no&hyphen;one could talk to them. That was after four days of trying to bring this matter to your attention. Yet you have the hide to come in here and attack that organisation under privilege.

They indicate the grasp you have on this subject. Listen to some of this stuff. I raised concerns about all the confusion being caused by the special auditor, and you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I have appointed the special auditor only recently. There has not even been the time for the allegations made by Senator Collins to occur. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2401"> </PARA>
<PARA>Extraordinary! You totally ignored the fact that it was your ministerial direction to freeze the funds the minute the special auditor was appointed that was causing significant problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you that there are three occasions where you made the same extraordinary statement. You seem to have a view that under the proposals you put in place funding would continue to flow. You said on three occasions, until the special auditor found a problem, organisations were innocent until they were proven guilty. Your action had exactly the reverse effect: all organisations were guilty until proven innocent. But again and again in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> you seem to have absolutely no appreciation of this fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding this censure motion&mdash;and I must say, particularly on the last three points, it was very easy; I think every ground for this censure has been amply made out&mdash;the Senate calls upon you to unconditionally withdraw your unfounded imputations against these communities and to ensure that your complete failure to consult ATSIC on actions profoundly affecting its operations does not occur again. Can I offer the minister this piece of gratuitous advice as someone who was in cabinet for seven years: it would not only save Aboriginal people from getting into trouble; from time to time it might save you from getting into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and importantly, we call upon you to take action to minimise the disruption to organisations not in clear breach of the accountability requirements demanded by ATSIC&mdash;absolutely unnecessary disruption which you single&hyphen;handedly have caused. For that, you are now forced to come into the Senate with your tail between your legs and your head down to finally admit after two weeks of telling us that nothing was wrong that you had to amend your ministerial direction to try to fix up the mess. It is a disgrace!</PARA></SPEECH>

<ROLE>Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will recall that when the government came to power it came with a commitment to improve outcomes for indigenous people. That was the bottom line: the improvement of outcomes. Part of that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commitment was a commitment to greater accountability. Those who doubt the need for greater accountability should look at the recently completed compliance audits into the Aboriginal legal services. Five out of five organisations examined were found to be in breach of their grant conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the special auditor, I am advised that only 10 per cent have been given a clean bill of health as far as complying with grant conditions is concerned&mdash;10 per cent. The appointment of the special auditor is showing an outcome which was not predictable but certainly thought to be an outcome. The reasons for appointing the special auditor to date have been justified. The other 90 per cent are in breach at some level; 10 per cent are in major breach or have other major problems. The Junjuwa people are in breach, and that was the answer which I gave yesterday. So there are problems there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office has received over 200 written complaints of mismanagement and fraud, and several hundred phone complaints. Several hundred pages outlining all manner of allegations have been referred to the federal police, and these complaints come from Aboriginal people&mdash;from communities which are sick and tired of missing out because of the lack of accountability. There are critics of our drive for greater accountability, but you would expect those who will lose the most from accountability concerns to shout the loudest. Our commitment to accountability is absolute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Referring to the specific matters that Senator Collins has raised, it is probably important to give a chronological account of what has occurred so that the Senate is aware of the sequence. I did issue general directions on 10 April; a date which Senator Collins keeps hammering. I will read from a letter that I sent to Ms Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairman of ATSIC. The letter is headed `General directions to ATSIC in relation to the appointment of a Special Auditor' and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that you have been in contact with the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in relation to the general directions I issued on 10 April 1996 and that you have certain questions in relation to those directions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My view of the issues you raise is as follows: <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2402"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Query re releases under existing grants</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The directions would apply only to grants and not to periodic releases of grants already made or to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Query re the timing of the directions coming into effect</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the directions will not have legal effect until the Special Auditor has been appointed. However, I urge you to move to put the necessary processes in place immediately so that delay in commencing the Special Auditor mechanism may be minimised and so that the spirit of the directions may be implemented at the earliest possible date.</PARA>
<PARA>I will repeat that: `I urge you to put the necessary processes in place immediately so that delay in commencing the special auditor mechanism may be minimised.' Senator Collins cannot ask for anything clearer than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms O'Donoghue received that letter on 11 April, which said to put the necessary processes in place immediately so that any delay may be minimised and so that the spirit of the directions may be implemented at the earliest possible date. The letter further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. Query re the application of directions to all organisation or only those which have been in breach</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The directions refer to all organisations and not just those who have previously breached loan or grant conditions. This broad application was clearly the intention of the Cabinet and was my intention in issuing the directions. Even if a technical arguement could be mounted to the contrary, I would be able to issue revised directions at any time.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins will recall that on Friday I said the reason for that was that there would be no organisation that, if it was in breach, could not be picked up in the audit. There was a reason for that, but I also said that transitional arrangements would be put in place, because we realised that the technical problems in doing such an audit would be great. Finally, in relation to the letter I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Query re the provision of financial statements in relation to alternative sources of funding</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The directions are intended to apply to all information which ATSIC can legally obtain and to encourage grantee organisations to provide fuller and better information than has previously been the case. I am seeking the most transparent decision making process which is possible. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have considered the matter of providing you access to the Commonwealth's legal advice. I do not believe that such access would be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter was dated 11 April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 5 June the following letter went to the acting chief executive officer of ATSIC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Rees</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has agreed to the appointment of KPMG as the Special Auditor (SA), pursuant to the Minister's General Direction of 10 April 1996, for a period of six months. A contract has been executed with KPMG on 4 June 1996 and their appointment commences on that day.</PARA>
<PARA>The point here is that there was time from 11 April to the letter dated 5 June, but the contract was executed on 4 June. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC staff have been involved in discussions with staff of this office and KPMG as the preferred tenderer on issues associated with the development of the contract. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The contract, including the payment of accounts, is to be administered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the project will be dealt with on a `fee for service basis'.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins, I think it is important that the facts are on the table and that you understand what has been occurring. On 31 May there is a file note which says that there was consultation on 30 May. The file note states that this particular person spoke to ATSIC to inform them of the minister's decision to put in place transitional arrangements for the special auditor process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 June I wrote to the Chairman of ATSIC and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the General Directions I issued on 10 April 1996 to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) pursuant to Section 12 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989, and the Explanatory Addendum I issued on 4 June 1996, relating to the appointment of a Special Auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you may be aware, I have agreed to the appointment of the firm KPMG to undertake the tasks of the Special Auditor, and the contract between the Commonwealth and KPMG has now been finalised by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, effective 4 June 1996. A copy of the contract was provided to the acting CEO of ATSIC, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2403"> Mr G Rees on 5 June. I understand that ATSIC officers have been consulted regarding a number of contractual issues and the ATSIC staff have been liaising with KPMG on a protocol to support the effective performance of the Special Auditor function.</PARA>
<PARA>Then I go on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must stress that I regard ATSIC as responsible for ensuring the smooth and timely provision of the material necessary for the Special Auditor to form a considered judgment on whether an organisation is not a fit and proper body to receive public money. Equally, it is my view that by exercising good judgment about organisations appropriate to receive grants or loans, ATSIC can avoid the likelihood of the Special Auditor finding proposed grant recipients not fit and proper and so, over time, reduce the need for a Special Auditor.</PARA>
<PARA>The point there is that we recognised that there could be delays in the processing of that material. So we set in place&mdash;and evidence was given to this effect on Friday at a hearing of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee&mdash;a mechanism of transitional arrangements where organisations could be categorised as green, amber or red, so that the ones that were thought to be in major breach could be processed first. Then the ones who were green could obviously go ahead and be processed because of the problems that have been mentioned in terms of the technical aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously some organisations were in trouble and Senator Collins has been jumping up and down about the Fitzroy Valley and the Junjuwa. I will read from a fax which was received today in relation to that particular organisation which was mentioned by Senator Collins.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a good example of what occurred on Friday. That is why I am ignoring the interjections. The facts of the matter are that instructions have been relayed to the Federal Police so those matters can be expedited. Getting back to the chronological order of events, so the Senate is fully <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2404"> informed as to what occurred, I will go back to the letter that was sent on 6 June. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must stress that I regard ATSIC as responsible for ensuring the smooth and timely provision of the material necessary for the Special Auditor. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I also mentioned previously that I spoke about transitional arrangements&mdash;and they are in this letter of 6 June. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have agreed to transitional arrangements associated with the initial work of the Special Auditor whereby proposed grant recipients which have no present breaches of grant conditions and only minor technical breaches, if any in the past, may receive a grant pro rata for the first three months of the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year. In these circumstances ATSIC must still provide the relevant information to the Special Auditor in time for the July grant and the Special Auditor must still form a view on whether such organisations are fit and proper before the following grant is given in October. In this way I have aimed to minimise any delays in the provision of grants to organisations whose performance to date suggests the Special Auditor may not find them not fit and proper.</PARA>
<PARA>I will repeat that, because it needs to be emphasised. It is entirely consistent with the advice I gave the Senate. On 6 June, Senator Collins, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . minimise any delays in the provision of grants to organisations whose performance to date suggests that the Special Auditor may not find them not fit and proper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 June I wrote to the Chief Executive Officer of ATSIC in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to express my serious concern at continuing reports that ATSIC Regional Council officers are telling community groups that funding is not guaranteed over the next three months, or in other ways are misinterpreting the Special Auditor process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, ATSIC has been aware since 10 April of the nature of information required to be provided by ATSIC to the Special Auditor once appointed, and I expect that ATSIC officers should have been using the intervening period to make the necessary preparations for the current round of grant decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reiterate that I agreed to the transitional arrangements specifically to ensure that organisations with acceptable records of grant compliance need not undergo Special Auditor scrutiny for the current round, and therefore, subject to normal ATSIC grant assessment processes, can be immediately guaranteed funding for the next three months. In my letter to the Chairman, Ms Lois O'Donoghue, of 6 June 1996, I set out the transitional arrangements I agreed, to with the aim of minimising any `delays in the provision of grants to organisations whose performance to date suggests the Special Auditor may not find them not fit and proper.' I therefore urgently request that you take all actions necessary to ensure that ATSIC Regional Council officers comply with all Special Auditor processes, including the transitional arrangements, and that all officers accurately represent those processes to the indigenous community.</PARA>
<PARA>That brings you up to date, Madam Deputy President. As I said yesterday afternoon at the end of question time, with Senator Collins being an honest man, despite his own quotation about dealing with honesty as a dangerous product, I thought that perhaps he knows something that I do not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this regard. I took him at his face value and my officers rang ATSIC. We were told that the relevant ma <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2405"> terial had been followed and the advice that I had given the Senate was correct. Then I explained, as Senator Collins will remember, when discussing the amendments to the bill we were debating, that there had been confusion. I agreed with that. I thought it was an honest mistake, an interpretation of advice that he had received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, and I have clearly shown, receipt of that information from the Western Australian office in relation to the Junjuwa community in the Fitzroy Valley, shows they did issue incorrect material. That was the letter, you will recall, Madam Deputy President, that Senator Collins was waving around yesterday, saying that they had been informed. It is also confirmed that the community are in breach of the audit requirements. That answers the case completely. The reality is that only 10 per cent&mdash;in the estimate, anyway&mdash;so far of the funds are fulfilling strict audit requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am further advised by the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations that currently it is estimated that another 1,200 incorporated Aboriginal organisations are in breach of their grant conditions&mdash;in other words, over 50 per cent. We came to office with a concern that people's money be spent in the pursuit of improving the conditions of Aboriginal communities, and we stick to that. That is not negotiable at all and we will pursue that because it is in the interests of the Aboriginal community that that be done. As I go around the Aboriginal communities, I am sure that I have support in them for that stand. There is no question about that situation.Madam Deputy President, I think I have answered the charge that has been brought against me about misleading the Senate.

That was the information I was given, Senator Collins. I could do no more than report what I was told. I can do no more than repeat what I was told by ATSIC and I got that assurance.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And later in the day, Senator, when I asked you when in fact you were informed and what was the earliest opportunity you had to come in and correct the record, what did you do? You wouldn't answer the question, because the only way you could try to correct the record was in answer to a question asked by a member of the opposition, Senator Bob Collins, in Senate question time today when this Senate had been sitting from 9.30 in the morning until 1.55 this afternoon before question time commenced at two o'clock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I say, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that he took the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Downer route.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within weeks, Senator Herron has established a reputation for ignorance and incompetence second to none&mdash;which is pretty difficult considering the ministerial line&hyphen;up in here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In front of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee last <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2410"> Friday, Senator Herron again revealed a great deal about his appalling level of understanding of his own important portfolio. He was revealed, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 25 June under the headline `Herron paints a picture of ministerial ineptitude', as a minister who is not aware of his statutory obligations under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, which he has breached. He regards those sorts of obligations as details. He justified major changes to ATSIC on the basis of community concerns about Aboriginal funding and gave as an example of that concern remarks of political candidates such as the member for Oxley, Ms Pauline Hanson. He described the preferred qualification for the chair of ATSIC as including `an ability to mix with foreign dignitaries and understand the protocols required on those occasions'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of his inept handling of his portfolio and his alienation of most of his constituency came his outrageous and offensive remarks directed at Senator Collins during question time last week.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2411"> We have a minister in this chamber who has shown consistent incompetence and consistent ineptitude.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that the new government is trying to do things differently in this portfolio. The new government is not prepared to stand a record that it has inherited. After 13 years of Labor there can be no doubt, by any objective observer, that Labor failed appallingly in relation to the administration of Aboriginal affairs. You only need to look at areas of Aboriginal housing, employment, health and education. Whatever index you seek to apply, after 13 years of Labor administration in this area you can only come to the conclusion of failure. The statistics are appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hesitate to refer to them because they are well known. The public understands the existence of these problems. What the public cannot understand is why Labor, having administered this portfolio for so many years, did nothing about it. There are 120 remote communities without adequate water supplies, 134 communities without appropriate sewage disposal systems, 250 communities with no electricity, and two out of every five Aboriginal males can expect to live beyond their 65th birthday compared with three out of four non&hyphen;Aboriginal males. There is a prevalence of diabetes, high levels of infant mortality, and sickness in Aboriginal children linked to poor housing conditions and inadequate health care. One can go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the legacy that this minister inherited yet, after three months, this alternative government&mdash;the Labor Party&mdash;has the nerve to censure the minister for claimed failure. What a nerve! Certainly, it has the right to debate Aboriginal affairs policy, but to have the gall to come in here after just three months and condemn Senator Herron as a failed minister demonstrates a cheek beyond comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron inherited a very difficult situation. He inherited an outcomes situation that was unsatisfactory by anyone's assessment, but he also had the difficult challenge of addressing why the outcome has been so poor when a lot of taxpayers' money has been put into the portfolio over a long period of time. Senator Herron very quickly picked up <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2412"> the fact that there were widespread allegations that the money was not reaching those who were most in need, that the money was not achieving the outcomes that were required in health, education, social security, housing and so forth. Not surprisingly!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron is not only accountable to the taxpayers at large for the expenditure of that money but he is also accountable for producing a better outcome than that which was achieved by his predecessors. That is not an easy task for a new minister in this portfolio. It is particularly complicated in a situation where you have an intervening body with responsibilities such as ATSIC. It is not a portfolio such as most of us have where we have the direct link of expenditure responsibility. The position in which Senator Herron found himself is one of extreme difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that background, the Labor Party comes in here today and attempts, firstly, to censure him for stating&mdash;to paraphrase it in my terms&mdash;over the last few days his belief as to why problems were occurring. On Monday, the problems were put to us in a question from Senator Crowley. There were problems at Fitzroy Crossing in relation to CDEP and allegations were made by Senator Crowley in that instance in relation to the funding of sewerage systems and water supply, and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The following day there were some other allegations made, but they do not seem to have taken the matter much further. On Wednesday, Senator Bob Collins was a little bit more specific when he referred to difficulties that were being experienced by the Junjuwa community.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, what I am saying is that Senator Herron was advising the Senate that he believed that, if these problems were existing, they were not as a result of his appointment of a special auditor. He went through the series of steps that he had taken since the first appointment to ensure, firstly, that those who were not in default did not suffer and, secondly and perhaps even more importantly, that if there was default, individuals who were innocent did not suffer as a result of that as well. What more could be expected of him?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is responsible for accountability to the taxpayer and to the Aboriginal community, and has a responsibility to use his best endeavours to ensure that the funding gets to those most in need. He seeks to do that by the appointment of a special auditor so that he knows what is going on and can get to the bottom of the problem of money not reaching those most in need&mdash;and for his <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2413"> trouble he gets condemned by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party was never interested in accountability, and it was never particularly interested in whether money and services got to those most in need. If they had been interested, their record would have been a lot better. We would not have these appalling statistics in relation to Aboriginal health, education, social security, housing and so on. What comes out of Senator Herron's answers is his real efforts to ensure that the appointment of a special auditor did not result in the innocent suffering.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You may scoff, but just follow the steps. The first appointment and notification to ATSIC was back on 10 April. When concerns were expressed that this may have the unintended consequence of stopping funding for those to whom funding should obviously flow, Senator Herron put in place transitional arrangements which were designed to ensure there would not be any delay in funding to organisations where there is no breach of grant requirement&mdash;and that, as I understand it, was this three weeks requirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to his attention that there still might be difficulties notwithstanding the transitional arrangements he put in place&mdash;and it is not surprising there are difficulties in this regard, because we are talking about some 1,600 different organisations that are receiving funding&mdash;he furthermore comes into the Senate today and makes reference to the transitional arrangements that were put in place and says he intends to go yet one step further by issuing a direction that the three-week delay will not apply after 1 October and that the effect of this will be to allow on lodgement of a grant application with the special auditor funding to be provided immediately to that organisation with the condition that that organisation is not in serious breach. We are talking about 1,600 organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What more can be expected of the minister in these circumstances? He is seeking to meet his responsibility to taxpayers at large to ensure the money is properly appropriated. He <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is seeking to meet his responsibility to the Aboriginal constituency to ensure that those to whom the benefits should apply do in fact get the benefits. He appoints a special auditor to assist him with that task, as is his right and, as some might say, his responsibility in the circumstances before him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also puts in place processes to ensure that this works in a way that does not disadvantage the innocent. When questioned about whether those processes might be further improved, he puts in place new transitional provisions to further improve the situation and, when that is questioned, he improves them yet again with another direction to ensure that the innocent do not suffer. And what does he get for his trouble? He gets Senator Collins marching in here today seeking to censure him! What a hopeless situation. As I said, not surprisingly, on the last day of sitting the opposition looks to make some mischief, and in this instance it is aimed at Senator Herron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The charge made out by Senator Collins is a confused allegation. Not only does Senator Collins seek to make as the basis of his motion of censure that Senator Herron said he believed that any failure in the funds reaching the ultimate recipient had nothing to do with his appointment of a special auditor&mdash;clearly, it is not in the circumstances of the answers that have been given by Senator Herron over a period of days&mdash;but he further seeks to censure the minister for what he regards as other areas of failure in the administration of the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, Senator Collins says that a special auditor should not have been appointed. If a special auditor was to be appointed, firstly, a period of consultation should have taken place. He goes one step further in the second point, and that can be debated. Whether processes have been the most effective processes to achieve certain outcomes is the normal subject for an MPI or an urgency motion. Thirdly, his motion calls upon the minister to do certain things. You do not do that in a censure motion. You are either serious about the censure&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think everyone will concede that this is an extremely difficult portfolio. Senator Herron came into this portfolio and was faced with the situation where a lot of funds were not going to the people who required them. There was a whole list of things where benefits were not flowing down to the people those benefits were supposed to flow to. That was the difficulty he had to face when he came into this portfolio, which has $1 billion of expenditure to Aboriginal communities. He then had to get on top of this portfolio and make sure that everyone who was in need of services under his portfolio received those services.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2415">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not read this extensive list of Labor government and Labor Party failures. I would appreciate it if Senator Bob Collins could listen to this. There are at least two pages listing the Labor Party's failures in administrating Aboriginal affairs over the last 13 years. Halfway through the period of Labor government there was an attempt by the Labor Party to put in the portfolio a commission that would allow self-determination. That was subjected to a lot of debate. After the legislation had been debated and passed by the Senate, ATSIC was set up and the Aboriginal community was given a commission that would allow it self-determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it also required a ministerial overview. The minister has to administer a billion dollars worth of taxpayers' money. He has tried to provide accountability for that money. On 10 April the minister appointed KPMG to perform an audit. Senator Bob Collins has said that the appointment of KPMG has slowed down the provision of services and money to the Aboriginal community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been charged with, amongst other things, misleading the parliament. That charge falls to the ground because that charge is untrue. The minister came into the parliament today and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday, senators will recall, I gave an undertaking that there would not be undue delays to the funding of organisations through the special auditor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in support of Senator Collins's censure motion, but I will be relatively brief. It is important that I attempt to bring the debate back to the actual contents of the motion. Those who have been listening to the contributions of Senator Hill and Senator Boswell might be confused as to what it is we are actually talking about. It is important that I direct the debate to the main part of Senator Bob Collins's motion, which states that we should censure the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, for:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . misleading the Senate when he said in question time that problems being experienced by Aboriginal communities in ensuring continuity of funding for Community Development Employment Projects programs and essential services "had nothing to do with the appointment of the Special Auditor". . .</PARA>
<PARA>The key issue in this debate today is the impact of the special auditor. Senator Herron has maintained all week that his special auditor and the activities of that special auditor have not impacted on the ability of people in remote communities in my state and other states to access CDEP grants and maintain their employment, and sewerage and water systems. All week, Senator Collins and other Labor senators have been asking questions of Senator Herron about this issue. We did so because we received calls from people in those communities who said, `Our funding is about to be cut off as a result of the activities of the special auditor.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we pressed Senator Herron on a number of occasions about that issue. He maintained, in a confused and befuddled state, that in fact it `had nothing to do with the appointment of a special auditor'. He maintained that but he went further, and this is what I found most reprehensible. He then sought to attack the people asking the questions. Senator Herron attacked Senator Collins and he attacked the communities which had raised those concerns&mdash;those legitimate concerns that have now been proven to be correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a humiliating capitulation, Senator Herron had to come in here today and say that he had taken actions to rectify the impact of the special auditor's activities on the communities in the Kimberleys and other parts of remote Australia. People were being sacked or their employment was being threatened, and their access to water and sewerage services was at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here a press release issued by the Kimberley Land Council today. It was obviously issued prior to Senator Herron's announcement, but it is important that what it says goes on the record because it shows the level of concern that exists in the Kimberleys and Western Australia about the minister's actions. I have not seen the details of what Senator Herron announced in his capitulation today, but it sounded very much like funding <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2418"> was going to be assured for the next three months. I am grateful for that and welcome it, because people were in real need and at real risk because of his actions. The Kimberley Land Council said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The special ATSIC auditing process instigated by the minister is having a disastrous effect on the lives of Aboriginal people. Aboriginal work&hyphen;for&hyphen;the&hyphen;dole schemes have been suspended. Water and sewerage systems will soon fail due to lack of money to buy fuel and communities may soon be without money to maintain infrastructure and to run clinics and schools. This process is causing fear and uncertainty amongst Aboriginal people. It is destabilising communities and distracting people from an agenda which undermines the rights of Aboriginal people. It is outrageous that anyone who raises legitimate concerns about what the minister is doing in Aboriginal affairs is dismissed as a troublemaker.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have Aboriginal communities expressing their concern about what was been occurring. But, if you believe the minister, you would think it was only troublemakers like Senator Collins, myself and the other Labor senators who were concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until today, there was no problem. But today Senator Herron came in here and had to deal with the accusations that he has been making. We have raised these issues because of the real concern the communities have about the impact of his decision to rush into appointing a special auditor&mdash;because of his ideological drive about accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister stumbled again and, quite frankly, he is dangerous. We used to think he was just a bit of a figure of fun, but he is dangerous because he is causing real harm to people. The most serious charge laid in the motion today is that he should be censured. Senator Herron should be censured as a result of the answers that he has given this week to a series of opposition questions regarding the CDEP programs and the Aboriginal community's concerns. We were dismissed and ridiculed for raising those questions. On 24 June, Senator Herron said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of those things have occurred as a result of the appointment of the special auditor . . . They are the result of actions and a lot of misinterpretation of material which occurred as a result of the previous budget. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>He even tried to blame the previous government and the previous budget for his problems. On 25 June, in reply to another question, he went on to accuse Senator Bob Collins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have been guilty of spreading misinformation and fear through Aboriginal communities. You have been guilty of creating alarm in CDEP recipients.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the only organisations in danger of funding being frozen are those with serious existing problems of accountability. We will come back to that quote later in my contribution. What did he do? He attacked the man, not the ball, again. When he is under pressure, when he is wounded, he attacks Senator Collins or attacks Aboriginal communities because he is not up to the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are wounded because of your own inability to deal with the job. What you said in answer to those questions was clearly wrong. You have at least now come into the chamber&mdash;and, as Senator Faulkner said, `used the Downer defence'&mdash;and admitted that you were wrong, because you have now taken action to fix the problem that you said did not exist. You said it did not exist. You said it was misinformation and fearmongering. If that was the case, why did you have to fix it today? If you were right earlier in the week, why did you have to fix it today? You had to fix it because you misled the Senate. You were wrong, wrong, wrong. You misled the Senate, and today you had to come in&mdash;slide in here&mdash;and fix up your mistake: not the mistake of the Aboriginal organisations who you tried to lay the blame on, not the mistake of Senator Collins, but your mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the reason why the minister was forced to come in here today was that he was totally undermined by ATSIC. ATSIC put out a press release this morning which laid out the truth of the matter, although, to be fair to them, they did their best to protect Senator Herron. ATSIC actually had to deal with the concerns that were coming from their constituent communities. In that media release dated 26 June, the ATSIC spokesperson said today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is too early to predict how many, if any, indigenous organisations will not be funded in good time because of the special audit processes. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2419"> </PARA>
<PARA>They did not say, `Oh, the special audit processes aren't having an impact.' They did not say, `It's the fault of the previous government.' They did not say, `It's lies and misinformation.' And they did not say, `It was a Senator Collins's plot.' What they said was that it is too early to predict how many organisations will suffer.</PARA>

I am not so concerned about Senator Collins, although that infamous outburst of yours was particularly unfortunate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am concerned about is the impact that you had on Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal people.

Your insensitivity to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginal people and their community's concerns in the last week damns you, in my view&mdash;damns you as totally inappropriate to hold your ministerial position. It really makes me wonder what the future of Aboriginal people in this country is going to be if they have to rely on you to argue their case in cabinet. That is of real concern to us, and I think it is something that John Howard really has to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was going to spend some time discussing some of the accountability issues, but I am far more concerned, given the comprehensive nature of the contributions of Senator Collins and Senator Faulkner, to concentrate on those aspects of the debate that have centred on the attack on Aboriginal communities in Western Australia. I know Senator Kernot is anxious to speak and I will try and limit my remarks, Senator Kernot, but I do think it is important that I cover some of this ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the items in the censure motion moved by Senator Collins calls on the minister to unconditionally withdraw his unfounded imputations against those communities. We included that in the censure motion despite Senator Hill's concerns about style and form because it is a very important issue. People do not like being attacked by their own minister especially when he does not know what he is doing. To lash out because you are injured and because you are under pressure, by attacking the Aboriginal communities who actually have the audacity to raise their concerns, is one of the lowest things that I have seen in this parliament, and it does you no credit at all, Senator Herron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to indicate, firstly, that I have been trying to have some contact with the Aboriginal communities in the Kimberley to ascertain their views about these matters.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to repeat, as I have done almost every day for the past week, that organisations will continue to receive funding unless there is a serious breach of grant requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>By your own admission today, that is not the case. Organisations were being denied funds whether or not they had serious breaches. As the result of the special auditor, there was an impediment. You went on, in answer to the supplementary question by Senator Collins&mdash;referring to the Junjuwa council&mdash;to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, one can only assume, if those circumstances are correct, that the grant body is in serious trouble in relation to audit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did have&mdash;and you were a wonderful chair, Senator Panizza. You gave me lots of opportunities, thank you. I did have an opportunity to ask questions on matters which concerned me. I wanted to give Senator Herron the benefit of the doubt in the beginning and the benefit of time. At the same time, I want to say that I was very conscious of the actions taken by him as minister. I had serious concerns with the action of appointing a special auditor and in announcing, such a short time after coming to the portfolio, that cabinet had decided that Aboriginal accountability was a serious matter and there was lots of evidence that ATSIC organisations were obviously in breach of the accountability rules and, therefore, the government needed the reserve power to appoint an administrator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very concerned about the context of the actions being taken. Unfortunately, we do have to make our way through some of this question and answer trail in order to prove or disprove whether Senator Herron misled the Senate, particularly when he said that continuity of funding for CDEP programs and essential services had nothing to do with the appointment of the special auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I make my way through these questions and answers, I begin on 10 April with the announcement of the special auditor general direction. We make our way through a couple of questions. Senate Herron begins his answers to the first questions by saying, `We believe that at no stage the funds will be cut off.' He goes on to say in answer, `It is not the intention&mdash;nor do I believe this will occur&mdash;that there will be any delay in the expenditure of those funds.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we can accept that. But when he is pressed, when we continue through the trail&mdash;we get to 24 June by this time&mdash;we find more definitive answers. We find him saying, `None of these things have occurred as a result of the special auditor.' We then find a letter from ATSIC's Assistant General Manager, Finance, Mr Alfredson, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now that the special auditor has been appointed, all ATSIC managers and delegates are reminded that as of immediately, no grants or loans may be made to incorporated or unincorporated bodies without the required clearance by the special auditor, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2422"> including any grants or loans made in the remainder of this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>So this is where the real confusion, I think, has been exposed. Will it have no effect? Will it have any effect? What has caused the confusion? How do we interpret what the minister is saying, particularly if you are an Aboriginal community dependent on funding?</PARA>

It is also relevant to note that that office had already been audited by KPMG 18 months ago and given a tick.

The fact that you had to clarify the position today, to me, means that the evidence is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have spent the most time on paragraph (a) of this censure motion. I actually think paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) are very important as well. Paragraph (b) states that `the minister failed to properly explore alternative options for improving ATSIC accountability before his precipitate action in appointing the special auditor'. I know we have explored this elsewhere. Again, it is a time frame&mdash;appointed a minister; a couple of weeks later, without even talking to ATSIC, we find that the minister is apprised of knowledge of so many instances of lack of accountability that cabinet decides on the spot to issue a general direction to appoint a special auditor. Not only that, the evidence is so damning that the cabinet insists that the Senate pass an amendment to give the minister the reserve power to appoint an administrator over ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When pressed on this, where is the evidence? Where is the quantified evidence which makes these actions necessary? The minister told us that there was mounting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2423"> community concern, that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had referred to a haemorrhaging of public funds, and the evidence was that some candidates who had made racist comments in the election campaign had been elected. One of those candidates had been elected in a previously very safe Labor seat. Therefore, from that, we are told to conclude there is mounting community concern about a lack of Aboriginal accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Senator Calvert is shaking his head, but unfortunately that is what was said. I do not think that is quantified evidence. What we have heard from ATSIC is that there were other options available. Possibly, if Senator Herron had thought it was the right thing to do to speak to ATSIC before the cabinet meeting, not after, when he was trying to explain why he had to issue a general direction, ATSIC may have been able to tell him, as they have told me, that there were at least 30 cases last year where the Office of Evaluation and Audit has taken the appropriate action, has referred them on to another agency, and that the Australian Securities Commission, the Australian Federal Police or another state body has failed to take it any further, citing as the reason a lack of resources or that it is not of a high enough priority. Yet the reflection is on ATSIC&mdash;that ATSIC has not followed due process, that ATSIC is unaccountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we say that the minister failed to properly explore alternative options, that is true. He could have asked the Federal Police, the ASC and the various state agencies. Why do you say this is not a high priority when we, on behalf of the Australian community, are interpreting and saying to you that we want greater accountability? Why does the buck stop here? What do we need to do about it? I think part (1)(b) of the motion is proven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part (1)(c) of the motion is about the minister `failing to consult ATSIC to seek advice on the impact this would have on ATSIC and the Aboriginal people it serves'. I do not believe this very short time frame&mdash;the whole package&mdash;in an administrative sense is reasonable. I have heard nothing to suggest that ATSIC has been consulted about it. The impact is demonstrated&mdash;210 people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have already been sacked in the Broome area and thousands more are saying that they may have to go on unemployment benefits because of the total confusion over transitional arrangements and the status of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On part (1)(d) of the motion&mdash;`stating in the Senate that the Aboriginal communities who raised concerns should not be believed'&mdash;we can always look for mischief makers. At some times it is hard to know whether people are acting politically or not, but we should take into account the level of panic that might have existed in these communities as they saw within the next couple of days no source of income for their diesel&hyphen;powered water and sewerage systems and they got no response from the minister's office. I would come down on the side of panic rather than mischief making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The communities which have been mentioned in the Senate are not from my state to the best of my knowledge, and I do not have personal knowledge of any of the people mentioned. But I think we are entitled to conclude, based on the question and answer trail here, that it really was wrong to blame the communities for what really is an administrative stuff-up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On those four counts, I do think the Senate has a case to censure the minister. It is with regret that I say that the Democrats support this motion. I do not enjoy censuring, Senator Herron. We are not calling for his resignation; we are asking for three things that, I think, will put the matter straight.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope it is my penultimate speech. I am very much afraid it may not be, and you ought to be too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to speak to this motion to censure the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron. I am afraid that I, as well, agree that it must be supported. I cannot disagree with any of the sections of the censure motion. I am not saying that I agree with all the aspects of the debate that has occurred, but I have received evidence in my own hands about the concerns that have been expressed by members of the Aboriginal community regarding the impact of the special auditor provisions. While I have not got as close hand evidence in relation to the CDEP program, it is of great concern to me that it may be jeopardised in the same way as the other programs I have heard about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to assure the Senate that it is not being argued that the minister, Senator Herron, wanted to throw the entire Aboriginal community into disarray so he, therefore, imposed a special auditor. I believe it was a policy decision that a special auditor be imposed, but there was a failure to check with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the ATSIC board and the Aboriginal communities that might be impacted by that provision. The minister was not informed that that decision would cause disruption because it was near the end of the financial year. He was not informed that it would leave all the funding for the next financial year&mdash;that is, in three days time&mdash;in doubt. That information was not made available to the minister before he issued the order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been a major problem in this matter. Irrespective of whether it was intended is not under debate. We do not assume that. As I said to Senator Ellison, there is no assumption here of evil motivation, bad intentions or a deliberate attempt to stir up people or cause panic within the Aboriginal community. It is nothing of the kind. In fact, it would be very stupid for any government to do that. I do not believe for one moment that that was the intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, that has been the unintended consequence&mdash;it is indisputable&mdash;of the special auditor provision. The problem I have experienced&mdash;I believe this is what other members in the chamber have been trying to say&mdash;is that, in his response to us, Senator Herron has been making light of this unintended consequence by saying that it does not exist. This motion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> stating in the Senate that the Aboriginal communities who raised concerns should not be believed . . .</PARA>

However, the callers have been talking to me about the ATSIC bill, which we discussed yesterday.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every attempt by the minister to underplay the impact is perhaps being misperceived by the listeners, including myself, and the Aboriginal community, as a view that the minister does not believe them. I think the minister is trying to say, `This was never the intended consequence. If it is a consequence, I will do something about it.' We know that he has done something about it today. However, we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need him to take even more seriously the fact that it is only those people who have jumped up and down whose concerns can be allayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have only a matter of days before the problem reaches a peak. That is why I am supporting this motion. That is why, as Senator Kernot said, if it had been asking for the minister's resignation, it would not have had my support. If it had been saying that he had misled the parliament on some kind of technicality that could be argued about as to how the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>read, as Senator Hill seemed to say, it would not have had my support. The reason it has my support is that the underlying principle in each of these points is, in my own experience, indisputable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate is being told that there is no problem when those of us who are supporting the motion know with our own ears and eyes that there is a problem. We know that alternative options were not explored with the people concerned prior to the imposition of this special direction. We would have felt a lot of sympathy about the exploration of options to increase the accountability of ATSIC. I certainly would have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made it clear that I have not been uncritical of ATSIC. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>record will show that I have been labelled an ATSIC basher in this place. I have persisted in saying that I am not an ATSIC basher but that I am critical of ATSIC and its service delivery on the ground. I agree with the coalition in many of its concerns. If it had come into government and said, `We want to address this problem constructively. We have a plan in place. Will you give it your support?', I would have given it my support provided that we had checked it with Aboriginal communities to see what the likely impact and outcome would have been. I cannot be more sincere in saying that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very strong in condemning the previous government about its double&hyphen;speak on Aboriginal issues. It said that it had consulted when it had failed to consult. I, Senator Campbell and Senator Ellison expressed criticisms about the previous minister Robert Tickner in relation to the land fund and the government's failure to do anything but the most bureaucratic and academic consultation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2426"> Those same criticisms can be expressed of this government now. It is acting on policy and theory. It did not do anything like the kind of consultation that a move of this kind, even if considered in retrospect, justified. The government may not have been expected to know that in advance. Now that it has happened, it should be expected to know that it was in error. It should be expected to admit that there is a problem in the Aboriginal community that is not entirely of the opposition parties' making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not generating panic. We are trying to respond to the panic in the community. We are saying, `Do something about it.' We are not blaming you. We are just saying, `It appears to us that what you have done has led to this situation. We want you to do something about it.' I think Senator Hill mentioned the Senate's gall in, after a mere three months, criticising Senator Herron's handling of his portfolio. What about the gall of the government in its failure to consult before leaping into this extremely difficult area and in doing exactly the things that are stated in this motion. I will read them:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> failing to properly explore alternative options for improving ATSIC accountability before his precipitate action in appointing the Special Auditor;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> failing to consult ATSIC to seek advice on the impact this would have on ATSIC and the Aboriginal people it serves&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and then stating what I have covered already, which is that if we and Aboriginal people are jumping up and down, it is somehow political and unjustified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot vote against this motion, because I think it is indisputable. I do not think that we can quarrel with the requests that this motion ask us to make of the minister. We want him to unconditionally withdraw his unfounded imputations against these communities, and that means we simply want him to believe there is a problem. We are not wanting him to say, `We intended you to have this problem, so tough.' What we want him to say is that, for whatever reason, there is a problem&mdash;whether it is because of the end of the financial year, whether it is because of the way in which the auditor was appointed and the timing of it or whether it was because of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> difficulties among Aboriginal people, with a new government not feeling entirely trusted and believed. Whatever it is, please withdraw your imputations on those communities and on us and say, `We believe you. We can see there is a problem. We are trying to cope with it.'

I heard the evidence given to the committee. I am not suggesting that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has deliberately misled the Senate, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the motion does not say so. That is why there is no call for resignation in there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it curious for a senator of Senator Hill's experience to suggest that a motion brought before this chamber cannot be drafted in any way a senator wishes to draft it. It is a matter for the Senate as to whether it wants to support it or not. I do not read any deliberate misrepresentation into Senator Herron's actions in here, and that is why the motion does not say so. I do not believe that Senator Herron intended to bring about this result deliberately. I put on the record&mdash;I said it by way of interjection&mdash;my gratitude to Senator Herron for the announcement he made today that he is going to amend his directions to deal with the very real problem that has been caused by his actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, let me say this, and this is why the motion was drafted the way it is. I think that perhaps Senator Herron&mdash;and I made an allusion to this earlier in the debate&mdash;was forced into this position through circumstances beyond his control. I thought it was appalling for the government&mdash;and that is the correct way to describe it, as it was a government action&mdash;to do this. Senator Herron is in here representing the government in the portfolio of Aboriginal affairs; he is on the front bench. I thought it was reprehensible and disgraceful of the government, who, just a couple of short weeks after they had all been sworn in, without the slightest consultation with the body at all, took a decision in the cabinet room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in cabinet for seven years and I have often commented that one of the things that is very obvious about the cabinet room is that it is a completely sealed chamber with no windows to the outside world. I was a minister long enough to know what happened. It is the government that you represent that is copping it and so it should. It was disgraceful that you did not consult ATSIC on this issue. Perhaps your cabinet may wish to consider this folly in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was, at the very least, an act of the grossest discourtesy that you could possibly imagine to draft provisions to put in an administrator to take over the whole organisation, and a special auditor, the effective of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2428"> which was to completely dislocate the operations of the organisation. There was not one bit of consultation. The bare courtesy of talking to the chair of the organisation was extended less than half an hour before the announcement was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chair, I thought, most eloquently and with great emotion said at the committee meeting that, to her great hurt and the hurt of all Aboriginal people, once again allegations of Aboriginal propriety became the first central subject of a newly elected federal government. It was appalling. For that to be done a couple of weeks after they were elected and for it to be done without the slightest consultation with the organisation concerned has brought this situation to the sorry pass that it is in now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a standing order in most parliaments that requires us to have a time lapse between introducing propositions and passing them. I have not got the standing orders in front of me but it is something like&mdash;and no doubt the clerks will frown at me if I get it completely wrong&mdash;we have to avoid hasty or ill&hyphen;considered legislation. When you do something like this you get the result that we have got now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that Senator Herron is in the position of wearing it for the government, but that is his job. The government's action in this respect was not just reprehensible but in real terms stupid. As I said Senator Herron, it has not only caused distress right across Australia but has also caused total confusion at the end of the financial year when they are trying to cope with the pressure that is on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the busiest time of the year for every regional office in Australia and, I might add, companies, and this gets dropped on their heads while they are trying to comply with all the accountability requirements we put on them. Out of left field comes this extraordinary proposition. There was no warning given to the organisation before cabinet made this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say stupid because it is still causing great distress and confusion and is dislocating these valuable CDEP. The minister has rightly gone on the record and applauded working for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dole and building up community infrastructure as a result and taking less money for working than if you sat on your backside and got unemployment benefits. The real stupidity of it is that, if the government had extended some courtesy to ATSIC, it would have benefited them because they would have got professional advice from those very professional people at ATSIC as to precisely what the result would be.

I have consulted with the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance on this matter. They regret that they are unable to table documents in relation to this order at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the submissions made to the National Commission of Audit, the Minister for Finance has advised me that the commission's secretariat did not uniformly advise those who provided information to the commission that it could be made public. There was no written advice from the secretariat about the status of any of the information. Some information was, in fact, provided, I understand, to the commission on the express wish of the author that it not be made public. Because of this, the Minister for Finance has advised me that he has instructed his department to contact all of those people making submissions to the commission to ascertain whether or not they wish their submission to be made public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the first part of the order, I can say that there is extensive documentation involved. Some of that documentation is covered by the exclusions for tabling, which have a long period of precedence in this place, that is, the documentation is being <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> examined in relation to its status as, for example, cabinet&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence and/or commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance have advised me that they are not prepared to table documentation on a piecemeal basis. But, as I have indicated to the Senate in complying with previous returns to order, in matters such as this the government wants to cooperate to the maximum extent possible consistent with its executive obligations. Despite the quantum of documentation involved and the timing difficulty in seeking and receiving responses from all those parties who provided information, I assure the Senate that we shall table the documents requested by the Senate immediately these issues have been resolved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When notice had been given, instead of proceeding to seek formality for that motion, after informal discussions with Senator Short I agreed to postpone the motion till today. I did that on the basis that Senator Short said quite clearly, and he did not demur from this, that if I sought formality for that motion yesterday he would have to refuse formality on the basis that he did not have advice from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello). That is what he said, and it is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that spirit I postponed the motion till today, which is when Senator Short came into this chamber, agreed to formality and made a statement in relation to the government's approach. Senator Short, at no time did you say that you would provide documents in accordance with this return to order on a piecemeal basis. You said you would provide whatever documents were available, though I acknowledge you said that you could not guarantee that all those documents would be available by this time. Now you are coming into this chamber and saying, `You'll get nothing unless you get the lot.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. Those of us who were ministers in the previous Labor administration often had to deal with motions that were not just some creation of an individual non-government senator, as seems to have been suggested by Senator Short in his earlier statement. This is an order of the Senate. It is not my own personal demand or requirement that these documents be provided. This is an order of the Senate that you, Senator Short, as the relevant minister in this chamber, did not oppose earlier during Senate proceedings. This is an order of the Senate for the production of documents that you, as the Minister representing the Treasurer and the Minister representing the Minister for Finance, supported in this chamber. It is not some personal whim or fancy on my part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that time and again during the life of the Labor government these orders of the Senate were required by the Senate to be met in accordance with decisions of the Senate. If they were not, then we would regularly hear howls of protest from the then opposition&mdash;including you, Senator Short&mdash;who are on the record time and time again demanding that these orders of the Senate be adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an act of gross hypocrisy on the part of Senator Short. The statement that he has provided to the Senate is simply not good enough&mdash;not good enough in that the order of the Senate has not been met and not good enough in that he could not provide earlier today the Senate with any advice on this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a good, old&hyphen;fashioned cover&hyphen;up, because this government is embarrassed by the Commission of Audit. I want to make this point to you, Senator Short: I am not much interested in private submissions to the National Commission of Audit, but I am interested in government submissions to the National Commission of Audit. I say to you, Senator Short, that that does not require you to communicate with anybody to provide <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2432"> those submissions. You can provide those decisions by very simple work in ministers' offices or in the bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the opposition's part, we will accept that those particular submissions in the first instance would meet the spirit of this order of the Senate. You do not have to go to any individual from any place and check on privacy provisions to provide to this Senate government submissions or directions to the National Commission of Audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) tasked the National Commission of Audit in relation to the pension benchmark&mdash;25 per cent of average weekly earnings&mdash;and a change to the definition of that benchmark. We know that, even though the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, was not let in on the secret. We know it because that particular document, under the signature of the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, actually appears in appendix A of the National Commission of Audit document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do not know&mdash;this is what people who are listening to or hearing about this debate will be more and more concerned about&mdash;what else those or other ministers might have tasked the National Commission of Audit to do. We are entitled to know that in accordance with the order of the Senate, and there are no privacy implications involved. Senator, you said this morning in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will do its best to comply with the undertaking to the maximum extent possible.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were your words. Now you are saying that you will not deal with it because, if it </PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.33 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I was quite surprised this morning to hear a government accede to a return to order. That is not a natural turn of events because a return to order brings out all sorts of information that governments sometimes do not anticipate coming out. But I think there is a higher responsibility on this government now, having accepted the return to order&mdash;albeit with the qualifications that Senator Short outlined in his statement this morning&mdash;to produce the information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tried to listen carefully to Senator Short's statement. He appeared to be saying that one of the major reasons it was impossible to comply went to the second part of the motion, where other people who have made submissions to the Commission of Audit could well have made those submissions without the knowledge that they might become public. Senator Short said that it was therefore incumbent on him and his colleagues to go back and check to see whether the material was releasable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that part of what he said believable. I am surprised that this had not occurred to him or his advisers this morning. It is always possible that Senator Short was not aware of the nature and volume of the private submissions made. I certainly have no idea whatsoever. I have to concede in this debate that I did not know that the Commission of Audit was taking submissions from private individuals and institutions. Therefore, in relation to the second part, what Senator Short said today is a little believable, although it would have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2433"> been better if he and his advisers had been on top of it this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what he has had to say about the first part of the motion is not terribly believable. Surely, it does not take too long for the secretariat to produce the submissions put to it by the government. Senator Faulkner alluded well to why this is an important issue. The independent audit commission was set up to give an independent view about the finances and future finances of government. It was not set up as a stooge of government, I would hope. It was not set up just to reflect government policy. Its credibility was to rest on the fact that here are people with no proprietary interest in these issues, coming up with recommendations for the long term for government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first suspicion that this commission was not going to do that was aroused by the fact that it was staffed by Treasury and the Department of Finance. Talk about rounding up the usual suspects! All the economic dries that you could find in the world, all those wonderfully sociable characters from the Department of Finance, would have turned up and pumped into that commission every view they have been running around this place for the last 15 years, some successfully, some unsuccessfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially, the commission was staffed by those two departments. I do not think you could accuse any of the commission members&mdash;the ones who actually headed up the thing&mdash;of being Fabian socialists, but they are all of a particular type. Even with those reservations, surely the Commission of Audit plays a key and crucial role in bringing out these recommendations, and its recommendations should not be discounted merely because it was staffed by Treasury and the Department of Finance, or merely because the final recommendations to government come from a set piece of ideological or academic thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> What is of concern to this side of the house is what tasking the commission was given through the backdoor. We know from one of the appendices that the commission was tasked to look at average weekly earnings, with 25 per cent as the benchmark for pen sions, and to look at all variations thereinafter. If their recommendations were accepted, they could have quite serious consequences for those relying solely on the pension for their livelihood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we want to know from Senator Short is how many other such suggestions the government made to their independent commission to rule on and how those suggestions were framed. It is not a question of cabinet in confidence or anything else. I say to the officials of the various departments, `Don't get your stamps out now and start stamping "cabinet in confidence" all over.' We are too smart to fall for that particular one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that Senator Short avoided doing tonight&mdash;and what might have satisfied the opposition&mdash;was giving us an indication of when the government will be ready with part A. It may be possible to still table the part A documents in this chamber tomorrow. If that were the case, we could probably end this debate and discuss the rest of the government's business for the night. But we do have a problem with the very nature of what Senator Short has said tonight. It has been too vague. I, for one, on the balance of probabilities, accept his view of part B of the motion. If part B involves quite a number of volumes, I could understand his wanting to go back and check with individuals whether they thought their views would be made public or not. It is a bit like asking whether in camera evidence can later be published, so I understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the documents going from departments to the commission asking them to raise particular issues, that is not cabinet in confidence and nor is it confidential material. That must be material that can be made available very readily. I think, following my contribution, Senator Short should get back on his feet to address the timing of part A. We accept that he cannot give us the timing of part B because he will not know when he will be able to finalise his inquiries into that matter. However, he should at least be able to indicate to us whether part A can be delivered by tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon. If not, what special arrangements can be made for that material to be made available to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2434"> senators prior to the next sitting week, which starts on 20 August? To have a delay through to 20 August would be totally unacceptable in my view. I invite Senator Short to address these two questions: can he meet part A by tomorrow and, if not, can he meet it long before 20 August?</PARA></SPEECH>

I understand that he has said there is a problem with the privacy of some of the submissions. I think the Senate should take note of the National Commission of Audit report, because in the back it lists the submissions that were made. I cannot see any individual submissions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Administrative Services; the Department of Defence; the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, which made two submissions; the Department of Finance, which made four submissions; the Department of Health and Family Services; the Department of Social Security; the Department of Treasury, which made two submissions; and the Department of Transport and Regional Development. There was also a submission from the Federal Libraries Information Network and one from Victorian Treasury, which would be rather interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was about the sum total of government departments. So there is not a real lot of them. It may be worth reading some of the others: Adelaide Central Mission; Aged Care Australia; all states and territories joint submission; Association of Independent Schools of Victoria; AUSEV; Australian Association of Pathology Practices; Australian Automobile Association; Australian Bureau of Statistics; Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Australian Confederation of Childcare; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Council of Deans of Education; Australian Law Reform Commission; Australian Local Government Association; Australian Medical Association Ltd; Australian National Training Authority; Business Council of Australia, which made two submissions; CentaCare, Catholic Family Services; Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services&mdash;another government department; Community and Public Sector Union; Computer Law Services Pty Ltd; Council on the Ageing; CRI Ltd; Curriculum Corporation; and P.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to those submissions there are others from Brother Mortensen; National Catholic Education Commission; National Council of Independent Schools Association; National Tertiary Education Industry Union; Northern Territory Treasury, which made two submissions; Office of Government Information Technology; Steering Committee on National Performance Monitoring of Government Trading Enterprises; Smith Family; Victorian Treasury; and Ward&hyphen;Ambler.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the opposition has made it fairly clear what it is seeking.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will not be opposing this motion. In agreeing to it going forward, however, I want to make a few points. Firstly, I am well aware that even if the government did oppose the motion, the opposition has the numbers to put it through. Secondly&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the question&mdash;as you quite rightly pointed out, Senator Ray&mdash;of getting a response from those who have made submissions and to whom we have written to see whether they are happy for the documentation to be provided.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I will be brief because of the logistics of tonight. I refer the Senate to a very unsavoury article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , which is headed `Wild men of the West shoot themselves in the foot', written by Frank Devine, who reeks of prejudice. In the same way as the loony left reek of prejudice, this guy reeks of prejudice <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2436"> from the right. I do not quite know why I am in the gun from him, except that in this chamber some time ago I made some ungracious comments about one John Hyde. I described him as an intellectual cripple who could do nothing else except parrot words that he had learnt from Burke and other intellectuals. Of course, Mr Hyde writes for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , and he has now set up a little faction in Western Australia, with about as much aplomb and efficiency and effectiveness as he ever demonstrated when he was in this chamber. I think they describe themselves as `those for Liberal values'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Devine takes exception to my opposing Mr Hyde. In fact, he takes particular exception to the fact that I criticise senators in this chamber who, with intellectual and political skills, think they are reinforcing their arguments by quoting some hack journalist. I would have thought that was unexceptionable. But what Mr Devine does is then promptly repeat what other journalists have said to reinforce his arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some time ago an advertisement appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, condemning members of the Liberal Party, and me in particular. The advertisement was illegibly signed by a number of disaffected ex&hyphen;Liberals and was followed by an article written by former senator Peter Durack. None of these people are serving parliamentarians, yet they have been distributing material which has clearly come from a party database. Given that they describe themselves as ex&hyphen;Liberals and make much of their non&hyphen;membership of the Liberal Party, perhaps they could enlighten the Liberal Party as to from whom they improperly acquired their list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me from the outset make two things clear. First, none of the dissident MPs involved have made more than a most modest contribution to the party since retiring on their government pensions, and most of them have made no contribution whatsoever. Secondly, each of these members was successfully endorsed by the Liberal Party, without complaint of the process or of their successful selection. The only significant changes to the process in recent years have been made during Keith Simpson's presidency in Western <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia&mdash;a period when Chaney, Durack, Filing, et al had a very considerable influence in the Liberal Party in Western Australia. To complain about the process in which these signatories have participated and formally supported is utterly absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that, of the four preselection outcomes at a state level of which they complain, not one of their favoured sons was successful. Yet the same process that selected their candidates&mdash;rare as they are in Western Australia these days&mdash;is apparently faultless. It seems that they have a reluctance to accept their minority position within the organisation and will not be satisfied until they devise a system in which the minority is successful and the majority is unsuccessful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They resort to arguments bereft of fact and long on innuendo and smear, in order to generate doubt in the minds of the public about the efforts of decent, honest, hardworking Liberals. They contribute little or nothing to the Liberal Party, yet they collect a government pension, courtesy of Liberal Party endorsement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This small group's hypocrisy is absolutely outstanding. Their public campaign of attack upon the party through the media says more about their integrity than it does about the party. The loyalty of this group has been extended in most cases to supporting or working for non&hyphen;Liberal candidates. It saddens me to see the organisation to which I contributed 25 years of my life captive to a small group of wreckers who seek to destroy what they cannot control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will see from the attached list, which I seek leave to table, that the committee for the practice of Liberal values, as it calls itself, is made up basically of Chaney, his friends, relations, supporters and a handful of ex&hyphen;parliamentarians and members from one or two dissident branches.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston, there are some difficulties, I would suggest, for the manager of government business, who has sought agreement around the chamber. The difficulty has been that there have been matters raised in the chamber which have thrown the program out of whack a little. There have been matters, in terms of what Senator Short has done this evening, which have tested the patience of the opposition to a considerable degree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We approached today's proceedings with the intention to be cooperative and flexible, and to provide assistance to the government in providing an orderly routine of business. It is unfortunate that events have occurred this evening that have not allowed that to proceed. We have reached the point where, I think, the patience of senators is sorely tried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been discussions about the prospect of a dinner break. That, of course, has been put to one side. I think it would be appropriate, though, to allow the senators who wish to participate in the valedictory speeches to do so, and to allow those senators who wish to undertake other duties to do so. There are staff members who have not had any breaks at all today. There are senators here who have not had any breaks at all today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are important matters that need to be considered. The retirement of senators from this chamber is one occasion on which important business is conducted; that is, colleagues are able to say a few words on their passing. That is the matter that ought now to take precedence in the Senate.

<TIME.STAMP>(7.26 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to Senator Faulkner's contribution and perhaps I can shed a little more light on this matter. In relation to the motion that Senator Faulkner mentioned that I moved&mdash;that, at least, is correct. The wording of that motion evolved after a number of days of quite detailed consultation&mdash;which I am sure everyone will agree&mdash;with the leader of opposition business and the whips of the minor parties. What we were seeking to do was to recognise that this was an important day, both in the sense of attempting to wind up the business of the sittings and also to farewell 10 senators who will be leaving this place&mdash;and I think that a majority of those senators who are leaving are Labor Party senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognised that the day was important. Senator Faulkner, you may be interested because you mentioned the spirit. The spirit was to see how we could accommodate a reasonable farewell to those colleagues and, at the same time, make sure that we could deal with the wash up of government business. So, when we reached general agreement on that, that motion was moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night there was another meeting which the Labor Party, the whip, and the whips of the minor parties attended. In that meeting we went through the program. We recognised that in some circumstances it was a bit hard to predict the time required because we do not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2444"> know how much time will be taken on bills. Sometimes, bills can take far longer than one expects, and sometimes they can be dealt with in an expeditious manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We felt that it was important that the Senate should make sure that it dealt with the business that was before it in an efficient manner so that the other place, which may be waiting for our responses to various messages, could deal with those responses effectively. A very clear understanding emerged from last night's meeting that we would conduct the valedictories, but at the same time, as messages came from the other place, these would be dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner. That was spelt out clearly, I think, to the understanding of all people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognised, first of all, that this was an important day, being the end of the sittings, and that we were saying goodbye to so many colleagues. We recognised that we had to deal with government business in an effective and efficient manner. We recognised that the other place would be waiting for our responses to messages that came up here. So we all agreed that we had to be flexible in dealing with the issues that came before this chamber today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we are still seeking. We are not seeking to change the spirit. We think that it was a pity that so much time was lost today in relation to the censure motion. But I think all colleagues would say, and senators would agree, that an awful lot has been done to try to ensure that the communication flows freely, and that people are well informed of what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will oppose the motion, and then I propose to move another motion which, in essence, would allow us to move rapidly on to the valedictory speeches but deal quickly and effectively with messages that have come up from the other place. There is the Development Allowance Authority bill message. There will be a Customs bill message, which I believe is on its way. There may be others. We will have to wait and see. So what I would suggest is that we keep to the spirit of the agreement, which was hammered out over four or five days discussion, so that we can say farewell in a sensible way to the senators who are leaving and at the same time make <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sure that we deal with the government business, which I think the community expects us to deal with, and make sure that the messages we receive are dealt with in an expeditious fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Labor Party will not be supporting this. I think that is a pity. People are coming from different directions on this. We understand the complications. But I think Senator Carr would confirm that an awful lot of work was done to try to nut out a reasonable agreement. So my appeal, Senator Carr, is also to you; but I hope that the Democrats, whom we consulted very carefully, will choose not to support this motion. If the motion fails, I will move another motion which will, hopefully, allow us to deal with the valedictories but also make sure that we can deal with messages that come up from the other place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I know them word for word. Senator Kemp has let the cat out of the bag. I thought that he wanted to get his particular way because of something to do with the Senate; but it has now become apparent that the stick has been put to him by the people over in the House of Representatives, who do not like waiting on the Senate's pleasure. That is a pleasure that they had for 13 years, and I do not want to deprive them of that any more. They can sit there waiting right through tomorrow, as far as I am concerned, because they were forced to so often.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2445"> I think the problem with what Senator Kemp has had to say really goes to the question of when we are going to start the valedictories. Do not think that we on this side are that keen about valedictories. We are never as sentimental as your side about those particular things, and we have other methods of farewelling people that are far less tortur ous than the valedictory system in the Senate. In general, if you took a survey of the Senate, you would probably find that half of the people in their heart of hearts would say that they want to disappear when the valedictories are on and go out and have a nice meal. You are threatening us, Senator Kemp, with actually bringing on business to drag us back here, and that is what we are objecting to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is less serious on this occasion than it could be, inasmuch as we know that you have from nine o'clock tomorrow morning until 3.45 p.m. Frankly, if you do not complete all your business tomorrow, including this, in that time, you are never going to. At least one item&mdash;if you do not complete it it will not be our fault and it will not be yours&mdash;I suspect will be talked out. All the rest will be done tomorrow morning. So what the Senate is voting on now is really this decision: do we start valedictories at a reasonable hour now and finish them by about 10 o'clock, or do we accede to Senator Kemp's view that we will have interspersed government business amongst all this? Everyone has to hang around for something we could easily do between nine and ten tomorrow morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the argument is overwhelming to at least get up at a reasonable hour. I have never been accused of being someone dripping with sentimentality, and I am not doing that yet, but if you look around the chamber you see the departing senators poking their heads in the door. I think we should at least let them have all of that out of the road. Then the only choice is whether you go on to government business or not later tonight, which will be about 10 o'clock. I think that is foolish. You can get rid of all the rest of the formalities built up tonight between nine and ten in the morning. Then, I understand, there is one other major piece of legislation to consider. We do not know whether that will be talked out or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that we should support Senator Carr's motion. I do not think the motion that Senator Kemp has foreshadowed moving, Mr Acting Deputy President, can be put because it is a contradiction of this one. Really, they should throw the dice on this one and get on with the rest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And possibly give us a bit of advice for the future, Senator Jones. I will mention senators in order of seniority, except for the President, whom I will deal with first&mdash;I will give him that extra recognition of his stature as President. Mr President, you have risen to high office in this place; few have that opportunity and we acknowledge your contribution as such. The role of the President of this chamber, I think, is much more difficult now than it once was. It is more difficult now than it was when I started in the Senate. The nature of the Senate has changed substantially. I will not say it was just with the advent of Senator Faulkner, but it is a vigorous chamber now in a way that perhaps it once was not. Particularly during question time it no doubt stretches the President's capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do recognise your achievements and wish you well. I wanted to specifically acknowledge some of the work that you have done for the Senate out of the chamber, particularly some of your international work, specifically Burma. I know that you have been prepared to use the stature of your office to try and help bring about change in Burma towards democracy and an improved human rights environment. I admire you for having been prepared to do that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2446">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are retiring in circumstances that may not be particularly happy, but you cannot blame us for that. In this instance we are not the guilty party. In some ways such circumstances possibly make it harder to face retirement from this place. Be that as it may, we, on this side of the chamber, certainly wish you well in the next phase of your life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, if I go down in order of seniority, I have my friend and colleague Baden Teague. Baden was elected in 1977. I gave a little speech the other night for Baden in which I concluded that he was never really suited to politics. I reached that conclusion because, firstly, he is a gentleman; secondly, he comes from the intelligentsia of our community; thirdly, he is a man with a conscience; and, fourthly, he is committed to advancing public policy, which probably disqualifies most of us. Certainly, Baden, you have demonstrated that the qualities of being a gentleman and of being fair, reasonable and thoughtful, still have a place within Australian politics and we appreciate that contribution that you have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That you have brought to us your intellect has been useful in so many ways. You have always been a thoughtful contributor who has given careful consideration to what he has to say; a man with a very real conscience; a moral man, which does not do any of us any harm, and someone dedicated to public policy. I think of the contributions that Baden Teague has made in areas of foreign policy, particularly in areas of education, and more recently in areas of constitutional reform, which I think might have come to Senator Teague a little late in his parliamentary career. But, if Australia does move to a republic, he will probably be recognised as one of the fathers of that republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate at this time to recognise the work that he has done in so many different areas, those that I have mentioned and those within the Senate itself. He is someone who has always respected and appreciated the Senate committee system and what it can do to contribute to better legislation and appropriate accountability of government. Baden Teague is someone I admire and someone I particularly wish well for in the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, I want to mention Gerry Jones, who has snuck up pretty high on the list now. He came in when I did, elected in 1980. Gerry Jones, from my observation anyway, is actually another gentleman of the Senate. I recognise Gerry's sense of political history; I recognise some of the missions that he has adopted. I think of his attitude to gun control, which is a good lesson to the Australian community. He is someone who really is prepared to put into practice what he believes. I was reminded of the fact that he said that when he retired he believed there was a strong argument that he should be replaced by a woman parliamentarian. We all very easily claim that there should be a better proportion of the sexes in this place but it is another thing to go one step further and try and put it into practice. I acknowledge the work that Gerry Jones has done in the years that he has been here. I think he has been a strong asset to this place and he can be very proud of his contribution also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne came in at the same time. Noel and I came in together; we were the only two Liberals. We had known each other before. We had both had long organisational backgrounds in politics, we had both been party presidents in our respective states, and I guess coming in together and learning the game together we really built quite a close friendship. I have to say that I regret that things ultimately went so wrong and I regret the circumstances in which Noel is now leaving us. Nevertheless, as Noel moves on to the next phase of his life I wish him well in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michael Baume came to us from the House of Representatives, a dogged politician I think I would have to say, someone who has demonstrated since he has been in the Senate how you can extract every opportunity from the Senate practices to advance your political objective. That has been a good lesson to all senators, that this chamber does provide more than adequate opportunities to press a political point of view and, particularly in Michael's case, to ensure to the fullest extent accountability of government and government administration. Michael has given us a lesson since he has been in the Senate as to how to go <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2447"> about that task and use the full opportunities that are open to a senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Very experienced, Michael Baume has contributed to this place in such areas as arts, heritage, sport and youth. He also has considerable experience in the area of health. He retires from politics having contributed at the local electorate level in a marginal seat, knowing the needs of a community and being prepared to service that community as a parliamentarian, and now, at the level of the Senate, recognising the contribution that this chamber can make to better improve the legislative process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will miss his determination and his skills. He did serve, very ably, recently as a parliamentary adviser to our mission in New York. I understand he found himself quite attracted to the city of New York. I do not know whether that is related to his plans for the future, but I am sure that, whatever service he fulfils for the community in the future, he will do it well. So I wish Michael Baume all the best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know Bryant Burns as well, but you do not need to know Bryant Burns well to appreciate his sincerity and his commitment to his roots and to the values that he brings to this place. They are never hidden far from view. Whenever those values are tested within debate or in any other way, Senator Burns is on his feet, and I respect that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is very much a Labor man, committed to traditional Labor ideals, who, as I said, brings a particular set of values and skills to this place which helps us in the sense that we seek to reflect the community as a whole. As the Labor Party has changed over the years towards what I might describe as the technocrats and the intellectuals, I think it is critically important&mdash;though it sounds a bit gratuitous of me, doesn't it, Senator Faulkner?&mdash;that the old Labor men still have a place within the game, and that is important for Australian politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Burns has carried out his Senate functions very professionally&mdash;too professionally one night. I can remember he got very close to throwing me out of a committee when he was chairing it. I thought it was practically impossible to throw someone out <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of a committee, but it was the closest I ever came. I learnt from that that you do not cross Senator Burns when he is in the chair. Senator, I wish you well in your retirement also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert Bell has not been here for so long, coming in 1990. He is a Democrat from Tasmania. He is somebody who is also dedicated to his beliefs. He is not afraid of hard work and makes a lot of sense in what he says. I guess I had most contact with Robert Bell in the education portfolio. I have to say he was well informed and always presented a good argument, even if I did not agree with it on all occasions&mdash;although on some occasions we actually did agree with each other. It was back in the days when, occasionally, the Democrats voted with us.</PARA>

I would not be at all surprised if we see Robert Bell back in the Senate some day in the future. I do not know whether it will be as a Democrat; I am not sure about their future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid Spindler I have known a bit longer because Sid and I&mdash;another Democrat, this time from Victoria&mdash;have been here longer. He was elected in 1990. Senator Spindler and I shared a number of committees over a number of years, particularly in the legal area. He is, I have to say again, a senator who is always dedicated to his views, consistent in his views and a very determined person, but I find that most people who come into politics&mdash;who are prepared to suffer the trauma of getting here and the type of life that it provides&mdash;have a certain steel, and Senator Spindler certainly has that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that he had a little bit of trouble in catching up with the economic realities of the new world, but, nevertheless, I guess there has got to be someone in this place who will never reform and who still believes that tariffs are the answer&mdash;and he will never be convinced otherwise. That is something that we do know about Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2448"> Spindler.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME>
<STATE> (New South Wales&mdash;</STATE>
<ROLE>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate in expressing good wishes to those senators who are retiring. It is a significant number, as we have heard. I would like to say a little about all those who are retiring, in perhaps a slightly different order from the one Senator Hill used. I might deal with opposition senators first and then with the non&hyphen;Labor senators who are retiring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, let me say to you, Mr President, in a personal sense and also from members of the opposition that you have our best wishes on your retirement from this place. I really believe that being President of the Senate is a very difficult role in our parliamentary system. I think it requires more skills than being Speaker of the House of Representatives. You are in the chamber here where no political party has a majority, where neither the government nor the opposition can be absolutely certain how any procedural matter will finally conclude. The pressures on a President of the Senate are very significant, indeed. I believe that you have conducted yourself at all times with very great dignity. You have struggled manfully to improve parliamentary standards in this place. I am not sure that I have always necessarily helped you in this task as I have interjected on one or two occasions that I can recall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a number of years I have been in a very disadvantageous situation in relation to the President. For three years I was Manager of Government Business in the Senate during the life of the Labor administration and I was the nearest senator to you, Mr President. Now, of course, as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, I am just as close. We were musing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2449"> informally this morning that I tend to have a reasonably loud voice. I am sure that is the only reason that you have seen fit on one or two occasions to call me to order for interjections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, you have made a very significant contribution to our party, not only in the parliament but also at an organisational level. I, for one, have a background in machine politics and I appreciate that. Your service to Labor goes not only to your role in this parliament, which has been a very important one, but also to your position as state secretary of the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party. You have played a very influential and key role within the Labor Party at a national level. I certainly acknowledge that and, on behalf of the opposition, I wish you well for the future. I have certainly enjoyed working with you as a member of the Labor caucus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my friend and colleague, Bryant Burns, I am sure we are all going to miss you very much as someone who has been a very forthright and courageous contributor to the Labor caucus. You have made a very valuable contribution since 1987, representing the state of Queensland in the Senate. You are one person who, throughout your parliamentary career, has never forgotten that you had a life before politics and that life before politics had an absolutely dedicated commitment to the principles of the Labor Party and the Labor movement. You have not forgetten that all the time you have been here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were fond of properly reminding the Labor caucus, and, where appropriate, Labor ministers of those fundamental principles. You are also the only retiring Labor senator who is from the same faction of the Labor Party&mdash;the left faction&mdash;that I am a member of. Bryant, I appreciate the personal support that I received throughout the time we worked together in the left of the party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, I think your very strong commitment to our party and the principles that our party stands for, and also the fact that your long and meritorious service in the trade union movement has been important to you, has meant that you have made a very important contribution in this place and in the Labor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> caucus. I know it is appreciated amongst all the Labor senators and members of the House of Representatives. We very sincerely wish you well in your retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Gerry Jones that I had the privilege of working very closely with you for quite a long period. I do not forget the fact that one of the team of government whips at the time was off on an overseas trip. We had a Labor Senate caucus meeting and I made what I think was one of the biggest mistakes of my political life. At the time when we were thinking about who on earth could slip into the role of acting deputy whip for the government, I slipped out the back and made a telephone call to my office. I went to the telephone booth with no position in the parliamentary party; I came out and found I had been unanimously elected in my absence as the acting deputy government whip.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="JONES" NAMEID="LH4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And unopposed, which did not surprise me, I might say. That began a long association of working very closely with you in the whip's office. Throughout that time we developed a very good and close working relationship which I always enjoyed. I think you made a very significant contribution to our party, particularly in your role here as government whip in the Senate. You, too, served in the party machine over a long period. You, too, served in state parliament. Your contribution to our party has extended over a very long period. You have always conducted yourself with very great distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again on behalf of my colleagues that we genuinely appreciate what you have been able to achieve. We appreciate your loyalty to our party and, I am sure, the personal support you have been able to give so many of us in your time as government whip. We genuinely wish you the very best for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other Labor colleague who is retiring is Senator Wheelwright. I noticed that Senator Hill, in very briefly mentioning Senator Wheelwright, said he expected Senator Wheelwright to be back in the parliament at some stage in the future. I, too, expect that that will be the case, and we will see you back in the parliament. You have only had an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2450"> opportunity to be a senator for a very short period. I think you came in in May last year. I know that you also realise how short a period of time that has been. But I also know that you have really enjoyed the time that you have had here. We believe you have made a very important contribution to our caucus, to our Labor Senate team here, and we have really appreciated working closely with you for that all too short amount of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first worked with Tom quite a long time ago. Tom was the education research officer of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party from 1981 to 1984. Those days in the Labor Party were different from what they are now and they were very different days in the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. I do not think I would be telling any secrets, Tom, if I said we were actually in different factions then. I would not be telling any secrets if I said we are in different factions now. But the fact that you and I have been able to work closely together in the period that you have been in the Senate is very clear evidence that our party has changed and evolved since that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think our working relationship back in 1981 was probably a bit rough, frankly, at times. But in the time that you have been in the Senate it has been a very, very good working relationship. Not only have I personally enjoyed working with you; I think we all acknowledge that you have made a very important contribution to our party in both government and opposition. I know that you are keen to serve again in the parliament, so I do not think this will be the last valedictory speech that someone makes in relation to you. I am sure we will see you back here again. I am sure that you will continue your long and distinguished service in support of our party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also a number of non&hyphen;Labor senators retiring. As I did with my colleagues from the Labor Party, let me deal with those non&hyphen;Labor senators in alphabetical order. Senator Bell, you were involved in a very tough election campaign for the final Senate seat in Tasmania. I think it was a real knockdown, drag&hyphen;out fight in the last election for that Senate seat. It was one that was in doubt <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the longest period of time, a tough fight on the ground, and it was a close result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You and Senator&hyphen;elect Brown really went toe to toe, because I think everyone understood at the time that that seat really came down to either you or Senator&hyphen;elect Brown serving in this place for the next term. As we all know, you fell under the line. I know that you are not going to give away your political career or political ambitions as a result of that setback. I can only say to you that from the opposition's perspective you have been a person with whom we have always enjoyed working. I think we always had a very courteous and proper relationship. You have never been backward in coming forward and expressing the views that you hold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have certainly found that even though at times we have not voted the same way and there have been some significant political differences, we have been able to conduct our political debates in a spirited way but also in a very proper and dignified way. I believe you have made a very significant contribution to this place. We wish you well for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chamarette was in a similar political battle that took place in Western Australia. There was a different result in that case. I well remember when Senator Chamarette came into the chamber on the resignation of Senator Vallentine and a couple of the early skirmishes that I had with her in relation to attendance or otherwise at whips meetings and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, in the roles I have played in this place&mdash;as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, particularly, and before that as whip&mdash;I needed to talk a lot to the minor parties and the independent senators in this place. I got to know you very well, Senator Chamarette, over the years that you have been here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not always agreed, as you know. In fact, on many occasions we have disagreed. I hope that our party has been able to talk to you frankly and honestly. I know that the communication we have with you has always been reciprocated in the same spirit. That is appreciated by us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2451">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always thought it interesting, Senator Chamarette, that your background is as what is described as a clinical psychologist. I always thought that must have been of enormous help for someone who was going to be a senator. I do not know what you are planning to do in the future. Your vote has often been very important in this place. You, obviously, have a very high public profile and have become, I think, a very well-known political figure in this country as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether you plan to be a clinical psychologist again, but I am sure that a few years in the Senate must be a tremendous contribution to that career if you intend to pursue it in the future. On behalf of the opposition, we wish you well in the future also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crichton-Browne is retiring. We saw a little earlier in the chamber that perhaps not all is well in the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party. Much of this has become well-known in the public arena.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCHACHT" NAMEID="4J4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator. I can say very honestly that in the time Senator Crichton-Browne was in this chamber he struck me as a senator who had a real grasp of the standing and sessional orders of this place. He was a very effective presiding officer. For some time he was Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. I believe that, throughout the time he held those positions, he was proactive in the role. I think he knew his way around the sessional and standing orders of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always acknowledged that Senator Crichton-Browne has a machine background in the Liberal Party. Machine men in the Liberal Party are little different from machine men in the Labor Party&mdash;or machine operators, if you like. But anyone with that sort of background brings certain skills to a place like this. I think Senator Crichton-Browne often demonstrated those skills in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I do not know what the future holds for Senator Crichton-Browne. I suspect he is still a very influential figure in the Western Aus tralian division of the Liberal Party. I am pretty confident in saying that I am sure he will have a continuing involvement in Western Australian politics. We look forward to seeing how that develops in the future. We wish him well in his future career, whatever it might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sid Spindler is also retiring. Sid, I can honestly say that you have been one of the great contributors in this place. Whenever I come back to my office after having been doing something around this building and see a debate in this chamber, more often than not there is Senator Spindler on his feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid, I will let you in on a secret. When I was the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I found it terribly frustrating that you had so much to say about so many things. I acknowledge the good sense in many of the contributions that you made. But, at times, as we tried to roll the parliamentary program along, it could be a little frustrating. Now I am not frustrated about it at all, and now you are leaving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other senators would also acknowledge Sid's sincerity and the extent of the contribution that he has made in this place and in committees of the Senate. Sid, I know not what you plan to do in your retirement. Whatever it is, I wish you well for the future and hope that you enjoy the times ahead outside this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say to you, Baden Teague, that you are also a person who has really treated the Senate and your responsibilities in this place with a very great degree of seriousness. You have really taken your role as a senator representing the state of South Australia and as a member of the Liberal Party very seriously. You have also been a very significant contributor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very interested to see in recent months that you have made contributions in areas such as your commitment to progressing an Australian republic. You have put views in relation to the future of higher education in this country. Many of the sentiments that you have expressed in those debates are ones that I have shared. I cannot say that I have always shared the sentiments you have expressed in this place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2452">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you are a person who, while putting your views forthrightly, can very rarely be accused of being disorderly. I know that you have had to call me to order on quite a few occasions, but I have very rarely seen you go beyond the invisible line in that respect. We acknowledge what you have been able to achieve in this place and the way that you have put your point of view. We certainly also acknowledge that you have been a very courteous, albeit a very committed, member of your political party. We also wish you well for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also understand that Senator Baume is retiring. I first heard about this by reading it in the paper. Senator Baume is not the first politician to represent his country overseas. It is a very important responsibility for anyone, irrespective of whether they have had a background in politics and parliament. As Senator Hill said in relation to Senator Baume, I am sure that many of us well remember his approach to his parliamentary responsibilities. I think I can say that I will, not the least because of one or two things he said about me this afternoon. Senator Baume is not retiring from public life. His role in New York is an important one not only for him but also for his country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again to you, Mr President, and the other senators who are retiring that this a very significant turnover in the number of senators leaving us at this time. To the 10 senators out of the 76 who sit in this chamber go our best wishes for the future. On behalf of the opposition, we wish you well and thank you for the contribution that you have made.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ROLE>Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are all very mindful that this is the last sitting day for 10 of our senators. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I wish you all well wherever your lives lead you outside this place. While some of you are leaving involuntarily, most of you are probably leaving with some degree of reluctance and regret now that the day has actually come. We all remember when we meet former colleagues just how healthy and happy they look within a very short time of having left this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will begin by paying particular tribute to my two Democrat colleagues, Senator Sid Spindler and Senator Robert Bell. Although we will return in the spring session with two new senators to replace them, today marks a sad day for the Democrats. It is a day of loss for us. As I said last night at a private function when we farewelled Robert and Sid, their departure and the departure of three of their long&hyphen;serving staff members&mdash;Lee Rivers, Bev Irving and Brian Austen&mdash;marks to us the loss of some 45 years of parliamentary experience. For a small party like us, that is a wealth of experience that is not easily replaced. We know that we will sorely miss it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid Spindler retires after six years&mdash;it seems much longer; it is true that we have been around together for a long time&mdash;as the Australian Democrats senator for Victoria. As others have said, it is fair to say that Sid is one person who has passed through this place who can honestly say that he has made a significant difference during his time here. In his six years as a senator, Sid has never once wavered in his commitment to redress inequality, injustice and exploitation. He has battled against this country's decade&hyphen;long obsession with economic rationalism with determination and grit, as others have attested to this evening, with intelligence and energy and with consistency and courage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid has never been afraid to stand up for what others would think might be unpopular causes and issues. He has never been afraid of a good fight. He said to me in the party room yesterday, `I am going to keep trying', even when he knew that nobody else was going to vote for the amendments. He was going to talk to them just one more time. As he said in his own valedictory speech yesterday, a person is defined by one's opponents as much as by one's friends. If that is the case, Sid has much to be proud of on both counts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid was a founding member of the Democrats. Since the very beginning of our party he has played a critical role in its development and growth. He has been a party official, a staffer and a senator. He has been loyal, not just to the Democrats, but to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2453"> notion of a strong and united alternative political force in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid's capacity to work is legendary, and some of that legend will have to remain unsaid. I have to say that I really cannot see Sid retiring in any sense of the word. For a start, he will, as he said yesterday, be taking up a position as chair of the Anti-Slavery Society, a role from which he will be able to pursue matters such as the exploitation of child labour, an issue in which he led this parliament. I am sure there are many other issues Sid does not intend simply to let go by because he is no longer a senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid's greatest contributions, in my opinion, have been in the areas of industry policy, trade and taxation policy, labour exploitation, support for migrants and refugees and pursuing the goal of bringing an end to discrimination based on the grounds of sexuality. In all of these areas, Sid has made a major and significant contribution to national debate. And in all of these areas, I think the years ahead will show that he was a politician who was ahead of his time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps most significant of all is the energy, the passion and the single&hyphen;mindedness with which Sid has opposed intolerance and injustice. It was not always an easy or a popular path to go down. Many of you will know of the famous statement of the Lutheran theologian Martin Niemoller, who said of Germany during the war, `When Hitler attacked the Jews, I was not a Jew; therefore I was not concerned. When Hitler attacked the Catholics, I was not a Catholic; therefore I was not concerned. When Hitler attacked the unions and the industrialists, I was not a member of the unions, and I was not concerned. Then Hitler attacked me and the Protestant Church, and there was nobody left to be concerned.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that sort of apathy and lack of vigilance against which Sid has fought for most of his life. That is why he has stood up for people with whom he does not necessarily personally identify, because, like Martin Niemoller, he knows from personal experience just how short is the distance between a relatively civilised society and the descent into an oppressive and intolerant one.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of all the Democrat senators and on behalf of all our party members, I say to Sid that his long record of opposition to exploitation, discrimination and oppression is one of which he and we are very, very proud. I will miss his intellectual and personal support in the party room. I wanted to put that on the record tonight. We wish him and Julia all the very best for their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Robert Bell leaves the Senate involuntarily, despite recording the Democrats' second highest ever vote in Tasmania. He, too, leaves behind a strong record of action on a diverse range of issues, many of which reflect his great love for and commitment to his home state. Robert is truly passionate about Tasmania, about its people and its industries and about its economic and environmental potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That enthusiasm for all things Tasmanian, combined with the fact that he genuinely believes in getting out and talking to his community&mdash;his mobile office is a very good example of that&mdash;has led Robert to be one of the most effective representatives that that state has had for a long time, and I think Tasmanians will miss him. I think they will come to wish he was still in the Senate speaking out on their behalf. I think they will come to appreciate the value of having a representative who is not focused on a single issue or limited spectrum of issues, but who understands and cares about the wellbeing of Tasmania as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to imply that Robert's contribution has been limited to Tasmanian matters. He has also made a major contribution in many other areas&mdash;in particular, his record in opposing the dumping of toxic waste, in opposing woodchipping in native forests, in speaking out against the use and effects of hazardous industrial chemicals and in raising the dangers from electromagnetic radiation. These are all issues where Robert has led national debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As our education spokesperson, he has led the Democrats' fight against fees for higher education and against fees in state schools. He has been a vigorous defender of the Australian state school system. He has also been one of the strongest advocates local government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2454"> has had in this place. Perhaps most importantly, Robert has always been true to the philosophy of which he spoke when he gave his first speech in the Senate six years ago. The `Ringarooma Kid' told the Senate of his time as a teacher at the Friends School in Hobart and how much he admired the Friends' philosophy of a gentle, caring, humble and humanitarian concern for all people as equals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert is a living, breathing example of that philosophy. That is a great credit to him. It may not have helped him win an election, but it says a lot about the sort of person he is, and why we will miss him. On behalf of the Democrats, I extend our very best wishes and thanks to Robert and Jane, and Sally and Christopher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something briefly too about our other colleagues who are retiring. Firstly, to Senator Christabel Chamarette. Senator, I do not need to tell you that we have not always seen eye to eye&mdash;often on matters of process&mdash;but I have to say that native title was truly, spectacularly, Cecil B. De Mille memorable. Even though we have not always seen eye to eye, the Democrats respect your commitment to social justice and the environment. We thank you for your support on a wide range of issues, support which I trust you feel has been reciprocated on occasions. We wish you well for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Senator Michael Beahan, on behalf of the Democrats, I extend my thanks for your time as President of the Senate. We really appreciate that you have always been approachable and even-handed, and that you have carried out your duties fairly and honestly. That has been a very difficult task, particularly in the last few months.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mainly one. We have often wondered and said to Senator Teague, `What are you doing in the Liberal Party?' We were glad to have the opportunity to have that conversation with you in our party room yesterday. We trust that your liberation from this place will enable you to pursue more freely those interests which are close to your heart, particularly your passion for seeing Australia become a republic&mdash;a passion that we share.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Senator Noel Crichton-Browne, if he is listening, we want to say that you too did credit to the position of Deputy President when you occupied it. You were fair and impartial and conducted yourself with dignity. We thank you for that. My best wishes go to you and your family in surviving what I think was a pretty tough year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My major memory of Senator Michael Baume is that he has spoken on more reports in this place than anybody else. We recognise his passionate commitment to the arts and other cultural pursuits. I guess most people remember him for his interesting taste in pig ties and his pursuit of porkies. We wish him well in his New York appointment and hope that he is glad to leave his preoccupation with pigs behind him once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was reminded today of when Senator Bryant Burns and I shared the charter of a small plane to western Queensland for one of the rural rallies and how a certain Senator Ian Macdonald gave a very vocal account of himself at that rally. I remember that we were a pretty good team act on that occasion&mdash;a most unlikely pairing I thought, having never had much of a conversation with Senator Burns before. But in the words of one of my colleagues, `For an old metal worker and a leftie, Senator Burns had an admirable commitment to all things rural.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2455"> I always thought Senator Gerry Jones was such a cheerful person for a whip. He is so calm and has such necessary qualities. I know a little of Senator Jones's personal circumstances and his responsibilities to his grandchildren, for which he has my deep admira tion. I wish Gerry and Rita a most rewarding next phase of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tom Wheelwright was here for such a short time, that is true. I think you have made a vigorous and intelligent contribution to the economic debate in this chamber. You were never afraid to challenge some of that comfortable rhetoric that your party moved into in recent years. I admire you for that. When you say, as you did 10 times, `This is not my last speech,' I really believe you. I hope you will be back here, but not at the expense of any New South Wales Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, from a personal perspective, I extend my deep thanks and my deep wishes to Sid Spindler, Robert Bell and their staff&mdash;Lee Rivers, Bev Irving, Brian Austen and Leonie Godridge. I warn all of them not to look too healthy and happy when next I see them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join in the valedictory debate and make a contribution on behalf of my National Party colleagues. Tonight we are farewelling 10 senators. Some are retiring involuntarily and some are retiring voluntarily. The President, Baden Teague, Michael Baume, Gerry Jones, Bryant Burns, Sid Spindler, Robert Bell, Christabel Chamarette, Tom Wheelwright and Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne are all leaving us tonight. Some have been here a long time. Baden Teague has been here since 1977 and, at the other end of the spectrum, Senator Wheelwright has only been here for a short time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose it is a day that we all have to face sooner or later. It would be a day of mixed feelings&mdash;sadness, regret, nostalgia and, perhaps, relief&mdash;when you walk out of the chamber for last time, as you will tomorrow, and leave this place. I hope you will all leave with happy memories and positive feelings for the Senate. I know that many friendships are forged in this place. While the friendship may not be personal friendship between the different parties, I know that we all get on well together when we are out of this chamber. There are a few exceptions, as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Leader of the Democrats alluded to in her speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I extend my best wishes to you, Mr President. In my opinion, you have been a good and fair President. I think that the chamber owes you a vote of thanks. You have been the President for over 2&half; years&mdash;in good times and rough times. There have been a few rough times. You have kept a cool head. You have tried to keep rulings fair and give both sides of the house a fair go. You entered the Senate in 1987. You were the victim of pre&hyphen;selection in Western Australia. It seems to happen a lot in Western Australia. It must be something in the water. You have served on numerous committees. You have earned your place as President of the Senate and you can go out with pride. You have done a good job over the last 2&half; years. I wish you well in your retirement in the beautiful state of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Michael Baume leaves us tonight. He will be continuing in public office. I am not sure whether his position is official as yet. Whether you agree with Senator Baume or not, you have to admire his absolute tenacity for standing up in here and never taking a backward step. I know that he got under the skin of the Labor Party when in government, but I suppose an effective politician is one who has the tenacity to keep coming back all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ever there was a tenacious politician, I think Senator Baume has earned that reputation. He was in the lower house from 1975 until 1983 and he came here later on. He has been a great contributor on all matters. As someone else said, he has been up on many reports and has certainly contributed to many debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baden Teague has to be acknowledged as the gentleman of parliament. I don't think I have ever heard Baden Teague say an unkind word to anyone about anyone. That is an unusual attribute in here. Baden, you are a Christian and you practise Christianity in the true sense of the word&mdash;you never say anything bad about anyone. I hope that you do not succeed in your endeavours to make Australia a republic and I will be opposing you in every way, but I also admire your <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2456"> commitment to that strategy. I cannot quite understand why you have it. Maybe in the fullness of your retirement you will sit down and explain to me what is good about a republic. I will be prepared to listen.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gerry Jones, my Queensland colleague, joined the Senate in 1980. He was born in a country town in Queensland and served for one term in the state parliament, where he was an angry young man. He has mellowed into a different person now. He was the state MLA for Everton from 1972 to 1974, when the Labor Party went through one of the most troubled periods in Queensland. I believe he was also the state secretary there for a number of years. Gerry, I have never heard you say a cross word about anyone. You have always had a very cheery disposition and I think you have served this parliament well. It must have been difficult to be the government whip, as Senator Panizza is now finding, and trying to get the legislation through. I think you had a bit more help than we have had lately. Gerry, we wish you all the best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a comment on Senator Kernot's comment that we acknowledge what you have done for your grandchildren. I have always admired you for taking charge in those difficult times. We say to you and your wife: have a long and happy retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bryant Burns, elected in 1987, born in Rockhampton, is one of those rare commodities in the Labor Party&mdash;Senator Lundy is another one&mdash;a person who actually used Solvol on their hands, a worker who wears that tag with pride. Senator Burns is a man who has actually picked up a tool. He is a former stockman, boilermaker and unionist; and he was a trade union official of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Burns came down here, for the first four or five weeks he was very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aggressive with everyone, particularly anyone in the National Party. After the first four or five weeks Senator Burns mellowed and he was always very friendly around the parliament. We have travelled on committees together&mdash;in fact, we went into the heart of National Party country at one stage, into Kingaroy. I have been on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island committees with him. My notation says, `Quintessential representative of the old style, blue&hyphen;collar worker and the Labor Party'. Senator Burns, you can wear that tag with pride. You have never forgotten your roots. You have stood up for the working class people and I wish you all the best in your retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Wheelwright: as Senator Hill said, I don't think we should farewell you. I think you are going to be back. Whether it be in this place or the other place, you have got parliament marked all over you. You like it and you will not walk away from it. So it is not goodbye but just goodbye for a short time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid Spindler: Sid, while you live, McEwenism will never die. I would class myself as not an economic rationalist, but I think you go a lot further than I would on the issue. I think you would be 30 years behind McEwenism. Things move on but you are entitled to your opinion. You have pushed that opinion vigorously in the parliament and I know that you go because of ill health. When someone said you had been here six years, I thought I couldn't imagine this place without you. It seems to be indelibly imprinted on my mind that Sid Spindler has been here for a longer time than six years.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, maybe that is right. I can remember Senator Bell's first speech, where he informed us that his first brush with public life was when he won the radish growing competition at school. I think he thought that made him an expert on primary industries. Rob, you have been a great friend and colleague. You have always given us the support we needed in rural and primary industry debates. Our views vary a bit on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2457"> some of the social issues, and we disagree on some of the environmental issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken to you since the election and know that you are committed to re-entering this place. It was a hard fight, as the previous speaker mentioned. It was the hardest head&hyphen;to&hyphen;head battle between the Greens and the Democrats in Tasmania. It was always going to be a difficult fight for you against such a high profile candidate as Senator&hyphen;elect Brown, but I expect to see you back some time. We will certainly see you in some parliament, whether it be here or in Tasmania. You have made a contribution to education and many other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For as long as I live, I, too, will remember Senator Chamarette for the Mabo debate. That will always be the height of political debates. I have never seen such twists and turns. As I have said before, it reminded me of a tin of spaghetti. No-one knew where anyone was going for four or five days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have an interesting background&mdash;born in 1948 in India and a clinical psychologist and community worker. You have been a battler for the underdog and for the Aboriginal community. You leave this place with my best wishes, and I hope you have a happy retirement also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Noel Crichton-Browne was elected in 1980&mdash;about three years before I came here. He was Deputy President and Chairman of Committees from 1993 to 1995. He has held a variety of offices with the Liberal organisation. Noel was always very friendly to me. In fact, at certain times we were neighbours, it being that our offices adjoined. I say to Noel that politics is unkind, it is hard, it is tough. Very few people escape politics without taking a few knocks and without a few scars. It has been a hard two years for you, and I wish you a retirement where you can relax and refocus your life. I wish you all the best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, this is a time of mixed feelings. For some it is both a sad time and a happy time. For many people there is sadness that they are leaving their friends in their political party. For some people it will be a relief. But I hope all of the people who are leaving the Senate tomorrow will remember the happy years, the friends they have made, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the victories and losses they have had. Keep those memories with you throughout a long and happy retirement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening on behalf of the Greens (WA). I know that in normal circumstances the leaders rise on this occasion. People would realise that in the Greens we do not have leaders, and that is an important part of our process. It is in greening the process that Christabel has exemplified that. In her time in the Senate she has made a very important contribution, which, from what I hear tonight, will be memorable. I believe the most important function tonight is that those people who are leaving will have a chance to make their last remarks, so I am not going to take up too much of the Senate's time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Senator Michael Baume, Mr President&mdash;Senator Michael Beahan, Senator Robert Bell, Senator Bryant Burns, Senator Noel Crichton-Browne, Senator Gerry Jones, Senator Sid Spindler, Senator Baden Teague and Senator Tom Wheelwright&mdash;travel well. I hope that when you are away from the Senate there is a healing process of any of the damage it may have done and you find that any of the joys you got from this place continue throughout your life and help in whatever path you decide to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take just a few minutes to honour my colleague. As I mentioned, Christabel's contribution here is in greening the process. We have had talks tonight about gentlemen of the Senate. I am not quite sure what `gentlemen' means, although sometimes gentlemen turn somewhat other when women disagree. Christabel will leave us as the great anarchist of the Senate. Some people take that as a term of insult. In the Greens we take that as a great honour. The true meaning of `anarchist' is a person who devolves power to the community, and that is what Christabel has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I joined Christabel in the Senate, we found that we shared the balance of power. People tried to find names for us to try to belittle the contribution that the Greens made to the Senate process, so they called us such names as the `gumnut twins'. We appropriated the term and wore it proudly. Christabel <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2458"> has left me in awe on many occasions with her ability, her determination and her courage. Nobody could say that was not in evidence during the native title debate and in all the great debates in which she has participated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to pay tribute to Christabel's staff, because none of us are what we are without the people behind us&mdash;to Theo, to Bryan, to Andrew, who was our shared staff member, to Franci, to Jacqui and Cathcart, and to many of the people who, as they say, came to help and stayed, like Rosemary and Libby. They also appreciate the courage, determination and sheer hard work of Christabel, as do the Greens (WA).</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is an informal agreement that the retiring senators will now speak in turn and that I will open up for them. I was going to start by washing the Solvol off my hands, but I won't. It is an interesting phenomenon that the length of service of senators is becoming shorter. If you look at the statistics of the last five decades and the average years of service of those senators elected, you will see that from 1941 to 1950 it was 12.4 years; 1951 to 1960, 13.7 years; 1961 to 1970, 11.4 years; 1971 to 1980, 10.7 years; and&mdash;get this&mdash;1981 to 1990, 6.3 years; and I think it is still going down. So my time of nine years in the Senate, although it seems very short to me, is above average based on recent trends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came to the Senate in 1987 with a fairly cynical view of its role. As one of those with strong and bitter memories of 1975, I was no enthusiastic supporter of the Senate. However, while I still believe that the Senate should not have the right to block supply, I do have a greater respect for it as an increasingly effective and necessary check on the power of the executive&mdash;any executive. I believe the Senate is developing and refining its role as a house of review and that, while petty politics frequently distract it from an effective use of its powers, much useful work is done in scrutinising and critically appraising the decisions and activities of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Among the more rewarding aspects of my time here as a backbencher has been the committee work that I have been involved in. Most of my involvement has been in refer ence aspects of committee work because the legislative aspect was not as significant before I became President. I was also involved in chairing a number of estimates committees, which kept me up very late at night on a number of occasions&mdash;I think one of my committees broke the record for the length of sitting in one session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I chose at that time to focus on joint committees. I still believe that these are the best vehicle for the reference function of committees, because I think the breadth of representation brings with it a breadth of perspective. I was a member, for example, of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which I believe is one of the best committees in this parliament. I was a member of its trade and human rights subcommittees. I must say that I am appalled that there is talk of the human rights subcommittee being absorbed into the foreign affairs committee. I think the human rights subcommittee has done very good and widely respected work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very good; it would have sent a very bad signal around the world. I am very glad, if that decision has been made. I was also a member of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters over a number of years. That committee did a great deal of useful work in refining and improving the electoral system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was the founding chairman of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, along with Senator Spindler and Senator Cooney and others. We were able to carve out in that early period a role for this committee, essentially charged with the oversight of the operation of corporate law. I believe that the committee has done much in a very quiet but useful way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also proud of the fact that I was a member of the Senate employment, education and training committee when it tabled its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Education for active citizenship</EMPHASIS>. I believe that was a very useful activity for that committee, with very positive outcomes. It was useful because it was dealing with a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2459"> discrete, manageable topic including a plan for the implementation of recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an example of how a Senate committee can have considerable influence in leading debate in the community. It created a round of debate within the community which lasted for some time. It was followed by a second report, which reviewed that debate and took it a stage further. Then we saw the establishment of the Civic Experts Group, with a report by that group, and finally the funding commitments made by government to the whole area of civics education, which I hope will be honoured by the new government, because it is a very important area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the best parts of committee work was the camaraderie involved in it. You are forced together, working towards common goals, usually finding consensus, travelling together and getting to know each other well. Some of the firmest friendships on both sides of the chamber I have made have been through the committee work and through overseas travel when I have gone on delegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a great honour to be elected President of the Senate in February 1994. I suppose it is not surprising that many people outside this parliament&mdash;and I suspect a few inside&mdash;view the role of President simply in terms of chairing question time. This is, as senators here know, thankfully a very small part of a much more complex job. The other elements of the job I have found very rewarding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Administrating the four departments, for example, three of them together with the Speaker, is a demanding, time consuming but most enjoyable task. The multimillion dollar budget and large, highly skilled and varied staff provide plenty of challenges. It is like a small ministry, which is where I really would have liked to have been, so it was a part I enjoyed very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased in the role that, with the support of the Speaker and others, I was able to introduce the art acquisition program to redress an imbalance that was created by the  budget cuts of a former Western Australian minister to the art collection. There was almost no Western Australian art, very little <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Queensland art, no urban Aboriginal art, and very little Northern Territory art. We set about redressing that imbalance, first of all, then maintaining the collection as a living collection and not one that was rooted in 1988 as a static, dead collection, and, finally, honouring the integrity of the original concept, which was to do just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed that I was unable to finish the job of creating a unified corporate identity for the parliament. There are a multiplicity of images going out of this place&mdash;in the form of letterheads, booklets and all sorts of things&mdash;which give a very confused image of what this whole place is about. It makes it very hard to choose, if you are getting gifts made, what emblem to put on them because we do not have an emblem that really represents this place. That is work that was started but will probably be aborted at this stage because of cost. I hope, Senator Reid, that you can pick that up at some stage in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also would have liked to have made two minor changes for which I could not muster sufficient support. I refer firstly to Prayers. I believe the Prayers in our standing orders are an archaic and anachronistic form of words that really should be changed. I believe that the South Africans have the best idea with a minute's contemplative silence. That appeals to all faiths, or non&hyphen;faiths. Or you could have an evocative poem, or something like that. But I could not get support for that idea so the change was not possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same applies to wigs and gowns. While I think that the staff would very much like to rid themselves of this outmoded garb, as the Federal Court has, I again could not find support for that change. I was pleased, however, with the introduction of saner and more healthy hours, which I hope you will retain in the new sessional orders, Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third role, the ceremonial and protocol role, I thought would be stiff, starchy and formal&mdash;and some of it is&mdash;but most of it has been rewarding and interesting. It is rather like being an ambassador for the parliament. That is what trains us so well for ambassadorial positions if our side happens to win <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2460"> government. Just remember that I am well trained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of this role involves representing the parliament overseas. While overseas trips for members and senators are often seen as perks of office and as junkets, they are a very important part of parliamentary activity, particularly with the advent of a globalised economy and the increasing interdependence of nation states. They are also important in fostering greater understanding of cultural and other differences between people, in supporting and furthering the government's foreign policy and trade interests&mdash;which do not vary much between governments; we are reasonably bipartisan on those things&mdash;and to selling Australia overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made this the focus of my visits overseas. I have made the point strongly wherever I have gone that Australia is no longer simply the distant woolshed, granary or quarry that it once was; that we are indeed a clever country, increasingly involved in elaborately transformed manufacturing and in industries involving cerebral rather than muscular activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am dismayed when I and other presiding officers still have trouble convincing the bureaucracy that there are some tangible benefits in presiding officers leading delegations. Rightly or wrongly, access for presiding officers in many countries is greater than for ministers or parliamentary secretaries. Our foreign affairs posts find it much easier to organise high level appointments for delegations if they are led by presiding officers. They invariably report their gratitude for the access and opportunities this gives them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was that on various visits, either with delegations or on my own, I met, for example, with Vice&hyphen;President Gore in the USA, President Salinas in Mexico, King Hussein in Jordan, King Juan Carlos in Spain, the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Israel, President Rafsanjani in Iran, President Mandela and deputy presidents Thabo Mbeki and F. W. de Klerk in South Africa, Vice&hyphen;President Miyanda in Zambia, former President Kaunda recently, and with many others. I hope, Senator Reid, that you do not have to fight the same battles that I and the previous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Speaker had to fight to convince the bureaucracy of our value in helping them do the job better. That is what it amounts to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the chamber&mdash;I have already intimated this&mdash;I cannot say that it has been the most enjoyable part of my job. But, as I have already said, it is only a small part. It is not that I object to some passion and fire in the proceedings of the Senate, particularly at question time&mdash;which has become a sort of jousting pit for opposition and government more than a place where information is seriously sought and expected to be received&mdash;but I do urge senators to ponder the effect of the often low level and crude interchanges which have become all too frequent. It is not a question of comments being unparliamentary in a strictly technical sense; it is simply inappropriate in the national parliament to speak in this way&mdash;and it is hated by the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time there is a noisy question time, there are a large number of calls to my office, and following that there are a large number of letters that come to the office, which all get replied to in detail. Every time I speak to community groups about the role of the Senate President, that is the constant call&mdash;the people just hate it, they cannot understand it at all, and it is having a very damaging effect on us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that&mdash;I do not think I am overstating this&mdash;it is one of the major factors in the low standing of MPs and senators, because the televising of question time is the most visible part of the parliament. I find particularly objectionable the very personal attacks made in question time in the preamble to questions, in answers and in interjections, but also in other debates at other times. The Senate, honestly, would be a much better place if we stuck to the issues&mdash;as some people do, I must say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2461"> While not in any way wishing to curb the freedom of senators to probe the activities of those in positions of power and to demand proper behaviour and accountability, I also believe that we should bear in mind clause 9 of our own resolution on parliamentary privilege agreed to in 1988. It enjoins us all to, among other things, `exercise [our] valu able right of freedom of speech in a responsible manner' and, secondly, `have regard to the rights of others'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of this I think the Senate has placed the President in an impossible situation, given the multi-party nature of the Senate, with no clear majority for any party. I am frequently called upon to throw people out, and people outside cannot understand why I do not do this. But senators know that I am effectively rendered incapable of doing this by procedures in our standing orders which make it effectively impossible. I do not have a standing order 304A like they do in the House of Representatives, the so-called sin bin. Nor can I call, as they do in the House of Representatives, under standing orders 303 and 304, for a direct and immediate vote of the Senate to expel a senator. In the end, even if I do go through the long and almost impossible processes that we have under our standing orders, I do not know whether I have the numbers to support me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If senators want to give the President workable powers of sanction, they should amend the standing orders to bring them into line at least with those in the other place. But, as I have said many times before, this should not be necessary. Senators should, in the interests of the standing of the Senate and the parliament, apply appropriate standards to themselves without the need for external sanction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I apologise, Senators, for ending on such a didactic note. It is not the way I actually feel. While I am sad at the termination of this part of my career&mdash;and it is only the termination of this part of my career; I have got plenty of working life left&mdash;I also feel elated, both at the opportunities which lie ahead and at the prospect of freeing myself from the shackles and constraints of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also feel very privileged to have had the opportunity to have served as a senator for the last nine years. I thank the people of Western Australia for their support. I thank the Labor Party. While I have good reason to be angry with a number of people in the party in relation to my preselection, I still retain a high respect and affection for the party, which is both older and stronger than some of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who rise to power from time to time within it. I will continue to support it, and it is inevitably true that, without the Labor Party, I would not have had this experience which I so value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank my Perth staff, Peter McKerrow, Lesley Grill and Ian Thomson, who do such wonderful work for me and for the party, and my Canberra staff, Fred Peppinck, Frank Nugent, Derek Abbott&mdash;who was there before Frank&mdash;Deborah Walsh, Kathleen Griffiths, Sue English, Gordon Kirschner and, before him, Harry Menzies. They are all loyal and dedicated staff. But I pay special attention to Anne Neary, who has been with me now for 13 years as my personal assistant and who runs just about everything around here, certainly in the party sense but also she has found her way into the parliament and seems to run much of that now too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, and your team. I think you display a very high level of professionalism and, I must say, total and absolute loyalty&mdash;whether to me or to this position, I do not know, but I like to think both. You are champions of the Senate. That is a legitimate role which you carry out well. I think you deserve credit for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the officers and staff of all the other departments: the Joint House Department, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the Department of the Library. We have a very professional group of people we have in this parliament&mdash;from the gardeners to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> editors, from library researchers to finance clerks, from maintenance workers to attendants and guides, to the transport officers who look after our daily needs to get to and from home. I have become very proud of them all and made many friends among them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my fellow departing senators: Senators Baume, Bell, Burns, Chamarette, Crichton-Browne, Jones, Spindler, Teague and Wheelwright, I wish you all well and look forward to joining you as former senators at some stage. It has been a great privilege to have had the opportunity to serve as a senator and as President of the Senate, which, for strange reasons and at a reduced salary, I retain until 20 August. I thank you all and look forward <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2462"> to maintaining contact with the many friends I have made in this place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`I would rather go a little early than stay a little too long'. That is the way I began announcing in this chamber a year and a half ago that I would not be contesting the March 1996 election. I have no regrets, I have the more enthusiasm for going on to new activities, starting on Monday. I wish to say that the 18 years I have spent in the Senate has been a pleasure for me and a great privilege to represent the people of South Australia, to contribute to national policy debates and to get to know so closely not only most of the senators who are now serving but many over the 18 years that I have been here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time has come for me to pursue with more focus some writing and research interests that I have had for many years and, like leaving school, like leaving university, like leaving my work on the staff of the University of Adelaide, I now leave the Senate thankful for excellent opportunities and looking forward with great vigour to the next phase. I am certainly not going to retire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One task that I wish to take up is to write a book about Australia's relations with our APEC partners and the initiatives we need to take in foreign affairs, trade and regional security to safeguard Australia's prosperity in peace. In particular, I want to write a book about China, including my own experiences there over the last 28 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also see it as another challenge for my wife Kathy and I to attempt to write a comprehensive history of my own state, South Australia, and to build upon all that has been published about the development of our state and its distinctive characteristics as an exciting part of Australia. I look forward also to contributing to the universities in my own city, and I have been glad to have been involved in pretty well all the education debates over the last decade or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been elected these last six months to be on the Council of the University of Adelaide and I look forward to an academic association with Flinders University in an honorary capacity. I will be involved with any <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education matters that need my services in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I announced that I would not be contesting the last election, I said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will continue to pursue the political principles and policies that I have advocated within the Liberal Party and the Commonwealth parliament. Among those principles are truth and justice, compassion, excellence, practical commonsense, equality of opportunity and the Australian sense of a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to these words. They mean a lot to me, and I know that they mean a lot to all of us. No one of us has a monopoly on any of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the careful, heartfelt remarks of Senator Margetts for her close colleague, and the meaning that she invests in that, and of Senator Kernot for her two close colleagues Sid Spindler and Robert Bell, again taking up some of these words. Similarly, there were the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) about his colleagues, and Senator Hill's kind references to not only those of us on this side but indeed all of us who are retiring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Boswell said that the years ahead will give room for some of the hurts of this place to be healed. I have to say, very carefully, that you have been all so kind to me that the hurts I have suffered here have been outnumbered by a great sense of victory&mdash;100 to one. The hurts that I have suffered have rarely lasted till the next morning. I do not have any sense of offence from anyone in this place, and I have a great deal of friendship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For me, who happens to be on the liberal and reforming side of my party, I am amongst the most loyal to the party. I seek to continue to contribute to my party, the Liberal Party. It was formed the year I was born, 1944, and I will not be giving up on putting forward my point of view in the forums of the party, at least in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, with the new energy of starting a new career at my relatively young age, I actually feel sufficient energy and young enough to return in some years to this parliament, perhaps as Prime Minister. I will not be looking to be here, but if I do see some national need in the future, particularly five <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2463"> or seven years away, I will be back. I say, in principle, I am ready to come back.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly my support for an Australian head of state remains undiminished, and I will enjoy the wider freedom of the coming years to go on in step with the Australian people to achieve this historic change to the Australian constitution. I also hope, as many from this place have done, to make a positive contribution to Aboriginal reconciliation in this country. I happen to believe with the psalmist:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof: Commit your way to the Lord and He will direct your path.</PARA>
<PARA>Saint Paul has added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the God of grace and peace will be with you.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the areas I will miss is constituents. I know that it makes for a lot of hard work and that patience is sometimes needed, but thousands of constituents have come to all of us, not least to me in these 18 years. I gained a great deal of enjoyment in trying to gain some justice or solution to those who have come to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have valued mixing in every area of the community in South Australia, both in the city and the countryside, and I will continue to do this with my wife as we attempt&mdash;maybe it is a 10&hyphen;year task&mdash;to write a history of the development of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have thoroughly enjoyed my involvement in the Liberal Party. Right from the beginning, within a few months of joining, I was invited to nominate for an election to the state executive, and I eventually became the policy coordinator of the party. I served for more than 20 years on the state council of the party, and I have been in endless federal election campaigns. I was once president of the Sturt campaign, was campaign manager for Hindmarsh, and contributed to campaigns in Adelaide and Kingston&mdash;often in Kingston&mdash;and in other seats, including Grey, Boothby and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My involvement with the party leads me to the view that, whilst I will have irritations from time to time and I will not always have my argument accepted, the great majority of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Liberal Party members in my state are of the salt of the earth&mdash;wonderful citizens of this country&mdash;and we, in the political process, need to recognise that there are bona fide genuine Australians in every political party in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to refer to a few of the activities that I have been privileged to be involved in here in Canberra. To have been for many years a member of the Senate Privileges Committee, which I see as the leading committee of this chamber, and to have then been, for a period, chairman of that committee, is a great honour. To have served with those who are now there with me is a great pleasure. I see in the chamber Senator Childs, Senator Coates, Senator Ray, who has succeeded me as chairman, Senator Knowles and Senator Panizza; and there have been a number of others. There have been some 50 reports that I have participated in, and the secretary to the committee, Anne Lynch, is thoroughly professional and a great friend to the Senate. I will miss Anne and all of the members of the Privileges Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the Privileges Committee as undergirding democracy in this country, ensuring that there are rights for citizens that cannot be trampled upon and ensuring their access to the parliament and that there are rights for elected members of parliament to go about the democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second area is Aboriginal affairs. Throughout my time here I have tried to speak for justice and for the rights of the Aboriginal people of this country. I served as an undergraduate as the director of the Aboriginal scholarship scheme, and when I first arrived here I found myself on a committee in the Fraser government period with Alan Missen, Neville Bonner, who became a lifelong friend, Kathy Sullivan, Phil Ruddock and others. I have, for more than 20 years, been a good friend of Charles Perkins, Lois O'Donoghue and many other Aboriginal leaders who I count as part of my family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to visit the Pitjantjatjara communities as often as I could, perhaps a dozen times during my time in this parliament. At one stage my wife and I had begun to learn Pitjantjatjara. Certainly, Joshua, my son, who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2464"> is in the gallery, has travelled with us as well to the Pitjantjatjara many times from when he was a very small boy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I served for five years on the Council of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. From the outset I supported the Mabo decision and I support reconciliation with all of its objectives. I believe it is possible to gain assent to that proposition from all of us, as we go about this as constructively as we can, consulting with the people of Australia as much as we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the foci of my time in Senate committees have been education, science, the arts and communications. I was chairman of the Senate education committee and of the coalition's policy committee on education. I was acting shadow minister for seven of our shadows during the Hawke and Keating period and was involved in the debates. Robert Bell knows that we were able to move and gain majority support in the Senate for many education motions and amendments to legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For three years I was on the Council of the National Library of Australia under the chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen&mdash;and thoroughly enjoyed it. Another area which has been at times very contentious is immigration. I was chairman of the coalition committee on immigration and ethnic affairs. It was called ethnic affairs then but we now rightly refer to it as multicultural affairs in the ministry that Phillip Ruddock represents. I was a foundation member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Immigration Regulations in Robert Ray's period as minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a gigantic debate arising from various events in August 1988. I was in the thick of it and I am very proud of the arguments I put during that year, in particular in that month, within my own party and throughout the nation&mdash;and we have a multicultural Australia. I will continue to support it. That victory has been understood by my party and, I think, by the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the time I have been here I have been really excited to be involved in foreign affairs, defence and trade. One of the consolations of being in opposition for 13 years&mdash;I have to say that losing five elections is no <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way to go&mdash;is that you can apply yourself to the detail of national policy debate in an area like foreign affairs, defence and trade, and are able to be sufficiently free to go on parliamentary delegations to pretty well everywhere in the world and to learn from that and bring the knowledge back to the advantage of Australia. It has been my pleasure to have had more than my fair share of those involvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the time I have been in the Senate we have seen the end of the Cold War, a more effective United Nations, the end to apartheid, China's open door policy from 1979, democracy return in Latin America, the establishment of APEC and much greater stability in Indo&hyphen;China, with developments in Vietnam and Cambodia. Australia has played a part in it and parliamentary debate has played a part in it. I have fond memories of contributing to many reports and debates in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Committee work has also been a great opportunity for all senators. I value very much the more than 100 reports that we have written&mdash;a whole library of material with recommendations, in my case mostly bipartisan. I believe in the mirror of the argument and that you can win, even if you are in a minority or in opposition, if you do the homework and if you put down the reasons why your conclusion should guide the public policy of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer in particular to just half a dozen of those reports: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A national language policy for Australia</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Peace and disarmament in the nuclear age</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Latin America</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sexual harassment in the Australian Defence Force</EMPHASIS> and, only yesterday, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia&hyphen;China relations</EMPHASIS>. There have been others of which I am very pleased to have been a part. They relate to human rights, India, the United States of America, Russia's perestroika, Japan's defence policy, Burma, Bosnia and so on. I thank senators who have participated with me in those committees. They have become firm friends through the processes of our meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to give my thanks to scores of members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I acknowledge Senator Evans <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2465"> and his predecessors; and Mr Downer, the current foreign minister, who have given me, as one senator, enormous access to the department, both here in Canberra and in all our posts overseas. I have many friends throughout the department, again on the basis of the mirror of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank Australian ambassadors overseas in many countries. I will only mention those in China: Ross Garnaut, David Sadlier and Michael Lightowler&mdash;whom it has been a pleasure to work with. There are about 80 ambassadors in Canberra representing overseas countries. For many years now I have exchanged Christmas cards with all of them and have got to know all of them in literally hundreds, maybe thousands, of receptions&mdash;some of them very well, through our discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an honour for me that the President of Chile gave me their highest honour. I will wear that proudly, as I did the other day at the Queen's birthday reception, I think for the first time&mdash;some thought I should be wearing it right now. I certainly appreciate it as a symbol of the dialogue that many of us seek to carry out positively, in Australia's interest, with representatives of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to thank the Senate staff who have really contributed positively and professionally to my time here in the Senate; most of all to Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, and to Anne Lynch, the Deputy Clerk. I also thank Rosemary Laing, Cleaver Elliott, Peter O'Keeffe, John Vander Wyk and Terry Brown, with all of whom I have had many associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the library staff, especially John Brudenall, June Verrier, Andrew Chin, Michael Ong, and all of those in the foreign affairs, defence and trade area; in Hansard, John Templeton, Bernie Harris, in particular, and all the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters; the attendants, led by Alan Platt, and all the attendants in this chamber and around the building. Your service is acknowledged by us and we thank you very sincerely. Alan, I still remember my 10 years in the chamber in the old Parliament House and your great concern for that chamber&mdash;and your even greater concern, if I can put it that way, for this chamber.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank those in the Parliamentary Education Office, with which I have been involved throughout its existence; and the Parliamentary Relations Office, as I was on the executive of the CPA, the IPU, the APPF and the PGA. They facilitated my overseas travel enormously. I also wish to acknowledge the friendship and service of the Black Rod, Robert Alison, and the Secretary of the Joint House Department, Michael Bolton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I calculate I have had about 10,000 Commonwealth car journeys and the drivers have been absolutely superb. In the Senate Transport Office, Bruce Greentree and Kearen Finn, being those who currently coordinate that, are superb in the personal service they give to senators. I think I have had about 3,000 air journeys and there is always a Commonwealth car waiting at the other end, whether it is Adelaide or Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I will refer to my own staff and then to the departing senators. I wish to acknowledge Liz MacKellar, who served as my secretary for 12 years; Lynton Crosby, my first research officer, who is now the Deputy Director of the Liberal Party; Robert Reid, who is now policy adviser to Premier Richard Court; Christopher Gardiner, now aged care services coordinator in New South Wales; and Rohan Greenland, who is in the gallery, a most excellent officer and a great friend. Rohan is now, after a period advising the President of the AMA, the press secretary of the Minister for Health and Family Services, Michael Wooldridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also acknowledge Dawn Crosby, who is now a director of the Liberal Party in the ACT; Bruce Edwards, who for seven years was my research officer and is now a senior officer on the staff of the Liberal Party in New South Wales; and Joanie Waterford, who begins next week as research officer for Senator&hyphen;elect Coonan. I now refer to my most recent staff: Paul Evans, who is in the gallery and who is now a staff member of Trish Worth, my very close friend and my local member; Christopher Argent; Naomi Moylan; David MacKay; Elizabeth Morrow; and, not least, my own son, Joshua, who has nearly graduated in law and who has been coordinating my office in the last couple of weeks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2466">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to acknowledge those departing with me. There are 10 of us. When I came here after the 1977 election there were 10 of us who were newly elected. I especially wish to thank, for their friendship, Senator Watson and Senator MacGibbon. We came in together. There are only two senators currently serving who have been here longer than the three of us. Also elected at that time were Gareth Evans, Don Chipp, David Hamer and some four others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to my very close friend and a person who I greatly respect, Senator Gerry Jones. We have travelled together in the Middle East and in China. We served as chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It has been a superb experience for me to have a great Australian involved with me in all those undertakings. I wish you and Rita every happiness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Baume preceded me in the parliament, having been elected in 1975. Michael and I have contributed to the Liberal Party in all the debates. I have great respect for Michael. The Liberal Party inherits both the conservative tradition in politics and the liberal tradition in politics. We both share something of each. I know that in some debates we will be removed from each other, but I assure not only my colleagues but also the Senate that at no stage has there been any difficulty for us to cooperate. I wish Michael and Toni every happiness in Reykjavik&mdash;or is it New York? I also acknowledge that we have travelled together in Indonesia. We will remember Java, West Irian, Irian Jaya and other places. We celebrated Anzac Day with all solemnity in Turkey together just a year ago, with our wives&mdash;and the Governor&hyphen;General happened to be there as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must mention Senator Bryant Burns who I respect very highly as I think the last of the old Labor Party in this parliament. I say it with great affection. Bryant and I became very close personal friends because he and I were leaders of the China&hyphen;Australia friendship group in this parliament. We understood each other on lots of issues. I wish him every happiness. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I disagree with the President, Senator Michael Beahan&mdash;every day, I have sought to be here for prayers. I believe it is right that after 96 years, we continue for another 96 years, and more, in opening our sittings, as representative of the Australian people, with prayer. But I agree with his remarks about the deterioration of behaviour in question time. I know that it upsets the Australian public. I agree with him, too, that the role of President of the Senate is an enormously important one. It is one that he has filled well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to Senator Beahan's successor contributing in every positive way to his position. I look to my close friend&mdash;she is like a sister to me in this place&mdash;Senator Margaret Reid. I had the privilege in my party room of nominating Senator Reid to be considered for the position of President. It was carried unanimously. I also acknowledge&mdash;as everyone in my party knows&mdash;that, had we won the 1993 election, I would have been glad to have been nominated to be President of the Senate. We did not win and those days have long passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I refer to Senator Noel Crichton-Browne. I remember earlier days, and I wish Noel all the best in future days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another Western Australian, Senator Christabel Chamarette, was one of the very happy and welcome guests at the wedding of my wife and I nearly 25 years ago, as was Senator Chapman. Christabel and my wife Kathy were classmates at school and they were also well known to each other all through university. I really respect Christabel's bona fides. I have said more&mdash;we all said more&mdash;in the Christian Fellowship meeting on Wednesday morning. I wish you well, Christabel. I heard and understand what your colleague Dee Margetts said about you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Spindler, Senator Bell and Senator Wheelwright have always been in my view in recent months. They were in a similar orientation when I was sitting for 13 years on the other side of the chamber. I wish you all well. I recognise in particular Robert Bell's partnership in many education debates in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the remaining senators, let me say a few things. Continue to serve Australia well. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2467"> particularly look to my immediate friends. Senator Robert Hill is my closest colleague in this place and my best friend in the Senate. We have gone through thick and thin together in my party. We have had great triumphs and we have also had some setbacks. I respect Robert enormously. I know the Senate is in good hands when he is the Leader of the Government in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going across to the other side, I mention Robert Ray. I have always got on very well with Robert, not least when he was a minister. I regard him as the most credible senator sitting opposite. I believe we should all be consistent and credible in this place. It helps a great deal in our contributions and to the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already mentioned Margaret Reid. There are many other personal friends, David Brownhill, for example&mdash;a great friend and my tennis partner to whom I handed this week the cup that the Senate has held in the tennis competition between the Reps and the Senate over all the time I have been here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention as personal friends Amanda Vanstone, Jocelyn Newman, Richard Alston and Winston Crane. Winston sat next to me in that top corner, and we are friends forever. I mention Sue Knowles. There are so many on all hands&mdash;everyone I see about me amongst the Liberal and National Party members and opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brian Harradine sent me a note today saying he was sad that he was missing this discussion in the Senate. Brian has become a personal friend of mine in every respect. I regard him a very honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise other more recent friends like Kay Denman. I really have enjoyed getting to know Kay. I really have enjoyed one of the most recent senators here, Natasha Stott Despoja. I really look forward to the contribution you will make in the parliament in all respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention other friends like John Woodley, the current President of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. I have mentioned Bruce Childs already. Barney Cooney, you are a brother, mate, and I will miss you. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I wish you and all of those I have mentioned well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator West was in the chair a minute ago. We have been on committees together and travelled together in China and other places. We both happen to have a Cornish heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I talk too much. I am sorry, I should sit down. I do not wish to omit anyone because, frankly, I do not know that I have an enemy in this place. I really have an enormous number of friends here. I will miss you, but I am going on to fresh things. So from Monday, feel free of any of our obligations; get on with serving Australia in your way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot conclude the list without mentioning at least a few former senators: Peter Baume, my great soul mate; Peter Durack, whom I respect enormously; John Carrick, who was my first Leader of the Government in this place and who sat next to me in his last year; and a great South Australian, Senator Sir Condor Laucke, now deceased, whom I have always respected and who was the most senior when I was the youngest in the Senate. I acknowledge the contributions of all South Australian senators who have served with me here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I come to the best people in the world&mdash;my wife, my sons, and my mother and father. I would not have been here without them. I would not have survived 18 years had it not been for the enormous contribution to my thinking and to my personal life of my wife Kathy. In the first five years especially I often thought she could equally have been elected to this Senate. She has the same skills that I have and she is a superb Australian. I thank her most sincerely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have three boys. Joshua, who is in the gallery, was only three when I was elected. He is now 21 and about to finish law. Matthew, who is a medical student, is a great mate. Nathan, my very good friend, is still in year 11 at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to take a sentence from my parents' letter to me today. My mother, who is in her late 70s and has always been a great supporter, says, `It will be just great to have you at home here more often in the days that lay ahead.' My father, who is now 85 and plays <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2468"> golf every week, said, amongst other things, `I feel that you will be like a bird set free. It is a great feeling being really free.' My father does not know it, but I have been saying to a lot of people that I am looking forward to Monday when I will be free to have energy to apply to this new set of activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last of all, I thank the people of South Australia for electing me here. I will return to be in the midst of the South Australian people and to contribute something towards the history of the South Australian people. It has been a total pleasure to be a senator in this place. I thank all senators for making it such a happy time for me.</PARA></SPEECH>

I do not think there can be a better combination than 39 years in the Labor Party and having to survive for 40 years. I did not believe my wife would survive 40 years with me being in the Labor Party.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think that tonight is a time when I should thank people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to express my gratitude to my staff: Karen Thompson, who has been my secretary for nine years; Ian Ross, a former editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, who worked the media for me; Natasha Thompson and Sacha Berry, two young girls who used to split the week between them&mdash;that gave them employment and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2470"> allowed them to undertake other things that they wanted to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a list of people, and I know that Baden went through a lot of them. I want to thank the transport officers, Bruce and Kearen.

Cleaver Elliott, John Vander Wyk, Terry Brown, Bev Orr and Angie Lilley work in the office just outside and assisted me during the time that I was the whip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must mention the PLOs. The late Rob Jones did a tremendous job and was a loss not only to this parliament but to everyone in the parliament. George Thompson, who is now chief adviser to John, did a great job and was of great assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And of course there is Nhan Vo&hyphen;Van, who is still there. I must say that John Panizza has probably got one of the best PLOs that this Senate has ever had. He showed professionalism when I dealt with him as government whip; he shows the same type of professionalism now. But it is a pity that they cannot win a division from the other side.</PARA>

He said that presiding officers should go overseas because they meet more people, and he listed all the people that we met.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the things that people do not know is that, during the anti&hyphen;apartheid demonstrations, particularly during the stop&hyphen;the&hyphen;tour demonstrations, I led the demonstrations in Queensland. I have a photo of me sitting in the main street with all the demonstrators. The Liberal Party tried to beat me in a state seat. They had that photo and drew a ring around my head and said, `You are responsible. You led demonstrations.' In actual fact that increased their vote so there was no real problem with it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2471">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to anti-apartheid demonstrations starting in Australia, some people may recall&mdash;you may have to go back and look this up because I know it is a long time ago&mdash;in the early 1970s that the Lions came out here to play rugby against Australia. Because they had played against South Africa, a team that was selected under the apartheid system, we believed that they should not be allowed to play in Australia. We tried to organise a demonstration in Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most people know my wife. She certainly does not look like a demonstrator. She looks like a middle class person rather than a demonstrator. She started the demonstration against the Lions. There were two people there&mdash;my wife and  a young teacher. They handed out dodgers in front of where the Lions were going in to play Queensland. That was the first demonstration against the apartheid system relating to sport. I went out to the airport to pick up Tony Abrahams who had come from France. He played rugby in the centres or the wing for Australia, but would have no truck with the apartheid system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rita and I went to South Africa. During our visit to South Africa we went to a rugby match. We watched New Zealand play Western Province. It was the first time that I had been to a rugby match since the days of the demonstrations, and it was the first rugby match that Rita had been to since the day she started the demonstration. It was ironic that it was South Africa. It was a very fitting end to the apartheid system that we finished up in South Africa, went to rugby and could see the result of the changes that had taken place and the changes that they had made in their constitution to do away with the apartheid system and bring in a fair and proper government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of my political career, in which Rita gave me loyal support, I suppose the biggest disappointment I have is that, starting as an official party organiser in 1967, I missed watching my four children&mdash;three girls and one boy&mdash;growing up. I think I have probably spent more time with my grandchildren than I have with my children. To all senators I say, `Don't miss out on your kids. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> If you are going to waste time in the Senate, do it in such a way that you give priority to your family and your kids.'

I have informally indicated to the President that I intend to retire from the Senate before the August budget session. This is my farewell to this chamber. I wish the best of everything to the other nine senators whose terms are finishing. Some are close friends, like Baden Teague; others friendly opponents, like Senators Jones, Burns, Wheelwright and Bell; and others I simply have not had the opportunity of getting close to. I want to single out Senator Christabel Chamarette for special mention as a special person. She is someone of total  commitment and integrity. Despite my almost continual disagreements with her, I certainly treasure her friendship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I made my maiden speech as the member for Macarthur in the House of Representatives a little over 20 years ago, I said I believed that the middle ground, the mainstream of Australia, would see the Liberal Party as its intellectual home. The mainstream left home and dumped us in 1983, and I lost my seat along with my exciting job as parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer, John Howard. My special responsibility was in helping sort out the mess the tax office had made by wrongly accepting as absolute a High Court judgment that section 260 of the tax act was not effective against a whole series of devious tax evasion arrangements. It has since been found to have been effective all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard was made to carry the political can for what was more a lack of skill in the tax office than a lack of will by the government. I will never forget the incredible comment by a former tax commissioner who, when called on in John Howard's office when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2472"> John Hewson was his senior adviser and I was his parliamentary secretary to justify his office's failure to bring forward anti-evasion legislation that had been promised two years earlier, said, `Mr Treasurer, how do you explain the inexplicable?' One day I will write a fairly detailed piece. All former journalists say that they are going to write a book. I will write a book and I hope the tax office and its secret agendas and all sorts of other things get a fair slice of the book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard also had to live with the ludicrous accusation that he had left a $9.6 billion dollar deficit for the 1983&hyphen;84 financial year. The proof of the absurdity of that claim, which depended on a continuation, among other things, of what was already the worst drought for 50 years for a further 15 months, was evident when the Hawke government brought down its 1983&hyphen;84 budget revealing an $8 billion dollar deficit after it had added a net $1.5 billion of its own expenditure. As a result, the Howard forecast of a likely deficit of about $6.5 billion was remarkably accurate, but that did not diminish the totally dishonest continual attacks on him on this score.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These examples of the political crosses John Howard has had to bear from opponents who had little regard for the truth, and the manner in which he has triumphed over them to become Australia's Prime Minister, underline some of the reasons for my unashamed admiration for the man. His election as Prime Minister gave me one of the greatest thrills of my political career. No&hyphen;one deserved it more; the mainstream has come back to its natural home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Winston Howard, like his middle&hyphen;namesake, is the right man in the right job at the right time. He has the strength of intellect, will and character to lead Australia out of our present problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the crosses he bears at the moment is the cross&hyphen; benches of this chamber, with the perception by the Australian Democrats and Greens that it is in their political interests to force a double dissolution&mdash;and so create lower electoral quotas&mdash;overwhelming any sense of responsibility to pass the legislative program of a government elected with a massive mandate of reform. John Howard's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reform program, so overwhelmingly endorsed last March, has been stalled, not on the basis of merit or sound argument but for a perceived political benefit. I think the Democrats and the Greens are wrong on all scores, including politically. In my maiden speech to the Senate almost 11 years ago I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role we have here is a most important one, ensuring, if we can, that Australia is being well governed, that our laws are just and that the rights of all Australians are protected. As senators, our responsibilities, like our privileges, are substantial. It is our duty, and certainly it is my intention, never to shirk those responsibilities or abuse those privileges.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two points I would like to make about this. Firstly, on the question of responsibilities, I believe I have worked hard to fulfil mine. I am concerned that the cross&hyphen;benches here are not living up to theirs. Secondly, I want to say something about the abuse of privileges. On that score, I strongly defend my actions in this chamber, which have been criticised. On all occasions I believe they were in the public interest. I note that the truth hurts most and I have always spoken what I believed to be the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is remarkable that what the media describes as `investigative journalism' when they do it magically becomes muckraking and mudslinging when a politician does it. My own view of my responsibilities rests on my hope in my maiden speech here that I would be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . judged here on my contribution to the Senate's performance in making or, in some instances, unmaking the laws under which we live. I hope that that judgment will be on the substance of what I do because it is substance that really matters. The dependency on demagoguery and the reliance on rhetoric that has so often diminished political debate in this Chamber no longer carries weight among thinking Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, all but a few months of my Senate life I have spent in opposition, but I can look back with pleasure at some changes I have made, for the better, to government legislation from opposition, particularly on the Australia Card issue and its replacement. The role I have most enjoyed is using some of the forms of the Senate to bring a greater level of detailed scrutiny of government than had apparently previously existed. This was an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2473"> urgent need at a time when the government was diminishing the role of the House of Representatives to little more than an electoral college for the executive, a situation now being reversed by the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt people will find different things to remember me by. Some will see no further than their snouts and will think only of pigs. I would say here that I am proud of my performance in revealing&mdash;despite a persistent campaign of personal abuse&mdash;matters that go to the heart of ministerial and prime ministerial duty and questions of potential for conflict of interest. The accuracy of my revelations of illegality and impropriety has been confirmed by the successful prosecutions of some of the persons involved. This matter is far from finished and others will pursue the improprieties involved that are still emerging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, my greatest contribution to this place was to add an extra dimension to the use of notices of motion and the tabling of Auditor&hyphen;General's reports and government documents as methods of keeping a check on the exercise of increasingly authoritarian power by government. I hope my colleagues will continue to pursue matters in these areas, even though the need now has been significantly diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate estimates committees have provided me with opportunities to examine questionable government spending programs, particularly after John Howard, as opposition leader, in 1986 appointed me as foundation Chairman of the Waste Watch Committee. I am proud of the achievements of that committee in exposing ludicrous examples of waste and vote buying by pandering to fringe groups with indefensible hand&hyphen;outs of government money. The female surfboard fiasco, song&hyphen;writers in residence and all the rest of this nonsense are now things of the past as a result of the efforts of that committee. Senate reference committees, particularly the arts, education and soccer inquiries on which I served, were good examples of the positive contribution the Senate makes.</PARA>

Among the many exciting non-parliamentary events in my political life have been duties overseas, such as my three months as our parliamentary representative to the United Nations General Assembly in 1993, where I had the remarkable thrill of speaking to the General Assembly from the dais at which so many leading figures of the world have spoken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another highlight was playing for this parliament in a cricket match at the Sydney Cricket Ground against the New South Wales parliament, where the old SCG scoreboard read `Baume 47, Hawke 2'. Perhaps I should add that Senator Chapman scored 42. We still got beat. I have enjoyed many other cricket matches, and I have often wondered whether my close friendship with the Prime Minister may have something to do with the fact that I stumped a bloke off his bowling in a match against the builders&mdash;and it was a very good ball too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel proud of the number of schools I have encouraged to visit parliament and the number of national flags I have presented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not, however, roses roses all the way. During my first two years in the House of Representatives, I was held under water by the Labor opposition, who subjected me to unfair and false attack on the basis of the failure of a Sydney stockbroking firm in which I had previously been a non-owner partner. An official inquiry under a Labor state government into this failure had specifically exempted me from any criticism relating to the firm's failure. That put some iron in my soul and gave me a view of the lack of integrity of those who in those days deliberately falsified that report to attack me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all that, there was nothing I felt the Labor Party could do to me that hurt. Most of the abusive remarks about me I took as an accolade, considering the character and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> credibility of those making them. Some of those opposite who will be glad to see me go are, I hope, endorsing my effectiveness over the years in exposing what should have been exposed and in commending what deserved to be commended but vigorously opposing what was not in Australia's best interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Spending 20 years or so in this profession imposes enormous pressures on one's family. I am very lucky indeed to have a wife, Toni, who enjoys the political process and who was a member of the New South Wales state executive of the Liberal Party before we married six years ago last Sunday. We have proved that the parliamentary and organisational wings of the Liberal Party can at times get along very well indeed, despite evidence to the contrary elsewhere. Unfortunately, this week she suffered the tragic loss of her mother in a car accident, and I thank her for being here with me today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So are my three sons&mdash;Andrew, Nicholas and Patrick. As young children, they put up with my commitments to my marginal seat of Macarthur, but at least I made sure we had quality time together by attending their sport, their debates and their school events. To all parents in this business&mdash;I plead with you to ensure you do not become separated from your children. I treasure the close relationship I have with my now adult sons, and I remember fondly the unrehearsed endorsement in Nowra by a 10-year-old Nicholas on a microphone in the 1975 election: `Vote Liberal for Michael Baume because he's my dad'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am rather glad that Senator Faulkner earlier tonight gave me permission to speak as often as possible now that he is in opposition, because in a sense I cheated: I gave what I called a final speech yesterday and my valedictory today. I gave my final speech yesterday because our four children were able to be present. I am glad that Julia is still able to be here, together with Beverly Irving, my long-suffering assistant in the office. They are the two women who run my life at the moment, or have until today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a great privilege for me to be part of the process of making the Senate a more effective house of review&mdash;for the last six years as a senator for Victoria and, before that, as senior adviser to former Senators Don Chipp and Janine Haines when they were leaders of the Australian Democrats. That process for the Democrats includes assessing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> every clause of every bill to determine whether it should be passed, amended or rejected&mdash;perhaps Senator Michael Baume could take note of that&mdash;on the basis of the merits of that legislation, as defined by the policies and principles of the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That issue touches on the debate we have had in the community about mandates. I believe it has now been finally acknowledged that the definition of `keeping them honest' means keeping them accountable in terms of the common good rather than on the basis of whether a government mandate for a particular measure has been created by including that measure in the party's election speech. Clearly it is the task of executive government to propose laws and, if passed, to implement them. To reverse that order and to suggest that the government of the day has the right to tell parliament which laws to pass is an arrogant denial of parliamentary democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is of course also the increasing pace of economic, social and technological change, the resulting uncertainty about our future and the complexity of the challenges facing governments which make a mockery of any rigid three-year program, as indeed all governments are experiencing. But being a legislator is not enough. One of the reasons I entered parliament and am leaving with mixed feelings is that there is potential for pursuing one's own aspirations for our individual and collective futures.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. Let me quote briefly from my final speech earlier this week:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I owned up to my agenda in my first speech&mdash;to push us closer to a society which is socially and economically just for all its members, regardless of colour, creed, gender, sexuality, disability or wealth; a society which is ecologically sustainable and which is accepting of our responsibility to reduce inequality globally.</PARA>
<PARA>I have, I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the strong belief not only that inequality in people's life opportunities is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>inherently and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">morally wrong, but also that such inequality, injustice and intolerance ultimately leads to conflict, oppression and violence. This was reinforced <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2476"> by my childhood experiences in war-torn Europe and the enormity of the Holocaust. I determined that I wanted to do all I could to ensure that such events did not occur again.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, I said that I wanted to make sure that we made every effort to leave a world to our children and their children where such a prospect could be excluded with some confidence. I then proceeded to thank my family, my own staff and the staff of the other Democrat senators. No doubt senators will be relieved that I do not intend to repeat those comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I must express my feelings about all the other people who make our work possible. One of the most positive experiences of my term in the Senate was the utterly professional yet friendly support provided by the staff of the Senate. One incident stands out from my early days with former Senator Don Chipp. I called on the then Clerk of Procedure, one Harry Evans, to get an amendment drafted. Once he had elicited exactly what I wanted&mdash;in itself no mean feat&mdash;Harry Evans walked across to his assistant, who was sitting at an electric typewriter, and dictated then and there a number of word&hyphen;perfect clauses amending several acts of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That incident has stayed with me as the symbol of the quality of the service we enjoy from the other clerks&mdash;Anne Lynch, Peter O'Keefe, Cleaver Elliott, John Vander Wyk and Rosemary Laing&mdash;the Usher of the Black Rod, Rob Alison, and the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, Andrea Griffiths, the quiet and much appreciated professionalism of the attendants and Comcar drivers, the Table Office, the printing shop and all the other services which make our work possible. Two aspects continue to fill me with some awe: how on earth Hansard can be accurate yet make one's garbled output look so elegant in print; and how often one can ask the same procedural question and still receive a friendly, patient and accurate answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier I said that being a legislator is not enough and perhaps the most important avenue to explore new directions is offered by the Senate committees and their staff. And here I have participated in many inquiries that have given me great pleasure and great <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> satisfaction, starting with mergers and acquisitions; my own inquiry into industry, development and tariffs; cost of justice; outworkers; treaties; and more recently indicators and benchmarks.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. Of course there are the couple of landmines that I am leaving behind&mdash;the unfinished business of the casino and sexuality inquiries. I have always counted this work as a critically important part of my work in this place. I have found the committee secretariat members not only of legal and constitutional affairs, which probably was my preferred home of all the committees, but also of the NCA; family law; corporations; economics; foreign affairs, defence and trade; and migration committees to be unfailingly hardworking, efficient and competent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two chairmen stand out: Senator Barney Cooney has shown himself to be one of the great civil libertarians of this chamber and a friend; and Senator Chris Ellison has displayed such even-hand yet goal-directed fairness that he could have come from any party. I trust this is not the kiss of death, Chris. One of the pleasant surprises was that we could disagree quite strongly on issues&mdash;Senator Alan Ferguson and Senator John Panizza come to mind&mdash;yet work together constructively and cooperatively, even regard each other with a degree of respect and civility, perhaps with Senator Ian Macdonald providing one of the rare exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of my regrets that a backbencher's resources simply cannot be stretched to do justice to six shadow portfolios, five committees and, just as importantly, the pursuit of issues not currently on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. In my case, the attempt has affected my health and confirmed the need to leave. More generally, I am sure, it is short&hyphen;sighted policy to deny the resources to so many motivated and capable senators which could multiply the contributions that those senators could make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should not be beyond the capacity of the parliament to find resources to extract that extra value out of senators willing to shoulder additional responsibilities. Unfortunately, we are moving in the opposite direction, with a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2477"> finance minister reluctant to provide funds for select committees of inquiry established by this chamber&mdash;a clear and, I believe, regrettable example of party political considerations overriding the principles of government accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, I wish to pay tribute to my colleagues. The Australian Democrats, being a small team, have to work as a team and have to work well together. Cheryl Kernot is known to us not only for managing the political process and the presentation of the political process but also for showing steel and commitment to what is right and just, as I described yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert Bell is returning to community activities but I am sure he will be back. Much has been said about the contributions he has made to our process here. Certainly, he has provided a very weighty anchor to the debates in our party room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meg Lees has always been capable, energetic and committed&mdash;the `whirling dervish' is one term that comes to mind. Vicki Bourne, once known in the far off days when she worked for then Senator Colin Mason as the `party girl' has become `Madam Lash', our whip. She is a very efficient, very effective and most enthusiastic defender of human rights, both in Australia and overseas. We all jostle with her to get a word in because that is a topic dear to the hearts of Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With John Woodley we were delighted to be finally respectable enough to have a reverend in our midst. John has added a certain aura to our team which will not be forgotten. John, the dignity and wisdom that comes with it is much appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Natasha Stott Despoja is the latest addition and is proving that youth is no bar to achievement and no bar to a fantastic future. I believe that we will hear a lot from Natasha.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention Lyn Allison. She is not yet in this chamber but I am delighted that as I am leaving it has been possible to ensure that there will be another Democrat senator from Victoria. I have come to know Lyn as being extremely capable and as having a strong will. She also has a somewhat dubious past, having been arrested at Albert Park <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> during one of the demonstrations against the raceway. Previously she was an independent councillor of the City of Port Melbourne. I can assure senators opposite that she will be a handful to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Andrew Murray I do not know very well. He comes to us from Western Australia. He is a Rhodes Scholar. I am sure he will add a lot to the intellectual debate of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, I will mention briefly some of the other senators who are leaving and essentially associate myself with the remarks made by others who have gone before me, in particular Senator Kernot on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Let me first say something about Bryant Burns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I share the respect that others have expressed for the conviction that Bryant has exhibited in many areas of his work in the committees. I cannot remember, Bryant, one occasion where I felt I should disagree with you. It was a good, useful and cooperative relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom Wheelwright&mdash;a very brief presence, but we went together to Mururoa. That was a memorable occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always respected Christabel Chamarette. I have not always agreed with Christabel. My wife claims that she is an anarchist, so to some extent&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Julia claims she is an anarchist, so I can appreciate to a large extent how the mind of an anarchist works. I have a great deal of respect for that. The chamber and the government process are not easily adapted to anarchist mode, as I am sure, Christabel, you have found out. But it is challenging for us sometimes to give some thought to how things could be done differently and better. I think you have provided us with some ideas on that, and I am sad that you are leaving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baden Teague, I will not compete with you for the office of head of state, but I may meet you at the constitutional convention, I hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">President Michael Beahan, I have always had a great deal of respect for the way in which you have handled this chamber. May <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2478"> I say that, apart from the Anti&hyphen;Slavery Society, I expect to be spending some time at the International Centre for Conflict Resolution and also to hang out my shingle as a mediator. Mr President, if your successor finds that question time does not improve I might be back with some business cards and distribute them around the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will leave the Senate deeply concerned about the future of our society, and in a sense I am regretful that I am not able to stay. The present government, I feel, is embarking on a cost cutting spree outside any conceivable policy framework and devoid of any rational substantive basis for the cuts that are being made. All we get is, `We must reduce the budget deficit and fill this black hole of $8 billion'&mdash;a figure which has now been largely discredited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that it is based on necessarily uncertain economic growth forecasts. We also know that these forecasts have already been revised upwards, thus significantly reducing the deficit. The black hole has now become the grey hole, possibly even with some white edges, yet this does not stop the government in its destructive frenzy. The day after the revised growth estimates were announced, the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, was all over the media saying that the cuts will go ahead anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's economic future depends on our industries increasing their capacity to compete internationally&mdash;that is, to replace imports and to export more to reduce unemployment&mdash;yet the Howard government is cutting industry assistance, export promotion and labour market programs. Australia needs to become the truly clever and innovative society, yet Mr Howard is cutting funding to education, research and development. Our society needs to become the civil society, as Eva Cox called it in her Boyer lectures, concerned about justice, the collective good and government accountability, yet Mr Howard is reducing the Ombudsman's budget by a third. The vandals are not only at the gates, they are well within the gates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians need the Senate and the Senate needs the Australian Democrats to make government accountable, to scrutinise the cuts <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to services dictated by the economic rationalists in Finance and Treasury, and to protect Australian citizens from the destructive consequences of these ill&hyphen;considered cuts. It will be a tough job, but I am sure the Senate is up to it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to indicate right at the very beginning that as Bryant Burns, and someone who may believe in certain issues and care about fairness and equity in the community, people's civil rights, their right to good education, to good health care, it would mean nothing if I were not involved in the labour movement. I speak about the labour movement as the trade union movement which built the Labor Party; and they both, of course, make up the labour movement. So I indicate my appreciation to that great body of men and women who have made it possible for me to come here to the Senate to play a role in the development and the future of this great country of ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been proud to be part of the Labor achievements over the nine years that I have been here&mdash;although I have not supported all of them; I am not one to sell assets that are good profit providers. However, I have not had to really search my conscience and suggest I should walk across the floor because I guess I have a great appreciation for solidarity and commitment to the majority view and the majority decision. I think without that, democracy is nothing. If you are not going to be part of an organisation or a body of people if they disagree with you, if you only want those occasions when you get your way, then the whole of society has a real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess one of the highlights of my experiences in the Senate was very late at night when the Mabo native title legislation was finally put through the Senate. I knew at that time that while there was much debate and criticism from the opposition about the way in which the legislation was couched, the terms and the language, and some of the ways in which it provided for the native title to be administered, really no&hyphen;one was opposed to seeing some benefit by way of traditional land going to Aboriginal people. It was a great <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2479"> experience for me to see that happen. I guess it was against the tradition of the Senate that everybody got up and clapped, even people in the gallery, and I appreciate the fact that most people in the gallery did not object to that: they understood the emotional occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had excellent experience on a number of committees which I chose to go on and was fortunate enough to be able to go on. I was able to work with people within the Labor Party who also had a commitment in those areas and also people from the opposition who had a real commitment in those areas as well. I guess it was my first experience in the Senate of what they call split personality where people on the other side would get up and no matter what we said they would cane us and get stuck into us, but suddenly on a committee when we talked about issues in a detailed way and we were given evidence about what had happened and the direction in which some issues were going, we could all come to agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was rather strange, but it was a good experience to see that that could happen. Most of the committee work that I was involved in resulted in unanimous decisions. Even when there were some minority reports, they were not of any really great substance where the matters were important to this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In foreign affairs, in particular, I recall when Graham Maguire was chairman and we did a report on India. Many reports are just left in piles to gather dust but this one was a little different because it was of great substance and I believe it was well thought out in its recommendations. The description of the evidence that had come to us by way of submissions was very helpful and constructive. Indeed, there was a request from India for hundreds of copies of the report so they could analyse our attitude to the relationship between the two countries. When Graham Maguire visited India, he had an audience for one hour with the Prime Minister, which is quite unusual for people at those levels of government&mdash;one to the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an excellent report on South America. The ambassadors in those southern American countries decided it would be useful if we continued the dialogue and attempted to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make the relationship we had even better and just make suggestions of how that could be strengthened and made more productive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was involved in the report on our relationship with China. The Chinese government, in its usual generous way, invited the committee to go there and see for ourselves the way the government operated and the prosperity that was accruing to the people there as a result of the opening up of their, as they call it, socialist market economy. I recall a very interesting visit, which was set up by Baden Teague, to the military university. It was a pleasure to talk with the people there about the need to enhance what we had in terms of regional defence, where each of us could cooperate, how there could be an exchange between the military forces from both countries, and the fact that we should be transparent in the things that we do and that we should be showing that we are really no threat to each other. I really enjoyed that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not the only views I share with Baden Teague. Baden had been to China long before I had but I had studied the history of China quite a bit. We are both very good friends of China. If your friendships are genuine, you are not friends with someone because they think all the time the way you do or because they do everything you want them to do. You accept them, warts and all, while at the same time trying to encourage them through debate and discussion to come across to your way of thinking. In the process, they may very well convince you that you might have to change your views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of the republic&mdash;I might get thrown out of the Labor Party for saying all these nice things about Baden Teague&mdash;I believe he is a fairly objective person, even though he is very misguided in many things he has said in the chamber and the many derogatory remarks he has made about the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On many occasions when I travelled throughout the country for regional and rural affairs I was asked, `How come a bloke who is a trade unionist, and a leftie at that, ever became chairman of that committee?' All I could say was that it was because I care about rural people as I do about workers in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2480"> cities and that I had a capacity as a chairman to get the best out of the committee, to encourage them to be part of the debate and to put forward suggestions that would be enlightened and in the interests not only of the rural community but of the whole of the Australian community. I think I did that fairly well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have always said, if as a chairman you want to get a result from a committee, you really have to encourage the members of that committee to put their points of view. You have to be fair in the way you deal with them and you have to recognise the constructive views they express. I guess, also, that it is important, when people have sincerely held views, that even if you do not agree with them, you have to think about it. I have sincerely held views, as others do. If you want people to take you seriously and give you the right to hold those views, you have to give them the same right to hold views that are different from yours. If you do that, mutual respect can be developed and a lot of good work can be done in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of the policy of the previous government and the policy of the government that is now in power, I guess the electors will finally judge either side at the next election. I would just like to say that I intend to put quite a bit of my effort and time into assisting the trade unions as much as I can in what I believe is going to be a very big dispute in the community about industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been amazed, when discussing the policies with people in the opposition, at their honestly held belief that some of the changes in industrial relations that have been suggested by way of the legislation that has come before the Senate and will now be looked at by a committee will be good for the community. I know they will not but I am amazed that some of those people really feel that. Some do not&mdash;they just want to do the workers in&mdash;but there are many who do not want this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regardless of the erstwhile debate and the many words said in this chamber and in the other chamber, the decision will not be made in Parliament House; it will be made out there <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the workplace, between employers and employees, and in the community. I will be part of that struggle. I might see some people from time to time who have worked in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank the clerks, who have been very helpful and always reasonably fair. I recall that when we were in government from time to time people on our side were not too happy about the way the clerks helped the opposition. But now we are always very grateful for any help they might give us&mdash;not that, because of our competence, dedication and enthusiasm, we need much help, but any help is worthwhile. It was with sadness that I read about one of the clerks who operated so efficiently in this place being sacked in Queensland because she was carrying out the sort of work that she was instructed to do, to improve the way the parliament operated in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess I am not sad, relieved or happy. I knew that I came into this place for a limited period and that I would play a role&mdash;and that that role would end and I would go on to do something else. I must say that the time I have spent here has been most interesting and most useful even though when I came here I was not a young person forming different ideas and other views, and having a great appreciation for other people's points of view. It has certainly given me more skills that I had before I entered the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People talk about the democratic process. For people to elect someone into the Senate for six years, or someone into the House of Representatives potentially for three years, is not democracy. To do that, and then follow what they do and understand the effect their decisions have on society in all its aspects and to be able to get together as groups of people to put points of view so as to tell people why they are right or wrong, support them or oppose them, and every day understand what is happening in this place and in other areas where laws and legislation are dealt with, is democracy for me. Until people in larger and larger numbers start to understand this and assert their right in that way, the sort of democracy that we deserve and should have will not be at our disposal.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I finish I must say that I certainly enjoyed working with people in the Labor Party. As I said today at a little gathering of Labor Party people, you do not always have to like people to work with them, and I mean that broadly. I have had many an argument in my day but I have tried on most occasions to stay away from personalities, because there are so many things that people can agree on. If you become too personal and nasty, they are not inclined to work with you when they would really like to. I think you have to take the view, `Okay, let's disagree quite vigorously,' but give the other person the right to have that point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that the clerks have been of great help. I refer also to the people in the Transport Office. They have been of great help to me over the years. They have been very friendly and have also treated me like a human being, which I have appreciated very much. I thank all the people around Parliament House who make our job so much easier and so much more constructive and useful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go from here, as I said, into another aspect of my career. I am not suggesting it will be long. I think Michael Baume suggested he might have a further long career. I do not know how long mine will be; one never knows. But I will certainly do my best to pursue equity and fairness in the community. I have noticed that the Democrats have a similar view in that regard. I pay them a tribute for that. There have been times when I was really encouraged to vote with them, but there is that old solidarity thing&mdash;you can never change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish everybody in the chamber the best. I know that when 10 people walk out of here, they may have a lot of experience, they may have a lot of knowledge, but they leave behind them a lot of people who have also got knowledge and will maybe acquire better knowledge. The Senate is in good hands as long as it lasts. I do not think it is a house of review and I do not think it should really last for a long time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME>
<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I celebrate the end of four years in this place. I am at the end of the six&hyphen;year term to which I was appointed following <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the retirement of Senator Jo Vallentine. I use the word `celebrate' in its fullest sense. I celebrate the great debates and historic outcomes in which I have been privileged to participate. I celebrate the end of my time here, including my sadness at not having been elected for a further term to represent the people of Western Australia, the Greens (WA) and many who have supported and relied on my voice. I celebrate all the wonderful people whom I have met, worked with, argued with, laughed and cried with, during my time in the Senate. Tonight I express my appreciation to all of you, my Senate colleagues. I particularly wish all the best to those who, with me, are departing. It has been a fascinating, challenging and at times frustrating experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, too, want to express my appreciation to the clerks&mdash;to Harry, Anne, Cleaver, Peter, Rosemary and John. When I came as a solitary senator in 1992 they were a tremendous help to me. It was a very invidious position, and I am also very grateful for the model provided by my neighbour in my previous place in this chamber, Senator Brian Harradine. I do not think I could have had a better teacher for some of the procedures that were used in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to express my gratitude to the parliamentary staff in this place, and to the Parliamentary Library, and my tremendous appreciation and respect&mdash;in particular to the clerks and all the supporting staff&mdash;for the way in which they approach their very important roles in this place for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really appreciate Hansard. If we had to talk about bloopers, I could talk about my speech during the third reading debate on the native title legislation and how my comment about Henry Reynolds's article on native title being `prophetic' came out as `pathetic'. But I had better not go into too many of those anecdotes in case there would ever be the opportunity to return the compliment in the memoirs, for example, of Bernie Harris, Malcolm McGregor or any of the others. I know that we all really appreciate their hard work, their long hours and their unfailing courtesy and professionalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My Senate team has been an avid user of technology. Our very limited staff resources <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2482"> has meant we have relied heavily upon the full breadth of the services available to us. We have helped coax the parliament, we believe, into the 20th century by supporting such things as electronic copies of bills, use of the fax gateway, access to laptops and connection to the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank all the information services support staff in this place, especially user support, which I know is heavily relied upon by my staff. In particular, thank you to Bill Adam, John Kerr, Graham Fawns and John Dyer for their patience and invaluable expertise. Thanks also to Lorraine Kearney and Joyce Clarke for keeping us connected by fax to our constituency networks. I hope that other honourable senators will take up the challenge to ensure that the parliament keeps pace with computer awareness and use in the community. We must maximise communication and consultation with the community and minimise our heavy reliance on paper, with the tragic destruction of our forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you to the many others too numerous to name who make this parliament into less of an institution and more of a community&mdash;attendants, Comcar drivers, cafeteria and dining room staff and the many others, including, of course, the staff members of other parliamentarians, with whom we invariably develop links and friendships as we work on issues together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very aware that much of the sadness I feel in leaving is at the loss of the community that is my team&mdash;my staff, past and present, paid and unpaid. I acknowledge the presence of eight of them in the gallery at the moment. I cannot express the depth of my appreciation. It has been a team. I have to acknowledge that it is very much like an iceberg&mdash;one-tenth at the top and nine-tenths at the bottom. The amount of work that both Dee and I have been able to get through would not have been possible without the dedication and commitment of the people who have become not only staff but deep personal friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the first six weeks when my team worked unpaid, as I did, before I was appointed to this place. It has been a really interesting last six weeks. It has been quite <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> difficult adjusting to the fact that we are leaving, and there has been a grieving involved in that. It has been very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recognition of the fact that all I have been able to offer in this place has been a team effort, I have asked some of those nearest to me to contribute to this speech. I explained in my first speech in March 1992 that `Green' as we use it in the movement has become the symbol for change in awareness throughout the world. In the Greens (WA) we talk about our fundamental commitments to our four pillars as: peace and nuclear disarmament, social justice, the environment, and participatory democracy. Also in my first speech I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The common thread that unites all those who come into the political arena as Greens, and which sets us apart from other political parties, is a profound conviction that the structures and old ways of addressing the problems will not be effective. While cynicism and apathy regarding politics and politicians engulf the Australian community, as they have done elsewhere, there is a small but growing minority that has not given up but is seeking a revolutionary change in the political system. This revolution, which may be more appropriately called a transformation because it utilises that which is good from the past, is centred on the political process rather than the issues.</PARA>
<PARA>The common threads that unite us come from all those areas I have mentioned and you will see them in the following quotes I bring you from Theo Mackaay, Rosemary Greenhalgh, Franci Williams and Jacquie Svenson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is from Theo Mackaay, who must be the most hardworking replier to constituent letters and the most diligent speech writer. His speeches are the ones I can most easily speak from because he is so adept at writing sermons. I know we do not speak from notes. If you have ever noticed me looking as though I have got copious notes and talking very fluently, it is probably because Theo wrote the copious notes. Here is Theo's message:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I came into this position with a commitment to social justice, and have found that while I have long known that social justice is about choices&mdash;people being empowered to make choices about their lives&mdash;I now believe that the fundamental social justice is connection. We are less likely to harm people or the Creation if we have an understanding of our being connected. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2483"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When people have no connection with each other, dismissing their place in the community is easy, and the same is true of our connection with the Earth&mdash;if we have no sense of our being connected, then we can easily do it harm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, when we define people in society in categories, into "them" and "us", (or we glibly talk about `the taxpayer will not put up with misspending on payments or programs' when we want to justify spending cuts) we are paving the way for injustice.</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you, Theo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rosemary Greenhalgh came as a volunteer to help for one day a week and stayed on full time for years. She had this message. It was her inspiration:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May the rights and inheritance of all indigenous Australians be justly recognised, and the land, their mother, not be destroyed by our greed and short&hyphen;sighted exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you, Rosemary. Franci Williams wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are facing ever new challenges to counter the growing social, economic, and political power of conservative thought in both major parties and others who seek to impose their patriarchal, homophobic, racist and fundamentalist values. Let us work together to foster a new politics, a politics of meaning, politics as if all of us mattered, politics that is no less than a revolution in consciousness.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, from Jacquie. The scribble at the top is interesting; it says, `This won't fit but here it is anyway.' Jacquie wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I first came here as a youngen from alternative youth culture in the West, and my greatest impression on arriving in the Parliament for the first time was a lot of men shouting at each other. Not much listening, and not much desire to acknowledge all kinds of wisdom regardless of which party or person it came from, as valid wisdom that would enable the best decision to be reached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also saw a lot of people who didn't seem to realise the importance of their decisions on the ground, and the hardships their decisions could cause or prevent for the millions of Australians who have given them the job of making those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And a lot of people who are out of touch with what's really happening away from the world of marble corridors, chauffeured cars and first class seats on aeroplanes. Some people&mdash;people I know and still know, people who I lived and worked with before I came to this place&mdash;eat three meals a week if they're lucky and don't have anywhere to live. The decisions you make affect whether that changes to two meals or four, whether those people can afford shoes or must go barefoot. Those decisions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affect everything. They affect how much forest will be left for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are very privileged to be in this place, and the people of Australia have bestowed upon every one of you an enormous responsibility. Those people, and the planet itself, need your best and most considered decisions, made separate from ego and personal gain. In times as desperate as these, nothing less can be accepted. Much time has been spent by Christabel bringing to these hallowed halls the reality of what's happening to the Earth outside these walls, and I and staff before me have written a lot of words about that. I cannot stress more strongly the urgency of those words, because humanity is teetering on the verge of ecological collapse. These are not doomsday words from an environmental fanatic. It is hard scientific fact. If just for a moment during my and Christabel's work in this place you have genuinely heard that urgency and considered it with open eyes and heart, my work here has not been in vain.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>It has been a great privilege to be in the parliament at such a significant point in Australia's history. The opportunity to participate in the native title debate was definitely the highlight of my time in the Senate. It is ironic that those who criticised the Greens during the debate now understand our concerns and are calling for the changes we made to the bill to be retained as they are in danger of being removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another achievement in changing the political culture is the recognition that trading across issues is not acceptable as it sells out one issue for another and corrupts the long-term agenda for both. The media acknowledgment of this in the Telstra environment package deal was in marked contrast to the response to the 1993 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2484"> But the unique and most positive contribution that we have tried to make is that we became part of a community with a vision for democracy within the Senate. This community includes members and staff of all parties, Senate staff, attendants and basically anyone who could listen and understand the need for consensus rather than the violent imposition of decisions by dint of bullying and numbers. These people were able to appreciate and support our efforts even when they disagreed with our views on the particular issue. It is this group that will miss my Senate team the most. May you reminisce with fondness over the incidents of anarchy&mdash;we call it democra cy&mdash;and the headaches we caused to Gareth Evans and the previous government. The new government is culture shocked to now be on the receiving end. The Labor Party is pleasantly surprised at our consistency with our previous positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also created or connected with a broader community through many people who wrote to us, valued our feedback on the issues before parliament, supported us in the election, defended us to their friends when we were being slammed by the PM or the press, worked as volunteers in the office or kept us involved and informed of their particular issue or community agency activity. This community of the spirit of democracy continues to grow. I want to mention here Clarrie, Mingli and Victor, who became part of our office community along with the volunteers, Rosemary, Penny, Hugh and Jennifer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank, as I had already begun to, in a heartfelt way my Senate team. As I mentioned, eight of them are here. Cathcart, who will certainly be memorable to you, is not. It is quite a gap. I would like to congratulate him and Jill on the birth of Loughlan Alexander Cathcart Weatherly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;L.A.W&mdash;not quite. We have had some wonderful times on our team. We really appreciated the brilliance as well as the bluster that Cathcart brought to us. Each person has made a contribution. It has made a very wonderful team.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank the leaders who spoke earlier for their comments and best wishes for the future. I particularly want to express my gratitude to my colleague Dee for her speech, which moved me enormously. I wish her the very best. I feel very sad to be leaving her with such a big load, but I am sure that it will be an exciting time. She is certainly capable of it. I wish her well and thank her for the experience that we have shared together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of the leaders gave their analysis in their own terms of how they saw my presence in this chamber. I would like to be remembered in this way. Many of you have grown to understand the Greens (WA). We are committed to the process as much as the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outcome. We feel that in no small way we have contributed to a more consensual approach in this chamber. While this is largely due to the prevailing numbers of the Senate, it is my belief and hope that it is a cultural shift that will endure. I feel that, as parliamentarians, we have little to offer if, as we approach the new millennium, we continue to cling to adversarial politics, a politics of division rather than unity. There will always be truth and wisdom on both sides for all sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community deserves no less than the best possible decisions we are capable of making. `Group wisdom' is a term we use to describe the best thinking of a group. It is not necessarily or absolutely right. There might be one individual in a group who is right. Group wisdom is the best decision for that point in time for that group of people. Every individual has a contribution to make and a hand in shaping the final outcome. Through this process we can arrive at a way of making decisions which honour the breadth of views and feelings in the community and give people a stronger connection to the decisions that affect their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My predecessor, Jo Vallentine, ended her valedictory speech with a wonderful poem called `The Singing Hill'. I would like to end with another poem, mainly by Chris Williams, with some group wisdom thrown in. It is the aspiration that I came to this place with. I go, seeing it as something that is present here and knowing that it cannot stop by the leaving of one or 10 people. It states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you, Baden Teague, Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne, Christabel Chamarette, Bryant Burns, Sid Spindler, Michael Baume, Tom Wheelwright, Gerry Jones and I are a special group. We share a special indefinable something as we leave this place together. Cheryl Kernot speaks of the Class of `90 amongst the Democrats, and that is another special group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his first speech, I recall Ian Campbell referring to the total number of senators who have ever represented the states and territories of Australia in this place, and it is a surprisingly small number. An even smaller number was spoken of by John Coates only just the other day, Mr President, at your end of session drinks event. He mentioned feeling rather strange to find himself a member of such a small group of Labor senators who have ever represented Tasmania. Those who would be interested might like to talk about that with John later because it is a surprisingly small group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We 10 who finish with this session and depart this place will remind ourselves in times to come of how important it has been to be categorised in certain ways and to find ourselves sharing certain feelings at certain times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, of course, other categories that we come into when we recall these moments. There are categories that have already been mentioned by Christabel, for example. She mentioned those who shared the Mabo event&mdash;it was not far different from this time of the night either&mdash;and there was something special about that moment.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final night, Cheryl. The one I was thinking of was that moment of absolute electricity in the air, and it really <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did mean something. There was almost a sparkle in the air when those final minutes ticked through and, even though I did not participate in the debate at that instant, I treasure that feeling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a feeling that we have as we associate ourselves with issues that we have debated through this place. One example of that for me&mdash;much less spectacular in some ways, but just as important across the whole nation&mdash;was very early in my time in this place. It was the moment of the wool tax debate. I sense a recognition from some of my colleagues because it was a very powerful moment. As somebody with enough experience&mdash;but really only a little experience in this place&mdash;it reminded me of how crucially important single words can be in here, when it is either `and' or `but' or, in this particular case, `half a per cent'. Yet that had consequences of millions, if not billions, of dollars across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am hoping that Senator Winston Crane is listening at this moment because there were moments during debates on industrial relations when words that almost became acronyms became particularly evocative. Just the words `contractors legislation' will get the attention of a number of people. If Senator Cook was here at the moment, he would immediately have a reaction to those two words. I know that as I leave here there will be several pairs of words or phrases that will evoke a certain response in me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, when I think of the term `contractors legislation', I am reminded of my first experience of really concerted lobbying. You see, the question of the wool tax evoked from those affected in the Australian community&mdash;those involved in the trade, so to speak&mdash;spontaneous response and informed response. I must say that the concerted lobbying that took place about the contractors legislation had me believing that what I was about to agree to would have the sky falling in, houses across Australia costing $20,000 more each immediately and the decline and complete disassembly of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we know that that did not happen. I learnt, as I have learnt so much in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2486"> place, that the concerted lobbying, which was rehearsed and applied in uniformity from all points of Australia, is much less effective than the genuine, spontaneous, varied and much more useful opinion expressing which takes place on nearly every issue. Having learnt that once, I do not need to learn that again. I hope the lobbyists do, though.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing which springs to mind for me is the other industrial relations legislation which has progressed through this place in some form or another. Some of it has required much work for little noticeable result for this party's participation. Industrial relations tends to be treated as an esoteric club, especially by journalists but also by other commentators. Acronyms and clause numbers are thrown about with little regard to the actual situation that the people who are affected by this legislation may find themselves in, and with little regard to what is described as industrial relations. I must say I approve of the redefining or reclassification of this as workplace relations, which is a much more accurate way of looking at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workplace relations are of fundamental importance to all Australians and do not deserve to be hived off into a specialist area where the acronyms can disguise the relevance to all Australians. Workplace relations have previously suffered from being the subject of specialist press and have therefore not found their way into the tabloid press for comprehensive discussion. I think the reason people should be interested in this has been illustrated well enough in the six years that I have been here to finally reveal its relevance so that people who are not in the privileged club can actually see that it may be worthwhile listening to the progress of the debate which will ensue in the next few months. I know that there are so many people who want to express their opinions in relation to this matter and make sure that their opinions are not discounted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that I have had some moderate success in representing the Democrats' concern that fairness in the workplace is a vital issue which characterises Australia. Australia is also characterised by our trust in the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Relations Commission. I am pleased that, after lengthy and varied negotiations on a number of bills, we have been able to defend as a party and as a team the independence of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I trust that that defence will continue whether I am here or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area that I would like to mention, and this reminds me of what this place is all about, is education. That has been a portfolio responsibility that I have had for most of the time that I have been here. I think the party has wisely recognised that there are different aspects of education represented by the school and higher education sectors. That recognition has come about in a natural way. I think the Senate will continue to see a great deal of activity from the Democrats in terms of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not hesitate to remind those who are listening that I have sought to defend the principle of free compulsory education up to secondary level. It should be provided by the community for the benefit of the community, which is something the Democrats have held dear since foundation. We have also held dear the principle of essentially free post&hyphen;secondary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My party's success in this area in my time here has been modest, but consistent and persistent. On some occasions, too few I might say, we have welcomed the presence of the coalition beside us in the debate. We challenged plans to increase HECS and to decrease Austudy repayments. I will be closely watching the coalition's performance to see whether there is any consistency applied in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2487"> Most of my other activities in this place have been issue related or at least, as Cheryl indicated earlier, related to the particularity of Tasmania. In some instances, it has been sufficient to just raise the issue and suggest a suitable outcome such as, for example, asking that there be some recognition of the expenses incurred in establishing fruit trees in orchards. I asked for that to be treated as a deductible expense for taxation purposes. It was sufficient to suggest that and events took their course. With the persistence of our research ers in our team eventually that found a proper place in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other instances the matters that I have been interested in have required persistence. I hesitate to remind Senator Schacht&mdash;this is one of those phrases where as soon as you say it you get a certain reaction&mdash;of the issue of quarrying at Exit Cave. Persistence was required but a result was eventually achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area that has required persistence is the legality of the so&hyphen;called voluntary fees at our government schools. Sid Spindler mentioned that he left a land mine. I am pleased to leave the employment, education and training committee with a little job&mdash;an inquiry into school funds, fees, sponsorship and so on. Off they will go and good luck to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have learnt much from both the staff and other senators on the committees that I have been involved with. I hesitate to mention names, but I really cannot go from this place without acknowledging three committee staff members&mdash;Brenton Holmes, Neil Bessell and Sue Morton. They are quite dissimilar people, but I have learnt a great deal from each of them. They have showed an admirable quality&mdash;that is, to interpret my meanderings through my speech patterns and to eventually arrive at an understanding of what it was that I thought was important at a particular committee report writing process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those committee inquiries have also provided me with many situations that readily come to mind. I will just mention a few because I do recognise the hour. Firstly, the powerful and respected report of the employment, education and training committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS> has become a great resource for the adult and community education sector. It is anticipated that this issue will be revisited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Rosemary Crowley&mdash;and I suppose Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne&mdash;will remember the surprisingly useful and effective inquiry in its report into the provision of physical education and sport in our schools. There have been several informative animal welfare or rural and regional affairs inquiries. In passing, I congratulate Bryant Burns on his chairmanship, which came through in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> number of those reports and which I remember now as I speak about the informative inquiries into the culling of feral animals in the Northern Territory and the transport of livestock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the inquiries have been informative, I have enjoyed the company of a varied collation of colleagues, which is really what we have here. By some sort of instinct&mdash;I do not know what it is&mdash;I have regularly taken many photographs, and I offer a friendly warning to those who are paying attention: I have an amazing collection of photographs and they include Amanda Vanstone rearranging the furniture in the Californian Research Institute&mdash;I think it was a foreshadowing of some further action later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have photos of Rosemary Crowley enthusing about an equal employment program in a mayoral office somewhere in South America; I think it was in Argentina. The photo is great. I do not do her an injustice when I say I do not think she understood what the title was, but it was something about equality of women. It looked good and she was very enthusiastic about it. I have a photo of Mal Colston bushwalking on the Cocos Islands. I also have a photograph of John Coates carefully inspecting a jetty on Christmas Island. I do not know what for, but he looked very attentive at the time. It could be useful to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a photo of David Brownhill commissioning a woodchipper in Kakadu. It was not a very big one but it was making woodchips there, and that could be useful. I have a photograph of Eric Abetz astride a bulldozer in a Tasmanian forest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a photograph which I hesitate to remind Bryant Burns of, but I am sure that he will put it in context. It was of me, Bryant and Paul Calvert at a dusty pub somewhere outside Darwin. It is not so much the photo; it is what was written above our heads. We had been cajoled into a position by the publican. Mine host was very friendly to us and said, `You fellows look as if you should come over to this corner. I've got a special seat for you.' We sat down, very relieved. I was sweating. I did not really want to walk anywhere but I was coaxed into this particular place. I will not tell the Senate what was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2488"> above our heads when we finally looked up but it was very apt for three hot, dusty and tired politicians. It implied that the sort of conversation that we were likely to conduct would not be very useful and would be quite closely related to what comes out of the back end of a buffalo. We looked like prize politicians sitting in that corner. I have a photo of it and I am keeping it to myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have found that photographs can be extremely useful in this place. Some of the language in here is colourful. There are many articulate professionals who do their best to convey word pictures but I have found that photographs can enhance the case that we make from time to time. There are only some senators that I have taken the trouble to sit beside during question time or at other times and share my photographs with. There has always been a purpose to it, though. Bob Collins especially found it very useful in his time as minister when I brought him photographs of all sorts of descriptions to take up issues with him. `Look, Bob, this road is in the wrong place. See, here's the photos,' or `This is the evidence that you should see about timber harvesting techniques.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I have thousands of photographs of Tasmanian forests. I have brought many of them into this place. Some of them show its intrinsic beauty but too many of those photographs&mdash;this is serious&mdash;show the waste and destruction of clear&hyphen;felling and other disastrous harvesting practices. I believe these photographs should be shared as widely as possible so that fully informed decisions can be made here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether, in this era of technological development, we can look forward to the time when we might scan into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some illustrative photographs to either justify our decisions or explain them. Perhaps we will follow the trend that we have been following for some time. When I first came to this position the office that I occupied had two electric typewriters in it and it was full of carbon paper, Tippex and those sorts of materials. I know that we look forward to a day when we should be able to use the technology which is available to enhance our decision making, and I offer, as I go out the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> door, the hope not only that the EET committee will conduct an inquiry that I have initiated, but also that the technology that is available will be used as wisely as we can to enhance our decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hesitate to start mentioning my colleagues and those others who are leaving at this time because I feel a very close bond with my team of fellow Democrats. I know if I start to list their qualities and characteristics I will not be able to finish the sentence without getting a little bit emotional about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to leave here. I think the team that I am part of now is one which has an honest purpose and a capacity to enhance the good government of Australia. I do not think I overstate that. I think I know enough about what is going on here now to know that we are doing important and useful things in the history of Australia&mdash;and I want to be part of it. Rather than listing you guys around me, I am going to trust you to continue what is being done&mdash;and I do not stop the boundary of friendship at these six colleagues. I trust the lot of you. I know enough of you well enough to know that you are here not for personal gain or just political crankiness. I do think there is good sense and purpose in this place. I have enjoyed the time I have been here and being part of that good sense and purpose. I trust you to do it properly&mdash;and I am going to come back soon and check up on you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must acknowledge the assistance and the support that I have had from the many support staff we have in this place. I thank Kearen and Bruce in transport and the attendants, whom I will not attempt to name individually. I have had great assistance and support from the Senate support staff and the attendants who are here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will say before I leave this place that reducing the government's contribution to the Senate's resources I believe is nothing less than compromising democracy&mdash;and I mean that. I think it is foolish to reduce the resources available to those who are trying to make the best decisions in the best interests of this country. I have mentioned technology should be used and could be explored further. I will say that those human services which are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2489"> provided to the representatives of the people of Australia attempt to ensure that the decisions are made properly, and reducing them is foolish. So as my way of thanking those who have assisted me in the provision of services and assistance I will say that those services and that assistance should not be reduced because they benefit the good decision making process of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will leave it at that because I recognise the time. Thank you for the good wishes that have been expressed by those who have spoken before me. I associate myself strongly with the wishes that Cheryl Kernot made with regard to others who are leaving this place now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief because I think it is appropriate. I wrote a rough draft of a speech I was proposing to give tonight and sent it across to my wife. She sent it back saying, `Do not give that. It's just not you. It is not gracious enough for you. It is not dignified enough for you. It is not the sort of speech I would expect from you.' She also said, `In all our political career, it is the first time I have asked that you not do one single thing,' so I will not be making a speech of the substance I proposed. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that does not stop me saying there is no excuse for lack of dignity or grace in giving speeches. I was very sad tonight when Senator Knowles came in here in the most aggressive and unpleasant way, given that my family have committed themselves to her in a very personal way. When she could not afford to be a candidate, one of my dear friends paid her salary for 18 months just to allow her to be a candidate. That is the sort of thing that hurts not me but my wife and our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, having said that can I say that I have only ever held this position for the Liberal Party in trust. When they choose to remove me or I move away, it is for somebody else to hold that trust. I have never taken the view that I have some mortgage on what the Liberal Party thinks about me, but something that I have become very conscious of in recent times&mdash;and it is perhaps not so conscious in the minds of other people&mdash;is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how it affects your own family. My wife, Esther, said to me just recently, `Noel, you never asked me, "Did you want to go into politics?" I assumed that you would accept that I would go in.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no secret we lost triplets. There is no secret that we lost a little boy of two years of age as a result of my insistence in respect of a Liberal Party meeting. It is no secret that my little baby, Andrea, who is now 24 years of age and having done law, resents the price she had to pay of having a father who was involved in politics. It is no secret that my son, who is now a pilot at 18, resents the fact that he was coerced into spending most of his time in politics. It is no secret that my little boy, Russell, who is now 20, bitterly resented the contribution his father made to politics. They found themselves in an environment which was so totally different to that of all their friends, all their relations and all their mates. When I first came into this parliament, they were babies. I have been here 15 years. My eldest child is 24 years of age. So they have paid an enormous price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Esther said to me tonight that she had never asked me not to give a speech, how could I not agree with her? I wanted to talk about the contribution I had made to some of my colleagues who are in here, how they got here and at what price it cost me personally to get them here. But my dear wife said, `Noel, be gracious, even if it's not becoming of you.' So that I am going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just say two or three things of consequence to me. Firstly, I say to you, Robert Hill, that I know how things have been tough for you. In all the time I have been in this parliament you have been my best friend. I always assume that the decisions you have made in respect of me have been in the interests of the Liberal Party and not in my interests; but how I care for you will not change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never found the Labor Party&mdash;with the exception of Peter Walsh, who had a natural aversion to me&mdash;to be offensive, or unpleasant or unkind to me. I did an interview tonight on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>, I think it was, and I was asked about the Democrats.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last few months I have been very much concerned with those two hourglasses which sit at the front of the chamber on the table in front of the clerks. I have been very concerned with them because, as we know, theoretically time is infinite; but, because we are all human beings, time is in fact quite finite indeed&mdash;we are all mortal. For me, time has become extremely finite and time, in some respects, finishes at midnight next Sunday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do not want anybody to think that because I have been in the Senate for only a short period of time I have lacked anything of the enjoyment of being in the Senate.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking with a friend the other night in Sydney about the problems of the world, our rumination on the problems of the world and what we might do about them. She said to me suddenly, `You know, the world would be a helluva lot better place if everybody had happy and contented sex lives.' I thought that added a certain perspective to our deliberations here and I thought it was an idea that probably had a great deal to commend it. Without any disrespect to the Senate, I have to say that the next best thing to sex is the life of a senator.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RC6">Senator WHEELWRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said the next best thing. I have never in my life enjoyed anything quite so much as being a senator. It has without a doubt been the happiest period of my life so far. I like absolutely everything about the job, even down to the parquetry floor on which we walk. It has been my pleasure since I have been in this chamber, and it will be just 13 months, that I have seen the Senate at its worst&mdash;I have seen the Senate in the first week that I got here do only 1&half; minutes of government business and in the following week do only three minutes of government business&mdash;and the Senate at its best.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen the absolute white heat of debate in this chamber, where I have seen positions which are very strongly held also very strongly put. I also hope that in my participation on those occasions I have shown that I can take it as well as dish it out. Senator Vanstone earlier, when I put this view to her, said, `Yes, well of course you've got it quite the wrong way around; you shouldn't dish it out unless you can take it.' There is a great deal to be said for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been lucky enough to see major legislation moulded on the very floor of this chamber in consultation between the minister at the table and other senators and at a level of informality which I think defies any form of procedure, but nevertheless brings out what I believe is good government for this country. The best thing of all that I have seen in this chamber is the Senate completely quiet and patient with a senator who is no great public speaker but who is nevertheless very sincere.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2491">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also found through the committees that there has been untold intellectual stimulation in this place. One of the great things about being a senator is that everybody wants to tell you their story. If you are a senator, every Australian who has something to contribute or something to add or has some great concern about this country wants to come and tell you about it. They want to tell you how they pushed forward the bounds of goodness in this country, of intellectual life and all the rest of it. It is a great source of stimulation and I think it is not one that could easily be found anywhere else. If you are a senator, you do indeed meet the best and the brightest that Australia has to offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was lucky enough to be on the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee, which is the pick of the committees. Our work on that committee did not leave us much time to consider other areas of public life. I would certainly like to thank Robert King and Frances Michaelis who worked so hard on that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have, through the committees, been able to participate in some of the great issues of public policy today. I have been able to contribute to inquiries into Australia's role in the information superhighway, which has to be, if anything is, the great future for our children; into marine pollution; and into the education of Australia's great artists. This is not to mention the ongoing inquiries that I now have to leave on Telstra, on uranium and on industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other great privilege of a senator is being allowed to travel and I hope it is a privilege that all of you hold dear and intend to hang on to. In travelling around Australia as a senator you get to meet your fellow Australians. In my case it has been from Townsville to Jabiru, to the Great Sandy Desert, and even to Muroroa Atoll. I believe that one of the great privileges we have is to talk to other Australians to find out what it is they feel about the country and what it is they want from you as a parliamentarian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I have one small regret, it is that I have had no nominated spouse equivalent to travel with me. I think that probably says something <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about this place because I do not know how you could have a partner. I think it is probably one of the most difficult things of all. The great enjoyment that I have taken out of this place has been in some respects because I am a single man. I have a great sympathy for those people who have families and particularly those with young children. I think anything that can be done in this place to think more about how families fit in will benefit not just ourselves but the country at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also say that I have loved the theatre of the place. This has to be the greatest stage in the nation. I came into the incredible boredom of question time as a government backbencher, where all you can do is sit there and look at that praetorian guard of ministers in front of you with their spears advanced, their shields up as they stand there and withstand everything that can be thrown at them from across the other side of the chamber&mdash;the arrows, the knives, the stones, the boiling oil, the kitchen sink; anything that might fall to hand. And, of course, as a government backbencher you wince occasionally at some of the very heavy body blows. You see the knees of ministers sag for a while before they recover and you just hope that that thin line does not get broken. But for the rest of the time you have got to depend upon Aussie's coffee to keep your interest up because there is really not a great deal that you can do about it if that thin line breaks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also had the opportunity of being on the other side where you see a quite different sight. You see a pack of slavering hounds, bloodthirsty Goths and Vandals roaming around looking for any opportunity, any chink of light they can see on the other side; where everybody is encouraged to get up and have a go, do your best, do anything that you can think of and by all means charge in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having seen the wonderful order, this almost Roman imperial order of government and discipline, it has been an extraordinary experience for me to come over here and see this marauding pack of opposition who are exactly the same people! They just seem to have gone through this strange change as they cross the chamber.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2492">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, the minor parties have always appeared like the crowd at Wimbledon, watching the ball go from one side of the chamber to the other side of the chamber. However, unlike the crowd at Wimbledon, the minor parties are not above climbing over the fence and having a bit of a swing themselves. Even more occasionally they have had their arms ripped off for their trouble and they go back perhaps sorrier for the experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As everyone has said, there are too many people to thank. You can never mention everyone. Given the lateness of the hour and the time that is available, I will assume that most of the people who are going out with me have had enough nice things said about them without me adding to it. But I would particularly like to thank my very overworked and very underpaid staff who work for wages which are hopeless, who fill in overtime forms which are hopeless indications of the work they do. They are four people who are, I believe, the living proof that money is not the great motivator. It is the noble things in life that motivate people. It is questions of principle, conviction, commitment and compassion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No amount of money can pay the four people who have worked for me to do the work they have to the standard they have and with the commitment they have shown. And in that respect, Kathrine Boyle has provided my social policy advice, Ophelia Cowell has given me advice on the environment, Rod Smith is my economic adviser and Cass Wilkinson has advised on communications and the arts. Those people have contributed more to my work in this place than anybody else and certainly me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly would also like to thank the staff of the Senate. When I first came into this place, Cass could not believe it. On her first visit to this parliament she said, `Tom, I just cannot cope with all this deference these people show you.' And I suppose there is a certain humility that all senators find from the respect with which they are treated by the staff of the Senate and I hope all of us can say that we deserve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One person I must particularly mention is Cleaver Elliott. Ophelia said to me when she <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> first met him, and she is an environmental scientist, that Cleaver was a perfect example of a species adapting to its environment. She thought that his feet were adapted for padding down the corridor, that his ears and nose adapted to sensing the currents and eddies of the place and that his skin had entirely adapted to artificial light. But from working with Cleaver, I have to say that for me he represents the heart and soul of the place; he really does. And I think his respect for the institutions of the Senate and for the purpose of the Senate is something which befits all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank Hansard because I believe in this place we do not work with our hands, despite the reference to Solvol at every opportunity. We do not work with our hands: we work with our words and the keeper of our words is Hansard. I must say that I am constantly amazed at the quality of work that comes back to me from Hansard. The written word is a fundamentally different form of expression to the spoken word and I am delighted by the fact that when I get stuff back from Hansard I very seldom have to make anything more than the most trivial correction. It is extremely good as far as I am concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are being too kind. I know it is my last contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have taken great comfort from standing order 187 which says that speeches should not be read. I think it has been one of the great disciplines of this place because not reading a speech does clarify the mind and it also reminds you that there is an audience. It instructs us that the two things we have to do is to inform and to persuade. And on the subject of the audience, I have to say too that I have tried as much as I can to be conscious of the public gallery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without a doubt the most unnerving experience that I have had in this place was about two weeks into my term, when a large group of people came to observe a debate about the importation of pig meat from overseas. They lined these galleries until they were full. They sat very respectfully. They did not interrupt. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2493"> They did not intervene in the debate at all. They neither applauded, nor groaned. They just sat there watching us for day after day. I have to say it was one of the most unnerving experiences I have had in this chamber. It was a humbling experience. I know only a tiny proportion of people ever come to see parliament, but I try as much as I can to remind myself that there is always someone watching us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I would like to say, too, is that I know I have not always been able to maintain my own discipline but I have tried as much as I can not to interject. I think that one of the fundamental rights of any senator is the right to be heard. As much as I can, I have tried to respect that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as my Labor colleagues are concerned, I have to thank all of them for their extraordinary encouragement and the very great support that they have shown me in my time here. Particularly, I would like to thank my colleague, Shayne Murphy. He and I used to talk across the aisle so much when we were on the other side that they decided to sit us together when we came over here. He is the unsung hero of Muroroa. The world needs to know that he was far more gung&hyphen;ho than ever I was about the expedition to Muroroa. It was only the luck of the ballot that meant that I went through the 12&hyphen;mile zone with Greenpeace, rather than he. His contribution to that exercise and his commitment is something that has seldom been recognised. I have to thank him greatly for his encouragement and particularly for his sense of humour, which provides a unique perspective on this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to thank my New South Wales factional colleagues, Senators Forshaw, Neal and West. One of the most remarkable things about the New South Wales Right is that, the further you get from Sussex Street, the stronger the tribal loyalties become. The closer you go to the centres of power, the more divided we are. I have certainly found that. The trip to Canberra has been a unifying experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank John Faulkner. We play it very hard in New South Wales&mdash;very hard indeed. John said earlier that our working relationship had been a bit rough&mdash;I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think that is putting it mildly. In the period that he and I worked together in Sussex Street, there was a period of over a year when we did not speak to each other at all&mdash;not at all. We did not even say, `Good morning,' or `Pass the salt.' It was a very difficult period and I think it says something about his sense of graciousness that he was prepared to forgive and forget. All I can say about him is that I could not have got any more support from any leader or any friend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another person I would like to thank is Robert Ray. When I came in here I thought, `Anyone who frightens Graham Richardson'&mdash;and Graham said he was frightened of him&mdash;`absolutely terrifies me.' All I can say about Robert is that I have certainly been straight with him and I think he has been straight with me. He has been a great source of encouragement and, particularly, strategic advice. I cannot explain it, but it may be the fact that both he and I depended on taxi driving for our living at one point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another person I would like to thank is Gerry Jones. He truly is a gentle man. He is about the best person a new senator could meet for showing you through the highways and byways of the place, for catching you before you trip, and generally providing that </PARA>
<PARA>wise counsel and stopping you from looking like a complete dork when you really do not know what you are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other person I have to thank too is our new whip, Chris Evans, with whom I sat when I first came in, and I have to share one thing with the Senate. When I first sat down I looked at the duty roster and I said to Chris Evans, `What is this all about?' And he said, `Oh mate, don't worry about that, I just ignore it.' I will say, though, in his defence, that a duty roster is very different in opposition as opposed to government, and so I can understand the newfound enthusiasm that he finds and the great need for us on our side to respect it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I can say is that it has been a happy experience to find that you can have opponents in this place but not enemies, and in that respect I would like to mention two people: Senator Alan Ferguson and Senator Sandy Macdonald who have offered me <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2494"> friendship, and it is something that I have been very happy to accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank my landlady and my friend Amanda Little who has added the very much needed social dimension to my time in Canberra. I am one of the happy people who can say that I do not just come here to work, I do actually have another life outside of this chamber.</PARA>

That is my last speech, unless you all want to come back on the weekend&mdash;and if you do, I am more than happy to come. I will happily oblige.

Senator Gerry Jones is also a member of the honourable club of apparatchiks&mdash;state secretaries. In fact, that is where I first met Gerry. When I came into this place Gerry had been here for a while and he was already a whip. I appreciated the friendly advice that Gerry gave me and, above all else&mdash;again, in the best sense of Labor Party tradition&mdash;for creating that comradeship that makes for the strength of our party.</PARA>

They are both equally valuable to the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to those senators in other parties who are leaving. Baden Teague is a fellow senator from South Australia. I have to say that I hope that Baden's views do not belong to a shrinking minority in the Liberal Party <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2495"> because, whatever else we may say to him as an opponent, his views do carry on, in the best traditions of Hobbes, and other great liberals from the nineteenth century, a tradition within the conservative party of Australia. I do not know how he does it. I do not know how he has put up with it for so long, but I congratulate him for sticking to his guns. He probably felt very lonely at times. I also congratulate Senator Teague on being one of the very first Liberals in this parliament to stand up and declare himself in favour of an Australian as a head of state. The contribution that he is already making in South Australia to that is significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid Spindler had a different view from me in many of the areas I touched on when I was a minister in the industry portfolio. But I have to say that we did agree on one thing, and this is in the book. When we served together on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, we were the only two senators from any party that recommended that the corporations law should be amended in this country to have a standing power of divestiture against big companies. I still believe that one day that will occur. I also believe that we did well on that committee to start the work to give small business a better deal through unconscionable conduct. Hopefully that bill will be carried in this parliament. I say to Senator Spindler that I did not always agree with him but I certainly understood his commitment to Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert Bell gave me a hard time when I represented education in this place but I respected his commitment and understanding and, above all else, his knowledge of the portfolio. At times it made me rely very heavily on my advisers, who were leaning over the balcony suggesting that I say this or say that to what Senator Bell was putting up. I suspect Senator Bell has a fair chance of coming back and I certainly hope he will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chamarette&mdash;I have to be honest about what I say here&mdash;when she came in with Senator Margetts, added a certain proof to the theory that chaos does work in politics, from time to time. As a minister it was not always easy negotiating an outcome on legislation in detail. Whatever else we may <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have said at times about the policies that Senator Chamarette pushed, she said them with conviction and usually she could not be persuaded to change her mind when she believed her view was correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last two people I want to mention both come from the Liberal Party but one of them, Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne, is no longer in the Liberal Party. He was a controversial figure within the Liberal Party and a controversial figure in this Senate. He also made controversial speeches. I am not in any way going to carry the flag for Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne. I think he is more than capable of looking after himself. In his speech tonight he gave, I think, the soundest piece of advice to the new government that I have heard.</PARA>

The Democrats have only been around for a short period and they hold the balance of power, almost, in the Senate. But every day a whole range of ministers in the new government get up and abuse the Democrats in the most startling way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Crichton&hyphen;Browne's advice is probably, for the government, very reasonable. I hope they do not take any notice of it because they are making our job easier in this place. When I was chairman of the joint foreign affairs and defence committee, Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne was also a member. Even though he expressed views on many occasions in this place that I would have no brook with, he was a very constructive member of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I also have to say that I had a chance to get to know him through the work of that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2496"> committee, on the trips that committee made, and on visits overseas on delegations. That is where I became aware of some of the personal tragedy that Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne has had in his family. If some people could remove the hyperbole from around this discussion, it would give some aspect of understanding, possibly, to some of the personal controversy that his family has been through. I do not want to go into it, but I just want to make that comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Senator Baume. Senator Baume made a valedictory speech here in typical Michael Baume form. He was still throwing hand grenades; still making a political point, and still jousting. And I respect him for that. But he would not, therefore, respect me for getting up and making a hypocritical speech, saying, `Michael, go with our best wishes. Michael, we appreciate your contribution.' That would be hypocritical. He would not expect it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that for many years he was given the job of being the head kicker. He was given the job in the Liberal Party of raising issues when no&hyphen;one else would take that job, and from time to time, we strongly rejected and refuted his actions. I believe that was the role he was given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At times he made some dreadful mistakes. He made the mistake about the consistent attack on the former Prime Minister. He made an attack, at the time of the last New South Wales state election, on the Independent member for Manly, which he got completely wrong. But that was the job that he was given by the Liberal Party, and he carried it out on the basis that, if there were no smoke, he would make smoke then claim there was fire. That was the tactic he used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is being rewarded for that job he did for the Liberal Party with an appointment overseas. I have to say to Michael Baume that, if he puts his energies constructively into that job, I suspect he will do it quite reasonably. I will be reasonable. I think he could do the job quite reasonably if he sticks to the form of what the job entails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do want to say, as one of those who have jousted with Senator Baume in this place <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> again and again&mdash;and he made remarks tonight that may have been directed at me&mdash;</PARA>

We disagreed with it completely. We believe that he got it wrong on many occasions. But that was the role he chose to play and, even at the end, even in his valedictory, he was still there jousting, still throwing the odd hand grenade.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is time to go home. I normally do not speak in valedictories, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  records will show. I am getting up tonight to tell a story, and the reason that I am getting up tonight to tell a story is that, after a very long and distinguished parliamentary career, Gerry Jones is leaving the Senate. Can I say to you, Senator Wheelwright, that that experience you had with Gerry Jones in the new Parliament House is the same as the experience I had with Gerry Jones as the whip in the Old Parliament House, as a new senator from the Northern Territory. I can warmly endorse the assistance that Gerry Jones has given in that capacity to all new senators in this place, and it has been appreciated by us all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I got up because Gerry was actually going to tell this story himself. I think that he forgot, or he was overcome by emotion.

I hope your wife was listening to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, out of courtesy, I should acknowledge very quickly all of those other senators that are leaving. Mr President, first of all, yourself. I know that I have on occasions been the bane of your life. I am really sorry. But I always thought you were big enough to handle it, so I never let it worry me. But can I join all senators tonight, and Senator Schacht particularly, in acknowledging, not just the distinguished way in which you have carried out <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2497"> your office, but the contribution that you have made over the years to the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chris Schacht was right. You hear these stories about Robert Ray, Faulkner and yourself and, in the Northern Territory sense, me&mdash;the number crunchers. And it is nonsense. The number crunchers, by and large, are the people in political parties who are the ones who are prepared to do the work, and that really is what it gets down to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, you have made an extremely significant contribution on the national level to the Labor Party. You have distinguished the role of President, and I am sorry to see you leaving. I have got no doubt that your association with the Australian Labor Party will continue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne spoke in here, and I will simply mention Noel now in the same context.

He was an excellent chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other thing I want to say about Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne is this, and this is not something new&mdash;I said it at the time. I am not interested in canvassing those very painful issues that Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne was involved in. I do not want to go into that. As far as I am concerned, what happened between Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne and his wife should have been left between them. Leaving aside the merits of the issues, I am not even interested in what you might think about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> All I want to say about Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne is this: in respect of what was done, I am not even going to talk about that; in respect of how it was done&mdash;obtaining that material by whomever&mdash;I do not know who it was. Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne has named people. I have got no idea who it was. But whoever did it: it was a low act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those colleagues, old friends, Bryant Burns, Tom Wheelwright, young friends. When Tom first came into this Senate, all us old <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> roughnuts said, `My God, an economically literate senator: how are we going to handle this?'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid, you are a gentleman and a scholar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert Bell, I will miss you. Senator Gerry Jones mentioned tonight the habit he had over the years of collecting notes. He did it by design; I only did it by accident&mdash;I cannot collect things. But I have got piles of notes; I have got some great ones from Paul Keating that were passed down the cabinet table to me on a few occasions. There are some very funny ones from John Kerin that I have kept over the years, but some hilarious ones from Robert Bell. Robert, in terms of the entertainment you have given me in the time you have been here inside this chamber, particularly at question time, and the notes that you have passed me, I have kept all of your notes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you something else I have kept: the present from your daughter. She saw me on television in question time and she sent me this.

It has got a miniature meal inside the matchbox. Thank your daughter on my behalf, Robert. Again, it has been a solid contribution from you.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bryant Burns: best of luck in your future career. I hope you do not buy that property you were thinking of buying, because you will be eternally broke. Even though you want to become a pastoralist, don't. I hope you might start voting National. Don't become a pastoralist. Just take your <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> retirement in the way you should, because that is what you deserve. You were the chairman of committees that I was on. I was chairman of a committee that you were deputy chairman of. I respected your judgment, at different times. I always thought you were rather misdirected because you were of a different political faith from mine, but I thank you for your comradeship. I wish you a very happy retirement. You replaced George Georges, whom I enjoyed as well. He was actually more left wing than you were, but I appreciated your help and support in our committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Noel Crichton&hyphen;Brown: you are leaving the chamber at the end of this session. I am very sad that you have actually decided to leave this place as an Independent. That is really sad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember you, Gerry Jones, from the first time I spoke in the Old Parliament House. You stood aside for me so I could give my maiden speech. You were a top whip. I enjoyed being the whip for the National Party when you were the whip for the Labor Party. I enjoyed your company when we were at the United Nations because I think that that was one of the most memorable things I have done since I have been in this place. You were great company, and a great support and help. I do not think that anyone who saw us when we were at the United Nations knew whether we were from the government or from the opposition. So I thank you for your friendship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid Spindler: the time I spent with you on the family law act inquiry was quite something. We tried to achieve something, and you seconded the motion. We actually agreed to the inquiry together, and we got it. It took a fair bit of getting but we got an inquiry into something that actually affects so many people's lives. We tried to do something about the break&hyphen;up in marriages in Australia, and that is something you can be quite proud about in leaving this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baden Teague: I always enjoyed your company. We were not exactly on the same side sometimes, but whenever we played tennis, we definitely were. In some of the tennis matches we had against the House of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2501"> Representatives, we played against the best they had, the MacKellars and the Moores. Moore, of course, played Wimbledon and there were times we led them four&hyphen;nil but they always beat us. One of the beautiful things about playing with Baden was that he could always serve his second serve just as hard as his first serve and it didn't always go in. I think at one stage we might have served about four or five double faults in a row. But he is a great person to play with, a great friend, and a great comrade in that area. He always played his tennis like he played it in this place; he had great character and he had great purpose in what he was trying to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I must say something about the tennis cup he gave me, because in this chamber we hold the cup. We have only won it twice. We won it last time in 1992. We have to be challenged now by the House of Representatives to have another match and that will happen, I suppose, in the near future. We will most probably retain it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michael Beahan: our President, brought down by your own party; I am sorry you have left the chair at this particular stage. But I think that we can say some things about you.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Christabel Chamarette: you are in the same corridor as I live in.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom Wheelwright: you said that you are a great friend of Sandy Macdonald's. As you come from New South Wales, you must be good; but I think you are very misdirected as well. It is sad that you are leaving so quickly because you have made a bigger contribution and showed more purpose and dexterity than a lot of the people who are left in here from the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michael Baume: sad to see you leave. I wish you luck in your new venture. You have been a good friend on the tennis court, in parliament and also, before you came into this place, as a member of the House of Representatives. On the cricket field, you were a great cricketer. I am looking forward to seeing you in your new venture in a different place. I hope I can visit you and do something with you.</PARA>

Firstly, I start by saying that I have not had much to do with Senators Bell, Crichton&hyphen;Browne, Teague and Baume in my time in the Senate, so I do not intend to say too much about them, other than to say that Senator Bell was a very good chair of the Finance and Public Administration Committee when I served on it, and that I have always found Senator Teague to be a very genuine bloke and a gentleman.</PARA></TALK.START>

Michael Beahan: a distinguished Labor career&mdash;a professional, effective president, has more to contribute. Tom Wheelwright: an enthusiast, an economist&mdash;too good to stay on the interchange bench.

Bryant, I really enjoyed my time with you and I wish you all the best in your retirement and my best regards to Nanette, as well.</PARA>

Once upon a time, we used to have wonderful competitions where we took on all the embassies. We always got beaten, but it did not matter because it was great for public relations and international relations. I am afraid that has all gone. But I am sure somebody will bob up along the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the President, Michael Beahan: I have not always agreed with his decisions but, I tell you what, you would not meet a better gentleman than Michael Beahan. The thing I like about Michael Beahan is he likes Tasmania. I have always been very proud and pleased to know that, when he comes to Tasmania, sometimes he comes to see me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Christabel Chamarette: a very gentle person with strong ideas and probably a great loss to the Senate. The Senate is a place where you have different views and we are all elected by proportional representation. Christabel put forward a particular point of view that probably did not always agree with the mainstream of politics&mdash;with the major parties on either side of politics. But Christabel did it in a very honourable and special way. I must say that, as a Temporary Chairman of Committees, I always respected the way she put her views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom Wheelwright was here one minute and gone the next. I think he may have been a great politician if he had had the chance to hang around, because Tom had a very good economic background. That leads me to two other people&mdash;and I will first of all deal with Robert Bell. Robert Bell is not in my party, but I have to say that he is a true Tasmanian and I will always remember him for that. He <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2503"> stood up for the rights of Tasmania and he pushed those views very hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the fact that he used to grow very good radishes and his sister has married a very good friend of mine who is in radio down there, Robert Bell, in my opinion, would have been far more advantageous to Tasmania and to this Senate than the person who is going to replace him. I mean that, Robert. Whilst in the last few weeks we have seen a succession of motions put by the government that the Democrats have not agreed with, at the end of the day at least you would have understood the rationale of what we were trying to do. I have always respected the fact that you have always stood up for Tasmania in the way that you have. I really am sorry to see you go, mate; I really am. And I am sorry that we will not be able to get any more of the radishes you grow in your backyard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to the last person I had to speak about&mdash;my old friend Michael Baume. I will not spend much time on Michael. He is a character. He is a person I first met in Hobart&mdash;and I will not mention under what circumstances. I was not a member of parliament in those days, but I have always admired him. I always admired, in those days, his expertise in wine and, since then, I have admired his expertise in everything else that goes. He is a great raconteur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was my next door neighbour in this place for a long, long time. Everything I ever did I used to run past him. You would go in and he was a bloke who would have a pile of books, with a few odd socks and sandwiches and bananas underneath them. You would pull over a file and find a sandwich that was about three weeks old sitting there. He is a great beaver, worker and worrier for the Liberal Party cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell you what&mdash;Michael Baume could not go out on a higher note than he is going out on now, because everything he has ever aimed for has happened. Michael, you have achieved everything you wanted to achieve in spades. I am very proud and very pleased to see what you are doing. And I am going to miss you, because I do not think there is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> anybody around this place who is ever going to listen to my weak jokes again.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2504">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a person makes their first speech in this parliament as always they get congratulated by all the senators in the chamber. After I made my first speech there was one person who came around to my office afterwards when I was with my family and that was Senator Baden Teague. He came up to me and said, `You know, I appreciated what you said in your first speech'. I had spoken about the importance of the trade union movement and its importance in a democracy. He told me that he had a strong belief in a free trade union movement as an essential part of a democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that at the time I thought, `Who is this guy?' But I have come to very much respect the genuine beliefs and commitments that Senator Baden Teague holds. It has only been in the last few weeks when I became chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that I realised the depth of knowledge he has in that area and the incredible work that he has put into that committee. I have to say that I am very disappointed that I will not have&mdash;and I know other senators on that committee will feel the same way&mdash;the services of Senator Teague in the future. Of course, the same applies to Senator Jones and Senator Burns, who are also long&hyphen;standing members of that committee. So to you, Baden, thank you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to Robert Bell: one of the first committees I served on in this Senate was the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I met Robert there and the first thing I noticed was that he did not have a tie on. I liked that about him. I have never been quite game enough to take that punt myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He and I and the late Senator Olive Zakharov went to the Aboriginal community at Yuendumu in the Northern Territory as part of an investigation into open learning. I learned then, and I have since come to appreciate, the expertise that Robert has in the field of education. I appreciate the hard work and the contribution that he has made to the committees in this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the comments made earlier. I think it is a damn shame for this Senate that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Bell is not going to be back here after this weekend. I hope, Robert, that you can get back. I have appreciated your friendship and your company on two committees of this parliament&mdash;the education committee and the scrutiny of bills committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to Senators Sid Spindler, Christabel Chamarette and Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne, I have not had as much to do with them but I accept that they have deeply held commitments and beliefs and I just say that I wish them well in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Michael Baume is a very controversial figure. People on this side of the chamber have expressed their views about Michael Baume and, in many respects, I agree with what they have said in respect of his contribution in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Baume has a strange obsession with pigs, so much so that he likes to keep them hanging around his neck most of the time. I might say that, whenever he rose to his feet to give us another one of what I thought were disgraceful diatribes and attacks upon the former Prime Minister, it reminded me of the children's story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf. The ending of that children's story, as we know, is that you can huff and you can puff but you can never blow the house down. In all of his attempts, Senator Baume never did really make any dent in the integrity and the reputation of the former Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually also had a bit of contact with Senator Baume in other respects, because his office is in the same building in the city as my office. I would run into him quite a bit in the building and the car park. I have actually seen the back of his car, and found a few of those half&hyphen;eaten sandwiches, as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also used to run into Michael at the opera. Here was the guy from the Senate who was continually spewing out bile and venom at the Labor Party; yet, at the opera, we had pleasant evenings on a number of occasions, talking about opera. I think he always liked the gory bits. I just hope that some of the intelligence and obvious ability that he does really have can now be put to far better use than it has been put to in this chamber.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2505">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ralph Willis has got the privilege of representing the opposition at the United Nations later this year&mdash;I think I can tell the Senate that, as a returning officer for the party. Ralph said to me today, `You know, the funny thing is going to be that, one of these days, Paul Keating is going to go to New York. Certain respects are accorded to former Prime Ministers. Senator Baume might just have to go and meet him at the airport, in his capacity as the government's representative for New York.' As they say in the ad, `Hey, I'd like to see that!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now turn&mdash;very quickly, but very importantly&mdash;to the departing Labor senators. Gerry Jones, as everyone says, is just a wonderful, gentle person. He is always smiling. That is a great thing. Whenever you went to the whip's office, when Gerry was the whip, Joan Harvey greeted you with a smile and then Gerry greeted you with a smile. Gerry did not always have as good news as Joan did, with respect to particular matters such as pairs or whatever. But he was always very helpful and I always appreciated his advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that I had just started when Gerry asked me, `As a new senator, you are going to go onto certain committees. What areas are you interested in?' I said, `I am interested in industrial relations and a number of other areas.' He said, `Right, good, I will take that into account.' Of course, as always, as a new senator you get lumbered with the committees that other people want to get off, so I got put on the scrutiny of bills committee&mdash;I thought, `My God, what the heck is that?'&mdash;and the employment, education and training committee. I am still on those two committees and I am very pleased to be still on them. Gerry, you did me a big favour, because through that I have managed to have an association with people such as Robert Bell, Barney Cooney and Mal Colston. Thank you very much for the advice. Most recently, I joined the Senate foreign affairs committee. Whilst I have just come on to that committee, I have very quickly come to learn what a great contribution Gerry Jones made to that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Years ago, Bryant Burns was a union official in Queensland and I was based in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sydney. The first time I remember having any major communication with him was when I appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. Senator Winston Crane, Senator David Brownhill and Senator West will remember this. I was then the general secretary of the AWU. The committee was inquiring into New Zealand shearers. I thought you brought down a bloody terrible report! It was a shocker! You kept telling us that all the evidence was anecdotal. I have been on a few committees in this parliament since then. I have to say that, quite often, anecdotal evidence gets a far better hearing than I think we got on that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding the results and the report of the committee, I appreciated Senator Bryant Burns very much. He had a genuine belief in what the union was trying to put to the committee at that time. We were very much concerned about the jobs of Australian shearers. We were dealing with an issue that people said was racist and so on. Bryant and I have continued to talk about that inquiry. I know that Bryant Burns shares with me a concern about seeing workers in industries, particularly traditional industries like shearing, lose their jobs because of a range of factors, including the freer movement of labour between Australia and New Zealand, and technology and other matters. I very much appreciated the opportunity when I was on the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs of continuing my friendship with Bryant and our discussions about union matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As everyone has said, Michael Beahan has been a superb President of a very difficult chamber. I have often sat here and wondered whether he would ever name anyone and, if so, what would happen. I was so delighted to hear the story put by Senator Collins tonight. Michael really has performed the task of President of the Senate with utmost distinction. I certainly believe that he will carry that experience on to a successful career outside the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, to our New South Wales `mate', in the true sense of the word, Tom Wheelwright. Tom took on the hardest job; that is, he was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2506"> No. 3 on the Senate ticket when he went into an election that did not look too good for us. Senator West knows what I am talking about. Tom was prepared to put his hand up and take on that task. He campaigned hard, long and with a commitment, notwithstanding that he knew just how hard the task was to get back in that election. The ALP in New South Wales, and our faction in particular, recognises his commitment and contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with all that has been said by other speakers, which is that Tom, in the short time he has been here, has made a tremendous contribution to the parliament. I have no doubt that he will continue to make a tremendous contribution in the political field in the future. Tom, as you know, the great thing about the New South Wales Right is that we do stick together. We get accused of a lot of things, such as being thugs and number crunchers and all that, but it is not really true. When you get people of the calibre of Senator Tom Wheelwright into this chamber and many others from the New South Wales Right who have served the parliament over the years, you can see that we actually have some pretty good people to put into politics. Tom sits at the top of that list. To Tom and all the others, I give my best wishes for the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will first turn briefly to two of my colleagues who are leaving the chamber. I have listened to many speeches about Michael Baume and I listened to his speech tonight. One theme which has come through is that you were given a job to do and you did it as your light saw it. Most of our time in this chamber was spent trying to control you, Michael! You had a particular passion and goal. I do not think it was a job that was given to you. You are a very courageous senator. You have raised issues that, as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> someone else mentioned, many would have found difficult to raise. You have copped an enormous amount of flack in this chamber, but you have come through it all with shining colours. In my view, Michael, you have made a great contribution to this chamber. You have made a superb contribution to the Liberal Party. In my view, you will be very sorely missed in this chamber. I certainly wish you well. I hope that our paths will cross again, wherever that may be, Senator Baume.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many have commented on the characteristics Senator Teague has which make him unusual in any party, certainly in the Liberal Party. Every party can afford to have one of you, Baden Teague, but I am not sure that we can afford to have two of you. Occasionally on the front page of the paper I have seen Senator Teague quoted as dealing with a problem with one of the Liberal Party's policies as he saw it. From time to time, we wished to see you on some front pages for attacking the Labor Party. I am sure that you did but that you just did not get that front page coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baden, you have a view of the world that you have held with great sincerity. I certainly wish you well. From time to time, we have had our disputes and differences. They have always been conducted in a very civilised manner. I certainly wish you well as the years go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne is not here. It has been a very painful period for those of us who have known Noel. I certainly hope that Noel finds more peace with his wife and children in the years to come. It is worth recording that a major factor in the development of the modern committee system that we now enjoy in this chamber was Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2507">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a lot of compliments directed to you, Mr President. I listened particularly to your speech. I will read it with great care. One of the major reforms of this chamber would be to have an independent President. In the years to come, you may be able to share with the community some of your thoughts on that. If we want to enhance the role of this parliament, we have to enhance the role of the President and Mr Speaker. It seems to me that the way to do that is through the development of a truly independent Speaker. This is certainly what the Liberal Party is saying at the moment. I hope that that theme continues. I will look with interest at your contributions over the coming years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I looked in vain, Senator Spindler, for anything substantial that we have actually agreed on. We have had many exchanges over the years in which you have been here. It seems an astonishingly short time. We came in together. Happily I remain, but you are leaving. The energy with which you have tackled the causes that have interested you is commendable. I certainly wish you well. You have set a cracking pace for the person who replaces you. It is, in my mind, a premature departure from the parliament. It may be a good thing for the Liberal Party, but it is a pity for the Democrats that you are leaving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Robert Bell: we have shared many committees together, and again we have had our fair share of debate and worked together on some reports. One thing you did not mention, and I was rather hoping you would, was one occasion where a senator was removed from this chamber in the last six years. The true story of that, Senator Bell, has never come out. I wonder whether as the night wears on and perhaps you share a drink with Sid Spindler you might fully inform him of the reasons why that particular event occurred, but I will certainly say no more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Wheelwright: I think that the contribution you have made in a remarkably short period of time has been most worthwhile. You are a bit different, I have to say, from the image that many of us have of the Labor Party as we sit across the chamber. It is very rare, and I have to say that in my own experience I do not know whether I have ever <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heard it said before, that someone has spoken about the Senate with such passion. In fact, I do not think that is the tradition of the Labor Party right up to this present day, though I am sure in the coming months and years they will come to appreciate the Senate in a far greater way. But you are, I think, the first from your party to have expressed a real passion for this chamber, and I have to say it is a passion I share. On a variety of issues we would certainly have a debate, but it is that passion for this chamber, that great love of the parliament which you have acquired in such a short period of time, which does mark your views as being a little bit different from some of the views that your colleagues have expressed over an exceedingly long period of time. I welcome that change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Burns: I have often had this image of you, as political parties change, liberal parties change, labor parties change, that to my mind you have always been what I pictured as the traditional Labor man, and I think that came through in some of the speeches this evening. I think that many of the views you have put have been what I would describe as traditional Labor views. They are views which I may not share but they have been expressed with a great force and sincerity by yourself, and I certainly wish you well in the years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Gerry Jones: everyone has spoken to what a thoroughly decent person you are. I would certainly concur with that. My contacts with you have always been extremely constructive. From time to time we have perhaps spoken more frankly than we normally do, but we were able to do that in a way because we shared some confidences. I certainly wish you well and I associate myself with all those remarks that were made by colleagues about you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that concludes the list that is before me, except for Senator Christabel Chamarette, who is not with us. I have spoken to her privately. As manager of government business, I have certainly noted what an enormous challenge it is to deal with  her&mdash;in fact, the whole lot of you, to be quite frank, and certainly no&hyphen;one more so than Christabel. I certainly wish her well.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME>
<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, firstly, to farewell my New South Wales colleague Senator Michael Baume. Michael Baume and I have always been competitors, and this has stretched from the hothouse of Liberal Party preselection in New South Wales to the icebox of the Senate tennis courts at 7 o'clock on June mornings in Canberra&mdash;ah, the crunch of ice under the feet!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might surprise the Senate to learn that Baume and Tierney are two of the Senate's finest athletes. I always preferred to play doubles when I was playing with Michael&mdash;rather than singles, playing against Michael&mdash;because I have found that he plays tennis the way he plays politics. Wimbledon was nothing like our games. So, after an hour of tricky little drop shots over the net, which make you undertake heart attack inducing runs; full volleys to the pit of the stomach; sudden cross&hyphen;court shots that make you twist and slip over; and aces that leave you feeling humiliated, we would come away from the tennis courts very well prepared for a day in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michael Baume's dogged pursuit of the tennis ball and fine touch were only exceeded, I think, by his dogged pursuit of issues in the parliament and his eye for detail as a watchdog on the public service. I well remember that, in my first month in this place, Michael leaned over to me and excitedly pointed to page 16 of an obscure Auditor&hyphen;General's report on the internal operations of one of our more prestigious universities. I took his advice and took the issue up, made a five&hyphen;minute speech on government documents, put out the obligatory press release and actually sent the full text of the speech to the major newspaper in the city where that university was located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> To my amazement, it appeared as a page 1 story the next day. That sort of exposure, which Michael was able to bring about in relation to a whole range of public service activities, really did serve this chamber very well. His skills will be sorely missed by our democracy, because one of the greatest enemies of democracies is the impossibility of carefully scrutinising the truckloads of legisla tion, regulations and ordinances that move through parliament. When we lose scrutineers like Michael Baume, a lot more of this will slip through and power will, inevitably, move from the parliament to the bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other great contributions that Michael has made to the parliament is covering a very wide range of issues. He has an absolutely encyclopaedic knowledge. When I entered this place, I was told that I might be asked, on various occasions, to come into the chamber on a moment's notice and speak on anything. Well, that prospect, at that time, filled me with terror. I used to always admire the way that Michael could get up and speak on absolutely anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond the chamber and committee work, Michael made a great contribution to the broader life of the parliament. His sense of fun, from wearing pig ties through to appearing in cabaret acts and doing Gilbert and Sullivan, helped create a positive ambience which lifted the spirits of this place, being an institution with an adversarial format which is unnecessarily negative at times. Senator Michael Baume has been here since he entered as a oncer in 1975. He is one of the great characters of the parliament. We wish him well as he moves from this theatre to the world stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now come to Senator Robert Bell. It is not often that we have nice things to say about the Democrats. I am very glad that my benchmate, Senator Ian Macdonald, is not here to hear this tonight. The last time I said something nice about a Democrat was at the valedictory of Karen Sowada; she had the makings of a great parliamentarian and her loss was a great loss to this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert Bell preceded and followed Karen Sowada as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I found them both a delight to work with on parliamentary committees, unlike the Neanderthals who appeared and disappeared quite often from the Labor side of those committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Robert Bell would listen to reason and listen to an argument; he would come to a sensible position. He brought to this place a very extensive background in education and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2509"> was able to feed into the debate some very useful insights. I will very much miss the philosophical discussions on educational issues we had, as we moved around the countryside on an incredible range of inquiries. He greatly assisted the work of what became a very highly productive committee and produced seven major reports last year. I am confident that Robert Bell will not be away for very long. I am sure that, after Bob Brown's brief stint in the Senate, we will welcome back Robert Bell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Baden Teague: I first heard the name Baden Teague in the mid&hyphen;1980s when I was beavering away on the development of what was to become the Greiner government's education policy framework. At that time&mdash;this is in the early 1980s&mdash;I heard that Baden Teague was to come to the University of New South Wales to give an address on education. At that stage he had a very high reputation for federal policy development through his work as chair of employment, education and training where he produced a number of benchmark reports. On this side, he was followed by Senator Kay Patterson and myself, all of us PhDs in education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of Baden's excellent work, firstly in education and later in foreign affairs, has been a great contribution to the Senate. But what we remember particularly about Baden are his personal qualities, qualities that are rare in human beings and extremely rare in politicians. Baden is without guile, despite 18 years in the place. His nature and character have not been altered by this institution and its people. But I feel that, by his example, he has in some ways affected all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is a man of great faith. He told the Christian Fellowship the other morning that he and his wife pray together every day. Perhaps that is why he has been able to stay above the gutter that occasionally runs under this place, and to change others rather than them changing him. We pray in this place at the start of each day. Perhaps if we all took more to heart what we were saying we might take on some of the qualities that we have seen and come to admire in Baden Teague. I wish you godspeed, Baden, in the next phase of your life.</PARA>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that seeing a number of senators leaving here has very much brought home to me, in rather a short time in this place, the fondness you can develop for members of the Senate, even those with whom you might have very little in common and only fleeting contact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might start with Michael Baume whom I really have had some difficulties with since I have been in this place. I might say that I was blooded fairly early by Michael who, within the first or possibly second week I was here, got up and bucketed not only me but my family as well. I have to say that that has taught me one thing: that all vexations to the spirit eventually pass. And that certainly has come about in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baden Teague: I have had reasonably fleeting contact with him, particularly outside the house. But I have to say that your grace and your kindness very much impressed me. You are always looking for something nice to say, rather than something vicious. That has really been very much appreciated, even those brief moments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Crichton&hyphen;Browne: probably when I came in here, he was passed his prime. And, for me, maybe not having seen him in some of his evil moments&mdash;as you may believe you have seen him&mdash;I see him with some sympathy and as someone who has been separated very much from those things he was committed to and obviously admired and often loved. I feel sorry for him in that and I wish him luck.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And I think they probably quite happily describe themselves using that term. They obviously were a great vexation to the former Leader of the Government in the Senate, Gareth Evans, and I remember a particularly scathing interview about them shortly after I came in. But I have to say that, despite the political difficulties that Christabel and her partner in crime caused both the Labor Party and the business of the Senate, on a personal level Christabel Chamarette was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2510"> very genuine and very committed to what she believed in. I certainly have an enormous amount of respect for her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Robert Bell, despite what life has to offer and the goings on in this Senate, is someone who has that remarkable fuzzy innocent feel to him all the time, despite hours and hours with the Finance and Public Administration Committee. That is quite remarkable. If he can take that to what he is going to do after the Senate, he will be well served.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent a large number of hours with Sid Spindler on the family law committee and am very glad to see that some of the early matters dealt with in the family law committee regarding the care of children are coming into effect on 1 July. That is going to be a major positive step towards family law in this country, particularly in relation to the parenting and care of children after separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid was often the only person whom I found, even in a small part, to be on my side in many of the debates in the family law committee. I very much saw my role there as protecting the rights of single parents and their children. I felt, often, that the rest of the committee, on both my side and the other side, seemed to see their roles as being advocates for the parent without children. I saw this as something of a negative and retrograde step when we had gone so far to try and do more for children and to protect children in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on to my comrades in the Labor Party, so many positive things have been said about Senator Gerry Jones that it is very hard to add to them. Gerry Jones was someone whom I turned to for guidance when I first came in. Certainly, he always helped in such a way that even when there was a complete panic situation you always felt that, ultimately, it would all come out well and that no problems would be too large to overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember asking Gerry about the committee structure, about how you were chosen for particular committees, and if I could have some input. He said, `I'll have a look and see what gaps are available and get back to you.' Shortly after, I had a list of eight committees <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on my desk, and I never went in there looking for work much after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gerry was very helpful. I was one of those people who went into his office with rather ludicrous excuses for needing a pair, and he will probably know the particular situation that I am referring to. I was very grateful that he didn't choose to repeat it when he stood up earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Michael Beahan, you have certainly carried out your role with a great deal of dignity. Frankly, I do not think that I would have had the control and the tact that you have had in the face of what I would almost describe as abusive behaviour&mdash;certainly not the sorts of comments that I would have expected to come from senators when I first appeared here. In your difficult role, coming from one side of the chamber but having to play a balanced role, you have done well. On occasions when you have needed to be forceful you have done that, and that is sometimes necessary in a President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I have to say most about Senator Bryant Burns is his absolute iron commitment to the things that he believes in. Obviously with Bryant those two things are the Labor movement and, in particular, Queensland. He indicated earlier this evening that he was going to continue to play a role in those areas. That shows that no matter where he is he will always make a major contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have left Tom Wheelwright until last because Tom is one of us. He is from New South Wales; he is from the Labor Party; and also he is what could be described as, and, I think, has been described as on a number of occasions, one of my tribe. The way that Tom has behaved in making the choice to come into the Senate and how he has behaved while he has been here has only done credit to him and to the people who supported him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom had a very difficult decision to make when this position became vacant when Steve Loosley resigned; it was very short term, with a high likelihood, to anyone who has any rational understanding of politics, of its being not a position he could return to the Senate from. Despite that, Tom showed remarkable courage and optimism, and certainly anyone who observed the level of his commitment in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2511"> here would never have guessed that basically he was on an eventual death sentence and he very well knew it, despite the fact that he will almost certainly have the opportunity to come back and play another role in the Senate at some later time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom is pretty unusual. He did have an economics background. He did honours at the University of New South Wales. He then was an academic for a period and went on to work as education officer in the New South Wales ALP office, along with John Faulkner, who plays a role in the Senate still, and Graham Richardson, whose name, even though he has left this chamber, seems to pop up from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom then did something quite unusual, certainly in terms of the stereotype that is portrayed about ALP members of parliament. He left the ALP and went to do an MBA and then worked in the finance sector as a stockbroker. He did that job very well and was quite successful, but his commitment to politics and his love of politics would not allow him to stay there and he sought a greater role here in the Senate. I think he has done an incredible job and I really do hope to see him back.</PARA></SPEECH>

Through the little contact that I have had with Robert Bell, I totally endorse the remarks of those who have already spoken about you tonight, Robert. You are a very straight shooter. You are a good guy. You have made a big contribution here and we are very sorry to see you leave. There are two reasons for this: firstly, you are a good guy; secondly, perhaps, because of your replacement. You have made a real contribution to the Senate, certainly from the point of view of the Democrats. You had an ability to relate to all of us and we have felt that we could talk to you on a rational and sensible basis, and this has been very important. I hope things go well for you, and I am sorry that you are leaving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a few things to your other departing Democrat colleague, Sid Spindler. I am sorry that Sid is not here, but I would have to say that he stuck it out pretty well tonight. Sid is a fellow Victorian and we have known each other for quite a few years now. To those of you who are not Victorians, I have to tell you that Sid and I have attended <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2512"> about 10,000 ethnic community functions together. We have seen a great deal of each other. Sid is a very fine man. He has made a very important contribution and I am sorry that he is going. I do wish him well in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing I would say about Sid is that he and the Australian Democrats have had an office for the last few years almost directly opposite my electorate office in Collingwood. He has been on the other side of Smith Street: he is on the Fitzroy side and I am on the Collingwood side. We have been only about 50 meters apart. It has taken a long time, but I think that I can now say with confidence that, in the last month, they have decided to move&mdash;this has nothing to do with Sid. He has been a very good Victorian colleague and I wish him well in his retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Christabel Chamarette and I have spent a fair amount of time together, particularly on the immigration committee. We have had many differences of view on many issues. The one thing that I would say about Christabel without any hesitation at all is that she is a person with a great deal of compassion and feeling: she really does care about her fellow human beings. We have different views as to how best to serve the future needs of our community. She has been a very staunch advocate in her approach. We will miss her and I wish her well in whatever lies ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gerry Jones, we are going to miss you. As someone earlier mentioned&mdash;and I have probably never said it to you&mdash;I have always felt great pleasure in getting a Christmas card from you and Rita. But it is more than that. There is a warmth about Gerry and the way that he has gone about his task here. Your civility at all times has been very much appreciated on this side of the Senate. It has been a pleasure and a privilege working with you in our different ways for so many years. I wish all the very best to you and your family in your retirement, whatever it may bring. People say that they are going to retire when they leave the Senate; I think this is a misnomer. I am sure you will be very active in whatever you do.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my two Liberal party colleagues, Baden&hyphen;Teague and Michael Baume: Baden came into the Senate a couple of years after I first came into politics in 1977. One thing that has annoyed me increasingly over recent years is that car drivers call me Senator Teague. I say, `No; I am Senator Short' and they say, `Gee, you look so alike.' I say, `Gee, do I really; he is far more handsome than I am.' Baden, you have made a terrific contribution to parliament in a whole variety of ways. Others have said many of the things that I want to say. You have really made a very significant contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have probably come from different parts of the spectrum of liberalism but, as you have made the point yourself, the Liberal Party is a very broad church. The great virtue of that Liberal Party is that it is such a broad church that it can accommodate such a range of views. Many of the views that you have espoused I have very much agreed with, and I hope that some of those that I have espoused you would agree with as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I wish you and your family all the best in the future. You are about to become an author, I hear, of this, that and the other. We have probably all got our fingers and toes crossed and are wondering what is going to emanate out of all of that. I am sure it will be a bright and happy future for you and a very satisfying one. I thank you very much, as a colleague, for your contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final remarks have been very deliberately reserved for the curly one, my friend Michael Baume, who came into the parliament on the same day that I did in 1975. Senator Chapman, who is here tonight, was another one. We came in together into the House of Representatives in 1975 as the 43 so&hyphen;called `oncers'. None of us were oncers, although we had to have a second time round at some stage. All three of us went through more than one parliament in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have known Michael for a long time now. I would have to say that I do not think that I know of any politician who has been more vilified by the opposition than Michael Baume has, absolutely and totally wrongly vilified, and I have never seen a person who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2513"> has stood up to vilification and attack over such a sustained period as you have, Michael. You are a man of great courage and character and we have benefited greatly from your presence. We have also benefited greatly from your friendship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say `benefited' let me say that I have suffered greatly from your ability on the tennis court to be able to pop a ball over the net and make it almost spin back the other side, but I mean benefit in a whole variety of ways. We have been friends for a long time, we have been good colleagues and you have earned the respect of all of us. We will miss you very much indeed and we wish you all the best. We will not try to deluge you too much with visits to New York, but I have to say to you that you are probably going to get a fairly frequent stream of visitors&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few brief remarks with regard to those senators leaving us today. Firstly, Mr President, can I say that I have very much appreciated being able to associate with you here in this chamber and I have appreciated the friendship that you have shown. I do not need to express any view with regard to the job you have done; it has been a very difficult job and you have done it very well, and certainly you have done the Labor Party very proud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I want to mention Gerry Jones. I have only been here a very short time but when I came in he was the whip. Gerry, can I say to you thanks very much. I appreciate your assistance. You were always very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pleased to give assistance to new senators. I hope I never gave you a dodgy excuse for seeking a pair. I do not think I ever wrote you a note. May I say all the best to you and your wife and family in whatever you intend doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bryant Burns was the bloke I sat next to when I first came to the Senate. I actually thought it was some sort of punishment. I thought `God. They have sat me next to some old lefty!' But over time I have to say that I got to know Bryant and I very much enjoyed his company. Bryant, as chair of the rural and regional committee, was someone I learnt a great deal from. He contributed very significantly to rural and regional affairs. Certainly, from my point of view, he demonstrated a huge capacity to have a view and to have a great concern for the rural community in Australia. Burnsy took some fighting qualities to Christmas Island, and I am sure a few people will remember that. Although Senator Burns is not here; I wish him well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Tom Wheelwright, the person I sit next to at the moment, is and we had a great trip together to Tahiti to protest the French tests at Mururoa. When we arrived at about 3.30 in the morning, we caught a taxi which turned out to be the most expensive taxi I have ever caught in my life. It took us about five kilometres and cost us about $25. We were supposed to be staying in mediocre type accommodation. Evidently they did not have enough accommodation to take all of the people that had turned up to protest in Tahiti, so we ended up being transferred, along with John Coulter, to the Hotel Sofitel, which was a five&hyphen;star hotel/motel. We arrived there at about four o'clock in the morning and, as it was still dark, we could not see much. The next morning we got up and looked out the window&mdash;we were on the second floor&mdash;we saw beautiful lawns, a big swimming pool, an outdoor breakfast area and a beach, which was probably 30 metres away, with beautiful white sand. I turned to Tom and said, `If the workers could see me now. If this is what protest is all about, I am all for protesting!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, we were there for a very serious reason and Tom, as he said before, got to go on the boat but was rather disappointed that none of the people could actually get to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2514"> Mururoa. At the end of the day, there was a success to those protests and to all of the people who went. Mate, can I say that I really appreciate the advice that I have been able to seek from you with regards to economics&mdash;not that I have been able to understand too much of it. It has been rather interesting and I appreciate that, and I will certainly miss you when you are not here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robert Bell, of course, is my Tasmanian colleague. Robert and I have shared many views of a similar nature, particularly about forestry. I have to say that it is sad to see him go. I do hope that he gets back here, whether it be by way of a double dissolution or whatever. I do not think that Bob Brown, regardless of any effort he might like to make, will ever have the ability to make a contribution across the wide range of issues that Robert could make. I do not say that with any disrespect to Bob Brown, but I think that that will be the case. I wish you well, Robert, and hope you get back. Likewise, with my colleague here, I  not only hope you will get back; I know you will be back. I look forward to the time when we can sit together again and exchange a few ideas about the opposition's economic rationale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Christabel Chamarette is actually guilty of delivering to me the chairmanship of the first committee that I chaired in the Senate.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Abetz, I am glad you said that, because that is true. It came about that it did make you the shortest serving chairman of any committee. That is what you get when you rat on deals you do with the Greens. You really cannot do that. Senator Herron was actually the perpetrator of that ratting exercise and I think he learnt something valuable from that exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I never really had much to do with Senator Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne. One day he came across the chamber when we were in government and sat down beside me&mdash;I think we were having a division about something. It had always been expressed to me that Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne was a number cruncher within the Liberal Party and that he delivered certain things to certain people. When he sat <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down he said, `Listen, I hear you've taken one of the chairs of our committees.' I looked at him and thought, `Is this bloke threatening me, or what?' I had to explain to him that the deal that had been done was ratted upon and, hopefully, that would extricate me from having done something that was not a normally accepted practice. It is interesting to see where Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne has ended up prior to the end of this parliament. I say to him, as other senators have said, as Chairman of Committees he was a very good chair and he was a very good Deputy President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not have a lot to do with Sid Spindler but, as other people have said, he was a great person. I think he contributed a great deal and, as Senator John Faulkner said, it has been even more enjoyable watching his contributions since we have been in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for Baden Teague, I actually moved into Baden's old office when I first came into this place.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME>
<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I too would like to make a contribution in expressing appreciation to the 10 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2515"> senators who are retiring. I am not going to go through everyone by name, except to say that&mdash;from yourself, as the senior person retiring tonight, down to Senator Wheelwright&mdash;I express my appreciation and enjoyment of having worked with them all in varying ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to mention four people whom I have worked with very closely over the six years I have been in this parliament. I begin with Bryant Burns in his capacity as chairman of the rural and regional affairs committee. I am quite sorry that Bryant is not here tonight. I hope he is listening, or maybe one day he might even read what I have had to say. When I first came into this place, I had a particular interest in industrial relations and rural matters, particularly reform in country areas and country businesses, in transport, the waterfront, and what have you. After having heard Bryant Burns interject almost every time I got to my feet, I actually thought he was crazy. I have got to say that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we formed a rural and regional affairs committee and he became chairman. Actually, when we got out of the reaches of Canberra, he became quite a pragmatic, sensible, hard working, decent person. It was quite amazing, the transition from what used to happen here, with meaningless interjections, to the person he was when he got out in the field when he was involved with Senator Brownhill, Senator Bell and others. There are a number of reports which I will mention quickly: the one into foreign visitors or what has become known as the New Zealand shearers report; the drought report; currently we are finishing the landcare report&mdash;there is a little bit of work to be done on that; the value adding; and, in addition, the report we did into AQIS and the meat industry. While the meat industry and AQIS have a long way to go, I have no doubt that the changes that have been made and developed there have been largely due to a lot of that work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is just one aspect I want to raise in terms of the shearers report. Stories had emanated from certain parts of the AWU, particularly in Queensland but to a lesser extent in other states, about the impact New Zealand shearers were supposedly having on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Australian shearing industry. I am not going to go into the details other than to say we went to a place called Muttaburra&mdash;I am not sure, Bellie, whether you were at Muttaburra&mdash;out in western Queensland. This was supposed to be the New Zealand town of all times, run by New Zealand shearers. Finally we convinced the person who was the actual organiser of the four shearing teams or the boss or the person who ran the contract to appear before the committee. This guy got up there and said, `I just want to make one small correction. I've been in this country for 18 years; I've been married to an Australian girl for 18 years; I have four lovely Australian children; and I was actually born in New Guinea.' I am sure Bryant Burns, if he was in here, would remember that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming to Robert Bell, who was on that committee and also the education committee: Robert, I am sure you remember the time with the scrutiny of bills when we had done that report into export education. We were able to pick up a couple of aspects in that with John Tierney. It was a very important report. Baden Teague was also involved. Do you remember, Baden? We got delivered a seven&hyphen;page bill and we sent back 39 pages of amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. They were all carried in the end and I think we upset one Laurie Brereton. Was he the minister? He was not very happy, I can tell you. One particular thing that I remember&mdash;I will not mention the town&mdash;was when we went out to an organisation or establishment for homeless people during the youth unemployment inquiry. You could hardly call them kids because they ranged from about 45 to 13, so some of them were fairly young, but they were all homeless. A couple of them insisted they show us their garden; they were so proud of what they did in their garden. So we went out and had a look at the garden. Dare I mention it in here, Mr President, but this garden was actually that green stuff that you smoke.</PARA></TALK.START>

Bellie, you were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2516"> another one of these people who changed when you came back to this place. I remember you promising me at that door you were going to support us on amendments to the Industrial Relations Act. Somebody from over here then walked over there and made some promise to you and you reneged on your promise and voted the other way. I have never quite forgiven you for that. That is not the sort of thing you do. Nonetheless, I did enjoy working with you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now come to my two colleagues, Michael Baume and Baden Teague. I was fortunate enough in the first three years to sit with Baden Teague in that corner over there, then the next three years with Michael Baume. I want to tell people here: if any of you want to get rid of anyone, let them sit with me for three years, because they are both going.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are shifting, Kay Patterson is shifting; I will be on my own over here. But that is okay, don't worry about it. Baden, I just want to acknowledge that I was very fortunate in those first three years to sit with somebody like you who had the knowledge of this place, the standing orders, all those little things that you have to learn. Not that I know them all now, but it was a great educational process, leaving aside the policy matters for a moment and the way you used to speak and all your expressions and all the rest of it, which we all thoroughly enjoyed. I just want to say thank you, Baden, for all that support and that help you gave me in those days. It is very important when you come into this chamber for the first time that you have a mentor who takes you under their wing and helps you with the processes. Baden Teague did that for me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, for the next three years, I had Michael Baume sitting next to me, a totally different character. That was also an experience and an invaluable one, because Michael got me into Auditor&hyphen;General's reports and similar reports. He would ring me up and say, `You had better get up and do this one.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> You said here tonight, Michael, that you never had written speeches. But let me tell you, you had copious notes. I can tell you that we were sitting over there and if I went <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over about two&hyphen;thirds of the desk Michael would give me a shove and then he would gradually spread his notes all out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Every time I saw Michael Baume get up in this place and speak, he had the documents set out in order&mdash;how he wanted to present them, and what have you&mdash;and none of it was other than fully researched. I, too, join Jim Short in terms of his comments about the victimisation directed against you in terms of some of the things you took after. I saw what you were distributing&mdash;the legal documents, the various information&mdash;because I was sitting right there. It was not something that you were making up off the top of your head; it was information you were putting before this chamber that was fully researched and very accurate about what was occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to acknowledge that to you and, of course, reiterate what I said with regard to the other senators. I wish you all well, particularly Baden Teague and Michael Baume who gave me so much help in my first six years here. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to offer my best wishes to each of the retiring senators. Firstly, you, Mr President, Senator Michael Beahan, for the work that you have done in this place, particularly in your role as President. Of course, it is to be regretted that you seem to be the victim of the women's quota system in the Labor Party, even before it has come into operation. That is certainly a tragedy and it shows perhaps the folly of that particular policy as far as the Labor Party is concerned. Certainly, you have made a worthy contribution during your time here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Gerry Jones, the mild&hyphen;mannered former government whip, is well known to all of us. As one of the earlier speakers mentioned, he is one of the few senators on the other side who regularly sent us a Christmas card. The Christmas greetings from Gerry and his wife, Rita, were certainly always a very welcome part of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I got to know Bryant Burns quite well as a fellow committee member, particularly on the Senate economics committee with his work there, and particularly his rugged defence of the traditional Labor values and the trade <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2517"> union movement. That was certainly a very notable part of Senator Bryant Burns's contribution in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Wheelwright, of course, came here much more recently. We have got to know Senator Wheelwright very recently, in my own case, as a member of the recently appointed select committee on uranium. Right to the end, although that committee has only recently started its work, he has shown a great interest in the initial work of that committee and has contributed to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chamarette, from the Western Australian Greens, has made her particularly unique contribution to this place. We are neighbours, in the sense that her office has been across the corridor from mine in recent years, so I have much evidence of the people that regularly made their presence felt in that corridor.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Senator Bell also is aware of that, being a little further down the corridor. Certainly, Senator Chamarette brought a sincerity and a commitment to her role here as a representative of the Greens, and also as a member of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sid Spindler I have worked with on the Senate economics committee. Obviously, whilst not always agreeing with Sid's approach to some of the issues that that committee considers, whether it is economic issues or industrial relations issues, I must say he certainly has a commitment to the Australian Democrats' point of view and has put that very effectively during his time in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I probably know Robert Bell best of the Democrat senators. I got to know Robert particularly well during the period that I was doing a lot of work for the then opposition on industrial relations matters and Robert was the spokesman for the Democrats on industrial relations. I remember spending some time in discussions with him periodically on amendments that we wanted to seek his support for. Interestingly, I found that quite often Robert would agree with those proposed amendments but, sadly, some of his less enlightened Democrat colleagues would not agree with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them and so, at the end of the day, we were not able to get their support despite the relatively rational approach to those amendments of Robert himself. Perhaps we may have had a better industrial relations system if some of his colleagues in the Democrats had listened to Robert's views on those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne, a former Liberal senator, has served here for a very lengthy period of time. Of course, more recently he has left the party, but certainly he has played a very significant role during his time here in the Senate. He has obviously been a person of great influence in the Western Australian Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come now to my two Liberal colleagues. Firstly, I want to mention Senator Teague. I did speak about Baden at some length on the evening he announced his intended retirement&mdash;1 December 1994. Of course, Baden is not only my friend and colleague but also, as I said on that occasion, my cousin. Baden Chapman Teague is a long serving senator in this place and a worthy contributor to the Liberal cause. He is a friend who goes back many years to our days as youths together. We offered great encouragement to each other in our early interest in politics. I recall well, as I made the point on that earlier occasion, the support that Baden regularly gave to my campaigns in Kingston in the period 1975 to 1983. He was a regular contributor to those very active campaigns and made his presence felt in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the senators this evening have spoken of Baden's contribution in this place over a very long period of time but most particularly in the areas of education and foreign affairs. He is recognised within the diplomatic community in Canberra as having made an enormous contribution in the area of international relations and foreign affairs. He is highly regarded by members of that diplomatic community, most notably the South Americans; but not just the South American diplomats&mdash;right across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baden has made a magnificent contribution over his years here since coming to the Senate in 1978. I wish him and Kathy every enjoyment in their retirement from politics. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2518"> good to see Joshua up in the gallery too. He has been working with his father here as he has been cleaning up over the last couple of weeks ready to depart the Senate and take on new tasks. I too look forward to the volumes that will come from the research and writing projects that I know Baden has in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, this brings me to my other Liberal colleague, Senator Michael Baume. As Senator Short mentioned earlier, Michael Baume, Senator Short and I were elected at the massive 1975 victory of the Liberal Party and the advent of the Fraser coalition government at that time. Well do I remember, Senator Baume, when we were in the House of Representatives, those chants across the chamber from the Labor Party of `Oncer, oncer, oncer'. Indeed, the reality was that most of us became thricers and survived through to the 1983 election, you and I included.</PARA>

You showed great capacity, as a marginal seat member, in building a strong personal vote and holding that seat for three terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that period and during our time together in the Senate, we also shared a great love of cricket. I think it is notable that, in those days, even though we held marginal seats and, in many respects, had the demands of those seats weighing upon us, we seemed to at least be able to organise several games of cricket a year here at the parliament. That seems to be something that has faded. It must be a couple of years since we had a game of cricket here; perhaps it is a game we now have once every couple of years. But we used <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to have about three games a year, as I remember, in those days.</PARA>

That is the point that I want to make about Michael Baume: that he was one of the people, during that period, who was most responsible for maintaining an esprit de corps and developing a camaraderie among the 1975ers. That was most notable in the way he initiated and regularly organised the annual dinner of that group, year by year. He has done so for 21 years, apart from the year that he was at the United Nations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, after your time in the Reps, you came to the Senate in 1984. As has already been remarked on, you were a very assiduous committee worker and a devourer of government documents.

You have no doubt come under criticism from people, both on this side and on the other side, for various decisions that you might have made or not made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak on a more personal basis, because I had the privilege two years ago of travelling overseas with you and your partner, Margaret, to Germany and the United Kingdom. Can I say that, on a personal basis, there is no better person to travel with that I have ever met. I know that my wife, Anne, particularly enjoyed your company and Margaret's company on that trip. It was a very enjoyable time. And wherever we went, you represented your position and the Australian Senate with dignity, and certainly in the most bipartisan manner possible. Once again, we wish you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well in your retirement and I hope that the future for both you and Margaret is all that you would want it to be. Thank you once again for that personal friendship which developed over that trip away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say to Senator Jones, whom I did not know very well but who was a very friendly face in the whip's office when I first came, that I certainly wish him well. I also wish Senator Burns well. He has been described as a traditional Labor man and it is fair to say that, as a traditional Labor man, Senator Burns wore that tag with pride. Some of us used to deride him occasionally, but I think he wore it with pride and he will be remembered in this place for the way in which he stood up for the traditional values that he had always had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is strange that, in this place, some people you are here with for a long time you scarcely get to know, and others that you only meet for a very short time you actually get to know quite well. That was the case with Senator Wheelwright. From the time of his entry into the Senate, I happened to be on a committees with him&mdash;and on two committees at some stages. Senate Wheelwright was a very energetic contributor and the enthusiasm he has displayed as a Labor senator will probably stand him in good stead in the future. Many have said we may see him back again. Certainly, I would compliment Senator Wheelwright on the efforts that he made in the time he was here. It has been said that he has sound economic knowledge. I know that he certainly had more economic knowledge than me in various areas, because I do remember going to the Townsville casino with him and his investments paid off far better than mine did. I did enjoy Senator Wheelwright's company in the short time we had together on committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, I never worked with Senator Bell on committees, but he was always a very friendly person in this place. Senator Bell, I do wish you well. I am sorry that I did not have the opportunity to work more closely with you. With my rural background, I was initially quite keen to get on the rural and regional affairs committee, but the competition was pretty strong. Had I done so, I would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2520"> have had more to do with you. I certainly wish you well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had quite a deal to do with Senator Spindler, particularly in recent times on the Senate economics committee. While I did not agree with all of Senator Spindler's views, I certainly appreciated the zeal with which he approached his point of view and the way that he put it. Likewise with Senator Chamarette, although I did not have a particular lot to do with her even though she was the senator who came in just before me in early 1992. I came in May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne has been around this place for a considerable length of time. It has been rather sad in recent times that, in relation to many of those people who were very close friends of Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne's in his early days and very close to him, the bitterness that has developed has overflowed into the Senate chamber, which we have seen in the past few months. Some of us would do well to remember the contribution that Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne made in his early days in this parliament, and to the Liberal Party in particular. Unfortunately, many of us may remember the more recent times rather than the earlier times. I certainly would wish Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne well in his retirement and hope that, in the future, he finds a contribution he can make that will give him some satisfaction and fulfilment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particular want to speak about two colleagues who are here tonight&mdash;Senator Teague and Senator Baume. Senator Teague, I heard Senator Kemp say earlier that he had been reading the fine print when he was talking about Senator Spindler and he could not find anything that he actually agreed with Senator Spindler about. Well, we are in the same party, Senator Teague, and I have to say that I have to look very hard sometimes to think of all of the things that we agree on as well. But I want you to know that the contribution you have made to the Liberal Party, here and in South Australia, has been appreciated by all those that you have come into contact with. It has been said before that it is a broad church&mdash;and that is the reason both you and I are in the same party.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing we ought to acknowledge is the tremendous sacrifice that anybody makes when they have got a young family and they come into this place. You have made that sacrifice, together with Kathy and your family, and I think you are to be commended and admired by all of those South Australians that you represented, for the sacrificial way that anybody who, at your age, enters this Senate has to combine family life with their political life. Senator Teague, I congratulate you for what you have done and for the way that you have stood up for things that you believe in. I certainly wish you and Kathy well in your retirement. I hope it is a time that is exciting for you in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final remarks are directed to Senator Baume. I acknowledge, as Senator Chapman did, that Senator Baume is held in very high regard. Such was that regard that the Prime Minister came over here to hear Senator Baume's valedictory speech, and I know that the things that were said by Senator Baume struck a very solid chord with the Prime Minister and all of the senator's colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Baume, I have some particular personal issues that I will miss when you go, because I do not know anybody else in the Senate who knows Flanders and Swan as well as you and I do. They are two of the greatest comedians from England that I have ever known, and they sing and talk with great humour. I do not know who is going to do the fundraising singing, when you and I can no longer combine to raise money to try and win the seat of Canberra.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They probably will pay us to shut up. I will always remember your very keen enthusiasm for the arts. We shared a lot in common in music. We shared a lot in common in our political views, as well. I note particularly your dedication. I think the word that has been used tonight is `courage'. When I first came into this place, I could not but admire the way that you would tackle issues with an enthusiasm that very few of your colleagues would do&mdash;particularly the difficult issues that you felt needed to be raised. It was not a matter of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2521"> whether they should or should not be raised; you felt they needed to be raised. This was always done with an extraordinary amount of research, so that you had your facts right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way that the government of that time could try and defuse any issues that you raised was by means of derision, and their derision was short&hyphen;lived because, at the end of the day, it proved that many of those things that you so enthusiastically followed were true. You have been a great member of this Senate and a great member of the Australian parliament. We certainly wish you and Toni well in your new venture in New York. I hope there are a few bedrooms in the place, because it seems that nearly everybody here is going to be there at some stage or other. I certainly wish you well. I will miss your friendship but, most of all, we know where you are and we will be able to see you in the future. Thank you, Michael Baume, for your contribution to this place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME>
<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I hope you will forgive me for starting my contribution to tonight's valedictory with my very own colleagues. I start in terms of seniority with my great friend Senator Baden Teague.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Teague, I acknowledge your long and distinguished career and the great time that we have had together and the great advice that you have very quietly given me over the nearly 12 years that I have been here. You have been terrific. It would be my failing if I did not momentarily stand up here tonight and formally acknowledge the contribution which you have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I may excise just one section of your very distinguished and long career, one of the contributions that you have made is to the Privileges Committee. Privilege in this place is a very special thing that should be cherished and not abused. I hope that the future is largely dependent upon what you have contributed to the Privileges Committee over so many years: people do not abuse the right of privilege in this house, and you have given such clear direction in the way that you feel it should be exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Teague, it probably sounds very feeble, in many respects, to pick out such <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very small areas of such a long and distinguished career, at this time of night. But I would like to say a personal thankyou for what you have done for me, and also to wish you and Kathy well for your future as a young man with a family and as one who has so much to look forward to. Thank you, Senator Teague, for what you have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To another great friend in Senator Baume. Senator Baume and I virtually came in together, even though you had had a previous life which I had not had. I have got to say that you taught me a lot in terms of reflecting upon the ways in which the parliamentary process can be used to its benefit, without being abused, and I think that is the key. If so many new and upcoming senators could learn from someone like you, Senator Baume, this place would be a far better and richer place for those who are yet to follow. So you have a legacy in this place which many of us can follow and many who are yet to come can follow, in the way in which you have been able, without abusing the parliamentary process, to use the parliamentary process to bring many issues to the fore that would otherwise have not been brought to the fore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I wish you, Senator Baume, and your dear wife Toni everything of the best. Like Senator Ferguson, I do not know how you are going to accommodate us all if we decide to turn up at the one time in that unknown place to which you are headed. You have been terrific and thank you for all that you have done for me and for my staff. From my longest serving member of staff, Sue Oldham, who has been with me for all but six months of my almost 12 years here, can I put on record a special thankyou to you, because I know that she would like her appreciation for your friendship recorded in this your final night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To you, Mr President, may I say as a fellow Western Australian that I have respected you greatly for what you have done. I have to say that on many occasions I have disagreed with you philosophically, and I may have disagreed with you procedurally, but as a person I have </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2522">
<PARA>to say that I have always respected you enormously for what you stand for personally and you as a person. May I say to you that I wish you sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, all the best for the future that you have in store for you. I think it is sad the way in which you are leaving us, but I think that it is a significant contribution that you have made not only to your party but to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other two people that I would like to briefly acknowledge tonight are Senator Robert Bell and Senator Chamarette, two decent, honourable people who have sought to serve their causes particularly well. I very rarely prejudge anyone on someone else's viewpoint, but I have to say that a couple of colleagues from within the parliament, and one whom Senator Bell reminded me of tonight from outside the parliament, gave me a thumbnail sketch of Senator Bell prior to his arrival and indicated that he was going to be a very decent contributor to this place. He has fulfilled that thumbnail description to the utmost. To you, Senator Bell, all I can say is that in these last few days of your senatorial position I find it sad to see you go because I think you have made a significant contribu&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA>tion in your six years in the Senate. I hope that your contribution will be seen again here&mdash;as long, if I may put an overrider to that, as you do not knock out a Liberal when you come back. But you can certainly come back at the expense of anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Senator Chamarette, I suppose the same words apply, that she has certainly taken a very decent role. We have been corridor pals with Senator Bell and I have always found Senator Chamarette to be a very honourable and decent person with whom to deal. Once again, I hope that her re&hyphen;emergence in this place, if ever that were to be the case, is not at the expense of a Liberal. I hope that she has a long and fulfilling retirement that she intimates to me in private that she would seek to have. And, of course, to Senators Burns, Wheelwright and Spindler I extend my very best wishes.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>
