<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. In your speech to a higher education conference on 23 September entitled `The quest for truth', you said that when parties to a debate compete for the exposure of their point of view `this political scenario often means the truth, the facts and the figures are lost' and `the headline, the grab and the spin take over from rational and informed debate'. You later added, `The distortion of information carried to the voters distorts and damages the democratic process.' On the same day you attended a Senate estimates committee and raised the Wright family as an issue by answering a Dorothy Dixer from Senator Ferris. Have you not contradicted your own words? In failing to accept Mr Hollway's advice to immediately correct the record, have you not carried distorted information to the voters and damaged the democratic process? Aren't you guilty of the most blatant double standards?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Evans for that question. Senator Evans, you are, I think, quoting pretty well exactly correctly from the speech I made. I would not walk away from that speech for one minute. If I had an opportunity to make it again and again and again, I would continue to do so. You then lead in to the question of the so-called Wright family. Again, as has happened before&mdash;Madam President, I did indicate that I would point it out to you every time it happens&mdash;an inference against a minister is contained in a question. You say `by answering a Dorothy Dixer from Senator Ferris', yet I think I have in this place or in other places indicated on plenty of occasions, or at least one or two, that there was no arrangement for Senator Ferris to ask any particular question whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, Senator Evans, you want to set the precedent in this place that when you ask a senator something and they stand up and give you the answer, you consistently, having been given that answer, allege that that answer is untrue, that is up to you. But I think you are going down a very unfortunate road. You have asked this question in previous sitting weeks and you have been given the answer, and I stand by that answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of your question goes to immediately following up and I answered that question last time, too. I gave you all the material you could possibly want and indicated in the answer when I gave that material that what I wanted to do was ensure that the material I gave was correct. I in fact said last time in this place that I clearly did not leave time enough because, as late as 6 o'clock the night before I gave all that information in the chamber, further information arrived from the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us not pretend that between when Mr Hollway advised me that the Wright family was in fact not an actual family in itself, although it started off as an actual family, and when I signed the letter nothing was happening. Advice was sought from the clerk. The letter was changed to make sure that it was distributed. I have seen some press coverage since I have been away that I secretly wrote <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the estimates committee. The estimates committee is the appropriate place to write.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what the amendment was that was made at the suggestion of the clerk? It was put at the bottom of the letter to ask the chairman to distribute it to Labor members. If that is trying to keep something secret&mdash;heavens above! What else would you do other than advise Labor's members of the committee? Senators are not only entitled but obligated to try and ensure that they have got the information correct. I did that.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the minister that this question is about voracity of information given to the Senate. That is the very point of the question. Minister, did you not say in the same speech on 23 September that it would be unwise to blame the media at large in public debates because `the media frequently face enormous difficulty in ascertaining the facts'. Would you agree that their job is made even more difficult when ministers of the crown allow distortions and misrepresentations to take root in the public mind by not moving to correct the facts at the earliest opportunity?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do agree that the media sometimes have a very difficult task to get the correct information and to get the facts. But let us understand one thing in this matter: the so-called Wright family was based on an actual family. That turns out not to mean that it was an actual family because children were added, et cetera. I think the first of the actual families tabled vis-a-vis being cut out of Austudy by the means test was the basis for the Wright family. They would have, other than the actual means test, got Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not pretend for one minute that those families would be able to access welfare benefits. If you are walking away from that, if you think people in million dollar houses should be able to, then that is up to you to raise. You are asking me whether the impression created in the media was wrong. If the impression in the media is that some people were incorrectly getting Austudy, then no&mdash;the impression in the media is not wrong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. What message does the overwhelming endorsement of the Liberal member Jackie Kelly in the Lindsay by-election say about the Howard government's policies? What does Jackie Kelly's re-election reveal about the attitude of Lindsay voters towards the opposition's obstruction of the 1996-97 budget?  Is this a further justification of the confidence in the coalition government that the voters of Lindsay gave on 2 March and reaffirmed seven months later on 19 October?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4546" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was the one I was hoping to get from the Labor Party, but not today. It is a great victory and a great credit to Jackie Kelly, too. There is within the results some very serious messages, I believe, for the Labor Party and minority parties in this place. What it did was reaffirm that voters, who threw Labor out in unprecedented numbers in March, wish that the program they sought to be enacted actually does get enacted. There is no doubt about that at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor tried to scare in that campaign. Labor tried to scare on the basis of the last budget&mdash;a budget which you will remember was written up as a fair go budget. But, again, rather than listen, Labor went back and said, `This is the by-election in which you the voters can send a message to the coalition government to hold back.' The interesting thing is that the voters said, `No, we want change. We are tired of Labor. We had it for 13 years. We had record unemployment, record high interest rates, record debt. We voted for change and we expect that change to be endorsed and supported.' That is the key message that came out of the Lindsay by-election and it is a message that ought to be listened to in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I will quote a couple of newspaper reports. I don't do it often, but I think they are spot on. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The win is rightly seen as an endorsement of government policies and a sharp reminder to other policies that its reform program cannot be impeded without angering voters. Mr Howard is justified in claiming the endorsement of last March has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> renewed while Labor leader Kim Beazley must accept that the voters do not want obstruction of the general government program. Voters do indeed want to give Mr Howard a fair go in introducing changes that will produce fundamental improvements to employment, productivity and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what we were elected to do, exactly what we  want to do. The message in it to Labor is to not obstruct in this place&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook again says, `Rubbish!'  Still he will not listen to the wishes of the people. The people voted for change. They want to see the new program implemented. They want to see the new government given a fair go, in the same way, Senator Cook, they wanted to see Jackie Kelly given a fair go. Will you listen? All he says is, `Rubbish!' He will not listen to the people. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard can rightly claim that it reinforces his mandate to implement the key policies on which he and his colleagues were elected&mdash;the part sale of Telstra and subsequent financial commitments to the environment, the reformation of the nation's industrial relations law and the implementation of budget measures.</PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt at all, as these newspapers have objectively reported, that by their vote at the beginning of March the people have endorsed a program that they wish to have effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message is there for Labor. Since 1993 in the seat of Lindsay, Labor's primary vote has dropped 20 per cent from the March election and now this by-election. Their primary vote has crashed, but they still will not listen to the people. There is an opportunity for Labor to say, `The people have spoken clearly in March. The people have re-endorsed their position in this by-election. We will give the new government an opportunity. We will be prepared to allow its budget through. We will be prepared to allow its funding base for the Natural Heritage Trust&mdash;$1 billion to be spent on the environment&mdash;'<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you Senator Bolkus for that question because it does give me an opportunity to reiterate for members opposite how many times they were told that their targets were askew and unlikely to be achieved.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus, your job is to ask the question; my job is to answer it, okay?&mdash; how many times they were told that they were not on track and they were not going to get there. In September 1994 Mr Ted Evans, the secretary to the Treasury, is reported to have said that `it will be extraordinarily difficult to achieve the government's target of five per cent unemployment by the turn of the century'. He went as far as describing that as `very ambitious', which are strong words indeed for the secretary to the Treasury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same month&mdash;this is in 1994, so there was plenty of time for this message to sink in&mdash;Dr Vince FitzGerald, who headed the Keating government's national inquiry into savings, expressed concern that our national savings rate would not be sufficient to bring unemployment down to an acceptable level&mdash;five per cent or below&mdash;within the remainder of the present decade. You would have thought over 12 months or so that message would have sunk in. Dr John Quiggin, the professor of economics at James Cook University, described by one newspaper as `a strident supporter of Working Nation', said in June 1995 that the government had failed to allow for discouraged workers in its forecasts and therefore unemployment would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> still be running at eight per cent in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite obvious that, if key advisers and commentators were speaking in these terms and were in fact saying that you could not get there, how could the government itself have been blind to these realities? Of course they were not. Labor knew, as well as I did and its advisers did, that, in the absence of appropriate macro&hyphen;economic and micro&hyphen;economic policies, the achievement of its much touted five per cent target was no more than a mere fantasy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus asks me as to some advice from the department, and I suspect that he is not actually talking about advice. I think he is talking about one portion of an incoming government brief, which the senator opposite, I think, seeks to say or assert, concludes that the department offers advice to the incoming government that five per cent was achievable, and that is not the case, if that is what you are asserting.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Last week several financial institutions cut their mortgage interest rates, which is very welcome, of course. I ask the Minister to inform the Senate how much Australians will benefit from these cuts and how does the government's budget further improve living standards?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4548" SPEAKER="Kemp, Sen Rod" NAMEID="WW4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for this important question which is of interest to virtually all Australians. There is no doubt that the big reductions in home mortgage rates by half a percentage point or more announced on Friday is very good news for most Australian families. The cuts announced by Westpac, St George, FAI and Aussie Home Loans means that all these substantial lenders now offer home loan rates below eight per cent. This is the first time in two decades that variable home loan rates have been this low. Not since the mid&hyphen;1970s have families been able to enjoy such low interest rates in paying off their most valuable asset&mdash;their homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest cut, for example, by Aussie Home Loans provides a benefit of roughly $45 a month or over $500 a year for a family with a $100,000 25&hyphen;year mortgage. Westpac, as many senators will know, also substantially cut its first option variable rate on Friday and announced that this provides a benefit of around $10,000 to customers over the life of their loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, since the election, variable home mortgage rates offered by the four big banks have fallen by about 1&frac14; percentage points <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the rates now offered by Aussie Home Loans and others are even lower. I say to Senator Cook, who is trying to interject, that the interest rates, as I said, are great news for Australian families. The Treasurer Peter Costello said on Friday, `This is a low inflation economy with interest rates falling and this will be a great relief for those Australians who are looking for loans and paying off mortgages.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week figures were released that showed that underlying inflation for the year to September was 2.4 per cent&mdash;well within our target of two to three per cent on average over the economic cycle. Figures also showed a moderation in wage presses, with average weekly ordinary time earnings rising just 0.7 per cent for the quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no mistake: these cuts are possible because of the decisive action this government took in the budget to rein in the deficit. By reining in the deficit, we have taken the pressure off interest rates. We have already seen one cut in official interest rates and significant cuts in mortgage and business rates. This is in stark contrast to what happened under the Labor government. Over the last 2&half; years under Labor&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone said that at the time of the March election, her department had advised Mr Crean, the then employment minister, that unemployment by the year 2000 would have been, at best, 6.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>This is perhaps an example of how careful journalists have to be when they paraphrase press releases. The wording in the press release of 18 August&mdash;which the article of the 19th is responding to, and which I presume is what occasioned Mr Crean to speak out as well&mdash;is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEETYA has advised that at the time of the election, on the information available to the previous government, unemployment in 2000 would have been between 6.8 and 7.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter has been dealt with by Dr Kemp in the other place, and the situation is this: questions were asked, obviously by us, as to what employment scenarios were around. Those questions were asked not long after the last election and were based, in part, on the Treasurer's statement of 12 March, I think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had your government not been so gutless, had it been prepared to ask those questions, that information would have been available to it as well. The fact that you did not choose to ask is probably the same reason you did not choose to release all the Treasury papers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when we asked you to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I give you another hint, Senator, as to why you probably did not ask? Let me give you a few more names of people who were telling you that you were not on track. Helen Hughes, in September 1995, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unemployment rate not 8.2 per cent would be no better than seven per cent by the year 2000 if present growth levels were maintained.</PARA>

The Uruguay Round of GATT and formation of the World Trade Organisation was largely promoted in Australia as providing immense benefits to the economy. Magically, we would improve our balance of trade by greatly increasing our exports relative to our imports. Australia was supposed to come out $5.5 billion per annum to the good, and our agricultural sector was to be the main beneficiary and generator of wealth. Yet, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>  last week, we saw a program that highlighted the change in investment regimes and ownership of various sectors of the beef export industry that has not brought benefits while our balance of trade has deteriorated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the big change is, if we can take pressure off public expenditure, we bring interest rates down, which is already occurring, and business can start to grow and be internationally competitive again. I remind the honourable senator also that 43 per cent of Australia's industrial exports will now face zero tariffs, an average cut to agricultural tariffs of 36 per cent was made&mdash;as agriculture was brought more fully under the multilateral rules and disciplines&mdash;and market access opportunities were opened and export subsidies cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the senator also that multilateral disciplines were extended to the services sector for the first time, protection was extended to intellectual property and the round provided for stronger rules, fairer dispute settlement and greater transparency. In other words, there is a whole series of benefits from which Australian industry and Australia will gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note also that, on top of that, industry has encouraged the government to develop an ambitious and forward looking agenda for further liberalisation to take to the first biennial conference of members of the World Trade Organisation, which will take place in Singapore in December this year. Far from being put off by what is occurring, industry is in fact challenging us to go forward and build upon the gains and the benefits of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in relation to the beef industry to which the honourable senator refers, there have been advantages secured. There has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the removal of the US meat import law and its replacement with a much greater and more certain quota of 379,000 tonnes, affirmation of the commitment of the European Union not to subsidise beef into the Asia Pacific market and the complete liberalisation of the Korean beef market by the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, there are temporary difficulties in relation to beef exports. There is no secret about that, but the future, on the basis of what has been gained to date, remains promising. An important point to remember is that, apart from the changes that we are implementing in terms of enabling Australian business to be more internationally competitive and taking pressure off its outgoings, investment itself remains a key to enhancing our competitiveness. In that regard foreign investment into the beef industry has played a fundamental role over the last decade in modernising the industry and developing better linkages with our customers overseas.</PARA>

The previous government ignored the fact that the aggressive political trade policy of economically powerful governments, coupled with a strong support for what they see as strategic industries, would ensure that the trade field is not level; the support of free investment and foreign ownership would lead to transfer pricing and other distortions; and increased foreign ownership by vertically integrated transnationals would result in unfair trade pressures on domestic producers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After consultation with an ATSIC officer, I informed Senator Collins that ATSIC had put out a media release correcting the information.

As we can clearly see from the outstanding result in Lindsay, the people were not fooled by Labor's tired old&hyphen;style politicking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the shadow Treasurer also put out a press release on the current public housing reforms. Does this accurately reflect government policy? For the benefit of those opposite&mdash;the true deceivers&mdash;will the minister please explain yet again the government's policy on public housing reform?</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that very good question was the senator's maiden question. I congratulate him. Senator Knowles would also like it clearly understood that she is no relation to the Minister for Housing of the same name in New South Wales. Having said both of those things, I think it is once again an example of just how, as Senator Herron has pointed out, the Labor Party has not learned how out of touch it is with the Australian people. We had the March election. You would have thought they had learnt from that. We had the Lindsay by-election, and still they go on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an incredible unwillingness to listen. We saw that with Senator Collins, but why is it that the Labor Party has become so out of touch with what one would have expected once to have been their grass roots? It is an extraordinary thing that they now have to resort to cheap politicking&mdash;reckless indifference of the concerns of the people&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rather than considered policy. I would have thought that in the past the Labor Party prided itself on its policy development work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen now is a discredited opposition which cannot get used to being in opposition and has no ability to build on the failure of the past, to learn from the failures. Now they have just had another failure. The shadow Treasurer recently put out a press release on the housing reforms, attempting once again to frighten vulnerable people. He thinks somehow it is going to bring him and his party some electoral reward. It just is not so. The people of Lindsay saw through Minister Knowles's and candidate Free's press releases and scare tactics. They have seen through the shadow Treasurer Evans's press releases and scare tactics, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party was wrong about the abilities of the Australian people in March. It was wrong again in Lindsay. People are not fooled. They know perfectly well that what they are seeing now is cynicism and opportunism from an opposition that sees itself in opposition for many years to come, as former Senator Richardson has pointed out. I bet they do not like that too much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow Treasurer's press release is fascinating, because it does not accurately reflect government policy&mdash;although that is what it claims to do. It does not acknowledge the government's clear commitment that existing public housing tenants will not be disadvantaged by the housing reforms. The shadow Treasurer claimed in his press release that the government's policy defies logic. It is fascinating, because it is the shadow Treasurer who defies logic. Doesn't he realise that the former government of which he was presumably a senior cabinet minister&mdash;although we know he was often out of the country, perhaps he missed this&mdash;was going to implement exactly the same policy? I suggest that he and his colleagues should go back and have a look at their housing policy. It was one of the few directions that the previous government was taking which received bipartisan support because the reforms were long overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He spoke in his press release of the longer waiting lists that our reforms, he said, would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4556"> produce. I would have thought that a quarter of a million low income earners currently renting private accommodation, sitting on queues and waiting lists for public housing is quite enough and reason for the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless the Labor Party learns that this stupid, old-style scaremongering is unproductive and starts being honest with the Australian people, they are going to become increasingly irrelevant and destined, as I said before, to spend a long, long, long time on the opposition benches.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, do you acknowledge the findings of a World Bank study presented to this morning's Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee hearing that shows that, after your government's fee hikes, individual student contributions to the cost of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public higher education in Australia will be the highest in the Western world and second only to South Korea in the entire world? Are you also aware of evidence presented today by the architect of the HECS scheme, Dr Bruce Chapman, that your HECS changes constitute the most radical changes ever to higher education and would shift the composition of the student body towards the wealthier sections of our society? Given these facts, do you stand by your commitment, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> , to reconsider the higher HECS fees if they keep low income students out of universities?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to Dr Bruce Chapman's view that the proposed changes to HECS will skew the university population towards those who are the most wealthy in the community, it is not a view that I share. I do not say that that is a fact simply because it is Dr Chapman's view. It is worth noting, Senator Stott Despoja, that in the time when university education was free to students&mdash;that means that other people pay&mdash;the most disadvantaged people in the community got the least access.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr does not necessarily agree with me, but that is my view. When HECS was introduced, people said it would be the end of higher education. It clearly was not and the numbers have grown steadily ever since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also my view that it is completely unfair to ask of a teacher, who has a low course cost and, relatively speaking, a lower income, the same contribution per annum that you ask of a doctor, who has a high course cost and a higher income afterwards. I think that is completely unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the policy we have put forward we have shifted the HECS arrangement from being a flat charge where everyone pays the same to more properly reflect both the cost of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4557"> course&mdash;that is, the benefit given by other taxpayers to that student in cash terms&mdash;and the private benefit that students receive from higher education, which is largely reflected by the income that they get. That is why we propose to keep nursing, for example, which is an expensive course, in the lower band. As you would well know, nurses do not achieve higher incomes for the rest of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To shift to a three-tiered HECS that purely reflected the cost of the course would, I believe, be inequitable. But one that has a blend of that&mdash;that acknowledges some have lower incomes and some have higher incomes&mdash;is a good thing. In summary, what we have done here is acknowledge that what Labor did when it introduced HECS was correct. We think it is correct that there is a public benefit in a well developed, higher education student and it is without question that there is a private benefit to the students who participate. The HECS contribution is an acknowledgment of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are maintaining the excellent aspect of HECS&mdash;that you do not pay as you learn; you pay as you earn. We think that is a fairer system. Neville Wran, the former Labor Premier of New South Wales, suggested not charging everyone equally because everyone does not get an equal cost course and everyone does not get an equal private benefit. We are following his suggestion that it would be more equitable to shift to a three-tiered HECS. We think that is a much fairer way to go.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  report in front of me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find Senator Faulkner's comments totally unacceptable. I find it bizarre in the extreme that he can come in here and say that what we see and what has happened in terms of what Senator Vanstone has done is a pattern of deceit. Never once did I hear Senator Faulkner come in here when Carmen Lawrence had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight colleagues stand up and give evidence to say that she knew about a petition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that was going before parliament. Not once did I hear Senator Faulkner talk about patterns of deceit or about ministerial responsibility. No; he comes in here and totally misconstrues two situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last sitting week when we were talking about the Wright family, I did not have time to go through in detail the letter that Mr Hollway sent to Senator Tierney, the chairman of the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee. Just so that senators on the other side get the message, I will repeat what the departmental secretary wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you direct on the matter of the `Wright family' because the fault clearly lies with the department. It was an incorrect characterisation of the case by the Department to the Minister which led Senator Vanstone in turn to describe the Wright family as a specific example in the hearings on the Committee on 23 September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I myself wrongly believe the Wrights to be an actual case and, like the Minister, only became aware of this and not so until after the Committee hearings. Nonetheless, as Departmental Head, I accept responsibility for the mistake.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vanstone has said that she was under the same misapprehension because the information came across as an actual family from the department. The departmental head also said that he was under a misapprehension. Senator Vanstone went about finding out about it as soon as she was alerted to it. She then came into the parliament and corrected it, unlike Senator Schacht&mdash;there is a stark contrast between the minister's behaviour and Senator Schacht's behaviour&mdash;in 1994 when he was inadvertently advised by his department and gave an incorrect answer in the estimates committee. He did not set in train a process to advise either the committee or the department of the error. Parliament only found out when Senator McMullan was asked a question and Senator Schacht had to come in during the debate on taking note of answers and admit that he had made a mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have totally different rules&mdash;there is one lot of rules for those on that side and one lot of rules for us. Senator Faulkner was absolutely wrong. The `Wright family' was a family that was concocted in the department. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4561"> When the minister discovered that, she tried to make amends and advise people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other issue of unemployment, when they say they did not know about it, Ted Evans, Secretary to the Treasury, said that five per cent was very difficult and very ambitious. Vince FitzGerald said that savings were insufficient to reach five per cent. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial said that Simon Crean is either deluding himself or he is lying regarding the five per cent. John Quiggin, who was a very big supporter of Working Nation, said that the government was dishonest in saying that five per cent was achievable. They had been told over and over again that that five per cent was not achievable. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said himself that it was unwise to set targets. But they had this target of five per cent and they were told over and over that they could not make it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone put out a press release which said that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has advised that `at the time of the election, on information available to the previous government, unemployment in 2000 would have been between 6.8 per cent and 7.3 per cent.' The interpretation the journalist put on that was `Senator Vanstone said that at the March election her department had advised Mr Crean, the then employment minister, that unemployment by the year 2000 would have been at best 6.8 per cent.' That is how that has come about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To come in here and say that it is a whole pattern of deceit is absolutely outrageous and unacceptable. They ought to get their own house in order. They still have Carmen Lawrence sitting on the front bench. After eight of her colleagues said that she had told an untruth, she is still sitting on the opposition front bench.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, Senator Patterson seeks to change the subject rather than debate the motion before the chair. I think it is notable that we are debating matters of public record relating to the  performance of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). I wanted to touch upon that `Wright family' matter of public record&mdash;in fact, a matter of public notoriety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we went through the exercise in the estimates committee and were given the inadvertent misinformation and a press release was produced by a member who sits opposite, Senator Ferris, based upon that answer, that press release gained a great deal of publicity. In fact, many references had been made to the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS>and the headline `Millionaires on Welfare'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was advised by her department&mdash;it was tabled and recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that that was erroneous and that advice was received by the minister on 26 September in a minute from the secretary to her department. I do not think that it is ordinary for the secretary to a minister's department to formally apologise for misleading, thereby giving the minister no cause for suspecting that the matter was not serious, and then making a recommendation in the minute that the minister issue a media release. With that minute was enclosed a draft media release. That was on 26 September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secretary to the department was under no misapprehension that it was the minister's duty to correct the misapprehension&mdash;this matter of public notoriety&mdash;that was in the public arena and to do it quickly. The way to do it quickly was to release a media release, not to write to the secretary to the department, which may well have been another duty that the minister had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said in answer to a question today that the media makes many little errors of their own making and of the making of other people who advise them and that the minister is not responsible for correcting all of those misadvices and misreportages. But the minister is responsible to correct misinformation in the media for which she is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4562"> responsible. In this case, there is no doubt that the report, although based on Senator Ferris's media release, was based on the words of the minister and was so serious that her own departmental secretary had recommended to her that a media release be issued and, by implication, be issued forthwith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility </EMPHASIS>says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public.</PARA>
<PARA>In this case the committee had been misled and also the  public. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>When was the earliest opportunity? The secretary to the department was in no doubt. That was then and there. The secretary to the department recommended to the minister that a media release be issued and I suggest the implication is `then and there'. In relation to the duty of the minister that the Prime Minister's statement requires, it is clear that the minister's duty was to issue the media release and correct the misconception, which the minister says was caused inadvertently, at the earliest opportunity, not two weeks later. That is what the minister did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an unintentional misconception, a breach of the Prime Minister's code and a case where the department has given the lead to the secretary to the department and the minister has chosen not to take it. I suggest that this is a case of taking political advantage out of the misconception, nothing less. The media may not always get it right, but when it is not their fault, the party at fault&mdash;in this case, it is the minister&mdash;should accept responsibility for correcting the misconception.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a proposition that calls for the Senate to note Senator Vanstone's appalling array of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> answers today. This is predicated on a whole series of gaffes that she has made, fundamentally geared to the issue of the quest for truth. Of course, Senator Vanstone's quest for truth may never ever be achieved. She probably never will be able to find the holy grail that she seeks. The tangled web of fake families, bogus babies, advices from the secretary covered up, injudicious statements to the Senate and dorothy dixers have snared her in her own failures to actually be able to respond. If you cannot get it right in an answer to a dorothy dixer, then you probably will not be able to get it right as a minister. If you cannot correct the record as quickly as possible, then you should not be a minister. That is essentially what is at stake here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pattern of deceit and the pattern of fast and loose handling of the truth, of course, stems right back to the very beginning of this government. This minister, in a press release on 18 August, indicated this about her department:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . DEETYA has advised that at the time of the election, on information available to the previous government, unemployment in 2000 would have been between 6.8 and 7.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister quite clearly reinforced that view in an interview on Channel 10 on 25 August and in this chamber on 10 September. Of course, the department indicated its position very quickly, after the publication of these views, in an answer to a question that was posed by the opposition. Mr Hollway indicated to us that the department had written to the office of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to draw the attention of the office to the incorrect reporting in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on 19 August 1996 which implied that the department had advised the former Labor government that a five per cent unemployment rate was unachievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is quite clearly what the evidence was before the Senate estimates committee as well. The officials there quite clearly indicated that that was not the advice that they had given despite what the minister had said on three separate occasions. Dr Volker from DEETYA indicated this:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4564">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Volker&mdash;Again, Senator, we provided a brief which outlined the assumptions which would be needed to get there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator CARR&mdash;But it did indicate that it was achievable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Volker&mdash;If the assumptions were met.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>This was said by Dr Volker on 23 September 1996. In the supplementary round on 23 October, Mr Grant, from the same section of the department, was asked by Senator Chris Evans:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your view is there any way that such a conclusion could be fairly drawn from the advice given to the former minister, Mr Crean?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Grant replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, there is not.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no way a reasonable person could draw the conclusion that the department had advised her that the five per cent unemployment targets could be met. We see a similar pattern on 23 September in regard to the so-called Wright family. The minister had a big day on 23 September. She had already been down, before she arrived at the estimates committee, to an education conference at Darling Harbour in Sydney. In an address which was entitled `The quest for truth' she told a distinguished audience:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, this political scenario often means that the truth, the facts and the figures are lost. The headline, the grab and the spin take over from rational and informed debate. As a politician I can live with this. However, as a custodian of the nation's higher education system I am perplexed and concerned that important information about such a vital sector is distorted and ignored.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The distortion of information carried to the voters distorts and damages the democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what she has done with the Wright family. She indicated quite clearly that she has in fact misled this chamber. Some pretty important issues arise from this. It strikes me, from one of the biggest and most important government departments in this country, that such poorly constructed and consequently useless information could in fact be produced. How could that information find its way to the minister and into the Senate? The other important issue is: why did the minister take so long to correct her answer, quite clearly in breach of the ministerial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> guidelines that her Prime Minister has set down?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: Senator Vanstone's quest for the truth may never ever be achieved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I simply wish to note my support for the remonstrance that has just been presented to the Senate. I know, Madam President, that it has your support as well and the support of Senator Grant Tambling and, indeed, Senator Lundy, as we are all senators of territories that are potentially affected by the private member's bill that the remonstrance is remonstrating about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, the action of the Northern Territory parliament, as I know you are aware, is not taken lightly. This is a rare event in parliamentary terms. In parliaments under the Westminster system around the world, it is something which is resorted to only very rarely, indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of such remonstrances began in 1641 with events that are rather famous in terms of the history of our Westminster system. On that occasion in the year 1641 Charles Stuart, who subsequently became Charles I of England, caused the House of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commons to be invaded for the purpose of arresting five of its members whose actions he was unhappy with. On that occasion, the Speaker of the House of Commons delivered a remonstrance in such hard terms to the monarch that a monarch has not dared by tradition to set foot in the House of Commons ever since, except by invitation of that house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The action is not unprecedented in respect of the Northern Territory in that the Northern Territory presented a remonstrance to the federal government in 1962, protesting then about the fact that it was not a self-governing territory and that it should have been. The reason I note that, as the Chief Minister of Northern Territory noted in the territory parliament, of which I was privileged to be a member for 10 years, is the action was in fact a landmark action that assisted in the political campaign that was being waged at the time and culminated successfully in 1978 in the granting of self-government to the Northern Territory&mdash;a self-government which I believe has been exercised responsibly in the 18 years that we have had self-government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Madam President, I do not say that lightly because it has been the Country Liberal Party that has been in operation for the whole of those 18 years. I have a view that I have certainly expressed in the Northern Territory before, and can I say it is not a view that has been entirely welcomed by every member of my own party: that is, having spent the first 10 years of my life in the Northern Territory under the so-called delights of centralised government and actually working under a Canberra administration&mdash;having experienced that for 10 years and having experienced self-government for 10 years&mdash;I would much prefer the Northern Territory to be governed by the worst of all possible administrations in the Northern Territory, which is precisely what we have, than the best of all possible administrations in Canberra. That is strongly my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I disagree very strongly with this euthanasia law. I think it is bad law. I believe the process that brought it to bear is even worse, but it is a law of the Northern Territory parliament. I did want to make that point. It resulted from, again, a most unusual practice in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4573"> our Westminster system&mdash;that is, a conscience vote, something which is rarely exercised in Westminster parliaments under the two&hyphen;party system around the world. It is a rare event in any parliament, but on this occasion it was a conscience vote of the parliament and, again, a conscience vote in respect of the repeal bills put before the Northern Territory parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did everything that I possibly could to bring about the repeal of that act of parliament. I, along with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, interestingly enough, believe that it will be repealed at some time. I, along with Shane Stone, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who is on the public record with a statement with which I agree, believe that when people find out just how obnoxious this law is in practice the bill will be repealed. But it needs to be repealed by a Northern Territory parliament, not by an act of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of some interest to note&mdash;and indeed the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory noted it in the debate on this remonstrance, which has been presented to this Senate&mdash;that the previous Prime Minister of Australia did in fact receive a petition, an inquiry, from a constituent with regard to exercising the federal government's undisputed powers in respect of territories with regard to this particular legislation because the particular constituent did not like the legislation. The former Prime Minister of this country replied to that constituent in the terms that it was in fact a law of the Northern Territory, that it was in the province of the territory parliament as to whether the act remained or was repealed. Therefore, he declined to give this dreadful attack on the constitution of the Northern Territory the support that the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), I regret to say, has given it, along with the extension of the bill to the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original bill only applied to the Northern Territory. In an attempt, albeit well meant, to accommodate the concerns of people like me, Mr Andrews redrafted the bill and extended it to the ACT. In my view, that simply made the problem of the bill even more glaring than it was before and made it more difficult. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply want to conclude on that point by saying that, as far as I am concerned, this is not a question of states rights at all. I have said publicly on a number of occasions, and I will say it in here again: if the Andrews bill were presented to the federal parliament and precluded from all the parliaments of Australia voluntary active euthanasia, that particular class of law&mdash;that is, the parliament of Australia giving a medical practitioner the legal right to kill a patient, and that is what this is; this is not right to die legislation, we have had that in the territory for many years; this particular act of the Northern Territory is in fact a right for doctors to kill&mdash;I would vote in favour of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So my position on this, as I am sure many senators in here would understand, is not one of states rights. If the law applied equally to the states, I would have no difficulty in seeing the vote on this matter&mdash;and it is an important vote&mdash;being a genuine vote on the question of euthanasia, but it will not be. For all those people from New South Wales, Queensland and, indeed, from all the states who are voting in this debate, it will be a vote that they can take on this issue without the slightest impact in terms of their own constituencies. Therefore, it will not and cannot by definition be a true reflection of the position of this parliament on the question of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is this legislation applies only to the territories of Australia discriminates only against the territories of Australia. In the case of the Northern Territory, it discriminates against a parliament which has been operating without let or hindrance for 18 years. That is what I profoundly object to, as much as I object to this particular law of the Northern Territory parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a conscience vote that brought that law about. It was not in fact a piece of legislation from the Northern Territory executive which was pushed through on the numbers. As much as I dislike it, I cannot avoid looking the facts in the face and I have to concede that, rightly or wrongly, this was the true will of the Northern Territory parliament. Members of the government, and indeed members of the executive of that government, voted both for and against the legislation. Members <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4574"> of my own party, the Labor Party, also voted for and against the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, as a territory senator, I believe that on my part it would be a matter of utter betrayal of the parliamentary institutions of the territory in respect of this particular matter if I voted to support a bill which amends the constitution of the Northern Territory in such a way as to preclude an entire set of laws from being passed in that parliament. Therefore, I fully support the terms of the remonstrance that has been tabled in the Senate this afternoon.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Madam President, the remonstrance which you have just presented to the parliament is a very important and historical document. It is a document that was signed by all 25 members of all political persuasions in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly; that is, the fully elected parliament of the Northern Territory. As such, it has a very important place in the considerations that must come before the House of Representatives later today, when the euthanasia debate proceeds, and here, if on any subsequent occasion the same issue is pursued in this particular place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to be present yesterday at the procession by representatives of all three parliaments of the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island at the front of this Parliament House when the Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the Hon. Terry McCarthy, made a particular declaration on this important issue. We then subsequently proceeded to present copies of the remonstrance as passed by the Northern Territory parliament to both you, Madam President, in your private rooms, and also to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Halverson, in his rooms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It was very pleasing indeed that the representation in the procession and the presentations yesterday was in fact bipartisan, that members of the Labor Party from the Australian Capital Territory and also from the Norfolk Island parliament and members of the Country Liberal Party of the Northern Terri tory were able to be part of and present for that presentation. It is unfortunate that the leader of the Labor opposition in the Northern Territory, Mrs Maggie Hickey, and Senator Bob Collins were unable to be present yesterday at that very important and historic occasion, but I am pleased that Senator Collins has made clear to the Senate today his unequivocal support for the content and the intent of the remonstrance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also very pleased that the remonstrance proceeded, because I claim some credit in that I proposed the issue of a remonstrance to the Chief Minister a month or so ago as an appropriate mechanism to make an expression in this particular way. I drew on my own experience in that area because I was part of the presentation to this parliament in 1975 of a similar remonstrance on the issue of constitutional development of the Northern Territory. At that time, I was a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly myself, and we felt very strongly about the progress of constitutional development leading to self&hyphen;government, which then subsequently came about in 1978 in the Legislative Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Collins has already mentioned, it is important that previously, in 1962, the Northern Territory, under the aegis of, again, a cross&hyphen;party line&mdash;with the leadership of people like Tiger Brennan, a very famous political character of the Northern Territory; Dick Ward, a strong Labor member of the Northern Territory parliament; and others from my side of politics&mdash;made a similar remonstrance. The fact that the remonstrance has been presented is a very telling moment in the life of any parliament because it forces us to dwell on and to look very carefully at both the processes of the Westminster system and the issues of the relationships and respect between parliaments and, in effect, places all citizens of Australia on an equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the most important part and that is what I think both Senator Collins and I find most objectionable about the legislation proposed by Mr Kevin Andrews. It strips from territorians, whether they live in the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory or Norfolk Island, the rights that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4575"> every other Australian enjoys and should expect in the participation that they have in the parliamentary process. Therefore, I think it is most incumbent on us to take very carefully the sage advice that has been offered in this particular way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike Senator Collins, I hold a very different personal view on the issue of euthanasia. It took me a long time to wrestle with my soul in the debate as it was processed and progressed through the Northern Territory parliament over a couple of years, led by the then Chief Minister, Mr Marshall Perron. As I said, I wrestled with my soul, along with the community. I note that, in most of the urban centres of my electorate, there is widespread support for this particular legislation. I accept that, in many of the Aboriginal communities and many of the other areas, particularly those linked to both medical ethics and to a theological point of view, there is strong opposition to the social intent of this legislation, just as Senator Collins has outlined for his particular position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this legislation should be pushed in this parliament under the guise of an attack on territories' rights is indeed most unfortunate. I believe that euthanasia legislation is due and proper for consideration at this particular time right throughout Australia, but that that debate ought to be progressed and processed through the state and territory parliaments where it is right and proper for the regional differences to be properly exposed&mdash;as they have been in this debate&mdash;on a conscience vote issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is premature for the national parliament to be paternalistic or in effect overriding the wishes of people of Australia without having heard the views and opinions of all state and territory parliaments before we process this issue. Therefore, I think it is incumbent on me to point out that the remonstrance, as presented today, is a very proper and telling message between parliaments and on behalf of Australian citizens who live in all territories throughout Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I concur with the overall sentiments of the previous two speakers, Senator Bob Collins and Senator Tambling, that this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament is not the place to be overriding the legislation of the Northern Territory, which is world pioneering legislation on the matter of euthanasia. It is essentially a matter of human rights to me. I agree with Senator Tambling that we, as a maturing society, ought to have room to extend that right because, by not doing so, we are taking it away from people without their volition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must disagree with Senator Collins about it being `right to kill' legislation. It is nothing of the sort. It is a right of an individual who is dying, without hope of a remedy or remission, to be able to say, `I do not want to suffer unnecessarily or to suffer unnecessary dignity, nor to visit that suffering on my loved ones. I have a right, after a healthy and productive human life on this planet, to be able to make that determination.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important matter of individual rights, but it is not yet, as far as I understand it&mdash;and I have not read up well on this&mdash;a matter of universal covenant. I believe the time will come when it will be a matter of a global covenant, and then maybe this parliament will have the anchor upon which to consider the matter with more force. Indeed, this parliament quite rightly, for example, considered the matter of the Franklin River and its universal obligation to prevent the dam, which would have destroyed a World Heritage property if the state government had proceeded with that unnecessary and destructive dam in the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the remonstrance is something I believe we ought to all take careful note of, and I hope it will be circulated so that we can study it individually. It is, of course, a means of drawing attention to the feeling of angst that there is in the Northern Territory that this parliament, through a bill which is an artifice, might override the pioneering legislation for euthanasia, which has such popular backing in the Northern Territory. The so-called Andrews bill, which may come from the House of Representatives to the Senate later this year, is an artifice. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is purporting to be protecting states rights, but the real intent is to take away the hard&hyphen;won individual rights of individuals in the Northern Territory to have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4576"> access to euthanasia under the conditions laid out in that territory's euthanasia legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a very strong supporter of the legislation in the Northern Territory. I see the artifice that is being brought into this parliament to try to override that legislation. I support both the feeling in this remonstrance and the initiating question, which is the rights of individuals to a good death when their life is ebbing, they have no hope of remission and they wish to make that determination. I dare say that it is a matter we are going to hear a lot more about in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I go back to a point that Senator Tambling made. I do not think it is going to be a case of this law being overturned in the Northern Territory. I think it is going to be quite the reverse&mdash;a case of this law being a light of inspiration and hope spreading out to the other territories and states of this nation, and from here to other nations around the world, to give a very important right to human beings in search of dignity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No. 91. The explanatory statement advises that the Regulations partly implement a number of resolutions of the special meeting on 10 May 1996 of the Australian Police Ministers' Council, following the Port Arthur killings.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Part 3 of Schedule 6 provides for safety requirements for firearms. Item 1.6 provides in part that a firearm must not operate so as to discharge if dropped under specified conditions from a height of not more than 45 centimetres. The Committee asks whether this should be not less than 45 centimetres. As the provision stands at present the test could be satisfied by dropping a firearm from a height of, for instance, one centimetre. Of course, if the provision was for a height of not less than 45 centimetres, the firearm could be dropped from any height greater than that, which also would not appear to be the intended effect. The Committee asks why the provision does not simply provide for drops of 45 centimetres. If such precision is not required or is not attainable, could there be provision for a drop of 40 to 50 centimetres?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 6 August 1996 requesting my advice in relation to matters contained in amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations effected by Statutory Rules 1996 No. 91. The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (the Regulations) control the importation of the goods specified in the various regulations or the Schedules to the Regulations, by prohibiting importation absolutely, or making importation subject to the permission of a Minister or a specified person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the Port Arthur tragedy, a special meeting of the Australasian Police Minister's Council (APMC) adopted a number of resolutions aimed at more effective national firearm controls. The implementation of these resolutions required the Commonwealth Government to impose a total prohibition on the importation into Australia of all self-loading rifles and self-loading and pump action longarms. The importation of fully automatic weapons was already prohibited under the Regulations. While the importation of semi-automatic weapons was at that time subject to some controls under the Regulations, controls on their importation were tightened in</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">accordance with the APMC resolutions. These amendments took effect on 14 May 1996 in Statutory Rules 1996 No. 59.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Soon after these amendments, a new and simplified structure within the Regulations for the control of the importation of all firearms into Australia was introduced by Statutory Rules 1996 No. 91. The previous structure was introduced in 1990 but, as a result of several amendments being effected to the Regulations since 1990, the controls were spread across 6 regulations and 3 Schedules of the Regulations. This resulted in great difficulties in identifying the import control that applied to each type of firearm, and led to inconsistent interpretation and administration of the controls. The new structure introduced by Statutory Rules 1996 No. 91 has consolidated the import controls under one regulation (regulation 4F) and a single Schedule (Schedule 6) of the Regulations. The amendments also introduced tighter controls on the importation of firearm accessories, parts, magazines and ammunition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 4F provides that the importation of a firearm a firearm accessory, a firearm part, a firearm magazine or ammunition is prohibited unless the article is an article to which an item in Part 2 of Schedule 6 applies and the importation is in accordance with the requirements set out in that Part. In particular, placing both the firearms and the requirements for their importation in the same Schedule is the core of the simplified 8&mdash;structure <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as it enables the immediate identification of the firearm, etc and the requirements with which the importation of the firearm, etc must comply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These requirements fall into 4 broad categories or "tests": (1) the official purposes test, (2) the specified purposes test; (3) the specified persons test; and (4) the Police authorisation test (items 1 to 4 of Paright 1 of Schedule 6 refer). The requirements of three of the four tests (numbers (1), (2) and (4)) are a substantial carry-over of previous requirements for the importation of firearms. The fourth test, the specified persons test, contains a new set of requirements which arise from the APMC Resolution of 10 May 1996. This new test recognises the need of certain persons to possess semi-automatic firearms for the purposes of their occupation. Under the official purposes test, the importation of an article to which the test relates is prohibited unless the Attorney-General (AG) is satisfied that the article is for the purposes of the government of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory and that the relevant government will retain ownership of the firearm. This test is a carry-over of the previous "official purposes test" for the importation of firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The specified purposes test also provides that the importation of an article to which the test relates is prohibited unless the permission of the AG has been given. Under this test permission may only be given where the AG is satisfied that the firearm is not available in Australia and is to be used in either the production of a film or in the development of mountings for a laser target designator. Also, the importer must hold a licence or authorisation to possess the article in the State or Territory in which it is to be used. The specified purposes test is a direct carry over of two tests for the importation of firearms under the previous Regulations (previous regulations 4D, 4DA and 4DB).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the specified persons test, the importation of an article to which the test relates is prohibited unless the permission of the AG has been given. Under this test, permission may only be given where the AG is satisfied that the importer is a person who carries out the specified occupation and who holds a license or authorisation to possess the article in the State or Territory in which it is to be used. While this is a new import control test it is in the same form as import control tests, such as the film test, which were in the previous Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Police authorisation test, the importation of an article to which the test relates is prohibited unless the importer of the article has been given a statement, in an approved form from the relevant Commissioner, Chief Commissioner or Chief Police Officer of the police force of the State or Territory, that the importer holds a licence or authorisation to possess the article in accordance with the law of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4582"> the relevant State or Territory. Similar to the specified purposes test, this test is a direct carry-over of an import control under the previous Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The type of test with which the importation of the article must comply depends on the article itself. For example, most of the articles which are included in Schedule 6 to the Regulations, including, firearms, can be imported if they comply with any of the four abovementioned tests. While any of the four tests can be complied with, in practical terms the importation of an article to which the tests apply is allowed where the least stringent Police authorisation test is complied with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, certain firearms can only be imported under more limited circumstances. For example, all self-loading, semi-automatic firearms above a certain magazine capacity, as well as their parts and accessories, can only be imported if they comply with one of the first three tests. Not only must the possession of these firearms be permitted in a relevant State or Territory, but their importation will only be permitted if it is for one of the specified purposes set out in the first three tests. All other firearms and their parts and accessories which are not expressly identified in Schedule 6 (which includes all fully automatic firearms), can only be imported in accordance with the first two of the four tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your letter, you seek my advice as to whether the discretions which are exercisable by the AG or the relevant Commissioner, Chief Commissioner or Chief Police Officer of the police force of a State or Territory under the above tests are subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, in relation to the discretions exercised under the fourth test by the Commissioner, Chief Commissioner or Chief Police Officer of the police force of a State or Territory, these directions are exercised under the relevant law of a State or Territory. The licensing or authorising of the possession of a firearm, etc is dealt with in State and Territory legislation and therefore, cannot be the subject of merits review by the Commonwealth's AAT. However, it is appropriate to note that one of the purposes of the APMC itself is to promote a uniform, national approach to gun control amongst the States and Territories. Consistent and coherent administration of firearm licensing laws amongst the various administrations therefore is given an opportunity for regular discussion and review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the discretions exercised by the AG under the first three tests, the decision by the AG to refuse to grant a permission to import an article under any of the tests is not subject to merits review by the AAT. This is because the matters of which the AG must be satisfied before he or she can grant a permission are based on the high <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government policy considerations of public safety. As referred to above, the types of articles to which only these tests apply include all fully automatic firearms and semi&hyphen;automatic firearms above a certain capacity as well as their parts and accessories. Therefore, the AG must first be satisfied of the limited use to which the articles will be put. The fact that the permission can only be granted in respect a such limited uses will ensure that articles such as firearms will not enter into general circulation. Also the fact that the AG must be satisfied of the limited use to which the articles will be put is necessary because, without the AG's permission, such articles would otherwise be prohibited imports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the second and third tests, the AG must also be satisfied that the importer holds the relevant State or Territory licence or authorisation to possess the article in the relevant State or Territory in which article is to be used. In the interests of public safety, the AG cannot grant a permission to import an article to which the tests apply that an importer is not licensed or authorised to possess.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, if the AG is not satisfied of these matters, permission to import the article would not be granted and the refusal would be based on the high government policy grounds of public safety. It is not considered desirable to have merits review by the AAT of refusals of permissions when based on high government policy grounds such as this one. This position is also taken in respect of the control on the importation of goods under regulation 4 of the Regulations (Importation of certain dangerous goods in Schedule 2) and regulation 4R (importation of radioactive substances). The high government policy ground of giving effect to international treaty obligations is also another example for excepting refusals to grant import permission from merits review under regulations 4QA (importation of goods of Iraqi origin presently under United Nations sanctions).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the three tests, the decision maker who might refuse to grant an import permission is restricted to the AG. This restriction is seen as the necessary corollary to the exemption from merits review of decisions made on grounds of high government policy. In short, the final decision can only be taken by the Government's relevant policy Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exception of decisions to refuse import permissions from merits review under the above circumstances has previously been acknowledged by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, as has the corresponding control in such circumstances that restrict the refusal of permission power to the Government's relevant policy Minister. I am advised that in respect of the first and second tests, the Committee has acknow <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4583"> ledged this exception in the identical circumstances under the import controls on firearms in the previous Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also note your comment in relation to one of the requirements for safety testing of firearms contained in item 1.6 of Part 3 of Schedule 6. Under this requirement, a firearm that is dropped 3 times from a height of not more than 45 centimetres on to a rubber mat must not discharge. While I concede the point made by the Committee that the present wording of this requirement would allow a firearm to be dropped from any height less than 45 centimetres, I am advised that, in practice, a firearm is dropped from a height of 45 centimetres. However, the Committee has identified an inadvertent loophole in the present wording which is acknowledged. In order to ensure that a firearm is always dropped from a reasonable height, subitem 1.6 will be amended to provide that the firearm can only be dropped from a height between 35 and 45 centimetres. I thank the Committee for drawing this matter to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that the above comments are of assistance to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Migration Agents Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No. 79.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New cause 27 of the Code of Conduct requires agents to keep records of applications and of written and oral communications between the agent and clients. New clause 27A then requires an agent to make these records available for inspection on request by the Migration Agents Registration Board. The Committee would appreciate your advice on what protection  exists for the privacy of clients and whether the Privacy Commissioner was consulted on the present Regulations. The same question applies to clients' financial details under clause 28A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New clauses 28, 28A and 28B provide for the financial duties of an agent. New clause 28 requires the agent to keep separate accounts for the agent's operating expenses and for monies paid by clients to the agent for fees and disbursements. Cause 28A provides for records of clients' accounts. Clause <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 28B provides that nothing in these provisions affects the duty of a migration agent who is also a legal practitioner and who acts in that capacity, from the usual financial responsibility of a legal practitioner to clients' funds. This last requirements would, among other things, require a legal practitioner to comply with trust account provisions, which would give substantial protection to clients' money. The Committee asks why an agent who is not a legal practitioner does not appear to need to keep proper trust accounts? What happens if an agent who is not a legal practitioner goes bankrupt? Is the clients' money at risk? The earlier Code of Conduct provided for trust accounts, although in a permissive rather than mandatory fashion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 2 August 1996 in which you sought advice in relation to aspects of the Migration Agents Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No.79. The delay in replying to you is regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Migration Agents Registration Scheme (the Scheme) requires the registration of persons providing immigration advice and assistance and includes a complaints investigation mechanism which may result in disciplinary action by the Migration Agents Registration Board (the Board). The Scheme establishes minimum requirements for qualification for registration as a migration agent and establishes the boundaries of ethical and professional conduct within the migration advice industry. By so doing, the Scheme provides a high level of consumer protection for people who receive immigration advice from incompetent or unscrupulous advisers. The amendments to the Migration Agents Regulations are designed to enhance the objective of consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 308(1)(c) of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) provides that the Board may, at any time, require an agent to provide the Board with specified documents or records relevant to an agent's registration. The Board has exercised this power in the past, particularly in relation to complaints made against registered agents. However, in many instances, the Board has experienced difficulty in establishing the veracity of issues arising from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4584"> complaints because a failure on the part of some agents to adequately document their dealings with their clients. New Clause 27 of the Migration Agents Code of Conduct (the Code) is designed to address this problem by requiring that agents maintain case files which fully document their dealings with clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As it stood, the wording of the former Clause 28 of the Migration Agents Code of Conduct did not impose on all agents a requirement to operate separate accounts for client monies and an agent's business operating expenses. Rather it provided examples of the type of accounts agents should operate, including trust accounts. This resulted in some agents maintaining a single bank account for client and agent monies. In its report on the review of the Migration Agents Registration Scheme, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration recommended at recommendation 32 that, "Clause 28 of the Code of Conduct for migration agents be amended to clarify a migration agent's obligation to maintain client and agent funds in separate accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Clause 28 of the Code of Conduct implements this recommendation. The Clause is also designed to ensure the separation of an agent's business operating funds and monies paid to the agent by clients to cover application and agent's fees which can only be accessed once the agent has completed the relevant service and billed the client.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legal practitioners' obligations in relation to the operation of trust accounts are the subject of State legislation. New Clause 28B requires legal practitioners who are agents to continue to operate a trust account for the deposit of client monies. However, because non-lawyer agents were and continue to be beyond the reach of State trust fund legislation, the Code now requires that they operate a separate client account, albeit in a form similar to a trust account. The combined effect of new Clauses 28 and 28A, therefore, offers clients greater protection because the separation of client and agent's operating funds is now mandatory for all agents, as well as requiring agents to maintain detailed financial records which are open to scrutiny by the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked about the consequences of a non-lawyer agent being declared bankrupt. Section 303 of the Act provides that, where an agent is declared bankrupt, whether a legal practitioner or not, the Board may caution the agent or suspend or cancel the agent's registration. In such circumstances, it is then open to any client of that agent to seek recovery of monies under existing bankruptcy legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the privacy issues you have raised, the members of the Board are acutely aware of the confidential and sensitive nature of information obtained by agents in the course of their dealings with clients. The Board is subject to the provisions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Privacy Act 1988 and has, therefore, implemented procedures designed to protect information provided by agents to the Board in the exercise of its statutory powers. Given that the amendments to the Code are aimed at strengthening powers which the Board has exercised in the past, pursuant to paragraph 308(1)(c) of the Act, rather than introducing new provisions, it was not considered necessary to consult with the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The report I am tabling today is the record of a short tour of inspection which the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade undertook in August this year. The program of familiarisation visits, inspections and briefings encompassed key defence establishments in Brisbane, Townsville and Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program placed appropriate emphasis on the subcommittee's interest in learning first hand of the activities of the ADF. Although short, the program of visits and meetings provided very useful information for members of the subcommittee, particularly those who joined the subcommittee during this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the program we had many opportunities to discuss topical defence issues with commanding officers and service personnel. We gained invaluable insights into capabilities and requirements in the north. However, the report we have presented does not pretend to be an exhaustive discussion of all the topics <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4585"> raised with or by the subcommittee during the familiarisation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were particularly interested in seeing what has been undertaken through the APIN project, the army presence in the north project, which has been developing mainly at Robertson Barracks in Darwin since 1989 and will continue until the final phase of the project in the year 2001. Fully realised, APIN will see the relocation of some 2,300 soldiers and 2,600 family members to Darwin. APIN represents a departure from the traditional home location of elements of the Australian Defence Force in southern capitals and towns, and emphasises instead the establishment of quick response operational units which are self&hyphen;sufficient and trained for remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">APIN represents a major commitment to increasing Australia's defence capabilities in the north as well as a considerable financial investment. It is a clear example of tailoring modern accommodation construction techniques to meet the demanding climate of the tropics. The overall cost of the project has been estimated at around $500 million and there are significant flow-on effects for the Northern Territory economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We learned that defence is directly spending at present an average of $2 million per week in the Northern Territory. With construction added, it would be closer to $4 million per week not including construction and maintenance expenditure by the Defence Housing Authority. In eight years of operation in Darwin, the authority has injected $27.3 million on average each year into the local economy. The relative effect of direct and indirect defence expenditure is expected to be maintained at around 10 per cent of the gross territory product from 1995 to 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the features of APIN which impressed the subcommittee was the continued partnership with private industry in the design and construction of facilities and amenities and in the associated tendering processes which were designed to encourage the participation of small as well as large contractors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Defence Housing Authority has also participated in successful joint ventures with private sector developers. We attended the opening of Fairway Waters, the latest col laborative project at Palmerston, south-east of Darwin. It provides high-quality housing for defence personnel as well as for private purchasers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of major interest to the subcommittee during the northern visits was the Army 21 review, the proposed blueprint for the army for the 21st century, which had been presented to the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan). This has now been overtaken by the Restructuring of the Army statement by the Minister for Defence in the last sitting week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, given the significance of Army 21 as a paper for the future of Australia's defence as it was then, the subcommittee was surprised that the broad thrust of the proposals did not appear to be widely disseminated through the army's chain of command. Also there has been much media speculation in recent months about the new direction proposed for Australia's army of the future. The subcommittee has sought a briefing from the Minister for Defence on the restructuring proposals for the army and looks forward to receiving the briefing now that the minister made his defence policy statement in the parliament on 15 October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to thank the Minister for Defence, and the military and civilian personnel who assisted in ensuring the success of the subcommittee's familiarisation program. I also thank the secretariat of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, who worked closely with defence personnel to develop a program of visits, briefings and inspections which has provided so much valuable information to subcommittee members about defence requirements and capabilities in northern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central part of the visit was to see the development that has taken place in recent years of the presence of the Australian Defence Force in the north&mdash;the APIN or army presence in the north program. This is a very important program as well as being a very expensive one. The importance of it lies in the fact that it acclimatises troops who were formerly in Victoria and in the southern part of New South Wales to life in the tropics.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4586">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the prospective area of operations for Australian Defence Force troops will be either in the northern part of Australia or in South-East Asia, the acclimatisation of those troops is a matter that takes time and is a very important adjunct in their training and preparedness. At the same time it exposes their equipment and, to a certain degree, their doctrine, the way they operate, to the requirements of the climate as well. It tests them in a way that would not be possible to do at Holsworthy or Puckapunyal in the southern part of the continent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undeniably, it is a very high cost program because you are supporting a large establishment a long way from its source of supplies. The evidence given to the committee and recorded in this report from army was that, just off the top of their head, they estimated it was costing between $15,000 and $16,000 per soldier per annum as a consequence of the location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the original reason for the deployment to the north taken by the Labor government was wrong. It was based on the Dibb concept of defending Australia by lining the beaches with troops shoulder to shoulder&mdash;a philosophy which, sadly, still lives on, particularly in army today in many quarters. But there are some advantages in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Dibb's basic philosophy is quite wrong. What is absolutely crucial is for the Australian Defence Force and the Australian nation to know what is going on in that area. It is also terribly important for us to demonstrate our sovereignty over the territorial areas that we claim as our own: on the land, in the air and at sea. If a nation does not demonstrate its sovereignty then people do not respect that sovereignty. We must know what is going on in and through the airspace, over and under the water and on the landmass there, but that does not mean that you put your armed combat force units in that area. Nevertheless, it has happened now. Whatever the reasons, we have got a major financial investment in the north that we simply cannot walk away from. We have got to make the most of it and use it as effectively as we can for the benefit of the Defence Force and for the benefit of the country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be very interested to read the report being prepared by the Australian National Audit Office into the cost of the army presence in the north. The ANAO has just started to prepare the report. I say that because it is important in these times of restricted budgets for Defence that we know precisely what everything is costing us. I do not think that should be the sole determinant of what we do, what capabilities we should acquire or what force structures we should have&mdash;far from it. Defence is not a business: it is not something that presents a balance sheet and pays a dividend in a monetary sense every year. Its great dividend is the peace and security of this country, and that is a matter that cannot be quantified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think it is important that we get a very accurate handle on this instead of making the assumptions that we have to make at the present time about the cost of the army presence in the north. I look forward to the audit office report being available to the parliament in a year or so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the motion moved by Senator MacGibbon. Like all other residents of North Queensland, I am particularly proud of the Australian defence forces in the North Queensland area.

Senator MacGibbon was, of course, the chairman of the Defence Subcommittee and was actually the leader of the group that completed this report. The work of the committee is very obvious. I am also a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, but unfortunately I was not able to be involved in this particular trip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a North Queenslander and, like all others who live in the north, I am very proud of the army, navy and air force as they are established in North Queensland and the tremendous role they play in the community. The particular visit which this report records <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4587"> was organised to familiarise members of the Defence Subcommittee with a range of defence establishments in northern Australia. I want to confine my remarks to that area of northern Queensland with which I am most familiar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee met with Brigadier Mike Smith AM, the commander of the 3rd Brigade, and his officers. Lavarack Barracks is the headquarters of the 3rd Brigade and incorporates two infantry battalions&mdash;1 RAR and 2 RAR. The capability of the brigade is enhanced by the Townsville based allocated units, which are the 5th Aviation Regiment, the 2nd Field Logistic Battalion, No. 35 Squadron RAAF and the Operational Support Group RAAF. The 3rd Brigade is held at the very highest degree of readiness for operations and is the major combat component of the Australian Defence Force's Ready Deployment Force. A large proportion of the brigade's exercise training schedule involves joint training with the RAN and the RAAF. It also participates in combined exercises with United States and Indonesian forces. These exercises are of value in gaining new skills and ideas and in developing teamwork and understanding between defence forces of neighbouring countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The army presence in Townsville contributes very significantly to the local community and the economy. I have to say that small business generally benefits greatly from the presence of the army at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville. The army provides an enormous amount towards employment in the northern city. As well, the defence forces play a major community role. Many of the soldiers and airmen in Townsville are fully integrated in a very significant way within the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the Defence Subcommittee raised in discussions the role of army community service in minimising the negative impacts of overseas service&mdash;as in the case of Somalia and Rwanda&mdash;on service personnel and families, the army's relations with the wider Townsville community, and the impact of the transfer program when service personnel and families are transferred either to or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out of Townsville to other bases Australia&hyphen;wide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also met with Wing Commander Graham O'Brien, Wing Commander Geoff Lydeamore and Wing Commander Richards at the Townsville RAAF Base. The RAAF Base accommodates the Headquarters of the Operational Support Group, No. 84 Wing, 5th Aviation, the Combat Survival Training School and 323 Air Base Wing. Air Base Wing and No. 84 Wing are staffed by 390 service personnel and 33 civilian personnel and comprise a number of different units. The role of No. 84 Wing is to provide safe and effective short&hyphen;range fixed&hyphen;wing transport support to meet the requirements of the Australian defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 5th Aviation Regiment was established as an army unit in 1987 and now operates more aircraft than any other operational ADF unit. It provides air mobility and battlefield support to 3rd Brigade and it works closely on training exercises with the SAS. Further, 5th Aviation Regiment gives community assistance in search and rescue and flood relief operations and in relation to most civilian calamities&mdash;particularly the cyclones that we experience all too often in the north. The regiment plays a major and very beneficial role in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Townsville community was shaken by the Black Hawk accident at the high range training area in June this year. It affected all ranges of people across the Townsville community. Within my office two of my staff&mdash;through family and close friends&mdash;knew of people who were either killed or seriously injured in that accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Black Hawk helicopters were engaged on a Special Air Service Regiment training exercise when the accident occurred. Eighteen service personnel were killed and others were seriously injured. The army has taken action to counsel and support the service personnel and their families. Just this week, the inquiry into the Black Hawk helicopters crash is being convened in Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Defence Subcommittee also learned about the levels of Black Hawk serviceability after the major maintenance problems experienced in 1995. The parliamentary Standing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4588"> Committee on Public Works was also in Townsville last week and it heard that maintenance costs would blow out to over the allocated $1.4 million per aircraft unless action was taken quickly to correct the corrosion. Corrosion in those aircraft can seriously reduce the life of the helicopters. I understand that the government has announced that steps will be taken to properly house those helicopters so that the maintenance problems are minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the Defence Subcommittee visited the Jezzine barracks, the headquarters of the 11th Brigade, and were briefed by the brigade's commander, Brigadier Neil Weekes. Eleventh Brigade is the only reserve formation in an area which stretches from Thursday Island and within three kilometres of the Papua New Guinea border, west to the Queensland border and south to a line joining Mount Isa and Ingham. Although Townsville is the headquarters of the brigade, it does not actually lie within the brigade's tactical area of operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The brigade is an independent brigade group trained for protective operations. Its regional surveillance task is to examine and monitor civil infrastructure capabilities which would support military operations protecting vital assets. These vital assets include the port of Weipa and RAAF Scherger, Thursday Island, Horn Island, Mount Isa, Cairns, the port of Karumba, the Prince of Wales Channel, Endeavour Passage and the Carpentaria Mineral Province. The 11th Brigade has three army reserve battalions and support formations&mdash;31 Battalion RQR based in Townsville, 42 Battalion RQR based in Rockhampton, and 51 Battalion FNQR headquartered in Cairns but moving right up Cape York and into the Torres Strait islands&mdash;and it has a signals squadron, a field battery and brigade administrative support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, the Commonwealth is currently involved in expenditure in the high range army area west of Townsville, where a lot of the training work for our defence forces takes place. It is interesting that the army have appointed senior level officers with appropriate qualifications to keep an eye on the environmental consequences of training in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some parts of Queensland that are very environmentally sensitive. It is, indeed, pleasing to see that the army have, at high level, taken an interest in the environmental aspects of their training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, it was good to have the Defence Subcommittee visit the north to see what the defence forces do, and it raises again the tremendously good relationships which the defence forces have with the local communities and gives us an opportunity to highlight the very effective and necessary work that our defence forces do in North Queensland.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I last addressed this bill, I said that the second reading speech is an interesting speech for this reason: not only does it allege various facts&mdash;which is common to second reading speeches, to form a basis for doing what the legislation purports to do&mdash;but also the proposition that has been put alleges facts which, to a large extent, would go against that proposition, which is that one&hyphen;third of Telstra should be sold. Many of the things that are contained in the second reading speech, as I see it, would justify not the sale of Telstra but the keeping of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said on the last occasion that there was a statement in the second reading speech which suggested that the onus should be on those who want to resist the sale of Telstra to show why it should not be sold. I was saying that that is looking at things from the wrong angle. To sell Telstra, a most successful company, which, I recall, according to the second reading speech, is the biggest tax paying company in Australia, and put at risk that payment of tax to the Commonwealth seems to be a strange course to adopt. The first page of the second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal is not about marrying an ideological attachment to private ownership with the necessity to balance the books. Partial privatisation of Telstra is one element of a broader telecommunications policy aimed at giving Australians a world&hyphen;class telecommunications industry in terms of not only technology but also pricing and quality of service.</PARA>
<PARA>Much is made of the universal service obligation. It is difficult to see how selling one-third of Telstra can obtain that object. As the second reading speech points out, the government will retain the majority shareholding. Page 7 of the second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will also entrench a provision in Telstra's constitution to enable the Commonwealth to appoint directors in proportion to its shareholding.</PARA>
<PARA>It will continue to be able to control Telstra into the future. The reality is that the sale of one-third of Telstra will make very little difference. No doubt, the minority shareholders, as is pointed out in the second reading speech, will be able to go to annual general meetings and ask questions. No doubt, they will be able to put some pressure on the directors of Telstra. But it will not fundamentally change the present situation where the government is subject to questions in this chamber to ensure that Telstra is properly run. It seems a great effort to go through the process of selling one-third of Telstra simply to have some minority shareholders in a position to ask questions at the annual general meeting. Page 7 of the second reading speech also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Placing reporting obligations in legislation is the most transparent means of retaining access to information on a basis comparable to the current arrangements.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4590"> </PARA>
<PARA>The strange thing about that is that that sentence contemplates that the present situation does give a transparency to the way things are done. We are going to have a privatisation of Telstra and then to obtain what we lose as a result of that; we are going to have legislation to make transparent what is already transparent under the present scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation attempts to privatise a government corporation and then to provide a great deal of legislation to attempt to bring Telstra back to the very situation it is now in. The second reading speech says that the regulation of this company will now be tighter. I hope I have remembered the words correctly. It said that the provisions to have that in the new legislation will be much more strict than the regulation that was put into place under the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems extraordinary that we are going to vote on a bill on the basis of a second reading speech which, in effect, when it is read properly, is aimed more at keeping Telstra in its present ownership. It would be more readily understood if the whole thing was being sold off, but clearly that is not happening and there are no plans to sell this company off. We seem to fall between two stools. Firstly, we have a company that is only one-third privatised. Nevertheless, that comes with a lot more regulation of this company. Secondly, we go down a path that would seem to be privatisation, with the benefits that can bring, but we really do not&mdash;we really are chasing a dream. On page 13, under the heading `Customer service guarantee', the second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition has long been concerned about declines in many aspects of service, particularly where there is a lack of competition such as in areas of rural and remote Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>But there is no explanation of how the sale of one-third of Telstra is going to bring about any more competition in rural or remote Australia. It is a statement that was made and just left hanging in the air. Indeed, the presumption is that there will be no more competition because of the sale of one-third of Telstra. The only thing that would happen is that it may well be that the minority share <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> holders object to the company spending money in non-productive activities in rural and remote Australia. If that is so, the effect of selling one-third of Telstra will bring some pressure to bear on the company not to provide as good a service as it might in areas which do not return as big a profit as might be desired by the shareholders. Those areas are likely to be rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a vote on this when we were last here. Much consumer legislation is going into place in this bill. That legislation is necessary because the government perceives that people&mdash;Australians, the customers of Telstra&mdash;should be better treated. The whole purpose of privatisation and this one&hyphen;third sale is supposed to be to make services better through competition. If that is so, why does this second reading speech go through the process of saying that we need all these other regulations to obtain in effect what competition, as it is expressed in this bill, cannot obtain?</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Greens are totally opposed to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. We stood strongly against it during the election campaign and there has not been anything in the public debate or the Senate debate that I have heard since to change our minds. It is simply bad doctrinaire policy by the new government. It is doctrinaire because it is an extension of the idea that anything that the Stock Exchange can decide is better than anything that the parliament can decide. This is the fundamental principle of economic fundamentalism itself&mdash;economic rationalism, if you like&mdash;which is practised by this government with such zeal that it even puts a shine on the efforts of the previous Labor government, which, as we all know, was busy privatising such great Australian institutions as the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the latter, of course, I have seen the figures from the Australia Institute which show that it actually cost the Australian public over $600 million to sell the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories into private hands. That is the long&hyphen;term cost of government having to buy back services and the actual <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4591"> conveyancing, if you like, of that sale. What an extraordinary situation it is where, on the belief that government and parliament cannot adequately run vital sections of public affairs, we actually have the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in order to sell that instrumentality into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that was not warning enough, on this occasion we have before the Senate, in monetary terms, a much bigger sale and, in monetary terms, a much bigger loss inherent in this sale of Telstra. I have seen the figures&mdash;they are debatable&mdash;that the goodwill and the actual wherewithal of Telstra sold on the market as the government proposes would lead to losses of up to $20 billion or $30 billion. We are actually going to pay to take out of national control such an essential service as telecommunications because, for reasons that have not yet been able to be brought home because they have not been provided by the government, it is thought that, in private hands, Telstra will be a better entity than it has proved to be in public hands. That is muddle&hyphen;headed and it is wrong. The silly argument brought forward by the government&mdash;that the Castro government is doing this and therefore that justifies our doing it&mdash;shows the absurdity that attends the government's argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of the third of Telstra is said to bring in some $8 billion to the public coffers, and $1 billion out of that over the next five years or so will be put towards what is called the Natural Heritage Trust. There are two things about that. Firstly, the monetary side. What the government is proposing to do will effectively knock out one of the biggest income earners that it has got. The sale of the whole of Telstra&mdash;and that is the intention of the government in the medium to short term&mdash;would mean a loss of income of over $1 billion per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons the public of Australia are opposed to this legislation is that they have the savvy to know that that money can be made up only through either an increase in taxes or further cuts in public services. It means that the average Australian is going to be either hit in the pocket or further deprived of essential services such as health, education <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and security. When it gets to the hidden or indirect costs, they are legion. Many of them have been pointed to by previous speakers, so I will not go into the legion. Suffice it to say, however, that people on lower incomes and people in remote rural areas of Australia are going to be hardest hit. There is no doubt that Telstra's ability in public hands to deliver basic and essential telecommunication services to those two categories of Australians is going to be trammelled by its sale into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter what temporary legislation safeguarding the poor and the people living in remote areas is passed by this parliament, the ineluctable pressure of the private corporation which arises out of this sale will be in the opposite direction. It is going to be a great penalty on the pockets of remote consumers in Australia as we go down the line. They are going to find it harder to get some equality of service, let alone to get it at some equality of cost as the burgeoning communications world, the world of information, means that they too, like urban dwellers, rely more and more on the services that Telstra does provide and which it ought to be providing into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be much better for the government to be legislating to have a single underground cable system for all major providers in this country and for the cost of that to be borne not just by Telstra but by all providers than for the government to be bringing this legislation into this parliament with the end effect of deteriorating services to the public at greater cost to its pocket. I am referring there not to the big end of town but to the public in the main, spread out in the regional and rural areas of Australia, or those people struggling to make ends meet in the cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4592"> The second point, of course, is the environment. This parliament has already legislated to exclude Telstra and Optus from environmental considerations in expanding their networks. That has led to an enormous public reaction in what is arguably the most environmentally sensitive country in the world. People simply do not like cables being rolled out through their leafy suburbs at the whim of Optus any more than they like either company sticking towers on every hill, mar ring every vista in the great Australian countryside. But they can do that without fear or favour because this parliament was, I think, remiss enough to say, `We will not extend environmental laws to the extension of telecommunications in the future.' That was presumably done because it was thought that that would be a monetary cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is because successive governments have put all on the altar of monetary costs and none on the altar of other values in life, including environmental and aesthetic values, which the Australian public holds in higher kudos than the average member of cabinet has done in this place for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then comes the grand duplicity, the greenmail that is involved in this legislation. The government says that it is going to put $1 billion aside out of the sale to provide for funding the Natural Heritage Trust. When we look at that, we find that, in effect, the government has taken a much wider brush and is saying in essence, `If you want to have a good environment in the future, you've got to support this legislation to flog off Telstra into the private domain.' It is blackmail by old standards, greenmail by the new standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to accept that, then every time an environmental consideration is to be made by the government it will see its opportunity to play off some other totally unrelated consideration with those people in this place who hold the environment at the top of the scale of importance in the decisions we make. What will it be next? Will it be the privatisation of tertiary education around the country to raise money to protect our forests? Who knows. There would be no end to it. Once you give in to greenmail, you are caught forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have told the minister on a number of occasions that he can say what he likes about the need to fund the various things listed in his Natural Heritage Trust legislation but he is selling himself out in his responsibility as Australia's premier environmentalist when he says, `I won't do that unless we sell off Telstra and get the assent of the Senate to do so.' What a disgraceful philosophy. What a disgraceful way to behave as minister for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment. That is the failure of Senator Hill, who purports to be the minister for the environment but in fact repeatedly acts as minister against the environment. He says, `I'm not going to look after woodlands, I'm not going to look after the restoration of the health of our rivers, the coasts can go jump and Cape York is not a matter of consideration to me, unless you flog off the telephones.' That is where he is at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a travesty of his obligation as Minister for the Environment that Senator Hill is not fighting for each of those issues on their merit. It is a comment on the bankruptcy of wider ethics and values in this place, or at least in the realm of government thinking, that this greenmail is put before the Senate and the Minister for the Environment gets up and backs it. He has certainly done so publicly outside and with me in private as well. We are not buying that. As Greens, we never could and we never would.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at this bankrupt argument by the government that they need to sell Telstra to protect part of the environment, you actually see that at the same time they are draining previous funding from environmental efforts and obligations. In other words, they are not only creating the myth that they cannot get money from elsewhere to protect the environment, but they are also creating the myth that that spending&mdash;this was a commitment by Prime Minister Howard before the election&mdash;coming out of the sale of Telstra would be for new environmental goods. It is not. It is going to be put into past environmental commitments on the broad scale. We will not have a bar of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The efforts of this government to come to grips with its environmental obligations are going to be fought out in this place, as far as I and the Australian Greens are concerned, on the merits of the environmental product that the government comes up with. To date, it is the most abysmal performance by a minister for the environment that we have seen in recent decades. When you look at some of the performances of ministers for the environment over the last few decades, that is indeed saying something.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4593">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The misfortune for the environment is that Senator Hill has a fair degree of savvy about him. He has tried very hard to obfuscate his obligation to the environment by putting it across to, in large measure, his zeal for selling Telstra. We do not have to have much imagination or intelligence</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there we have it. Telstra should remain in public hands. Telstra is a great Australian public institution. If we have ever needed Telstra in the past, we are going to need it that much more in the future as telecommunications and the purveying of information becomes an even greater component of not only entertainment, education and information exchange but our ability to make opinions without fear or favour based on that information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to discuss the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. I would like to start with a quote from Bob Walker, Professor of Accounting at the University of New South Wales. He argues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privatisation can have a serious impact on Government finances. Hence it can be argued that governments should be more open about privatisation arrangements, to ensure that major financial transactions are subject to prior Parliamentary and public scrutiny. Claims about the need to maintain `commercial confidentiality' concerning proposed privatisations seem anomalous when contrasted with the more demanding disclosures required of listed companies facing takeover bids or contemplating the sale of major undertakings. Listed companies which propose to sell their major business undertaking must first seek ratification of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the proposal by shareholder in general meeting . . . Further, shareholders must be provided with reports from `experts' when certain transactions are contemplated:</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, when governments signal their intention to privatise particular agencies, equivalent information has not been made available to members of parliament, or to the community.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed partial privatisation of Telstra is no exception to Professor Walker's arguments. When the Democrats originally suggested that this bill should be the focus of a Senate inquiry, properly scrutinised by an inquiry, the government was up in arms proclaiming this to be an outrageous squandering of public resources. I am appalled to think that the government could consider that such scrutiny and such a reasoned investigation into the proposed sale of the government's most profitable business enterprise is a waste of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet throughout the entire debate over the sale of  Telstra, the government has failed to produce any convincing studies or analysis of the domestic situation which reveal any genuine gains to the community from the proposed partial sale. The government's case seems to rest fundamentally on an ideological belief that public is bad and private is good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial implications of the sale, however, are only a subset of the factors relevant to decisions concerning whether public assets should be privatised or should be retained. Today I would like to canvass a number of issues, some of which I think have been largely overlooked in this debate, such as the likely impact of the sale of Telstra on research and development in the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee's report revealed that the government has not given sufficient&mdash;if indeed any&mdash;consideration to the impact which privatisation of Telstra will have on the Telstra Research Laboratories, the TRL, and through this on the research capacity of Australia's telecommunications industry. TRL is not only Australia's leading telecommunications research facility; it is the largest such facility in the southern hemisphere. It is a national asset which has played a significant <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4594"> role in developing Australia's high technology infrastructure and in nurturing Australia's future telecommunications researchers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Mark Sceats, who is the head of the Australian Photonics CRC, has emphasised that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With Telstra as a government owned corporation, Telstra Research Laboratories has conducted and sponsored much of the R&amp;D required for the national interest. In effect, TRL was Australia's equivalent to the CSIRO for public R&amp;D in telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>By Australian standards, Telstra has invested large sums in R&amp;D. Last year Telstra was ranked the largest corporate investor in R&amp;D in Australia in absolute terms, investing a total of over $200 million. By global standards, however, and by the standards of its competitors, it is a long way down the scale. Telstra's expenditure on R&amp;D amounted to only 0.5 per cent of revenue, which is minuscule compared to the 4.7 per cent of revenue invested by the leading Japanese company and Telstra's competitor in global markets, Nippon Telephone and Telegraph.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privatisation, however, is not likely to generate an increased flow of funds to research, but, in fact, more likely a reduction. The majority report of the Senate Telstra inquiry reflected the legitimate fear of many researchers that a privatised Telstra would not retain the same commitment to research and development and to training and supporting telecommunications scientists and researchers as it has in the past. A purely profit driven Telstra would not retain the same commitment to long-term strategic research in the national interest. But it seems that in the lead&hyphen;up to privatisation senior management is intent on winding back the expenditure at TRL to make Telstra appear even more profitable and therefore more attractive, presumably, to future investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has announced it proposes to cut staff at TRL from the present 530 staff members to 380 by the end of this year. This is a cut of 150 employees, or around 30 per cent of staff, which already comes on top of a cut of 50 researchers and support staff who were given voluntary redundancies or early retirement over the past year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this, it is not surprising that researchers are saying that morale amongst staff has absolutely plummeted and that there is a climate of fear and uncertainty which, of course, undermines people's ability to undertake research. Management has claimed that these cuts are not being driven by privatisation and that in fact staff numbers and reductions are deemed necessary to improve focus and productivity in the lead&hyphen;up to open competition in the telecommunications industry next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is the case, then the government&mdash;perhaps more specifically the minister as the representative of the current owners of Telstra, the people of Australia&mdash;should be taking a closer interest and asking why. Why is Telstra slashing staff at its principal research facility as a means of increasing its competitiveness? Why is it pursuing this strategy when the leading global telecommunications companies see investing in R&amp;D as a means of increasing competitiveness?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that in the lead&hyphen;up to privatisation, TRL is mimicking the strategy pursued by British Telecom post&hyphen;privatisation and focusing on adapting supplied technology to local requirements. But this is a strategy that involves little more than the purchase and installation of equipment designed and built overseas. However, if Telstra no longer invests in new product or hardware development, there will be an overall net reduction in the level of research conducted in Australia, and the end result of that will be a loss of such jobs to this country. Even if this is of no concern to a purely profit driven Telstra, it is of concern to the Australian research community and it should be of concern to this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4595"> The detrimental impact which the sale of Telstra is likely to have on telecommunications research in this country is exacerbated by the government's decision to slash assistance for industrial research and development in the budget, and there are a range of measures in this budget that have attacked and slashed R&amp;D spending. Australia's private sector has been notoriously poor in investing in research and development and, by OECD standards, Australia's ratio of business ex penditure on R&amp;D to gross national product remains one of the lowest. The cuts announced by the government will ensure that it stays this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that encouraging strong investment in R&amp;D is essential for ensuring the development of internationally competitive industries&mdash;those industries that are able to cope and able to reduce our excessive dependency on commodity exports as well as counter the detrimental impact which increased manufactured exports are having on our balance of payments and domestic employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our view, increasing the competitiveness of Australian firms should be focused on increasing their capacity to innovate, to undertake research and to draw out the best in their human resources. It should not be about reducing wage and labour standards. Wage reductions will not increase employment levels, at least not the kind of jobs that we should be talking about or seeking to encourage in this country. It will not foster the development or the growth of high wage, high skilled industries. In fact, further reductions in real wages will entrench an already existing brain drain that is occurring in this country. It will induce our brightest and our best to flee to countries where job opportunities and better remuneration exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced his new jobs committee&mdash;a committee whose task it will be to investigate the impact of policy measures on employment and unemployment levels. I would be very curious to know what this new government committee thinks about the telecommunications policy&mdash;a policy which is responsible for Telstra confirming it will shed 22,000 staff at least while announcing a $2.3 billion profit, the biggest annual profit in Australia's corporate history. I would like to know what that committee thinks of the government's industry policy which is driving industry and jobs offshore, but I doubt the committee will get the chance to revisit any of these ideologically driven policies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The senators opposite who are participating in the debate on this Telstra bill are participating in probably one of the most cynical exercises yet seen before this Senate. Their opposition is not based on fact, nor is it based upon the evidence which was placed before the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee. Their opposition is a blatant case of political opportunism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was previously a supporter of the privatisation of Telstra. We know that the opposition, which now proudly defends the public ownership of Telstra, is the same opposition which, when in government, was quite happy to sell Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;having said that they were not going to sell the Commonwealth Bank, of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators opposite have not been able to justify, nor will they be able to justify, why it was all right to sell the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas and to try to sell ANL&mdash;they could not sell that, because it was broke&mdash;but it is not all right to partially sell Telstra. They have locked themselves into a position, a position which I would suggest is linked to their scare campaign during the last federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality&mdash;given their performance, I do not blame the previous Labor government for wanting to manufacture an issue on which to base an election campaign; they must have known that any election based on their record would have led to a landslide victory to us&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4596">what they did, and you would know this better than anyone, Mr Acting Deputy President, was create a scare campaign similar to the one on GST. Except this time it failed and failed miserably, and it failed again at the Lindsay by-election only last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former government members and senators marched around Australia at the last election saying, `Keep your hands off Telstra,' with campaign banners and ribbons. They tried to scare the Australian public, just like they did in their GST campaign. They might have got away with it once, but not twice. They underestimated the intelligence of the Australian voters, who, in turn, delivered a landslide victory to the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall all too well&mdash;the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), who is in the chamber, will recall it too&mdash;the disgraceful tactics of the Labor candidates who circulated, amongst other things, fake Telstra bills in rural areas. These bills bore no resemblance to fact&mdash;to any fact at all&mdash;but were designed only to scare and intimidate. I note that even now other Tasmanian senators, and Senator Mackay in her speech, are still trying to scare the people in rural Tasmania and regional areas about the so-called increased costs that would occur if Telstra is partially privatised. I also recall the predictions of massive increases in phone accounts, which we know, through the evidence placed before the committee, was another aspect of the opposition's imagination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about making Telstra more efficient. It is about improving the quality of telecommunications services, and it is about ensuring that our future telecommunications industry is based on the most sound economic grounds. There is no doubt that when this bill is passed it will make a positive contribution to employment within the telecommunications industry and provide other spin-offs which will occur as part of the employment rationalisation process. I note that Senator Stott Despoja has left. She was talking about the 20,000-odd people who will be leaving Telstra over the next few years, as announced by the chief executive.</PARA>

When you talk about losing all these jobs, you do not allow for the people who are leaving Telstra and going into private enterprise, into small communications companies, just like they are now. You only have to go around my own capital city to see that there are quite a few private providers installing mobile phones and doing all the work that Telstra had to do itself before. So there is no doubt that it will encourage more employment in the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, I believe that this bill will increase economic activity in rural and regional Australia. This is a very important aspect in my home state of Tasmania. I frequently receive complaints from constituents who do not have access to the most up-to-date telecommunications options. It is evident that Telstra has not been able to update its equipment as quickly as it would like to, because of the economic constraints of public ownership. Once these economic constraints are removed, I have no doubt that Telstra will be able to provide a much improved service to its Tasmanian customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the pleasure of taking the current Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston&mdash;then the shadow minister&mdash;on a tour of the west coast of Tasmania. That part of Tasmania has been ignored by Telecom for years and years and years, as my colleague in the chamber would know. What did the previous government do about it? Absolutely nothing. I took the then shadow minister along the west coast, and he was absolutely appalled at what was going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we have been in government, the west coast has been connected to a digitalised mobile service. Changes have been made to television reception because a lot of places could not receive any television at all. As the minister here would know, there is a fair bit of action going on in Tasmania as far as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4597"> communications go, but there would be a lot more if Telstra was partially privatised and it became more efficient.</PARA>

Anyway, on a national level this bill is going to provide an increase in our public sector savings by giving an opportunity to the government to clear $7 billion of public debt and at the same time remove an annual interest bill of around $660 million. In the last few days we have seen what a difference it makes when you start reducing your debt and come out with a debt reduction budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

They know what is going on, and they proved that at the Lindsay by&hyphen;election. They are not going to be hoodwinked by the stuff you guys have been saying around the place during the conduct of this Telstra debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that by retaining two&hyphen;thirds of Telstra in public ownership the government will also be retaining its access to two&hyphen;thirds of the Telstra dividends. That was the subject of another lie that has been promoted by the opposition. We know that by retaining two&hyphen;thirds of the Telstra dividend the government has structured the Telstra privatisation to provide the best of both worlds for both the Australian public and Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you listen to the opposition senators, you would be tempted to think that they had some experience in telecommunications management, but the fact is they do not. The person who has the experience in telecommunications management, in this country anyway, is the Telstra Chief Executive Officer, Mr Frank Blount. I do not hear you saying too much about his qualifications, but he is the Telstra chief executive. He has the experience. He is the one responsible for the very good profit result they had this year. It is his skills that have brought that about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, we have this ironic situation where the experts on the other side of this chamber are claiming that the public ownership of one-third of Telstra will provide no benefits and at the same time the Chief Executive Officer of the organisation is welcoming the opportunity to participate in the positive changes which this bill will provide. In other words, you are saying that if we sell Telstra we will not be so well off. The guy who has turned Telstra into a money making machine is saying that selling a third of it will make it a lot better. He is welcoming what we are trying to do. You experts over there know better. You would rather sit there and poke fun at people on this side of the chamber who over their lives have worked hard and made a few dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4598"> We also know that, as part of the scare campaign during the election, a call was often made by the then government that we should keep Telstra in Australian ownership. Al though this campaign was totally dishonest, it did cause a lot of concern, particularly amongst the elderly. I received many calls during the election campaign from people who had been misled on this matter. I just want to reaffirm to those people who did contact my office over a long period of time that this bill does not take away the Australian ownership of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat&mdash;and it has been repeated in this place by people on our side time and time again, but just in case somebody has missed it&mdash;that under the bill the Australian government and, just as importantly, the mum and dad investors who choose to put their savings in Telstra by becoming shareholders will control 88.3 per cent of Telstra, foreign ownership will be kept to a minimum of 11.7 per cent and individual foreign holdings can be no more than 1.7 per cent. This government is about ensuring not only that the ownership of Telstra remains in Australian hands but also that Telstra's chairmen and the majority of its directors are Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many of my fellow government senators, I viewed the investigation into this bill by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee with grave concern. It is evident from the examination of the evidence that the opposition and Democrat senators participated in that hearing with closed minds. For instance, we know that before the committee even sat the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) said they were going to oppose it. The opposition was of the same view. What was the point of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on tripping around the country supposedly taking evidence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From what I could see in this particular report, they were not prepared to consider the overwhelming majority of evidence that was placed before the committee. It is evident that the process commenced from the start when the opposition and Democrat senators combined to refer the bill to this particular committee because they knew they had the numbers to control it. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, know that in the same position we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would not have done anything like that. When we were in opposition and had the numbers on the references committee, we were not responsible for doing anything like this to promote opposition to matters that were of such importance to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many who have read the submissions, I came to the conclusion that many of the submissions and views that were put to the committee&mdash;and I did view some of the work when it was going on in Hobart&mdash;were in no way related to the issue of public ownership of one-third of Telstra.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That evidence showed that in Europe the overwhelming majority of national carriers are either privatised or about to be privatised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the facts that the opposition will not mention and cannot mention because they know that they highlight the lack of substance in their arguments. A move to partially privatise Telstra will also have a significant effect on the performance of our national telecommunications carrier. Again, evidence before the committee showed that Telstra has around 135 access lines per employee whereas the two privatised carriers, such as British Telecom and Telecommunications Corporation of New Zealand, are both much more efficient at around 200 lines per employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On its own admission, Telstra has indicated that it is 25 per cent below world's best practice and if it does not manage to keep up with its competitors that would rise to as much as 40 per cent. A gain of 30 per cent in efficiency would deliver savings of around $1.6 billion to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the partial privatisation of Telstra will bring real benefits to customers, particularly in the rural areas, while reducing the government's exposure to increasingly risky industry. It will ensure that Telstra becomes more efficient which will, as a result, improve the quality and reduce the cost of telecommunications services around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one final point that I want to make again and I believe it is a critical element in this debate. During the last election, there was no more widely debated issue than the aspect of the partial privatisation of Telstra. There could hardly have been a voter in Australia who did not go to the polling booth in March, this year, who did not watch the television commercial, for a start, who would not be aware of the differences in the position of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then Labor government and the coalition on this issue. The electors of Australia made their choice; they provided a huge mandate for this government to carry out its election promises. There is no mandate and no justification for these Opposition senators and the Democrats and the Greens to participate in a process of frustrating the government reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The people of Australia have made their choice. They realise the benefits which will flow from the partial privatisation of Telstra. Those within Telstra recognise the benefits and the only ones who do not seem to are the political opportunists opposite. As the Prime Minister said, for goodness sake get out of the way and let us get on with what we are trying to do for Australia. This bill will shape the future of our telecommunications industry in the next decade and provide Australian consumers with the sorts of benefits which those overseas have enjoyed for many years.</PARA></SPEECH>

The community service obligations will be maintained. There will be cross subsidies for regional Australia and they will remain. There will be a reduction in telephone bills. Australia's local tariffs are the highest in the world, and that is a demonstration of the fact that the company is not as competitive as it ought to be. One billion dollars of the proceeds will pay for the envi ronment and we do not have the resources available otherwise because of the debt left by the last government. And we have to constantly remind Australians that we pay $10 billion in interest on our mortgage every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Just think if we had not chalked up that debt paying for things we could not afford; what we could have been doing in the environment; what we could have been doing with carers; what we could have been doing in aged care; what we could have been doing in a whole raft of other areas including homeless youth. But, no, that government chose to spend, spend, spend and, in fact, spend the next generation's money because that is who will be paying it back if we do not turn this around. And that is what we have every intention of doing. This is one of the ways we believe we could fund what is desperately needed to rehabilitate the environment&mdash;the biggest funding program for the environment in the history of this country, costing $1 billion. The people on the other side, because suddenly they have become pure when they have gone to the other side, now do not believe in privatisation but they privatised almost everything that moved while they were in government. Now they have become purists and would let the environment suffer. Also it is a fact that a large proportion of the funding from the partial sale of Telstra will go into retiring debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are two very important reasons. The first is the environment and the second is retiring and getting rid of some of the debt to reduce that mortgage bill. It has a double purpose. That is unlike what the Labor Party did. When they privatised something, the money went into general revenue and was spent. We saw no benefits from the fact that they chose to sell CSL and they chose to sell the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Farmers Federation has come out in support of the partial sale of Telstra. About 66 per cent of their members thought the partial sale was a good idea, and nearly 71 per cent of farmers believed that services could be improved through the partial sale of Telstra. Telstra chiefs themselves warn `Privatise or lose $750 million'. That was in a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 4 July this year. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4601"> Also, senior executives of Telstra said that foreign companies would take $750 million from Telstra's revenue unless it is partially privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 4 June this year, an AGB McNair poll showed a 10 per cent increase in support for the partial sale of Telstra. When it was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, I think voter support was around 51 per cent. We are unlike Labor, which went to the election in 1993 saying that they would not privatise the rest of the Commonwealth Bank. In fact, the then Treasurer had written in the foreword of the prospectus that that would not happen. What did Labor do? They turned around and went back on their word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to the Australian public telling them that we would privatise one-third of Telstra. We were honest and up-front before the election, and we told them. The public made a decision on 2 March that we had a set of policies they wanted to support. I have to say that the Lindsay by-election confirmed that and confirmed, with even a stronger message, that the track we were on was a track they wanted to take. They wanted to see Australia pay its way. They did not want to see us leave a debt for the next generation that they could not jump over. They thought there was some fairness in making sure that we paid back some of the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja comes in here and goes on about young people, about representing youth and about students in universities. I have to say to her that one of the issues that is going to be a major issue throughout the world will be intergenerational issues and responsibilities. I, as a member of my generation, feel I have a responsibility to the next generation not to leave them with a huge amount of debt. That means all of us have to take some share in the pain, and all of us have to look for ways in which to solve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the ways that we believe we can do it is through the partial sale of Telstra. The world is not going to come to an end. The way the Labor Party is carrying on, you would think that we would not have a telephone left in Australia if there were a partial sale of Telstra. That is not the case. If you look at history of Labor, they promised, as I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said, that there would be no sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Then they sold it. What about the Federal Airports Corporation? What were they going to do before the election of 1993? They sold it. Then there is Qantas, and the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do not know how they can sit in this chamber now and turn into puritans. It is duplicitous; it is two&hyphen;faced; it is hypocritical. You could just go on with as many words to describe them as the thesaurus would give you. I do not know how they can sit there and rail against the partial sale of Telstra when, in fact, they privatised anything that moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you read former Senator Richardson's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever it takes</EMPHASIS>, you will find that Mr Keating himself had no objections to selling Telstra. When I was reading it, I thought hooley&hyphen;dooley. Here they are. Here was the leader of the Labor Party himself saying that they would sell it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I wanted to mention was that, when they sold the Commonwealth Bank and the Federal Airports Corporation and Qantas, they allowed significant foreign ownership of those enterprises. Suddenly, they have become the purists. They are going to rail against the fact that we are going to sell one&hyphen;third of it, and they are going to rail against the fact that it will be in foreign ownership. They will introduce all the furphies they can think of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In typical Labor style, they tried to sell Telstra by stealth. They tried to sell off the Yellow Pages and MobileNet before the 1995 budget. I think it was on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program some time in 1994 that, when Kerry O'Brien asked Mr Keating whether it mattered if Telstra was publicly or privately owned, Mr Keating said, `Not of its essence, no.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's born&hyphen;again disciples to government ownership did something that I found totally distasteful and totally inappropriate: they broke the conventions of this house in regard to this bill. We started a concept of having legislation committees and references committees back in, I think, 1994. The convention of the house was that legislation went to legislation committees and references went to the references committees.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4602">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, oh no, what did they do over on the other side? They play by different rules, not by gentlemen's rules. They play by totally different rules. We are the mugs, because we did not do it when we were on the other side. We did not send it off to a references committee because we controlled the numbers. No, we did not do it, because we have a view about honour and about convention, but people on the other side do not have a view about honour and convention. Their view is, `Play the game as hard and as dirty as they can. Just laugh at them because they play by the rules.' I find that despicable; I find it distasteful; and I think it is downright disgusting.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose Senator Kernot has been a bit preoccupied with industrial relations lately. When she was talking about the bill dealing with the privatisation of Telstra, again you would have thought the world was going to come to an end. On 22 May she issued a press release saying do not sell public ownership short. Senator Alston responded to that press release&mdash;and I think it needed to be responded to. His press release states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BT comprehensively refuted claims by the Democrats that consumer charges have increased in the UK since the privatisation of the company and that there was mass sacking of staff.</PARA>
<PARA>I just want to stop here for a moment and tell you about a friend of mine whose husband got a job in the United Kingdom. She is English. She had lived out here for some time and she went back to England after British Telecom was privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She said to me, quite unsolicited, when she came back to live in Australia&mdash;they were only there for a year; they were going for good and did not stay there for personal reasons&mdash;that she could not believe the difference in British Telecom since she was there a couple of years earlier. She said she could get through, people would answer the telephone and you did not hang on for ages. As a user she said to me in an unsolicited way how tremendous it was and what a difference there was in trying to shift a family and all sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BT have said that there have been enormous improvements from the point of view of consumers in Britain. I know that one swallow does not make a spring.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BT comprehensively refuted claims by the Democrats that consumer charges have increased in the UK since the privatisation of the company and that there was mass sacking of staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"BT told Senator Kernot that from the date of privatisation in 1984 until November 1995, the price of inland calls in the UK had been reduced by 53 per cent in real terms while international calls had fallen 46 per cent . . . </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition senators have mischievously tried to link the partial sale of Telstra with the retention of the universal service obligation. They are wrong. I say it again: wrong.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The universal service obligation is specified under the Telecommunications Act. Telstra is designated under that act as the universal service carrier for all of Australia. The government is committed to retaining the legislatively required universal service obligation&mdash;that is, the obligation to make the standard telephone service and payphones reasonably accessible to all Australians on an equitable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sorts of scare tactics that the Labor Party are using are wrong. The fact that they have become purists is hypocritical. The fact that they try to portray themselves as environmentally friendly is also hypocritical in that the partial sale of Telstra would have enormous benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity to speak in support of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. In so doing I wish to restate a couple of paragraphs from the second reading speech of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). The minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In marked contrast to the approach taken by the former Government in the cases of the Commonwealth Bank, Federal Airports Corporation and QANTAS we have sufficient regard for the electorate to be up&hyphen;front about our intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We made crystal clear in our election policy that if elected we would introduce into Parliament at the earliest opportunity legislation to sell one&hyphen;third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra by way of a share float. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4604"> </PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to quote that comment basically because of the information and the debate that has been put through the Senate by the Labor Party, the Greens and the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The partial privatisation of Telstra is what we are debating. Today I sat in this chamber and listened to the contribution of Senator Brown, from Tasmania, who talked incessantly about the entire sale&mdash;the whole privatisation&mdash;of Telstra. He knows&mdash;as do those opposition senators who have made the same claim&mdash;that that is totally and utterly wrong. There is no substance to the claim; in fact, it is quite the reverse. We gave a commitment that we would go to the people and to the parliament if we ever sought to sell more than one&hyphen;third of Telstra. That is more than the Labor Party ever did when in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a member of the committee that went on an expedition right around Australia: a committee that was inspired by the opposition parties, at huge expense to the taxpayer, when the opposition parties had already made up their minds on the outcome of the inquiry. I found it objectionable then and I find it objectionable today to hear them still talking about the bill that is before us today being a total privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If time allows I will come back to some of that information, but there are two issues that I wish to cover today: one is the duplication of cables and the other is the question of cabling. Partial privatisation within the regulatory framework that this government is currently putting in place will ensure real benefits for consumers. The bulk of international evidence suggests that privatisation, when linked with competitive reforms and consumer safeguards, provides significant consumer benefits such as lower prices and an increase of services as carrier efficiency and responsiveness improves. Something that came out consistently throughout the committee's inquiries was that Telstra is so far off the pace that only this type of initiative would see it become truly competitive in the world market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There a number of recommendations which appear in the majority report. I emphasise that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the majority report is the report put together by the opposition senators on the Senate committee on the partial sale of Telstra. The recommendations are not directly related to the merits of whether this bill should proceed or not. Part of the plan was to divert the committee down a track that was not really part of the bill. For example, the majority report recommends that the government undertake a number of actions in relation to what the report calls `duplication of infrastructure': that the government urgently review the strategy of allowing dual hybrid optical fibre&hyphen;coaxial cable roll&hyphen;out&mdash;particularly having regard to evidence that such networks will be obsolete within a decade&mdash;and immediately take action to ensure that carriers enter negotiations with a view to arriving at an arrangement whereby the carriers in future combine their competing broadband cable systems into one national network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it should be acknowledged that the rules that govern the roll&hyphen;out of telecommunications facilities were established by the Labor government. They are currently being examined by this government. When the opposition parties started this inquiry, the coalition government had only been in office for four short months. The way they performed like trained seals about the whole issue of dual cabling and underground and overhead cabling would lead anyone to believe that it was all on our initiative. We are following on from the Labor government's 13 years of mismanagement and miraculously they blame us four months down the track for their inadequacies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Newman interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right, Senator Newman. In the course of this examination the government will undoubtedly seek advice on the capabilities of the technologies the carriers are employing for their respective roll&hyphen;outs. However, it should be noted that this government favours a technology&hyphen;neutral approach towards telecommunications regulation in order to accommodate the rapid rate of technological change endemic to this industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4605">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the government is aware of concerns that there may be significant duplication of Australia's broadband cable infrastructure and suggestions that the government should act to minimise this duplication&mdash;and thus the investment&mdash;in infrastructure. However, facilities based competition, under which each carrier builds its own facilities to carry at least some part of its services, has been central to the development of open telecommunications markets in most countries. In Australia in the case of telephony, competition has delivered lower prices for consumers, greater investment in equipment and a wider range of choices of services for consumers. It has also provided much needed pressure for improvements in efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Network deployment decisions&mdash;what to build, when to build and where to build&mdash;are matters for the commercial judgment of the carriers and their associates. Additional infrastructure investment will not occur unless there is an expectation of user demand for the additional capacity and a commercial judgment about the need for a carrier to control its own facilities rather than simply interconnecting with those of another carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should not be assumed that competing telecommunications facilities necessarily duplicate each other. The rapid changes in technology and customer demand that characterise the telecommunications industry provide significant incentives for carriers and service providers to continually explore new and differentiated product applications and therefore different, but in some cases superficially similar, forms of infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that duplication is wasteful is usually made on a fairly simplistic level. If you have two sets of cables each costing $4 billion and you only need one, then you are wasting $4 billion. This argument does not hold up well when subjected to more detailed analysis. As a BZW report explains:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an indication of the benefits and costs, the cost of duplication is a part of the $3 billion that Optus Vision is spending to roll out its network . . . However, this is a long life cycle investment lasting 10 to 20 years. So the annual cost of `duplication' is measured in $100s of millions. It is much lower than the annual revenue measured in bills for which the cable companies and service providers will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compete. The competition benefits&mdash;lower operating costs, lower prices, more services, greater carrier responsiveness, more choice and a leading role in emerging services&mdash;means the benefits far outweigh the costs.</PARA>
<PARA>If a new investor decides it is not commercially feasible to build a new and separate infrastructure, then the current regulatory framework and that envisaged for post&hyphen;30 June 1997 facilities&mdash;interconnection generally on a commercial basis but subject to appropriate competitive safeguards; and the sharing of sites, that is, co&hyphen;location, where it is technically and economically feasible&mdash;would allow that investor to go into business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The OECD has recently concluded that governments should not aim to establish a single&mdash;that is monopoly&mdash;infrastructure provider but rather seek to promote the development of applications and an efficient market which requires not only competing fixed&hyphen;link structures but competing technologies and networks. Without competition, the development and diffusion of new technologies and applications will be restrained. There is also the risk that the monopoly provider could charge monopoly prices and restrict access to infrastructure. Thus, the government is unlikely to favour the establishment of a single infrastructure providing authority or carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of cabling was raised before the committee. The opposition parties made sure that they wheeled in witness after witness to quite genuinely express concern about the issue of cabling. It was portrayed by the opposition parties that cabling was contained within this bill and that this bill was somehow going to facilitate the policies that had been put in place by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of recommendations, once again, which appear in the majority report of the Senate committee inquiry on the partial sale of Telstra which are not directly related to the issue of whether or not Telstra should be partially sold. To give a further example, the majority report recommends a range of measures to force cabling underground. It recommended legislating for all cabling to be placed underground, the development of a long&hyphen;term program for all existing cabling underground, mandatory removal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4606"> of obsolete aerial cabling, and at least mandating co&hyphen;location of cabling where technically feasible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This last recommendation seems to be a recognition of the difficulty of implementing the other three recommendations and that co&hyphen;location of telecommunications cabling is not always feasible. Certainly, the preliminary audit of existing duct capacity that Austel conducted at the government's request earlier this year indicate that this was the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Austel report indicated that the availability of Telstra duct space for anyone else's cable averages less than 30 per cent and is fragmented in such a way that useable contiguous duct spacing represents only a very small fraction of the total network route length. The audit also indicated that the difference in costs between overhead and underground cabling for a new network are very significant and any business case must strongly favour aerial deployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be recognised that the issue of aerial cabling is a difficult one. Nobody denies that. No&hyphen;one on the committee, on either side, denied that. But we need to be up front about what this bill contains. On one hand the government is well aware of the concern within the community about the visual impact of aerial cabling. On the other hand, the government is also aware of the desire within the community to have access to enhanced services and cheaper phone calls, those services which are delivered by new cabling infrastructure and are likely to be delivered faster and cheaper by aerial cabling. That was an interesting factor which was brought before the committee. The people decided that they did not want that cabling but, in the main, they wanted the facilities that the cabling provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also must be recognised that it is not just telecommunications cabling which is deployed aerially. Much of Australia's power cabling has also been deployed aerially. While these issues are not simple, the government is endeavouring to address them. The government undertook a review of the rules governing the manner in which telecommunications networks were rolled out. From the outset, it was evident that any new scheme would need <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to strike a balance between the need for early availability of advanced communications services and the right of local communities and their representatives to be consulted on the installation of facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government issued a draft revised telecommunication national code and a draft new land access code in July 1996 and directed Austel to conduct a public inquiry into both codes and report back. The minister is currently examining Austel's report and carefully considering the feedback which the government and Austel received from a number of interested parties on the form of the new telecommunications national code. Of particular benefit has been considerable discussion with the Australian Local Government Association, which has given the minister the views of local councils concerning a number of aspects of the draft telecommunications national code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A decision on the implementation of the new code will be made once the minister is satisfied that proper account has been taken of the comments received. The government does not believe it is appropriate to completely change the rules applying to the carriers and require them to drastically reconfigure their networks. However, the government does recognise community concerns about aerial cabling. It has included measures in the draft telecommunications national code which would require carriers to put cabling underground where there is no existing aerial cabling of any kind unless local councils agree otherwise. Remember, there is a local input there then. It is not just the council; it is the people and the community of that particular area. It would also require carriers to put aerial cabling underground when all other cabling is placed underground, again, unless local councils agree otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has also written to state and territory ministers on the issue of whether there are any state initiatives relating to undergrounding of power cabling and possible scope for participation in these initiatives by telecommunications carriers. In addition, I understand that the minister has recently agreed to further discussions with the peak body for local government in Australia, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4607"> ALGA, about the proposed post&hyphen;1997 powers and immunities regime for the telecommunications carriers and the development of a long-term strategy for the undergrounding of all overhead cabling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, I quote from the minority report&mdash;the government senators report&mdash;of the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not see any basis for recommending any action beyond that which is already under consideration by the Government. We also stress, yet again, that these issues are in no way related to the part privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that the record be set straight as to the issues that were raised in the committee that the opposition parties purported to be part of this legislation and to put into the minds of so many people who were dragged before our committee as witnesses, basically under false pretences, that we are doing something about the very issues that concern them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting, once again, to listen to the input from senators in relation to the concerns expressed by rural and regional areas. Once again, I just happened to be absorbed today by the misinformation that Senator Brown put to the Senate. He was talking about the way in which rural and regional Australia will be badly affected by this legislation. Sadly, Senator Brown was not at the committee meetings to hear witnesses, not only the National Farmers Federation, to whom Senator Patterson referred, but also, for example, Mrs Ann Lewis, the Western Australian State President of Australian Women in Agriculture. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We rural Australian business people need a telecommunications provider who is considerate of the customer's needs and is prepared to discuss with us the technology available. We see private enterprise as being more receptive to our needs. Therefore, the partial privatisation of Telstra could be of great benefit to us.</PARA>
<PARA>They have selectively and religiously quoted and misquoted people who came before the committee, including people like Mrs Lewis and the National Farmers Federation, saying that people in rural and regional Australia will be worse off. In fact, the reverse is true. We had representatives of two rural South Australian councils&mdash;Mr Brazel, of Roxby Downs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Council, and Mr Hemming, of Cooper Pedy Council.

I think the message was there hot and strong that this government was given a mandate and it went out there before the election and told Australia exactly what it was going to do, which was quite contrary to what happened with the Commonwealth Bank, but I will come to that later. Anyway, the time has come for me to do my part. As I said, it is a pleasure to speak to this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get a few things straight. To my knowledge, those people responsible are not in the chamber now, but time and time again as I sat here the Friday before last doing the whip's duty most of the day, I heard senators from the opposition benches, the Democrats and the Greens&mdash;one of the Greens spoke today&mdash;talking about the sale of Telstra. They <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4608"> repeated it that often that I started to believe it too. But we are back to a new week now. By now they should realise that we are only selling one-third of Telstra. That is what the bill is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Calvert pointed out early in his delivery, the two-thirds that remains with the government and the shares that are going to be sold amount to a figure of about 88 per cent&mdash;I may be wrong, so please correct me if I am&mdash;but very little will be owned by interests outside this country. Please everyone, get it through your heads that we are selling only one-third of Telstra. I heard Senator Conroy say it for a start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us compare this with that broken promise of the previous Labor government on the Commonwealth Bank. They claim that it was not a broken promise because they did not mention it leading up to the previous election. I suppose they could go down that line and say, `No, we never promised not to sell it; we just did not say anything about it.' I come back to the point that, leading up to the election, we were out there saying that we were going to sell a third. We said that $1 billion would go into a foundation for the environment and the rest would be used for retiring debt and not recurring expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us compare the sale of Telstra with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. As I said, the Labor government of the time, contrary to former promises&mdash;even though they did not mention it leading up to the election&mdash;sold off 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. They sold 249 million shares at $5.40 each, which brought in $1.344 billion. At that time, this gave the Commonwealth Bank a total value of $4.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September 1991, just six weeks later, the share value of each of those shares that were sold off reached $6.46. As I remember, six weeks later, that 30 per cent grew to $1.608 billion. So the $1.344 billion grew to $1.608 billion&mdash;that was the privatised part&mdash;in a maximum of two months or something like that. That already gave a total value of $5.361 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in September 1993, when the government of the day decided to sell another 20 per cent, at that time those shares were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> valued at $7.79 per share. That original 30 per cent was now worth $1.939 billion, which also gave the Commonwealth Bank a total value of $6.463 billion. The point I am getting at is that whatever the government got at the time in that first share issue was far outstripped by the increase in the total value of the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the 80 per cent that was left at the time in the hands of the Commonwealth government grew back in no time, in a matter of about two years, and it went beyond the total value in 1991. In other words, it went past the 100 per cent value. Of course, there was a certain amount of inflation in that. But, unless the government at the time want to say that they let inflation run rampant, the inflation did not make up for that. So you can see that by part&hyphen;privatising a government entity, it does not take very long to make up for what has been sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In two years, the Commonwealth Bank grew to $2 billion, which was far in excess of that original sale of $1.344 billion. You ask: why does that happen? It happens because, when you go into part&hyphen;privatisation, you also get private enterprise management. You get private enterprise thinking in management.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot, you do get that; it does happen. That is why I can see the same thing happening with the balance of Telstra which is 66.66 per cent recurring. In no time down the track, this will be worth as much to the government as it is today, having already picked up in the meantime whatever the value is in cutting down the debt and certainly not using it on recurring expenditure. This includes that $1 billion that is going into the foundation, the income from which&mdash;this is something that those on the other side did not fully address&mdash;will go to the environment along with other allocations from the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4609"> Why will it make Telstra a little meaner and leaner with private enterprise management? Even though Telstra operations around the country have improved a lot over the years, there is still a lot to be done as far as work practice and attitude to work are con cerned. I can remember a person who worked for Telstra somewhere in Australia, not necessarily Western Australia, who had a private enterprise mentality about him. His job as a technician was to do certain installations. He was given a list of jobs to do for that week on a Monday morning; he came back at lunchtime and said that he had done such and such. They said, `You have done what? You have done three times the allocation that you were supposed to have done this morning.' He had to appear in front of a superior who told him to slow down a bit. I just throw that in to show you that those things are still going on. That is the comparison I have made with the Commonwealth Bank. I cannot see why the same cannot be repeated in Telstra with the two-thirds that remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Conroy from the opposition said that Telstra was a high performer. I agree that it is a high performer, except for a few of the things I have just mentioned. I believe that it will be a higher performer still with a private enterprise mentality and management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Conroy went on to say that Telstra made $2.3 billion in profits. I believe that those profits will certainly increase. The way he said it, I thought the $2.3 billion was going to disappear. Two-thirds of that, if the profit is the same&mdash;I think it will be higher&mdash;will still be there. Does he not know and do others in the chamber not know that the dividends going out from that privatised section will be taxed? Has he forgotten that? Have others forgotten that? Another thing is that it will probably be taxed at a higher rate. Most of those shares will be, I hope, held by ordinary Australians like you and me.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we already own it, but in a different way. This way, it will be much more efficient. It will probably be taxed at a higher rate than it is at the moment&mdash;higher than the company rate. So there will be more taxes flowing into the coffers so that Australia can proceed at a faster rate. I ask Senator Conroy to think about that. That $2.3 billion is definitely not going to disappear. Two-thirds will be there and the other third <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will probably be taxed at a higher rate. Perhaps he did not think of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Conroy also mentioned&mdash;I happened to be in the chamber at the time&mdash;that Telstra paid rates and taxes and all those sorts of things that a corporation pays. Is that not going to be the same under a part privatised Telstra? They will be paying exactly the same if the figures are the same. Those rates, taxes and whatever else they pay will still be being paid. Let us not say that those things are going to disappear altogether and that those government entities will not be getting what they are getting out of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my office a bit earlier on I heard Senator Stott Despoja from South Australia talking about the efficient suppliers of materials from Australia to Telstra, as if we were going to lose the opportunity to supply that high quality  electronic equipment to Telstra. Where is Telstra all of a sudden going to get those supplies? Are they going to go overseas just as a matter of course? No, they will not be going overseas as a matter of course. They will be buying where they have the quality of equipment they are buying now and where it is competitive. Australian manufacturers of electronic gear are doing pretty good now, so I cannot see for one moment how Australian suppliers are going to lose the opportunity of supplying that equipment to Telstra, as they are now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An operator the size of Telstra has to have reliability of supply, the ability to have those supplies brought in quickly in case of breakdown. These days, with international flights you can get parts from Singapore, New Zealand and other places fairly quickly, but there is nothing like having them here on our doorstep. I can assure you that there will be no change at all. They will still be buying Australian, and good Australian gear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the matter of community service obligations. From what I have been hearing from the opposition and other benches, you would think that by the sale of a small portion of Telstra community service obligations are going to go out the door. On my reading of the bill, I think it is pretty well covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there are not many people in this place or in the other place who come from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4610"> more remote areas of Australia than I do. From what I have read of the bill and from what I see of Telstra, I cannot see that we will be any worse off. You never know, we might be better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I live in a place&mdash;there are not too many of these places&mdash;where we have no facilities for mobile phones yet. You can use mobile satellite phones, but of course it costs you about $8,000 to buy a set and it costs you about $1 a word to speak on it. That is not a real alternative. I believe that with part privatisation and the shake-up in management, we might do better. I am from a remote area and I cannot see anything wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard a few other red herrings from the other side of the chamber. Senator Mackay from Tasmania was telling us how Tasmania has been neglected. I have not spent too much time in Tasmania, but any time I have wanted to communicate with someone in Tasmania I have always been able to do it just by picking up the phone and dialling. I was on an inquiry into communications towards the year 2000. That is the only time I went to King Island&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to quickly address the subject of overhead cables. As Senator Knowles has already said, this has nothing to do with the partial sale of Telstra&mdash;nothing whatsoever. When I am driving along the road or walking down the footpath, I don't necessarily look upwards; I look forwards to see where I am going. If you put a new cable up, Senator O'Brien, you will notice it for a while. But when you already have power cables there, especially three phase power with four heavy cables, and if an extra one is added overnight, I defy anyone to notice the extra one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you that the further overhead cables extend into the bush the better because it means that civilisation is coming closer to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For many months now we have heard the government's rationale for the privatisation of Telstra. It has been like privatisation debates, very short ones, that we have had previously in this place. The rationale is driven largely by two concerns. One is to provide an immediate source of short-term revenue for the government. Secondly, the sale is being driven by the ideological belief that private enterprise is inherently more efficient&mdash;I see you nodding, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, a captive of the ideology&mdash;and accountable than public sector counterparts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to look very closely at those two assertions because I just don't believe they stack up. I don't believe they provide sufficient justification for turning Australia's most profitable publicly owned asset into Australia's second biggest private corporation. This government, like the government before, has not had the imagination or the political will to devise better ways of improving our national savings. For ideological reasons, they just won't formally acknowledge the significant contribution that public investment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4611"> actually makes to this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much of this rationale is based on economic theory. I make this point because I am sick and tired of certain economists and the economic cheer squad of this country behaving as if they have some God given monopoly on the truth when it comes to current economic theory. I am sick and tired of them telling the rest of us to treat what are often not much more than political or economic fads as though they contain some compelling central truth which cannot be denied. I am really glad that finally, after almost a decade, we are having an extended public debate on privatisation, although we are still being told by the government that privatisation of our key public assets is so good for the community that it cannot be questioned or delayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that being told that we should privatise Telstra because nearly every other country has done so is not an argument. `Behave like lemmings,' they say. This is nothing more than an appeal to fashion&mdash;an appeal which seeks to deny Australians the right to make up their own minds, irrespective of what any other country is doing, about whether partial or full privatisation of our national carrier is in our best interests, is in Australia's best interests. There is no intrinsic merit in blindly following what other countries have done. Every country has its own unique geographical, historical and cultural circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza talked a lot about new investors paying tax and how the profit and loss columns will stack up. I would like to talk about the financial implications of the sale in some detail. Eminent Australian economists&mdash;such as John Quiggin, Professor of Economics at James Cook University, and Dr Allan Brown from Griffith University in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Queensland, both of whom have undertaken painstaking research into this field&mdash;have warned that the proposed privatisation of Telstra will result in a substantial loss to the net worth of the public sector. We all know the coalition does not place a high value on the net worth of the public sector, but other people do and taxpayers might be interested to know. These two economists argue that the interest savings in public debt from selling Telstra will be significantly less than the profit stream forgone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his submission to the Senate Telstra inquiry, Professor Quiggin estimated the value of Telstra in public ownership to be $54.4 billion. This estimate is based on comparing Telstra's after&hyphen;tax profits with the net sale proceeds that would be required to generate similar savings in public debt interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is $30 billion more than the market price that analysts believe Telstra will realise if sold. One of the reasons argued for this is that private equity holders demand a far greater rate of return on their investments than the real rate of return on government debt. According to Professor Quiggin, it is only under the most unrealistically pessimistic profit scenarios that the government's partial privatisation scenario appears attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, Professor Quiggin pointed out to the Senate Telstra inquiry that, in attempting to estimate the value of Telstra&mdash;the one that they are telling the Australian public when they are weighing up what we win and what we lose&mdash;the Department of Finance made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the elementary error of comparing the public debt interest savings arising from privatisation with the dividends paid by Telstra rather than the earnings of Telstra including retained earnings. This procedure is defended on the basis of fallacies that were refuted decades ago, such as the view that retained earnings are `locked up' and therefore of no value. This claim is erroneous since reinvested earnings will generate a higher stream of income in the future, and are just as valuable as dividends . . . Once the error of comparing interest flows with dividends rather than profits is corrected, the Department's own analysis would show a loss arising from the partial sale of Telstra. More precisely, if whole of government accrual accounting along the lines proposed by the Commission of Audit&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are other facts we can put on the record, such as the underpricing of public assets, which is one of the hallmarks of privatisation in this country. It happened with the Commonwealth Bank; it happened with Qantas; it happened with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. And what that means is that a relatively small number of people&mdash;the new shareholders and those involved in the actual transaction&mdash;make a gain at the expense of the rest of the taxpayers in Australia. What guarantee do we have that that will not happen with Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what if we assume the financial situation of the government is not adversely affected by the sale. What then? The fact is that we would not be any better off. The government would simply have realised the value in cash terms of an asset valued at that amount and the underlying budget balance would remain unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where is value to the nation in that? Where is the good economic policy in that? Under this scenario, it can equally be argued that it is better to retain Telstra in full public ownership and use the cash flows generated into consolidated revenue to repay public debt and fund existing programs or new ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, when assessing the impact of privatisation on the net worth of the public sector, we also have to take into account the costs of actually floating Telstra&mdash;namely, the fees for the lawyers, accountants, stockbrokers, analysts and advertising agents. The Department of Finance told the Senate inquiry that it estimates these costs will be in the order of $160 million. That is a lot of money. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That is $160 million coming out of the pockets of taxpayers for the wonderful privilege of losing ownership of their valuable public asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it all adds up to is that the sale of Telstra involves selling off our highest income earning public asset for what is most likely to be no net economic gain. In fact, it is true that Australian taxpayers could be paying for the sale like hire purchase&mdash;they could be paying for the sale for many years to come&mdash;and I do not see any good public policy in that either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has relied very heavily on the claim that selling a third of Telstra will make it more efficient because private businesses are inherently more efficient than their publicly owned counterparts. This is undeniably true in some industries in some areas, but it is not a truth in itself. I do not see any reason to anticipate efficiency gains beyond those that would have occurred anyway without a change in ownership. The performance and efficiency of government owned enterprises can and has been extensively improved under public ownership. Telstra itself has improved its performance and of course it can continue to do so, irrespective of who owns it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A significant amount of research has been undertaken which indicates that efficiency and consumer responsiveness is not inherently dependent on ownership, but rather depends on a combination of good management, effective competition, technological progress, regulation and consumer pressure. A 1995 Bureau of Industry Economics study revealed that Iceland, operating under a state telecommunications monopoly, had the world's lowest prices for a national basket of call charges and that Switzerland, another state monopoly, was the world leader both in terms of revenue per employee and revenue per line, which is an important measurement used by Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do not accept that there is a direct and inevitable association between economic performance and type of ownership. The fact is that the performance and efficiency of government owned enterprises has been extensively improved in public ownership. A <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4613"> 1995 study by the Industry Commission found that Telstra:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reduced its prices since 1989-90 by 16 per cent in real terms, while doubling&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I want to repeat that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">while doubling labour productivity and increasing payments to the government by over 60 per cent since 1990&hyphen;91.</PARA>
<PARA>We should not just blindly dismiss this record. It is a record that is worth pointing to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just propaganda to claim, as Telstra management and the government do, that partial privatisation offers some magic recipe by which Telstra will automatically make these significant efficiency gains. It has nothing to do with privatisation. As I said, it is about technological development. It is about management. It is about a commitment to providing a service, and I think Australians should be seriously questioning the commitment of the government and the capacity of Telstra's current management to deliver the sort of services Australia wants and needs, irrespective of whether Telstra is sold or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if efficiency gains are made under private ownership, there is no reason to assume that the benefits of those gains will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices rather than captured by shareholders in the form of profits. The government has acknowledged this by bringing forward legislation to put in place new regulations for consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If privatisation is going to deliver automatic consumer protection, then why do they need to bring forward this legislation? It is because they know that it is regulation, not privatisation, which is the key to safeguarding consumer interests. Unfortunately, the proposed consumer protection legislation does not go far enough in protecting the most vulnerable consumers&mdash;residential customers, those in remote localities and those with disabilities. If this is not remedied, and if other privatisations are anything to go by, all that we are likely to see post-privatisation is a sharp rise in the salaries of Telstra's senior executives, efficiency measured in how many jobs can be ditched, and no great leap forward in residential customer outcomes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know the code. What has efficiency and improved efficiency really equated to in this country in recent years? Improved efficiency really equals cutting down on staff and forcing workers to undertake greater duties and longer hours or suffer poorer terms and conditions. Only a few months ago Monash University published the results of a massive study on the effects of privatisation. There were over 200,000 case studies of enterprises and agencies world wide. The conclusion is one the government does not like to hear: no efficiency benefits from contracting out in the name of privatisation. I think that the South Australian Auditor-General just recently pointed out this very fact in an analysis of asset sales in South Australia. So let us not be duped by the repetition of the mantra about efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am certain that we would all remember that it was only recently that Telstra announced the biggest annual profit in Australian corporate history&mdash;$2.3 billion&mdash;while at the same time confirming that it would shed over 22,000 jobs in the next three years. I am not saying that there is no room for any staff reduction at Telstra, but I challenge the depths of those cuts. Recent employer surveys, both here and overseas, show that large&hyphen;scale downsizing not only has failed to deliver high productivity&mdash;that is one of the claims they made&mdash;and improved customer service but also has had a devastating effect on morale, staff commitment and motivation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that downsizing, like privatisation, is a current economic fad. While this particular fad has been in vogue in America, and is currently in vogue in Australia, the tide has changed in the United States. Earlier this year, the so-called guru of downsizing, Mr Stephen S. Roach, had a great public confession to make: I got it wrong. `Open-ended downsizing and real wage compression were recipes for industrial extinction,' he said. There is a growing number of commentators, analysts and academics who are reaching similar conclusions. This is something that we should be addressing in this country before the situation is irretrievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza says that one-third privatisation would make the board have a more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4614"> private enterprise focus and that that would be a good thing. But he does not talk about the inevitable tension between the one-third of shareholders hell-bent on profit maximisation, which would be natural, and the two-thirds still in government ownership. He does not talk about whose view prevails. He does not talk about the example of AIDC, where one of their recent decisions was to massively increase the salaries of the directors, and the government stood by as the major shareholder and said nothing. There is a huge problem when you have this one-third, two-third split, and there is a loss of accountability in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats believe that it is time to call for an end to Australia's decade&hyphen;long obsession with economic rationalism. There are times when private is not better than public, when asset sales are not in the long-term national interest, and when it is better for all of us to own and control something rather than deliver it into the hands of a few. For this reason, for the economic reasons, the Democrats&mdash;it is no secret&mdash;will be voting against the sale of one-third of Telstra. We are doing this on the basis of a consistent record. We have assessed in debates that we have had in this chamber in the past, in the case of the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is spending an inordinate amount of time on what should have been a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very simple proposition and something that should have got universal support. All we are talking about is selling one-third of Telstra, and we would do that with the aim of creating a modern, efficient communications system, available to the Australian community at its lowest price and with more than adequate consumer protection. The consumer protection that will be granted under this legislation is far wider than anything that exists at the present time. That is the point that I want to come to after I have made a few opening remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to this debate, and I am at a total loss to understand what the argument from the opponents to this sale is about. Most of what they are saying is just plain wrong. There is no factual basis at all to it. Some of the stuff that we are getting out of the Democrats, of course, is in the category of ghost stories designed to frighten the children. I really wish that they could attract some educated members to that party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of things in Australia now are really quite complex. If you are going to go around with people who are like modern day Luddites&mdash;the new Democrat senator from Victoria believes that mobile phones give you brain tumours, rather bad news for you, Senator Macdonald, because I have often seen you with two phones in use simultaneously&mdash;we really have to get some education into the Democrats, even if it takes years to do so. All we hear from Senator Kernot and members of her party is that somehow or other the most efficient way of running businesses is by owning them, owning them as a government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a lot of experience in this country with government ownership. There is no case for government ownership of commercial enterprises where that service can be delivered by private industry because private industry delivers it more efficiently and at less cost than any government enterprise. The reason for that is really very simple: not everyone is endowed with business acumen. Under the public service system, we are looking for different sorts of people&mdash;impartial public servants different from the sorts of people we are looking for in business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4615">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day there is no system of censure, and there is no reward possible for public servants when they run something like an airline, a bank or Telstra. In fact there is an inverse reward in the public service: if you lose $1 million or $1 billion on an enterprise, the reward for that is you get an increased departmental allowance next year and more staff because, obviously, it cannot cope with the situation. The cost of that to the Australian community, or the community at large, is really quite tragic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose one of the reasons why people oppose this one-third sale of Telstra is they have never lived under another system. They cannot imagine any other way of phoning a friend other than through a government owned enterprise. Therefore, they have no standards to compare what other services might be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over 25 years ago I had the privilege of living for some while in the United States. I was enormously impressed then by what the individual state based, privately owned telephone companies provided compared with what was provided by what was then the PMG in Australia. You had a courteous and prompt relationship with the operators if you had any problem. When you dialled someone, you got correct connections; you did not get wrong numbers. It was a rapid connection and you got very clear voice communications, none of the static and the other business that we had in Australia in those years. You had free local calls. You paid a very affordable and very low monthly rental. Even 25 years ago, you were billed for STD calls and they were minutely itemised&mdash;the number called, the time of the call and the rest of it&mdash;so there was never any argument about the account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those days, you were not allowed to touch anything in the Australian telecommunications system under pain of being thrown into gaol. If you moved into a new house or flat, you waited many months to get connected to the exchange, whereas, in the United States where I was living, Michigan Bell used to advertise on TV, `When you go from one apartment to another, take a pair of scissors, cut the cord and take your phone <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with you. We will do the connection the day after you arrive, if you have the phone with you.' It was a totally different concept of service from what happened in Australia at the time. That was 25 years ago and I do not want to dwell on the past. I do make the point, though, that there are incentives for private industry to perform that government industry just simply can never meet and, therefore, the consumer suffers in most cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the history of Telstra in Australia, go back to when it was Telecom and before that the PMG, you come to another conclusion&mdash;that is, there has been a gross abuse of the monopoly powers that were invested in it. The only time we have seen any improvement in telephonic communications in this country was when the Labor government quite correctly introduced some competition into the scheme. Surely to goodness, in the light of that experience now and the benefits this minuscule competition that has come in has brought consumers, introducing more competition now, more private ownership is clearly the way to go because we are still left with the legacy of all those inefficient years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, Senator Kernot, was saying that Telstra was going to sack 22,000 employees. I do not know what the present employee strength of Telstra is, but I guess it is somewhere around 80,000 people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might well have to go to a half. The whole problem with Telstra is that it has been in the grip of the union movement all its life. It was the technicians union that featherbedded Telstra and made it the inefficient operator it is today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to improve it much further, and we can improve it if it is privatised. Opponents to privatisation are quite dazzled by the sort of deathbed conversion to profitability that Telstra has had in the last 12 months. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4616"> believe, as Senator Panizza said, that we can have bigger profits in the years ahead if it is run efficiently. Profitability is one thing and the enterprise has to be profitable to cope with new technology coming on and the rest of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at the end of the day, we have to have an affordable and efficient service. I would argue that there would be room through efficiency to lower the cost to both the individuals and business in Australia, and both of those are very worthy and essential aims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to briefly deal with some of the myths that are around the place. If you listened to our opponents on this subject, they would lead you to believe that Telstra was beyond reproach, that no-one had any complaints about it. I can remember a few years ago in Cunnamulla in western Queensland being assailed by a property owner who owned two properties with his wife and it was essential for them to have phones on each property, but they could not get one phone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was mixed up for many years in the rural telephone subscribers organisation in rural Queensland, which came into being because of the poor service that Telstra provided to the bush. While someone might say that we are going back into the past, we are not going back very far; we are only going back about six or eight years. Let us look at the recent past at the organisation known as CoT, Casualties of Telecom. This group, particularly in Brisbane, have spent huge amounts of money on FOI finding out why their businesses have suffered through the incompetence of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compensation claims that they are lodging through insolvency of their business run into half a million to a million dollars&mdash;amounts like that. That is really big money. Only last week I had two new cases come into my office in Brisbane. It is a very tragic story of two middle-aged women who started a business, and Telstra just messed them around to such a degree that they have lost a very large amount of money&mdash;I presume a significant part of their life savings, if not all of it&mdash;purely because of Telstra's technical inefficiencies. I think they have put in a claim <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for about half a million dollars in compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether they will get it&mdash;or any of it&mdash;I have no idea. All I know is, from talking to them, that Telstra denies all responsibility. These people have been involved in considerable expense up to the present time, and the emotional stress of dealing with an absolutely insensitive and uncaring bureaucracy has to be seen to be believed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested to hear Senator Woodley for the Democrats waxing lyrical about the great service Telstra gives to the bush and saying that, if Telstra were sold, no-one in the bush would get a phone. With the greatest respect to Senator Woodley&mdash;and I am sorry he is not here&mdash;I think I do know the bush a bit better than he does. As I understand it, his experience of the bush is living in a manse in a small country town. That is really quite different from living out where the dingoes howl at night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just give an example of my own experience within the last month. My wife and I have a cattle property in Central Queensland. While we have mains electricity onto it, the phone is supplied by some sort of solar powered system. I do not quite know how it works. All I do know is that it does not work much more than about 40 per cent of the time. Maybe it gets to 50 per cent of the time, but the serviceability of that phone would never be above 50 per cent. That is an enormous frustration, because we do not have the property as a weekend retreat or somewhere to get a suntan. It is a business, and the business is selling cattle&mdash;whether fat cattle, steers, stud bulls or herd bulls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very frustrating and it costs us a huge amount of money when a buyer rings up and he cannot get connected to the property. There is a real safety element involved, because trauma and accidents are part and parcel of rural life. You try to avoid them as well as you can with correct management practices, but the phone has a very real safety factor to it. We have suffered enormously with this. We protest to Telstra, and nothing happens. They just do not want to know about us out there in the bush.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4617">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As recently as a month ago, when my wife came back to Brisbane&mdash;she spent most of this year up on the property&mdash;she picked up the phone and rang the Telstra complaints section in Brisbane. She said that she wished to record a complaint with the phone at Lillianvale. The person at the other end of the line who took the call said, `I can't take the call.' My wife mildly said, ` Why can't you?' Telstra said, `The subscriber's got to make the complaint.' My wife said, `But I am the subscriber.' They said, `How are you complaining about the phone not working when you are phoning us?' My wife said, `The phone is in the country and I cannot do it from the property because the phone is not working.' They said, `You should have gone to the neighbour and phoned from the neighbour's house.' My wife said, `That is a two-hour or three-hour drive over bad roads and I do not really feel that that is practical. I am ringing you from here.' At that point&mdash;and my wife is a person of impeccable manners, unlike me!&mdash;the person from Telstra taking the complaint just slammed the phone down on my wife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do not give me any of the stories that Telstra are giving a Rolls Royce service to the consumers of Australia; it is simply not true. They will do a lot better when they get a profit motive coming from one-third of their shareholding being held by Australian citizens. With those few words, I wish the bill a speedy passage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.12 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator MacGibbon and all of my colleagues, I support entirely the government's proposal for the sale of one-third of Telstra. I do it because I know it is good for Queenslanders and I know it is particularly beneficial to people up in the north, where I come from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is no surprise that the coalition parties are putting this proposal forward. It was one of the very clear aspects of our election policy and it was a policy that the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens urged the electorate to judge us on at election time. Of course the electorate did just that and gave us a massive majority both in the House of Repre sentatives and even in the election for one-half of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am excited about the sale of one-third&mdash;and I emphasise again, one-third&mdash;of Telstra. Listening to the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats spokesmen, you would think it was the total sale of Telstra. But it is a sale of one-third only&mdash;not like the Labor Party when they promised one thing in relation to privatisation and did exactly the opposite. It is the sale of one-third of Telstra. I am excited because the sale will provide a better service for people in all parts of Australia, but particularly in rural and regional Australia. As well, the proceeds of the sale will enable the greatest investment ever into the environment capital of our nation, and that can only be of benefit to all of us, but particularly to those in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the other aspect of the sale is that the bulk of the moneys received from the sale of one-third of Telstra will be used to reduce our debt. When our debt is reduced it has the effect down the line of reducing interest rates. Of course the reduction in interest rates, as we have seen since this government has been in power&mdash;and the reduction in interest rates that is anticipated by the markets&mdash;can only be wonderful news for home owners and small business people right throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having listened to some of the absolute rubbish that has come from those on the other side of the chamber on this debate, perhaps it is necessary to reiterate that the bill provides that Telstra will remain Australian. The bill restricts aggregate foreign ownership to an 11.6 ownership stake in Telstra; that is, 35 per cent of the one-third of Telstra equity that can be held by persons other than the Commonwealth. It restricts foreign ownership in Telstra to 1.6 per cent, and it imposes related offences and anti-avoidance and enforcement provisions. It will ensure that Telstra's head office base of operations and incorporation remains within Australia and that its chairman and the majority of its directors are all Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy President, having listened to some of the old European&hyphen;type centralists on the other side talking about these things, you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4618"> would not understand that that is what the bill says. The bill will enable remedial action to be taken where there has been a contribution of the ownership limits and other requirements, including applications by Telstra or the minister for Federal Court injunctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it will remain. It is Australian now, and it will remain totally Australian. There will be shareholder oversight in that the bill provides for the power to require Telstra to give the minister the financial statements. There will be a notification by Telstra of significant events that might take place. There is an obligation on the Telstra board to keep the minister informed of ongoing operations, and there is a requirement to prepare, update and provide corporate plans to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the bill has covered it very well. There are consumer safeguards, and these are quite clearly set out in the bill. The new consumer safeguards introduced by the government will be in addition to the continuation of several important mechanisms. The universal service obligation reaffirmed in the bill will continue to require a standard telephone service to be offered to all Australians. Untimed local call obligations already guaranteed by legislation will be retained for residential consumers. There will be price capping, which requires prices for a basket of Telstra's main services to reduce, on average, 7.5 per cent annually. Then there are the prices for individual services to residential customers. General prices surveillance will apply. All of those things are in the bill. It is quite obvious that no-one in the Labor Party or the Democrats or the Greens has been bothered to use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that my interest was the interest, of course, of my constituents. I want to briefly elaborate on where some of the money will go. One billion dollars of the proceeds of the sale of one-third will go to the environment. I am absolutely amazed about the reaction from parties like the Greens and the Democrats, which claim to have some environmental constituency. I might say that nobody really believes that anymore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Lindsay by-election has shown that the Democrats, in particular, have become quite irrelevant in the political scene, and the Greens are not much better. When you, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regrettably, have these ridiculously stupid parties of the Right&mdash;the Australians Against Further Immigration, the people that the Labor Party gave their preferences to, and the Shooters Party&mdash;getting more votes than the Greens and the Democrats, you can see that the Greens and the Democrats are on their way out. But $1 billion of the sale of one-third of Telstra is to go into Australia's environmental infrastructure, and $318 million will go for a major national vegetation initiative to tackle the problems of land and water degradation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Labor Party are not interested in this. You are only interested in the environment when it involves chaining yourself to a tree in the rainforest. When it is the real environmental issues, you are not interested. That is why you are refusing to give the government this money to put into that initiative on national vegetation. There will be $163 million to implement the Murray-Darling project.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon in the other place I had the exquisite pleasure of seeing Jackie Kelly sworn in as the new repeat member for the seat of Lindsay in Sydney's west. I wanted to touch upon a few of the issues which that by-election result raises. Let me just first of all point out a few of the raw facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of primary votes, the Liberal Party got 49 per cent of the primary votes. The ALP had a seven per cent drop from March to 33 per cent of the primary votes. That is a 16 per cent difference between the two parties on primary votes. This is in the seat of Lindsay&mdash;a Labor heartland. In the two-party preferred votes, it is not much better. It was 56 per cent for the Libs and 43 per cent for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4619"> the ALP. So there was a 13 per cent gap there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that there was a five per cent swing to the Liberal Party even though Ross Free, the previous member, should at least have had a very high profile. I think the problem was that his profile was such that people knew how incompetent he was in terms of what he did for the electorate. They saw more of him during the election campaign than they had seen in the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the vote for the Democrats. It fell from 6.4 per cent in March to 1.67 per cent. It is a terrible shame there are no Democrats in the chamber now. That is a miserable 1,179 votes alone. That is a few big families. If you have a few big families, you have the whole of the Democrat vote. The Democrats were out-polled by the Shooters Party, the AAFI, Call to Australia, the anti-airport candidate and the Greens. It is the lowest vote on record that I can find for the Democrats in a by-election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last by-election the Democrats ran in I think was Warringah. If my memory serves me correctly, they got something like 16 per cent of the votes in Warringah. In Mackellar, they got six per cent. When we go back a few years to Menzies, four or five years ago, they got around 20 per cent. This is a disastrous vote for the Democrats. Over the last 14 or 15 years it is the worst vote I can find.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this mean? What is the message from all this? Clearly, it is a reaffirmation of the directions that the Howard government is taking. It is support for the directions that we have been pushing this country in, support for a budget which has been widely seen, particularly in areas like Lindsay, as a tough but fair budget, a fair-go budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only it is a reaffirmation of the direction the Howard government is going in; it is also a message for the opposition parties. There is a simple message there. The first message is: let us get on with the job because that is what the population want. They want to see the government carry on in the direction it has been going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a message there about the ALP. How out of touch can you get? Clearly, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if there was a honeymoon for Kim Beazley, that period is now over. I am not sure there ever was. This is an illustration of how out of touch the whole of the ALP structure is. In terms of calling on the by-election, of making the protest in the first place, what sort of blame must you sheet home to John Della Bosca? What sort of misjudgment can you possibly make to do this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition in the other place said on 21 October on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daybreak</EMPHASIS>, `If there is one place you would want to run if you are a Liberal candidate, Lindsay would be it.' Really? Lindsay for 51 of the last 55 years has been a Labor seat.</PARA>

If it is such a Liberal seat, why on earth would you want to mount a challenge so that you can be disgraced and ridiculed? Why, if it is such a Liberal seat, did he go to such lengths and spend so much money on a court appeal so that you can have a by-election where you have been made to look like fools? Kim Beazley, Gary Gray or John Della Bosca is out of touch&mdash;the truth of it is the whole Labor Party is out of touch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the pleasant sight halfway through of the gloating that came when Bob Carr announced that suddenly he had found the money for the motorway tolls to be removed. You could see the gloating going on in the Labor Party in Lindsay. The bribery attempt, which is really what it was, was seen through by the population of Lindsay. The population of Lindsay said, `No, we don't want short-term bribes. We want a genuine government which is prepared to make the tough decisions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message there for the Labor Party and for the Democrats is that your spoiling tactics, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4620"> your negative opposition for the sake of opposition, has turned out to be completely irrelevant to the population of Lindsay and, indeed, for the population of the country. If the opinion polls around the rest of the country are anything to go by, the rest of the country is feeling exactly the same way as the good people of Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia are saying, `We want government. We do not want blockage. We do not want the hypocrisy that we are seeing with issues like public housing.' On the public housing issue essentially the thrust of our positive policy was your policy, yet in a hypocritical way the Labor Party turns around and says, `No, we oppose this.' Craig Knowles, the minister responsible in the state government, sent out an incorrect letter&mdash;let us be polite&mdash;to the public housing tenants making all sorts of ridiculous claims, which had no foundation whatsoever, in a simple attempt to scare those who are most vulnerable in our society. But the population of Lindsay saw through it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also said that this is a reflection on the budget. The Labor candidate, Ross Free, himself said that this will be a referendum on the nasties&mdash;that is the word he used&mdash;in the budget. That is an indication of what the election was about according to your own candidate. I am happy for once to accept Ross Free's word about this&mdash;that this was a referendum on the budget. Indeed, if that is the case, there was an overwhelming endorsement of the budget directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other issues here is the impact of this on the Democrats. Stephen Lear, the Democrats candidate, said on 20 October on the ABC that the Democrats face many problems. He went on to say, `We are really chasing our tails like a small dog at the back of the pack.' There is no question about the facts of that. I think the Democrats themselves will support that that is the fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> For once one of the Democrat candidates has come clean. They face an enormous dilemma. The Democrats have had a five per cent swing against them. It is a clear sign that the people want the Democrats to be constructive and not destructive. They do not want them to be spoilers; they want genuine con structive working together to improve the country. They do not want the cynicism that the ALP shows, they do not want the hypocrisy; they want them genuinely to keep the bastards honest and not to keep the bastards dishonest.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the Friday before the by-election I received information from an impeccable source, which was subsequently confirmed, that the ALP government under Bob Carr was planning to stop the issuing of firearm licences and would not recommence issuing them until the new year. This meant that, where those licences expired, they would not be renewable until some vague time in the distant future. This was correct and was supported by Shooters Party MLC John Tingle, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Firearms Registry did advise some Shooting Associations that they wished to discontinue issuing Shooters Licences in Category "A", which is the only sort you can have now, but the Minister has countermanded that and has directed that Licences must continue to be issued until December 21 this year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of preferences was first raised by Mr Franich and not by me.

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to address an issue which is of more importance and certainly more significance to a group of people in the area of Broken Hill. Yesterday they held a memorial service for the miners who lost their lives on the Line of Lode. So far 704 names have been recorded. Many more are known to have died there and their names are yet to be recorded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a project that is being conducted with local support from the Line of Lode Association and the Broken Hill Family and Sports Picnic Committee. Architectural students from the University of South Australia have created a design for a memorial which will sit on top of the highest peak of the Line of Lode. The memorial will overlook the city, the railway station, the town hall and the post <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> office. It will provide a stark and moving reminder to everybody who visits that city and that community that mining is an extremely dangerous occupation. To date, we know of 704 people who have died on the Line of Lode, including two whose bodies have never been recovered from the mine and whose resting place is in the mine itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that there are many more names to be recorded because I learnt yesterday from talking to the officials that, in the early days, if somebody was injured on the Line of Lode they were removed to hospital or to their home for their final care. So their death ensued away from the Line of Lode and was not recorded as a death on the line; it was recorded as a death somewhere else. Officials are now having to go through a lot of the history and the records of the community to try to ascertain the names of all those who have lost their lives in this industry. I would guess that from the time when the mine first started there will be many names that will never ever be recorded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very moving and fitting time to hold this memorial service: it was held in conjunction with the family sports and picnic day. It is a reminder of the poignancy, the care and the love in these mining communities. It is a reminder of the importance to these mining communities of the traditions of mining and their awareness of the dangers that go with mining that, at a family sports and picnic day, people actually take the time to hold a memorial service. There to provide the music and the hymn singing was the Victorian Welsh Male Voice Choir. They, of course, also appreciated from their ancestral roots the importance and the traditions of mining. They sang two very beautiful hymns and songs: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Amazing Grace</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I am a Working Man</EMPHASIS>. That song, for those who do not know it, is about someone who values seeing the light of day as they are actually able to leave the pit. They remember their colleagues who do not get to leave the pit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to send my best wishes to everybody who is involved with the project to set up this memorial to those who have lost their lives. I am sure that my fellow colleagues here would like to do so as well and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4622"> recognise the significance of this dangerous occupation and that this memorial will be an important milestone. When it is built it will be an important symbol which will stand over the city. Those who know Broken Hill will appreciate that the dumps and tailings stand very high as a permanent reminder that mining is a dangerous occupation, but having a monument that will stand out and be visible for many miles around will, of course, be an ever present reminder to the people there that this is a dangerous occupation. It will be an ever present reminder to anybody visiting the area that mining is a very dangerous occupation. The monument will also ensure that, for those people who go there, industrial occupational health and safety issues will always be of the utmost significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those people who were involved in the memorial service and to those families which have lost loved ones on the Line of Lode, I extend my condolences and thoughts. I really did appreciate that memorial service. I appreciated the fact that the unveiling of the plans for the memorial was conducted by the grand daughter of someone who lost their life on the Line of Lode and by someone who had been involved with the University of South Australia School of Architecture in designing the memorial. To all those involved, I wish you well. I found it a very moving tribute. I found the camaraderie and the friendship that existed in that community&mdash;in spite of the tribulations and the trials that they have had to live through&mdash;very rewarding as well. I wish them all the best.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME>
<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past I have risen to honour the memory of many of Australia's finest economists, the last one being a highly respected statistician. Tonight I would like to spend a moment of the Senate's time reflecting on the extraordinary life of Sir Roland Wilson&mdash;arguably Australia's finest statistician&mdash;who, sadly, at a great age, passed away last Thursday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Roland Wilson will long be remembered as one who made an exceptional contribution to Australia in the field of applied economics. He was a man of remarkable intellect and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> independence of thought, who was never afraid to speak his mind. These attributes sometimes brought him into conflict with his peers and colleagues, but they also brought innumerable benefits to the field of economics here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gives me great pleasure to highlight the fact that such a distinguished economist was born and bred in my home state of Tasmania. In fact, he was born in Ulverstone, a beautiful little town of some 11,000 people on the central north&hyphen;west coast. After being educated at Devonport High School, Sir Roland gained his first degree&mdash;Bachelor of Commerce&mdash;at the University of Tasmania. He eventually returned to the University of Tasmania to lecture in economics after undertaking studies at Oxford University as Tasmania's Rhodes scholar. May I add that Sir Roland Wilson was actually the first boy from a Tasmanian government high school to win such an award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later as a Commonwealth Fund Fellow he completed his PhD at the University of Chicago. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> reported yesterday, it was the entry into the Public Service which caused considerable friction on one occasion because he was recruited as a professional statistician at a time when doctors and lawyers were the only graduates in the Public Service. Bringing a new academic discipline to the job, his new colleagues at the statistician's office were incensed at the threat his appointment posed to their job security. Remembering this was in 1932, during the depths of the depression, those in the statistician's office were very much afraid that their jobs were on the line. People usually started at the bottom of the ladder as an inkwell filler or messenger boy, not as a Doctor of Philosophy in Economics. They decided to go on strike for a day to make their point. However, to their honour, it was these same colleagues who, four years later, were the first to congratulate him when he was appointed Commonwealth Statistician and Economic Adviser to the Treasury, the youngest man ever to hold that position. They now endorsed him as the best person for that position. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4623">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once Australia became involved in World War II, he was appointed to establish the Department of Labour and National Service and he became its head. Following the war, he served the United Nations as Chairman of the Economic and Employment Commission. This appointment came just four years after the establishment of the United Nations in 1945. It is interesting to note in passing that his death occurred on the day observed by all around the world as United Nations day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of these appointments, his time as Australia's Chief Statistician was fragmented. Finally, in 1951 he was appointed Secretary to the Treasury, a position he held until his retirement in 1966. This was not the end of his career, as he served both the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and Qantas as chairman until the mid&hyphen;1970s. This distinguished Australian provided a model for all public servants in his unstinting and selfless commitment to the good government of our country. Even in his retirement, although never one to mince words, he refused to speak out publicly on economic policy and practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989 the Distinguished Fellow Award was conferred on him by the Economic Society of Australia for his exceptional contribution to Australia. I am sure there will be many who would wish to emulate him as an outstanding Australian public figure.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to again raise the question of John Bevins Pty Ltd and remarks made in this Senate some weeks ago. I thought I would read onto the record the correspondence on this particular matter which involves both John Bevins, Ian McDonald and Senator O'Chee and let the record speak for itself. The circumstances were Senator O'Chee made some allegations in this chamber which prompted this correspondence. The first letter is from Mr John Bevins, Executive Chairman of John Bevins Pty Ltd, and it reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am deeply concerned that you claimed, in the Senate tonight, that my agency had offered a lucrative contract to a public servant employed in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Commonwealth Government's Office of Government Information and Advertising (OGIA). The clear implication of your comments was that this was an improper inducement&mdash;intended to affect the impartiality of a public servant charged with the responsibility of independently assessing tender documents submitted for the National Gun Control Public Education Campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your claim is entirely false. Check the facts, you will find this to be so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to believe that you inadvertently misled parliament. If you are an honourable man, then you will correct the record and apologise for the damage that you have done to our reputation and that of the public servant who has been drawn into this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, on the other hand, you wish to maintain your current position and leave this falsehood uncorrected, then I challenge you to repeat the defamatory statements without the protection of parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA>Then in a further letter to Senator O'Chee of 17 October, Ian McDonald, an employee of John Bevins, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A week ago my partner, John Bevins, wrote to inform you that statements which you made in the Senate last Thursday evening relating to our agency had no basis in fact. Separately, you have since received from Mr Simon Longstaff a copy of his Statutory Declaration in which he states his belief that your assertion was `without foundation' as was the `imputation that any of the parties acted improperly'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his letter, John asked that you check the facts and correct the record.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this point we are not aware of any action which you have taken to do either. Nor have we had the courtesy of a reply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accompanying this note is the fax header sheet of&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Ms X's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">C.V (which she sent to me last month at my request).</PARA>
<PARA>I use the name `Ms X' because I do not want to reveal the name of the public servant at this stage. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will note that it is dated and fax date&hyphen;stamped 17 September&mdash;a week after the DDB appointment was announced. For your assertion of a `lucrative position' being offered to hold true, one would then have to accept that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">i.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> we offered her a position several weeks before the `Guns Amnesty' agency decision date and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4624"> then got around to asking for her C.V. a week after it</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and/or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ii.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> we asked for and received her C.V. several weeks after&mdash;according to your theory&mdash;we had already offered her a job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepting that a C.V. is normally a critical input to any executive appointment, perhaps you will detect something not quite right with each of those?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the record, the agency has never offered&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Ms X&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">any `position', any `contract', any consultancy, or anything otherwise. We have the very highest regard for her professional abilities and for her exemplary personal conduct, but that is nonetheless so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John wrote that, if you are an honourable man, you will correct the record. May I add that if in the face of all indications to the contrary you still believe that we have acted improperly, then if you possess the courage of your beliefs you'll repeat them outside parliament. Either course would provide us with something to respect.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator O'Chee responded on 18 October in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr McDonald,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter and that of your colleague Mr Bevins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note your protestations, and had been intending to make a statement on the adjournment this week, however before I could do so Senator Ray spoke on the matter on Monday night. I can only assume this contribution was based on material you had provided him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My intention had been to state to the Senate your disagreement with my speech last week. Since you chose an adversarial and alternative route to achieve your objectives I considered myself relieved of any ethical obligation I had previously felt towards you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I have no intention of taking up your puerile and trite suggestion that I set myself up for a defamation action. I am already involved in two such cases because I have had the integrity to stand up for my constituents (where, of course, truth is no defence) and I do not feel compelled to needlessly involve myself in another to oblige someone whose interest is purely self.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bill O'Chee.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The final piece of correspondence comes from Mr Ian McDonald. He says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator, </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I acknowledge my receipt this morning of your 18 October letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its content was much as I had expected it might be but I must admit to some surprise at three comments which you've made within it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That we chose "an adversarial and alternative route": Seriously! What would you expect us to do when we had been defamed in a most cowardly manner yet could gain no response, let alone satisfaction, from yourself? Clearly our initial choice was to attempt to resolve the situation with yourself&mdash;but to no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That you've found that "truth is no defence": In the context of anything which you've uttered in The Senate on this issue, where does "truth" enter into this?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That you would not "oblige someone whose interest is purely self": In that an individual's reputation is about as "self" as you can get, I agree with you as to our motivation. But I can't follow the logic which allows you to believe that our defence of our reputations means you can absolve yourself of any "ethical obligation" to either correct your untruth or to otherwise test its validity?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary privilege is both a necessary and a wonderful thing. It can achieve much in the hands of honourable and conscientious parliamentarians who understand that the power and freedom which it grants to them comes at the cost of an absolute obligation to use it honestly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Bill, I'm sure that you don't need me to tell you that! Only you can truly say whether you've met that brief in this instance. We can do no more than hold an opinion.</PARA>
<PARA>I did not really enter the chamber tonight to tackle Senator O'Chee. But in a previous adjournment speech I wondered how this internal information out of DAS got into the hands of Senator O'Chee. So I pursued this matter at the estimates committee. I asked the Secretary to the Department of Administrative Services how this knowledge got out. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no contact with Minister Jull's office on this subject to your knowledge?</PARA>
<PARA>I was answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contact with Mr Jull's office in relation to what, Senator?</PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Potential conflict of interest by an OGIA officer?</PARA>
<PARA>He said he would have to defer to Ms Moore, the Assistant Manager. But he did confirm:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4625">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At one stage a query was raised from the minister's office about those intentions.</PARA>
<PARA>I then asked Ms Moore:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was that in writing or by way of phone?</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Moore said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had a phone call.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From whom?</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Moore replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From Miss Farnsworth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Jull's media adviser&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">asking me if I heard these rumours or discussions and if I could clarify them.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What did you respond?</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Moore said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I clarified them along the lines that the secretary has said.</PARA>
<PARA>So I put to Ms Moore that she not only clarified them but she also told Minister Jull's office that the officer concerned had declared a potential conflict of interest. She says, `Yes, Senator.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what appears to have happened is this: rumours  circulate that there was a potential conflict of interest in OGIA, the minister's office rings and gets those confirmed and then apparently briefs a senator or senators in the coalition who come into this parliament and dump on this particular officer. Who speaks for that officer is the question I ask? As ministers, your first requirement is to defend your department and the officers in the department. It is not to have them slandered in this particular chamber. Your job as a minister and Minister Jull's job is to defend his own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is ever proved that Minister Jull's office initiated these defamatory statements in the Senate, he should give the game away. It would be one of the greatest betrayals by a minister I have ever seen if that is the case. I ask Mr Jull here in this chamber to deny whether his office passed the information on to Senator O'Chee.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
