<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have very short memories and I know they are very convenient memories, so let me just remind you. Our policy was:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The important thing is this&mdash;our position is quite clear: we have put it on the table. But what is the Labor Party's position?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making to you is this: it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition came clean. If you look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> of 9 August, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . was he the senior Labor minister who told Telstra's chief executive, Frank Blount, that Telstra would be privatised in the early 90s?</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that Mr Beazley was the minister for communications at that time. It was not Michael Lee; he was not the minister. Mr Blount said that he would not name the minister; he said that he was still very active.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the question is: will the Leader of the Opposition stand up in the House of Representatives and say that it was not him? I am telling you that your position on this chops and changes all the time; our position is crystal clear. I am telling the truth now; I was telling the truth then.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to know if your policy position has changed. Will Kim Beazley get up in the House of Representatives and deny that it was he who said that to Frank Blount? It is a very critical question. You will be in tatters; if Mr Beazley was the one who was prepared to sell it and if all that you get from his policy statement as recently as last Saturday is that it will not be sold for the foreseeable future, you have a chasm between us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy position is clear, up-front. We put it to the last election. You tried to bag us; you got nowhere. The people voted for it. We offered to sell one-third. What is he saying? `We'll do it in the foreseeable future.' What is his relevant timeframe? Of course, if you happen to ever win government, he would change as quick as a flash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public know this wherever you go; they know that Labor was wanting to privatise Telstra. Indeed, Keating's recipe was to rip it into pieces.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. On March 2 this year the people of Australia voted overwhelmingly to change the government.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree that that is a good question. What we are faced with is the prospect of the Labor Party, having been defeated, now seeking in this place to tear down a key part of the government's budget strategy that makes a significant reduction in the deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is particularly pleasing is that, after having overwhelmingly elected a government that is prepared to take the hard decisions, and having seen the government take those hard decisions in this budget with that very substantial reduction in the deficit&mdash;so much so that it would be put in underlying surplus during the term of this parliament&mdash;the moves by the government to do that have actually been endorsed in the public opinion polls. In other words, contrary to what the Labor Party always believes&mdash;that it is necessary to spend and spend and spend again in order to remain popular&mdash;this government has, in fact, said that it is important that we be responsible and cut this huge deficit, and in the opinion polls they are saying that we are on the right track. A stunning 77 per cent of them surveyed in the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> poll rated this budget as average or higher, which is a better result than Labor achieved in 13 years of government&mdash;a stronger endorsement than Labor got in any of its 13 years of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, what is particularly pleasing to the government is that 59 per cent of those surveyed particularly commended the government on its decisions to cut the deficit and to increase national savings. So the people of Australia are now telling the government that we are on the right track; we have put down the budget that they believe is in the national interest. Now it is a question as to whether the opposition parties in this place are prepared to allow the government to govern and have its budget implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, early signs are that Labor will not accept it. What we have read in the last few days is that, in fact, they want to reverse the budget figure by some $7 billion over the next four years. They spent in government and now in opposition they are not prepared to allow us to save.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3007">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be the effect of this? If this occurs, we will be unable to achieve all the benefits we are wanting. The objectives of this budget are clear: we are trying to cut expenditure in order to keep pressure off interest rates, so that we can give small business lower rates of interest in order to keep pressure off inflation, in order to enable us to keep pressure off taxation&mdash;all these critical steps that are necessary to enable the economy to grow and, in particular, to enable employment growth to proceed out of a continually growing and strengthening economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In view of the fact that it is now over two weeks since the disgraceful assault on Parliament House and that, in that period, it has emerged that paid union officials, people who were members of unions affiliated with the ACTU, took part in that attack, has the ACTU apologised in any way for the disgraceful attack on this bastion of democracy or offered to make any reparations?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting the extent to which the community at large has been distressed by the events that occurred here a few weeks ago. It is unprecedented, in the life of this Parliament House, that a rally would turn into a riot resulting in very substantial damage to property and over 100 individuals, many of whom were police and protective officers doing their duty to protect us in this building, being hurt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3008">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This rally, which went so terribly wrong and resulted in this damage, was sponsored by the ACTU. It is not surprising that the Australian people have been expecting the leadership of the ACTU, as the organiser of this rally, to apologise for what happened&mdash;the damage that was caused and the injury to persons. Regrettably, although time has gone by, the ACTU leadership has not been prepared to do so. Furthermore, the Australian Labor Party, the political wing of the trade union movement, has not been prepared to ask the ACTU to apologise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth reflecting that this was the rally that Mr Kelty described as `the most successful in Canberra's history'&mdash;the most successful that ended up in a riot and caused so much damage to property and persons. Has he retracted that? Has he apologised on behalf of his organisation? No, he has not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has Jennie George done so? No, she has not. When she was pressed on the issue, she said she was waiting for the police to report to her on the details of the event and she was disappointed to hear that what the police were interested in doing was prosecuting those who broke the law. The police are not there to protect the interests of the ACTU. But even in those circumstances, she was not prepared to come clean and acknowledge the failure of her rally and to say how much the ACTU regretted what had occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, we all have responsibilities in relation to political rallies and we have responsibilities when they go wrong. When we speak to rallies, it behoves us to speak in a way that doesn't incite violence. A good start would have been Mr Beazley not talking about `Liberals hate this and Liberals hate that'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are in a rally and it is going sour, then, Senator Crowley, what is necessary is a touch of leadership to try to calm those who have become inflamed. Senator Crowley was 20 feet from the front of the rally but did not see anything. This was a rally that was battering down the front doors of Parliament House. Senator Crowley was 20 feet from there and saw nothing. Her behaviour was described by one police office as totally unreasonable in a volatile and dangerous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> situation. She was bellowing and arguing that the doors should be opened so that the mass could charge in. This was a mass that was violently trying to break down the doors and physically hurting people within the building, and she was demanding that the doors be opened up so that they could charge in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of leadership that the Australian people do not need to get from a political party with the history and standing of the Australian Labor Party. It is about time that somebody on the other side, either in the political wing or in the trade union wing, actually got up and said, `I'm sorry for what happened. It got out of hand.'

The Prime Minister said this morning that the solution to unemployment over the medium term was to pass the workplace relations bill. Isn't the real question just how much damage the Howard/Costello budget will do to jobs growth in the short term? Isn't there a more direct link between your budget and unemployment, with Treasury papers showing that unemployment will rise by 30,000 this year? Isn't it true that your budget retrenches at least 10,000 workers directly and cuts programs that help create jobs&mdash;programs which encourage research and development, which promote exports and which assist the start up of new small businesses?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is any secret in this matter. I think I have answered similar questions before. We have not been able to bring forward all of the expenditure that we would have liked in the first year of our implementation of our Natural Heritage Trust principally because the opposition parties in this place say that they are not going to pass the funding base for that. Nevertheless, we have brought some of it forward because we remain optimistic. We trust that in the end the Labor Party, the Greens and the Australian Democrats will realise that this $1 billion investment in the Australian environment is very worthwhile and that it is wholly legitimate to sell part of one capital asset, a telecommunications company, and to re-invest part of that in another capital asset, our natural environment.</PARA></TALK.START>

But that is a shared burden and we do not apologise for that. We inherited a deficit of nearly $10 billion and it was our responsibility to do something about it because, as Senator Brown might know, research will tell you that the Australian people want of us not only economic growth but also economic growth in an environmentally responsible way. In other words, they want us to create an economic situation in which we can achieve the economic goals that we would seek&mdash;in particular, job growth and rising living standards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of the meeting was that it took place at a critical time in Asia's energy future. The meeting provided a major impetus to Australia's goal of reforming energy policies across the region and advancing regional free trade in energy. As the Prime Minister said in his address to delegates, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3014"> energy is the source of growth. The APEC economies are forecast to grow at about a third faster than the OECD economies over the next 20 years, so the region's demand for energy will grow dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The expected investment in APEC regions between now and the year 2010 in energy related infrastructure is in the order of $A2 trillion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ministers around the table readily recognised the benefits of working together to address those challenges and agreed on outcomes which will be important in the future energy policies of all member economies.

These include pursuing enhanced efficiency in energy production; distribution and consumption; pursuing open energy markets; and better transfer between the economies of environmentally sound technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another outcome was that of reforms to mobilise private sector investment in the region's energy infrastructure, responding to detailed recommendations generated by businessmen from across the region. The sheer size of investment will require private sector involvement in the investments in energy infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was agreement on action to reduce the environmental impact of energy production, distribution and use.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Woodley is not the only person who would like to hear the answer; I would guess that there are an awful lot of Australians who would like to hear the answer. The situation is that a lot of pensioners have been giving the banks a great advantage by allowing them to have the holdings of pensioners and allowees without paying proper returns on the investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is exactly what happened when the previous government introduced extended deeming, which we supported. As soon as the previous government introduced that procedure, the banks at last started to give elderly people and other people on low incomes a fair return for their investments. We are saying that that was a good thing to do. Already there are two major banks, as I understand it, who are giving a deeming rate of five per cent. I believe that, with the new measures being introduced, other banks competing for business will be in the same situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a proper thing to maximise the income going to people on low incomes. I do not think that anybody would deny that that is something we should all aspire to to make sure that people on low incomes maximise their income from whatever source.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time on 22 August, which was somewhat disorderly even by recent standards, I was asked to consider the practices applying to questions which invite comment on policies of non-government parties and to the content of supplementary questions. On the first issue, in relation to questions on other parties' policies, presidents have consistently ruled that questions must relate to matters within the responsibility of ministers and the government and that questions which merely seek comment on the policies of other parties do not meet that test and therefore are not in order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions may refer to other parties' policies only for the purpose of asking a minister to indicate the government's intentions or actions in relation to particular matters. In answering such questions, ministers must confine themselves to areas within their ministerial responsibility and to the government's intentions and actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having examined the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript of the question concerned, I consider that that part of the original question was out of order, and the whole of the supplementary question should have been ruled out of order. It is obvious that this kind of question can be used as a pretext for a minister simply criticising the other parties' policies in an answer. It is for the chair to control this kind of misuse of such questions in the circumstances of particular cases, and I will continue to endeavour to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because he told the truth. That was his crime. He told the truth. He admitted that this government's intention is to flog off all of Telstra. Forget about one- <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> third, their intention is to flog off the lot. One-third is just a softener.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They thought there might be an easy way to get around this without scaring the horses if they could just propose the partial privatisation of Telstra. But just six months down the track since the election, the real agenda has come out courtesy of Senator Alston. The real agenda is now in the public arena&mdash;that is, the full privatisation of Telstra. It was admitted for all to see on national television that the full-scale privatisation of Telstra was inevitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was not just a throwaway line from some junior shadow minister. This is perhaps not to be compared with his pre-election commitment of maintaining the existing funding for the ABC. This is the responsible minister. This is the minister for communications. This was a revelation. This was Senator Alston being honest. This was Senator Alston being frank. This was Senator Alston telling the truth. This was an unguarded moment, an unguarded revelation from Senator Alston&mdash;the No. 6 minister in cabinet&mdash;that Telstra was to be sold, not a third of it, but the whole lot. For good measure, what did Senator Alston do? For good measure, he threw in his view that the sale of Telstra was not only inevitable but also highly desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You must ask yourself the question: why would a minister in this government let the cat out of the bag in such a flagrant way? Senator Alston has been carried away for some time by his self&hyphen;importance. He has puffed himself up&mdash;full bombast, full pomposity, full self-importance. He is really buoyed by his own self&hyphen;importance. Senator Alston was quite oblivious to what he was saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would have to say that he was guilty of hubris, which is what Mr Howard says is the greatest sin of all. He is guilty of hubris, and we all know what Mr Howard thinks of that. That is why he has been repudiated. He has been humiliated. He has been humbled in such a way by his own leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving Senator Alston's clear political ineptitude to one side, he has revealed this government's true agenda. No-one is now mistaken. No-one misunderstands what they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3024"> are on about. This government plans to sell the whole of Telstra. No matter what rock solid, ironclad guarantees John Howard gives on this matter, no matter what core or non-core promises John Howard makes on this particular matter, he plans to flog off the lot. We now know that that is the case. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me congratulate you, Mr Deputy President, on your elevation to the deputy presidency, this being the first occasion I have had in this chamber to congratulate you. The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) shows that empty vessels certainly make the most noise because he kept repeating the same point over and over without much substance at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position of the government on this matter is very clear, Senator Faulkner. We made our policy on Telstra very clear before the last election. We were going to sell one-third of Telstra. We were quite up front about that before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot took a most surprising position on this matter. There is the party that claims they are going to keep the bastards honest. If they really mean that, they should be keeping us to our promise of selling one-third of Telstra. We plan to do that. Instead&mdash;and this is what came out again and again of the hearings by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee&mdash;the Democrats are taking a position on Telstra that is way off to the left of Fidel Castro.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fidel Castro has done this. Albania has done this. The worldwide move is to partially privatise or privatise these bodies. We are moving to partially privatise in line with what governments right around the world are doing. Why are they doing it? They are doing it because it is a much more efficient way to run telcos. It is on the record of the Telstra inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence time and time again was that Telstra was 20 per cent to 30 per cent off the pace in terms of efficiency. Just think what that is costing the Australian economy in terms of cost and in terms of missed opportunities for lowering the price of calls. We <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need more competition. We need the government telco partly privatised so it can compete a lot better in this market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet we had the opposition parties conspiring during that Telstra inquiry to set up a terms of reference to take control of the inquiry away from the government, to put in a whole range of other matters for inquiry, including matters that could be totally separate inquiries on their own behalf. I mention, in particular, overhead cabling and the post-1997 regime. In the end, of course, what they were really on about was this matter of the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely amazing that Senator Faulkner gets up and criticises, given the machinations within the Labor Party about this matter over the last five years. The fact is that Paul Keating wanted to sell the lot. Keating wanted to sell the lot. I did not hear Senator Faulkner mentioning that position of the Labor party or its previous leader, to try to sell the whole of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not proposing to do that. We were quite up front before the last election that we would sell one-third of Telstra. That will take place. We will see how that works out. Before we take any new position on this matter, we will go back to the people with a policy. We will be totally up front, unlike this Labor government which was going to&mdash;if the previous Prime Minister had his way&mdash;flog the whole thing off without a mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have received a very strong mandate from the people to sell one-third of Telstra, and that is what we are determined to do. If we do change our minds later on, we will take it back to the people and be most up front again going into another election. We said that before the election. We have said that since the election and, in question time today, Senator Alston has reinforced what is our policy position. It does not matter how much that empty vessel up the back clangs and makes noises, it will not really overcome that very basic point.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak to the same motion. I speak to it because the question I asked and the answer given by Senator Alston today <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3025"> again exposes the fact that Senator Alston had his knuckles severely rapped by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;I have to say, I suspect, somewhat unfairly. Senator Alston in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>  program got himself into a fair bit of strife. He got himself into strife over Telstra and was admonished very severely by the Prime Minister, who the next day in a press conference said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I just want to make it clear on behalf of the government, and I spoke to Senator Alston both last night and this morning, and I reinforced to him there's been no policy change, any suggestion cabinet has discussed the matter is completely wrong.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Prime Minister said on the public record within 18 hours of that press interview that Senator Alston had. If ever there were a put down by the Prime Minister, that is one of the best put downs by a Prime Minister to any minister in a long time. Senator Alston got hit very clearly over the head and went to ground for 24 hours. His office would not make any comment. There was no comment from Senator Alston on the fact that the Prime Minister had clearly told him to shut up because he was ruining any chance or strategy the government had of getting the privatisation bill through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, when I asked my supplementary question, I wanted Senator Alston to comment about the fact that only a month or so ago there were some published remarks by the Prime Minister. I will quote from the Clayton Utz publication, winter issue 1996. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I believe within five years from now the whole of Telstra would be privatised. There are certain things that are unstoppable.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Prime Minister said a month ago. I trust that when Senator Alston was being abused by the Prime Minister in those phone calls, which the Prime Minister has put on the record that he made to Senator Alston, Senator Alston had the wit to point out, `Hang on, John, you were only a month ago saying that in five years it is all inevitable.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that Senator Alston also would have pointed out the contradiction in the Prime Minister's remarks in that same press conference on 2 September, when he said, `and vote against any legislation that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might be submitted in ten years time to sell any more.' The Prime Minister suddenly within a month had gone from saying it is inevitable within five years to saying it might be privatised within ten. I presume, Senator Alston, that you might have had a slight modicum of courage to tell the Prime Minister he had got it wrong, because he severely embarrassed your credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, over the last month is not the first time Senator Alston has been done over by his Prime Minister. Back in July, the Prime Minister and Mr Costello did the Minister for Communications and the Arts right over on the issue of ABC cuts. Senator Alston was arguing up until the time in July that it was reasonable for the ABC to take a 2&half; per cent efficiency cut, but that was about it. Suddenly the ERC imposed on him, ambushed him and said, `You've got to have a $55 million cut every year for the next four.' The ABC has a $209 million cut all up over the next four years. So Mr Howard and Mr Costello did the minister over again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, today we have press stories appearing that the so-called, much vaunted Senator Alston public inquiry into cross-media ownership rules is now going to be dropped and that there would be some sort of green paper. I have to say I think it is more like the shade of green of Senator Alston's face. This is an inquiry which he promised at the election. He has been saying to the media about every two or three weeks since the election, `I will be announcing the chairperson of this inquiry. Next week or the week after, I will be announcing the terms of reference.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For six months we have waited, and it has not turned up. What has turned up today is an indication from John Howard that this inquiry is too tricky for good old Senator Richard Alston to be involved in. Therefore, we will back away from that. We will destroy Senator Alston's credibility about a media inquiry. We will now have a green paper which will be under the control of the Prime Minister, not Senator Alston, who on three occasions now has been struck out by his Prime Minister. The old saying in politics is, `Three strikes and you're out.' This minister has been done over by his Prime Minister on three separate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3026"> occasions in the last month, and he still sits there posturing and blabbering about what he is doing in the portfolio.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is quite clear that the real issue is the credibility of the other side of politics.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is a non&hyphen;issue, why did the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have to ring him on two occasions when he was involved in detailed preparations to go to the South Pacific Forum? Why did the Prime Minister have to call a press conference, interrupting his visit to the South Pacific Forum on his way there? Why did he have to have a press conference to discuss this particular matter? I am not concerned with the ostensible reason for calling it. It was called specifically so that he could hose down Senator Alston's remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would have to say, if you were rating Senator Alston, that he had a big break out on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>. He not only bungled and let the truth out on Telstra, he also made intemperate remarks on the Fairfax organisation off the top of his head. It was a sort of Dougie Walters effort: do it off the stick; no preparation or anything else; open your big mouth and pontificate as much as you can regarding the press.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is forgivable, Senator Alston, if you have the runs on the board and you have a good track record. But, when we look at your track record in communications, you have had the ABC slaughtered in its funding; you have had a new chairman of the board selected by the Prime Minister and not you. One of the Prime Minister's friends has been put on and all your candidates have been rolled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot get together an inquiry on cross&hyphen;media ownership. It is going to come every week. It is going to take as long as Halley's comet before it arrives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you had a track record of solid decision making in communications, one could at least forgive the odd outbreak, the odd loose language. But we have discovered on this occasion that for the first time ever Senator Alston has said the truth. This comes as a terrible shock. We did not know whether in fact he was lying when he said that privatisation of Telstra was inevitable and desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the Prime Minister's reaction, for the first time ever we have Senator Alston, Tricky Dicky, opposite over here finally going on the public record and saying something truthful. It is a terrible shock indeed to my system that Senator Alston would say the truth on this! But it is consistent, basically, with what the Prime Minister hinted at the Clayton Utz function, these former employers who used to pay him while he was in parliament to give them advice. It is at least consistent with that. It is consistent with what the now Treasurer said in the Qantas debate: that if you only one&hyphen;third or partially privatise something, that organisation dies the death of a thousand cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real answer today was not given by Senator Alston. It was given by Senator Hill, who has at least given a let&hyphen;out. Senator Hill was asked whether he would introduce some sort of legislative amendment to their Telstra bill absolutely forbidding any further sale. And Senator Hill wimped it! Senator Hill wimped the question and did not answer it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The credibility question still is here: is the full privatisation of Telstra on the Liberal Party agenda? Is it going to be like so many of their other election promises, core and non&hyphen;core, `We will implement whatever we like; we will dump whatever promises we like,' because all they are interested in in this issue is getting their right wing ideological baggage up, as this section of the Senate chamber most reflects, to their own disgrace.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its Annual Report 1993&hyphen;94 this Committee reported that certain decisions provided for by the Trade Practices Regulations were not subject to external merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Subsequently, on 14 August 1995, the President of the Administrative Review Council, quoting the Committee's Report, wrote to the then Minister for Justice advising that, in the view of the ARC, those decisions should be subject to such review. The President copied her letter to the Assistant Treasurer and to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22 September 1995 the Committee wrote to the Assistant Treasurer, referring to the ARC advice, asking that the Regulations be amended to provide <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3039"> for AAT review of the decisions. On 11 October 1995 the Minister for Justice wrote to the Assistant Treasurer suggesting merits review of the decisions by the Trade Practices Tribunal. On 13 December 1995 the Assistant Treasurer replied to the Minister, copying his letter to the Committee, advising that he did not favour merits review by either the AAT or the TPT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that the ARC is a statutory agency with the function, among other things, of making recommendations to the Minister on review of administrative decisions. The Committee would be grateful for your advice on whether you accept the present recommendation of the ARC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the position of the ARC. In this context the Committee had previously referred similar discretions in the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations to the ARC for advice. Following advice from the ARC that the discretions should be subject to AAT review the Committee formally resolved on 30 November 1995 to recommend that the Senate disallow the relevant Regulations if the Minister did not, on that day, give the Committee an undertaking to amend them. The Minister then gave such an undertaking. On 17 June 1996 I will give notice of a motion of disallowance of regulation 8 of the Trade Practices Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 20, for 15 sittings days after that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will send a copy of this letter to the Assistant Treasurer and to the President of the ARC.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 15 April 1996 the former Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Senator Mal Colston, wrote to me concerning procedural aspects of the Trade Practices Regulations (Amendment).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These regulations amend the Trade Practices Regulations to establish fees for arbitration determinations by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (`the Commission') in relation to access disputes. Such disputes are likely to be large scale commercial disputes involving access to the services of significant infrastructure. For example, an electricity generator seeking access to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an electricity grid could seek arbitration by the Commission in respect of grid services `declared' under Part 3A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (the Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted by Senator Colston, subregulations 6C(2) and (3) provide for a notification of an access dispute fee of $2,750. Regulation 6D provides for the withdrawal of notification but has no provision for a refund on withdrawal. The subregulations were put in place to allow the Commission to recover its costs for processing each notification. The figure of $2,750 represents the minimum costs that the Commission will incur every time in processing a notification, covering initial processing costs, including the costs of notifying other interested parties. These costs would be incurred irrespective of whether or not an arbitration hearing occurs and accordingly, there is no provision for a refund. The figure was arrived at in close discussions with the Commission's management, who provided information about the costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second question raised by Senator Colston concerns the discretionary pre-hearing and hearing fees. Similarly, these fees were also set with a view to cost recovery, particularly given that the parties could use private dispute resolution if they so wished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fee of $10,000 represents the minimum `get-up' work which the Commission must undertake before conducing arbitration hearings. In the case of disputes about variations of an earlier determination a lower fee is specified ($2,000) because the Commission will have previously considered the matter. The daily hearing fee of $4,000 covers the minimum cost of daily hearings, including the cost of two Commissioners, Commission staff, counsel for the Commission, facility expenses, transcription fees, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By specifying these fees in the regulations, the parties know in advance what costs will be incurred, thus allowing the parties to control the costs of the arbitrations. In each case, the Commission must simply decide whether or not to charge the amounts specified in the regulations. If the Commission believes that the fees are not warranted in a particular situation (eg the hearing day has only lasted for 15 minutes) it could decide not to charge any fee for the day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted, these fees are different from those set out in the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Regulations (MSP Regulations) and do not contain a provision for a refund. This is because the MSP Regulations rely on a different regulation-making power, which would not appear to permit step-by-step charging. Given that, under regulation 6 of the Trade Practices Regulations, costs are only charged after they have been incurred there is no need for refund provisions. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3040"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third issue relates to the question of why no provision has been made to cover the expenses of witnesses summoned to appear before the Commission. Experience has shown that a specific provision is unnecessary, in light of the Trade Practices Tribunal decision in re John Dee (Export) Pty Ltd ATPR 41&hyphen;006. In that case, the President of the Tribunal held that the payment of expenses incurred by persons in compliance with summonses was an incidental aspect of the procedure of the Tribunal. As the Commission has the right to determine its own procedure (see s.44ZF of the Act), it appears the Commission has the power to order the payment of those witnesses expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that a disallowance motown was moved in the Senate on 30 May 1996 in respect of regulation 8 of the Trade Practices Regulations (Amendment). This issue had not been raised with me prior to the motion being made. Regulation 8 does not deal with the matters examined above, but merely amends regulation 28 of the Trade Practices Regulations. The amendments to regulation 28 enable the Commission to charge for providing copies of documents on the register held by the Commission under Part IIIA of the Act. The level of fees is the same as that charged by the Commission for copying documents held on the register under other parts of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust this explanation meets the concerns of the Committee. I request that you take action to withdraw the above disallowance motion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter (cttee\1041) dated 27 May 1996 concerning recommendations by the Administrative Review Council for merits review of Australian Competition and Consumer Commission decisions on whether concessional fees may be paid. You ask whether I accept the Council's recommendation. In short I have accepted the substance and effect of the President's advice in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may be aware that the former Minister for Justice responded to the President's letter on 11 October 1995, expressing support for the general proposition that decisions of the kind in question should be subject to administrative review. The former Minister also expressed the view that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular decisions should be within the jurisdiction of the (then) Trade Practices Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Assistant Treasurer wrote on 13 December 1995 to the former Minister for Justice indicating that it would be inappropriate for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to be in an authoritative position making findings which bear upon one of the key technical issues underpinning competition law. The former Assistant Treasurer also rejected the suggestion that jurisdiction be conferred on the Australian Competition Tribunal (the successor to the Trade Practices Tribunal).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This matter came before me after the election and I have written to my ministerial colleague Senator Jim Short, the Assistant Treasurer, about the advice provided by his predecessor to the former Minister for Justice. I have expressed my view (consistently with the advice of the President of the Council) that there should be external merits review of the decision making power in question. I have also considered which is the most appropriate body to review the particular decisions. I understand that the Administrative Review Council resolved in December 1995 not to pursue further the question of which tribunal would be the appropriate review forum. After considering the earlier correspondence, I have come to the view that the Australian Competition Tribunal is the most appropriate external review body. I have advised Senator Short accordingly. A copy of my letter to my ministerial colleague is enclosed for your information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note your intention to give notice of a motion of disallowance of regulation 8 of the Trade Practices Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1996 No. 20. As the implementation of the recommendation is essentially a matter for my colleague the Assistant Treasurer to respond to I have sent a copy of this letter to the Assistant Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also sent a copy to the President of the Administrative Review Council for her information.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to two letters to the Committee from Senator Brian Harradine, copies of which are attached, about the AUSTUDY Regulations. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3041"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine's letter of 11 December 1995 relates to the validity of certain administrative action in the light of provisions of the AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No 132. In this context I attach a copy of a memorandum prepared for Senator Harradine by the Parliamentary Research Service. In summary, the advice in the memorandum appears to be that action by the Minister, the Secretary and the Department may be inconsistent with provisions of the AUSTUDY Regulations and therefore invalid. The Committee would be grateful for your advice on whether administrative action taken in the relevant area has complied with the requirements of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, regulations are made by the Governor&hyphen;General, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council, under the authority of an enabling Act of the Parliament. It would be a matter of concern if administrators failed to observe the provisions of regulations, or substituted other requirements in place of those prescribed by regulation. The Committee has often pointed out that the rights and duties provided for by regulations are as significant as those provided for by Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine's letter of 1 May 1996 concerns Statutory Rules 1995 No 393 which, among other things, abolish the AUSTUDY Dependent Spouse Allowance. Senator Harradine points out that a provision dealing with the same matter was included in the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995. That Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 22 November 1995 and was introduced into the Senate on 27 November 1995, with the second reading adjourned on that date. The Regulations were subsequently made 15 days later, on 12 December 1995, and came into effect on the same day. The Committee would be grateful for your advice on why regulations were made covering a matter provided for in a government sponsored bill then before the Senate. Your advice would also be appreciated on the date on which drafting instructions for the Regulations in question were sent to the Office of Legislative Drafting. The Committee notes that the provision in the relevant Act relating to Dependent Spouse Allowance came into effect as recently as 1 January 1995. As it now stands, a provision of an Act appears to contemplate that there will be such an allowance, whereas the allowance was abolished by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would also be grateful for your advice on why the date of commencement of the Regulations is 12 December 1995, whereas the relevant date of commencement provided for in the Bill was almost three weeks later, on 1 January 1996. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Bill,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your letter of May 27 to my colleague David Kemp MP has been referred to me as the senior Minister in the portfolio. Thank you for forwarding a copy of the paper prepared by the Parliamentary Research Service and the letter of Senator Harradine&mdash;to whom I am responding separately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a former member of your Committee, I entirely take your point about the primacy of legislation over regulation and would be most concerned at any breach of this important principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, the Austudy scheme is established under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. This principal Act provides for the level and type of benefits to be specified by regulation. Regulation 64 of the Austudy regulation, provides for the payment of a Dependent Spouse Allowance (DSA) to some Austudy recipients. The DSA, created by regulation, has been a part of Austudy benefits from the inception of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point I wish to stress is that the DSA was created by regulation and therefore its termination should be by regulation. The DSA only found its way into the principal Act by an amendment which came into effect on January 1 1995&mdash;after which the principal Act contained a reference to the DSA in Schedule 1, Module F.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to Schedule 1 (F3), "The parental income test does not apply to the person while a parent of the person: . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> gets Austudy or Abstudy and:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> also gets dependent spouse allowance under Austudy or Abstudy . . . ".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This reference substantively dealt with eligibility for the Youth Training Allowance. The DSA was mentioned only because the amendment granted exemption from a parental means test if the parent was getting Austudy or the DSA. This provision in the principal Act does not create an obligation to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3042"> pay. Rather it simply refers to an allowance already set up under the Austudy regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, removing this reference to the DSA in the Act was a form of legislative house-keeping to acknowledge the cessation of an allowance (by removing a reference to it) which having been created by regulation, was being abolished by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, the previous Government&mdash;as part of a general move to replace the DSA with another benefit&mdash;repealed Austudy Regulation 64 by Regulation 9 of the Statutory Rules 1995 No. 393. The drafting instruction to repeal Regulation 64 was issued on October 30, 1995. The date of commencement of Regulation 9 was December 12, 1995&mdash;so that it could cover processing of 1996 Austudy applications in late 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to the principal Act to delete, amongst other things, reference to the DSA, was introduced into the Senate on November 27, 1995, but was not passed before the Parliament was prorogued. The deletion of reference to the DSA was, as I say, a piece of legislative house-keeping to acknowledge the fact that the DSA would no longer be available&mdash;under the Regulations&mdash;after January 1 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I very much appreciate your Committee's vital role in safeguarding the legislative process and I congratulate you, your Committee and Senator Harradine for your vigilance on this subject. I hope, however, I have satisfied you that there has been no breach of legislative principle in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note Senator Harradine's concerns and those of the PRS that the "deeming" provisions of the Austudy Actual Means Test might be in breach of the Austudy Regulations which require decisions to be made on the basis of information supplied by applicants. Naturally, I am concerned to ensure that no breach could occur and have asked the AMT review team now looking into this matter to take Senator Harradine's concerns fully into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I appreciate that there are a number of important political objections to some aspects of the Austudy scheme which are governed by the Austudy Regulations. The Government is addressing these objections through the AMT review to which, as indicated, I will treat Senator Harradine's letter and attachments as a most important submission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all the circumstances, I hope you will consider withdrawing the notice of motion which you gave to the Senate on May 30, 1996, to disallow Statutory Rules 1995 No. 393.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 15 April 1996 the former Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Senator Mal Colston, wrote to me concerning procedural aspects of the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney System Sale Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These regulations establish fees for arbitration determinations by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (`the Commission') in relation to access disputes under Part 6 of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 (the Act). Such disputes are likely to be large scale commercial disputes involving access to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted by Senator Colston, subregulation 3(2) provides for a dispute notification fee of $15,000 (or $5,000 if the dispute relates to an existing determination). Subregulation 3(4) then provides that if a notification is withdrawn before an arbitration hearing then $12,250 of the $15,000 (or $2,250 of the $5,000) is refunded to the notifier. This leaves a non-refundable component of $2,750, which is equivalent to the initial notification fee under regulation 6D of the Trade Practices Regulations (amendment). However, unlike under Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 the regulation making power did not support the progressive fee structure under the Part IIIA regulation. Accordingly, under the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney System Sale Regulations a larger up&hyphen;front fee was provided for, but with provision for refund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subregulation was put in place to allow the Commission to recover its costs for processing each notification. The figure of $2,750 represents the minimum costs that the Commission will incur every time in processing a notification. It will cover initial processing costs, including the costs of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> notifying other interested parties. These costs would be incurred irrespective of whether or not an arbitration hearing occurs and accordingly, there is no provision for a refund. The figure was arrived at in close discussions with the Commission's management, who provided information about the costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remainder of the notification fee (ie. $12,250/$2,250) covers the minimum cost of the arbitration, including the cost of two Commissioners, Commission staff, and counsel for the Commission. By specifying these fees in the regulations, the notifier knows in advance what costs will be incurred, thus enabling it to control its arbitration costs. Senator Colston also asked why no provision has been made to cover the expenses of persons summoned to appear before the Commission. Experience has shown that a specific provision is unnecessary, in light of the Trade Practices Tribunal decision in re John Dee (Export) Pty Ltd ATPR 41&hyphen;006. In that case, the President of the Tribunal held that the payment of expenses incurred by persons in compliance with summonses was an incidental aspect of the procedure of the Tribunal. As the Commission has the right to determine its own procedure (see section 96 of the Act), it appears the Commission has the power to order the payment of those witnesses expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that a disallowance motion in respect of those Regulations was moved in the Senate on 30 May 1996. I trust this explanation meets the concerns of the Committee. Therefore, I request that you take action to withdraw the above disallowance motion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to a letter of 15 April 1996 from the former Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Senator Colston, and your letter of 28 June 1996 concerning Health Insurance Commission Regulations (Amendment). Statutory Rules Nos 375 and 440. I note, also, that these Statutory Rules are the subject of Notices of Disallowance, lodged on 30 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Senator Colston's letter he referred to an earlier letter from the Committee to the then Minister for Human Services and Health concerning aspects of the immunisation register scheme. This earlier letter was the subject of a response by the Health Insurance Commission's Manager, Legal Services on 8 March 1996 (copy enclosed).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Colston advised that the Committee remains concerned about the matters raised in its original letter of 25 January 1996. These matters relate to calculation of administrative costs payable and means of disputing a decision that an overpayment has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of administrative costs payable in respect of provision of information for the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register, you would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3045"> be aware that the Regulations merely make reference to the making of "a payment". The amount payable is determined&mdash;as a matter of policy and in accordance with bilateral Commonwealth/State agreements outside the ambit of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 8 March 1996 response drew to your attention the administrative procedures, within the Health Insurance Commission, in relation to provider overpayments. These procedures involve notification to the payee of apparent overpayment and the giving of an opportunity to present any countervailing evidence or arguments, before any offsetting action would occur. I note also that the ability to offset is expressed as a discretionary, rather than a mandatory power, (the Commission "may" reduce a later payment: sub-regulation 3Q(3)). In fact there have been a small number of instances of overpayment where, upon notification, payees have refunded the appropriate amounts. These factors&mdash;together with the point that the issue of whether an overpayment has occurred is a matter, clearly, of fact&mdash;suggest that external "merits review" of a decision to involve the offsetting power would appear to be inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Officers of the Health Insurance Commission have sought advice (copy enclosed) from the administrative law area of the Attorney-General's Department on the issues you have raised. The advice received is that a decision to recover an acknowledged debt to the Commonwealth must be differentiated from a decision determining the means whereby such a debt is to be recovered. The latter decision does not give rise to the kinds of interests sought to be protected in providing for merits review, and accordingly, review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) would not appear appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Senator Colston's latest letter, he also requested advice in relation to possible review of a decision of the Managing Director, under paragraph 3Q(3)(d), to not direct an alternative means of payment to EFT payment. In answer to Senator Colston's specific query, I advise that there is no AAT review of such a decision. Indeed, the advice available to my officers is that this is a matter more properly described as being procedural in nature and one which would not appropriately be the subject of review by the AAT. As a matter of practice, too, the matter appears not to have caused significant concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that to date, only one practice has sought internal reconsideration of a paragraph 3Q(3)(d) decision. Also, in the early days of the scheme's operation (but not more recently), a small number of doctors initially requested payment by cheque&mdash;most apparently assuming that the Immunisation Register arrangements were the same as the Medicare arrangements where payment is generally by cheque. When advised of the EFT <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> payment regime, none of these requesters pursued the matter of payment method.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Colston's letter noted that the United Nations Security Council had on 22 November 1995 partly suspended the previously existing sanctions and that the Explanatory Statements advised that, because that was a `suspension' rather than a `termination' of the sanctions, it was implemented by `conditioned blanket permissions' rather than by an amendment of the Regulations.

"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 112 of the Act provides for the making of Regulations to prohibit the exportation of goods from Australia in terms almost identical to those of section 50.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June 1992 the PI Regulations and the PE Regulations were amended to implement UNSC Resolutions imposing economic and trade sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (FRY)&mdash;(Statutory Rules 1992 Nos. 154 and 155 refer&mdash;inserting PI regulation 4QB and PE Regulation 13CC). In May 1992 both the PI and the PE Regulations were further amended to extend the sanctions to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia&mdash;(Statutory Rules 1993 Nos. 67 and 68 refer&mdash;inserting PI regulation 4QC and PE regulation 13CD).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations 4QB and 4QC of the PI Regulations prohibited the importation of all goods from, or originating in, the FRY or the Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia without the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person Similarly, regulations 13CC and 13CD of the PE Regulations prohibited the exportation of all goods the immediate or final destination of which was, or was intended to be, one of those Republics without the written permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the relevant regulations required the Minister for Foreign Affairs or authorised person to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3047"> satisfied, when considering whether or not to grant a permission, that Australia's international obligations would not be infringed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with subparagraphs 50(3)(b)(ii) and 112(2A)(b)(ii) of the Act the permission granting powers under the relevant sanctions regulations provided that permissions could specify conditions or requirements to which importation or exportation under the permission was subject (PI Regulations 4QB(3) and 4QC(4) and PE Regulations 13CC(4) and 13CD(3) refer).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This formulation for the trade sanctions was chosen to accommodate Australia's international obligations under the terms of the relevant UNSC Resolutions within the restrictive terms of subsections 50(2) and 112(2) of the Act on the way regulations prohibiting the importation or exportation of goods may be drafted. It is also a formulation which allows Customs, at the time of importation or exportation, to identify goods as prohibited imports of prohibited exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The language used in UNSC Resolutions is often expressed in terms of requiring member States to put in place measures prohibiting all trade in goods to or from areas controlled by specified forces, or prohibiting trade with particular parties within a country or region. It is considered that the restrictions in subsections 50(2) and 112(2) of the Act on the way in which regulations may be drafted do not allow sanctions regulations to be drafted in the exact terms of the UNSC Resolutions. Defining goods in terms of their origin as "goods from an area controlled by Bosnian Serb forces" would not be "prohibiting the importation of goods from a specified place" within the terms of paragraph 50(2)(b) of the Act. Likewise, prohibiting importation of goods exported to Australia by an individual who belongs to a particular political party or rebel force, is not within the scope of subsection 50(2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drafting  the regulations in terms of prohibiting importation from, or exportation to, specified countries unless written permission is presented to Customs, is within the scope of paragraphs 50(2)(c) and 112(2)(c) of the Act, while at the same time allowing Australia to meet its international obligations. At the time of entry Customs will be able to identify the goods as a `possible' prohibited import or prohibited export because the relevant documentation indicates that it originated in, or is destined for, a place where the UNSC sanctions apply. Whether the goods are actually prohibited imports or prohibited exports can then be determined by Customs on the basis of the existence of a permission in writing that applies to those goods. The decision as to whether or not importation or exportation of those goods would infringe the terms of the UNSC Resolution is left to those with the permission granting power, ie the Minister for Foreign Affairs or authorised officers within the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;who are in a better position to know the terms of Australia's obligations under the UNSC Resolution and possible day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day changes in circumstances in the countries to which the sanctions relate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The December 1995 "suspension"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1995, in accordance with UNSC Resolution 1022 of 22 November 1995, the sanctions in relation to the FRY, the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were suspended indefinitely, except insofar as they related to the Bosnian Serb party and the foreign assets of FRY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As detailed above, the terms of sections 50 and 112 of the Customs Act allow regulations to be made which `prohibit' the importation and exportation of goods in particular ways. It is considered that regulations which `suspend' prohibitions except insofar as they relate to a particular party, or that `allow' importation or exportation unless the UN Secretary&hyphen;General notifies that certain agreements have been breached, would not be within the scope of these restrictive heads of power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was therefore not considered possible to give effect to Australia's obligations under the terms of UNSC Resolution 1022 by amending the Regulations. The power of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or an authorised person to grant permissions to import or export subject to conditions or restrictions, however, was used to give effect to Australia's obligations under the UNSC Resolution to suspend all previous sanctions measures, subject to certain exceptions in respect of the Bosnian Serb party and goods owned or controlled by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The suspension was achieved by issuing 6 `blanket' permissions under the relevant regulations which allowed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the importation into Australia of all goods except those goods originating in Bosnia Serb controlled areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the exportation from Australia of all goods except those goods:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the immediate or final destination of which was intended to be a Bosnian Serb controlled area of Bosnia and Herzegovina; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that were owned or controlled by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) or a public utility of that country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the issuing of permissions for individual importations or exportations of goods would be the usual manner in which a permission granting power under the PI Regulations or PE Regulations would be administered, the terms of the relevant regulations could be interpreted so as to allow a general <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3048"> permission to be issued. While not entirely satisfactory, this approach was only adopted after extensive consultation between officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Customs Service and the Office of Legislative Drafting in the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The March 1996 suspension</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By letter dated 26 February 1996 the Secretary&hyphen;General of NATO advised the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the Bosnian Serb forces had withdrawn from the zones of separation set out in the Dayton Place Agreement, thereby satisfying the last requirement of UNSC Resolution 1022 for the suspension of sanctions against the Bosnian Serb Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net obligation on Australia of this suspension was that no controls were required on the importation into Australia of goods from the relevant Republics and that only the exportation from Australia of goods "owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by FRY or a public utility of FRY" was to be controlled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this occasion the Regulations were amended to give effect to the suspension as, in relation to imported goods covered by the Pl Regulations 4QB and 4QC, using the permission granting power to make "unconditioned blanket" permissions would have completely abrogated the operation of those regulations. It was considered that this would have been an inappropriate use of the permission granting power under these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to goods for export covered by PE Regulations 13CC and 13CD, there were no longer any conditions to be applied to exports to the relevant Republics, only a general prohibition on exports to ANY destination of goods owned or controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the FRY. As the terms of existing PE Regulations 13CC only related to goods destined for the relevant Republics, and that was no longer the primary consideration under the sanctions regime, PE Regulation 13CC and 13CD was amended to apply the `exportation is prohibited without written permission' formula to all goods "owned or controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the FRY" rather than to all goods "exported to the FRY". PE Regulation 13CD, which related to goods for export to the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was repealed, as the only goods destined for those Republics which were now to be covered by the sanctions are controlled under the amended PE Regulation 13CC.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subregulation 3(2) of the Ozone Protection Regulations provides that the Minister may waive the fee for the grant of a licence if satisfied that certain activities are for test purposes. As drafted, therefore, the Minister has a discretion not to waive a fee even if satisfied that an activity is for test purposes.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ozone Protection Regulations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to a written request from the previous Chairman of the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee, Senator Colston, to the former Environment Minister, Senator Faulkner, I am writing to you to clarify a number of matters relating to the Commonwealth's Ozone Protection Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter from the Committee requested clarification on the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the setting of licence fees under subregulation 3(1) of the Ozone Protection Regulations, and the setting of activity fees under subregulation 4(1) of the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees&mdash;Imports) Regulations and subregulation 4(1) of the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees&mdash;Manufacture) Regulations; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the discretionary powers of the Minister for the Environment to waive the fee for the grant of two types of licences under certain conditions specified under subregulation 3(2) of the Ozone Protection Regulations and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the consequential question of whether review by the AAT should be provided for.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These issues are addressed below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Setting of Licence Fees</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The licence fees were set on a cost recovery basis to cover the grant and administration of licences. The licence and activity-based fees reimburse the Commonwealth for costs of furthering the HCFC and Methyl Bromide phase&hyphen;out programs over a thirty year period. The fees were set following extensive consultation and agreement with affected industry sectors. The funds go into an Ozone Protection Trust Fund for that purpose; after expenditure is incurred, the Commonwealth is reimbursed from the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discretionary Powers of the Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discretionary power in subregulation 3(2) was included to enable me to grant a licence without payment of the fee where imposing a fee would be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inequitable and against the purposes and spirit of the ozone protection program. For example a company may be importing a small quantity of a substance for purity testing prior to deciding to import bulk quantities. If the import, export or manufacture is of commercial or environmental significance, then the fee must be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Minister's discretion was to be further limited, the upper limit at which the fee would be payable would need to be substantially reduced to 5 kg. Industry shares this view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am of the view that the discretionary powers in subregulation 3(2) should remain as is.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AAT Review</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ozone Protection Act sets out in Section 66 those matters reviewable by the AAT. It would be consistent with Government legal policy to extend the scope of AAT review to the decision under subregulation 3(2) as to the Minister's discretion not to waive the fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will have my Department prepare a regulation amendment to this effect. In the meantime, the regulations as enacted should stand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank the Committee for the opportunity to respond to the specific issues raised regarding the Ozone Protection Regulations and would be happy to provide any additional information required.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Order, which was made on 26 September 1995, provides in paragraph 3.1 that an exporter must not export quota meat to the EU for entry from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1995 without a quota.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, the Order refers in a number of provisions to applications received by 29 September 1995.

In this context, the Committee wrote to the previous Minister on 25 October 1995 and 7 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> December 1995 about similar concerns with earlier Orders and received an interim reply from the Department dated 20 February 1996. The Committee would have no objection to a single reply from you which consolidates your advice on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the present Orders were made on 26 February 1996, but both purport to prohibit the export of Quota Meat to the EU for a period beginning before this date, in one case 1 January 1995. There are also retrospective references in the Schedules to each of the Orders. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the validity of this prejudicial retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both paragraphs 1.2(c) provide that `a reference to any statute includes a reference to that statute as amended or replaced from time to time.'  (Emphasis added.)  Section 49A of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS>  provides for the incorporation by reference of an Act as in force from time to time. However, there does not appear to be a similar provision for incorporation of Acts replaced. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the validity of this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both paragraphs 10.1(b) provide that an application `must be made in accordance with conditions advised in writing by the Corporation to the Eligible Exporter from time to time.' The imposition of such conditions from time to time independently of the legislative process may not be a valid exercise of power. The Committee would be grateful for your advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both paragraphs 9 provide for the possibility of an increase or variation of a Quota; both paragraphs 11.4 provide that the Corporation may withdraw an Approval at any time and for any reason; and both paragraphs 16.1 provide that the Corporation may vary certain matters in respect of the Quota. In the case of the discretions in paragraphs 16.1, both paragraphs 16.2 provide for AAT review. The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether there is similar AAT review of the other discretions and, if not, if the exclusion comes within ARC guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 7.4 of No MQ 66/96 provides that certain actions will take place provided that the relevant Certificate `annotated by the relevant EU authority. . . is received by the Corporation by 5.00 pm on 31 March 1996.'  As the Order was only made on 26 February 1996, was sufficient time allowed for the European authorities to receive and annotate the Certificate, which must then be forwarded to the Corporation?  The 31 March 1996 limit has already passed, so what actually happened will be known. The equivalent paragraph 7.4 of No MQ 67/96, on the other hand, provides for a date six months later. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3051"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted in its letter of 25 October 1995 that the new Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Act has replaced the previous Act and that some of the above matters may have been covered by transitional provisions in the new legislation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letters of 25 October 1995 and 7 December 1995, to the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, concerning review of some clauses of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) Orders MQ64/95, MQ65/95 and M73/95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice was sought from the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) and the Office of General Counsel of the Attorney General's Legal Practice on all Orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to your first query regarding Order MQ64/95, advice from the Attorney-General's Legal Practice is that the Order is not retrospective, an does not contravene the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. A copy of this advice is attached for your information. I have, however, asked the AMLC to consider adopting a new drafting approach to ensure that it avoids any suggestion of retrospectivity in future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to your second query regarding Clause 10.4 of Order MQ65/95, advice has been received from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Legal Practice supporting your view. Although the AMLC intention was for all quota variations to be reviewable, not just the decisions set out in paragraph 15.1, this has not been the effect of the drafting. Accordingly I have written to the AMLC indicating that in future drafting of Orders of this kind specific review provisions should be included.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to clause 4.4 of Order M73/95, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Legal Practice advice on this issue also supports your view that this should be a mandatory provision. I have written to the AMLC suggesting that this Order be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You also sent me another letter on 19 April 1996, regarding Orders MQ66/96 and MQ67/96. I have received advice from the AMLC and will seek further advice from the Attorney-General's Legal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Practice. I will write to you again when this advice has been received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of your queries on these Orders, the AMLC has agreed to provide more information in explanatory memoranda when tabling documents in the future to assist the Committee in understanding its intention. I have enclosed for your information a copy of my letter to the Hon John Kerin and I am hopeful that the problems you have raised will not occur again.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The tabling of this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is a significant event for both the committee and for the parliament. While it is a relatively short cameo report, it contains a number of intentions and recommendations which the committee feels will improve the parliamentary processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This committee is the most recently appointed joint committee and, with 16 members, is the second largest in the parliament. It came into existence as a result of widespread community concerns about the treaty making process. I would like to acknowledge the presence of Senator Kemp in the chamber and divert from the prepared text that I have in front of me. Senator Kemp was one of those who ran with that issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time since it was formed, I and my colleagues would like to think it has begun to change not only practices but, more importantly, attitudes to the process of making treaties in this country. Public perceptions of past processes generally have been critical of inadequate consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of this committee was foreshadowed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in his first ministerial statement, on 2 May 1996, and gave substance to assurances given by the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when in opposition last year. I would like to thank the Foreign Minister, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) and their departmental staff for getting the committee off to a good start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I talk briefly about the 25 treaties tabled on 21 May and 18 June, which are dealt with in this report, I would like to make some general comments about the revised procedures which have been set in place by the government, together with a few words on the way the new arrangements are working. Prior to the present arrangements, while lists of the treaties into which Australia had entered were tabled in the parliament each six months, the Australian people had no way of knowing what their government had done in their name. Increasingly, this closed process caused concern at all levels of society. Significantly, it resulted in a lack of knowledge within the bureaucracy of the implications of these treaties. This, to take one notable example, led to the High Court's judgement in the Teoh case, with continuing legislative question marks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1995 the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee&mdash;I note the then chairman, Senator Ellison, is in the Senate&mdash;tabled a report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trick or treaty? Commonwealth power to make and implement treaties.</EMPHASIS> This report reflected concerns about the impact of international treaties on Australia's federal system and the degree of consultation undertaken by government prior to ratification. Included in its recommendations were the establishment by legislation of a joint treaties committee, the preparation of treaty impact statements for each treaty tabled in parliament and increased <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3056"> efforts by government to identify and consult groups which may be affected by a treaty into which Australia proposes to enter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the government did not implement the Senate committee's recommendations in quite the way they were framed, the changes it has made meet most of that committee's suggestions. It is pleasing that a number of senators from that committee&mdash;including Senator Ellison and, might I say, me&mdash;are now continuing their work as members of the joint committee. National interest analyses are now required for each treaty and there is also much greater emphasis on consulting those who might be concerned. A treaties council of COAG has been established as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treaties now will be tabled for 15 sitting days, at the end of which time the committee is expected to report to the parliament. Provision has been made also for the tabling of urgent treaties which cannot be tabled for 15 sitting days before action must be taken. More on that later. In its turn the committee has advised the Minister for Foreign Affairs that as soon as practicable after each tabling it will inform him of those treaties on which it will report at the end of the 15&hyphen;day period and those for which it will require additional time to report. In the latter cases it is the committee's expectation that binding treaty action will not be taken until it has tabled a report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report completes the process for consideration of the 25 treaties tabled on 21 may and 18 June. It is not a lengthy report and does not comment in detail on each of those treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 15 July the committee held private discussions with officials of the sponsoring agencies and DFAT, in its coordinating role, about these treaties. This was very useful and the agencies were prompt in forwarding additional information on some matters which is now publicly available in accordance with normal committee practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Highlighting briefly a number of issues, the committee found that the multilateral regional convention on hazardous wastes, the Waigani convention, is an appropriate way for the small countries of the South Pacific to deal with their hazardous waste, given their limited <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bureaucratic and other resources. Additionally, it has sought information on successful Australian tenders for work being carried out under the agreement with the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, KEDO. With regard to the agreement establishing the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, the committee has called for a progress report on the institute after it has been in operation for 12 months to validate its need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After lengthy discussion the committee decided not to undertake an inquiry into the treaty with Indonesia on maintaining security at this time, but will consider an inquiry when it has been in operation for a year or so. It agreed also to undertake a relatively short inquiry into the subsidiary agreement between the governments of Australia and Japan concerning tuna long&hyphen;line fishing. This inquiry called for public submissions and has now had two public hearings, one in Canberra and the other in my home state of Tasmania. Other hearings are scheduled for later this month in Fremantle, together with an inspection of a tuna boat and a tuna farm at Port Lincoln. We intend to table our report by the end of next month. The secretariat has gone to great lengths to publicise that inquiry, and this has resulted in a large number of submissions. This response demonstrates that there is a genuine interest in treaty making at the community level in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At its meeting on 15 July the committee also decided to investigate and report on the implications for Australia of the UN convention to combat desertification in those countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa. As this convention was tabled in parliament on 5 December 1994, it falls outside the 15 sitting day rule. However, nothing in the committee's resolution of appointment prevents it from examining treaties which have already been tabled. Submissions for this inquiry have been sought and are coming in, albeit more slowly than the subject might have indicated. Depending on the number received and their sources, a program of hearings and inspections around Australia will be arranged. At this early stage of the inquiry we intend to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3057"> table a report on this as early as practicable in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is still too early to assess with any precision the effectiveness of our approach and the new processes. In this context we understand that another small group of treaties will be tabled tomorrow for report by 28 October and that a much larger group is likely to be tabled on 15 October for report on the day parliament rises for the year, namely, 5 December. In the latter case, it is likely we will be advising the Minister for Foreign Affairs of our intention to look at some of these treaties in more detail with correspondingly later tabling dates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his May statement, Minister Downer said that where tabling in advance of binding action is not possible the resulting treaty would be tabled as soon as possible with an explanation. He noted that the exceptions would be used sparingly and only where necessary to safeguard the various national interests. To date only one treaty has been tabled in this category. The committee is keen to press the point that urgent cases remain just that and that most will be dealt with in the specified time scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, the committee has taken to its task with enthusiasm and I would like to thank all members for their hard work, particularly the chairman, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and his deputy chairman, the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland). The committee's thanks are due also to the secretariat which has produced briefing material of a high standard and other documents as and when required.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to the Senate and to the appropriate ministers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with Senator Abetz in stating that this first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is a significant report both in terms of the committee and the parliament. The chamber would be aware that this committee was established by the parliament to consider the tabling of treaties and to provide detailed scrutiny and examination of those treaties which are of particular interest to Australians. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It arose essentially out of a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trick or treaty? Power to make and implement treaties.</EMPHASIS> I must say that it involved consideration of a range of reform processes to allow for greater public consultation on issues of treaty making in this country. I think Senator Abetz is quite right: there is a perception in the community that there has been inadequate consultation on a range of matters relating to treaty making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, that is not necessarily a perception borne out by the facts. In fact, when consideration is given to the detail of treaties, it is quite often the case that there is an understanding of the importance of treaties to this country. That is particularly the case with global environmental issues and, as part of that global environment, this country has an important role to play in terms of protecting its people and advancing the interests of the people of this country in regard to those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of the matters being discussed in this report do go to issues directly related to the environment. It is of interest that the reform process does involve a higher level of consultation in terms of the consideration of treaty business. I note in the report the reference to COAG and the understandings that have been entered into in regard to consultation with the states involving treaty matters, the possibility of information being provided and a long-term program to allow for forward consideration of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has struck me as particularly interesting in this matter is that the demands by the states to be consulted only extend as far as the premiers' offices. When it comes to the question of whether or not the state parliaments should be considered in the process of consultation, the shutters go up. It is always very interesting, I find, in terms of states rights arguments, that the question of executive government only goes as far as the premier's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great deal has been said about Senator Kemp's interest in these matters, and I do find the change that occurs as one crosses this chamber interesting. The commitment that Senator Kemp enjoined in the last parliament to international isolationism seems to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3058"> vanishing quite considerably. If I recall rightly, he indicated his opposition to the Basel convention on the disposal of hazardous wastes, the international convention on the combating of desertification, the World Heritage Convention, and the international climate and change convention. Of course, all those matters are now quite clearly being considered in a different light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me that what this committee does provide is an opportunity for a much more careful examination of national interest perceptions and debates. I think the requirement of the national interest analysis for each of the treaties does assist members of parliamentary committee to assess the nature of proposed obligations and treaty actions. That is a very important role that parliament can fulfil, particularly given our constitutional responsibilities under section 51 (xxiv.).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, it is an important function of this parliament to exercise the foreign affairs powers of the constitution in a way that actually does benefit the people of this country. I am concerned, nonetheless, that in that process there is a possibility that the treaty making process can be undermined by not providing for the tabling of urgent treaties or the use of the urgent treaty processes in such a way as to allow for exemptions beyond the 15&hyphen;day period. There ought to be a firm commitment by the government and a maintenance of that commitment to the process of informing the parliament about any treaty arrangements that it is entering into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the parliament does take its responsibilities very seriously and, of course, does not allow the government to circumvent its obligations by using the urgency mechanisms that have been provided within the new treaty making processes. It is important that departments of state understand their obligations to ensure that the accountability to parliament is not subverted by concluding treaties in a way which would allow for the circumvention of that parliamentary accountability by the use of the urgency mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report that we are considering today considers some 25 treaties which were tabled between 21 May and 18 June. It is not a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly long report but I do think it covers the matters quite adequately and reflects the considerations of the committee quite properly. In terms of specific matters such as the Waigani convention, the committee found that the multinational regional convention on hazardous wastes was an opportunity for us to consider the most appropriate way for small countries of the South Pacific to deal with their hazardous wastes given their limited bureaucratic and other resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report does highlight that small island states do have a legal and bureaucratic infrastructure that is able to meet their requirements within the terms of this particular treaty. Therefore, the option that has been provided under this treaty for a simpler approach is preferred. It does offer the advantage of being able to accommodate similar types of treaties and it is important for the South Pacific that they should be able to ratify them at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the particular matters that I would like to draw attention to, which I indicate that this report does cover, is the issue of the treaty with Indonesia. It was resolved by the committee that we should not take any action at this point but should perhaps look at the implementation of that treaty at a later date. I am particularly concerned about the reference to article II, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the terms of that treaty the parties undertake to consult each other in the case of adverse challenges either to either party or to their common security interests and, if appropriate, consider measures which might be taken either individually or jointly in accordance with the processes of each party.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>It is stated quite explicitly in the advice to the committee that this is an agreement which is in the common interest of both countries to provide peace and stability to the region and which underlies their intention to develop cooperation to benefit their security and that of the region. It provides for activities in the security field which would result in these benefits, and for regular ministerial consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has been advised that there is no legal obligation from either party to actually commit military forces to matters that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3059"> relate to internal security threats that might be posed within each country. Given the events in Indonesia in recent times, I think it is important that that advice be checked. I am not altogether convinced that that advice is in fact adequate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agreement is not a defence pact or an alliance, we are told. It does not commit either country automatically to support the other in the event of an attack. It obliges us only to consult in the event of threats to our security environment. It is not an assertion that Australia and Indonesia have common internal policies or philosophies or that Australia endorses Indonesia's domestic policies and action and vice versa. It does not involve Australia in the internal affairs of Indonesia or vice versa or compromise our approach on human rights in Indonesia. I trust that that advice is right. I expect that it is; you would not expect officials to be advising the parliament on the basis of advice that is incorrect. However, I will be seeking, when the time comes for an inquiry into this matter, to follow up those issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is indeed an historic day with the tabling of the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year. The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee gave a unanimous report in 1995. One of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its many recommendations was that this committee be set up. I compliment the government on adopting the majority of those recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a report which details the joint committee's work and the recommendations it makes. One of those recommendations relates to the national interest analysis, which will be tabled with each treaty. That analysis will include the discussion of economic, environmental, social and cultural effects of the treaty where relevant, the obligations imposed, its direct financial cost to Australia, and how it will be implemented domestically. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the national interest analyses also include a discussion of the legal effects and potential areas of conflict with state and territory laws, which I think is a thoroughly sound recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also has outlined its approach to dealing with treaties. It states that it intends to advise the minister as early as practicable after each tabling whether it proposes to comment on the specific treaties within the group which has been tabled, whether it expects to table a report commenting on a treaty or other treaties in that group on a particular date and, most importantly, whether it is not possible to report within the 15 sitting day period that Senator Abetz mentioned. I think it most appropriate that Senator Abetz tabled this report as he was on that Senate legal and constitutional committee, which I mentioned, and also sits on the joint committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note Senator Kemp's presence in the chamber. He has had a longstanding interest in the Commonwealth's exercise of its power pursuant to section 51(xxix) of the constitution, which deals with external affairs. I would take issue with Senator Carr that it is a perceived concern. I would say that it is a substantial concern that exists in the community, across the wider community, as to how the Commonwealth, by executive action, has increased its powers pursuant to that section of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it was a concern of the Senate committee, which was expressed unanimously, that there should be more scrutiny. Indeed, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3060"> the government's acceptance of most of the  recommendations&mdash;such as the setting up of a treaties council, the setting up of this committee, wider dissemination of treaty information, more consultation with community groups and also the requirement that treaties be tabled at least 15 days prior to ratification&mdash;answers a good many of those concerns. Hitherto, the practice has been that treaties were tabled twice a year. In fact, I recall one occasion last year when over 100 international instruments were tabled in the Senate with little or no time for debate. That, indeed, was an unacceptable state of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an historic day in the Senate with the tabling of this report. This report mentions a number of treaties which Senator Abetz has touched on and I will not go into. Senator Abetz has mentioned other hearings which the committee plans to hold in relation to a number of treaties dealing with a variety of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I compliment the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on its first report, especially in relation to the two recommendations it makes and also on the work it has done to date. I also note Senator Harradine's presence here. He has also had a longstanding interest in the way Australia has bound itself to international treaties and instruments. I think this report will no doubt be greeted by Senator Harradine, although I will not speak for him, as a positive measure in parliamentary scrutiny and the result of positive work by yet another Senate committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of documents on this list which cover returns on bounties: the Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act, the Bounty (Books) Act, the Bounty (Computers) Act, the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Act, the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act, the Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Act, the Bounty (Ships) Act and the Bounty (Textiles Yarns) Act. All of these bounties serve a vital and important role in Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> A bounty is the cashing out of a tariff; that is, rather than impose a tariff, causing importers to pay the Commonwealth whatever the tariff level is on top of the cost of their product, to put it in money terms, it is paying the Australian produce company a bounty for each product. Thus it encourages Australian companies to replace imports, and it encour ages Australian companies to grow their exports as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world marketplace is by and large corrupt&mdash;not corrupt in the sense of criminal activity but corrupt in the economic sense. It is not that the market is not clean, but there are bounties and protections, both visible and invisible, provided by other countries on their products. For Australian companies trading on the international market, it means that they do not trade on a flat or clean playing field. They trade on a playing field in which other nations support their companies against Australian companies, which are internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus it is that all of us for a long time have seen a bipartisan role in a corrupted marketplace of that nature to ensure that the playing field is at least in nominal terms a little more level than it otherwise would be. Bounties are one way of encouraging Australian companies to meet foreign competition which is aided by their governments and to win in the international marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the bounties referred to here are documents setting down properly for public scrutiny what the Australian government has paid to particular companies as bounties in the interests of helping them become more internationally competitive. It is properly before the Senate on the basis that it is taxpayers' money and that Australians are entitled to know what happens to that money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document that I would in particular like to refer to today is the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989 relating to payments made during the financial year 1 July to 30 June 1996. This document shows that the Australian taxpayer met payments of $23,728,663.32 to 12 ship construction companies in four states of Australia. Those states do not include New South Wales and Victoria. They are what you normally might call the outlying states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look down the list, you will find that these are the best companies that the Australian manufacturing industry can boast. These companies are world renowned. These companies have the market dominance in the niche of manufacturing fast aluminium catamaran ferries in the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3062">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These companies include Flagship and Incat Tasmania, as well as a number of companies in my own state of Western Australia, the most important being Austal Ships, International Ship Yards and Oceanfast. All of them manufacture in this market area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This market area is the only area in which Australia's complex, sophisticated and high-tech manufactures have a world lead. In other areas of the Australian manufacturing sector we have derived technology, we add some of our own and we are in the middle of the market. But in this area we lead the market. It is this industry which is quite critical in giving Australia a worldwide reputation for engineering and innovative excellence, for leading because of its technology and because of its research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would think that in the case of this sort of industry the government would be eager to ensure that the playing field was even and flat and that this industry had a fair chance in the international marketplace to continue its winning way. It is sad to say that this government chooses not to take that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget brought down just last month, this government is prematurely ending the bounty for this industry's sector, thus putting these companies&mdash;Incat, Austal Ships and Oceanfast, all 12 companies on this list&mdash;at a competitive disadvantage in, to use the economic term, a world `corrupted' marketplace. That is not intelligent support for Australian industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contrast between the parties&mdash;brought out by the interjection from Senator Calvert of Tasmania; and I wonder why he did interject&mdash;is that the government of this day is wanting to prematurely end a piece of legislation that aids Australia's international competitiveness. Whereas we, when we were in government, and I, when I was minister, wanted to extend the right of this industry's sector&mdash;and all others, for that matter&mdash;to be internationally competitive, to compete on a level playing field, to win export credits for Australia as well as to address the problems of the current account deficit. That is the issue that is at stake here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that I need to make in this debate is that last year&mdash;the year under review in which these documents have been tabled&mdash;there was a payment, as I have said, of $23.7 million to the 12 companies. That ought to be contrasted to a recent decision that this government made. This government recently decided&mdash;in my view rightly, because it had contracts entered into on the basis of the existing legislation&mdash;to not do as it intended to do and prematurely end the Ships (Capital Grants) Act.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of companies&mdash;the Shell oil company, BHP and the Mackay sugar refinery&mdash;had undertaken the construction of ships. The government was going to terminate the ships capital grants scheme, which upon completion of construction would have paid them a major sum to encourage those ships to be built so those companies would use Australian owned vessels in Australian waters for their own needs. As I recall, the contrast here was the amount the Commonwealth government would pay those three companies, all major companies in their own right&mdash;that is, $27 million&mdash;but the important point is the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3063"> ships were being built in Holland or in the Republic of Korea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have an industry which is overwhelmingly Australian owned that has the world market leadership in its market niche. There is a small payment to make the playing field even to end the corruption, in the economic sense of that word, of that playing field, and this government wants to pull the rug from under the industry and chop it out. I think that is an absolute and total disgrace. It goes against employment opportunity. It goes against high skill, high technology and innovation in Australia. It goes against our reputation in the world marketplace to hold our head up as a developed, sophisticated economy able to produce goods of this complexity and sophistication.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The export market development grants scheme is an important scheme. It has been in existence for a long time. It started under the Whitlam government. I cannot recall in which of the three years of that government's office it was started, but it was, nonetheless, a scheme to encourage medium to small Australian companies to export their goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the current government declaring that the major economic problem for Australia is the current account deficit&mdash;one of the occasions in which they identified what their economic policy is supposed to be aimed at&mdash;one would have thought that measures to encourage Australian companies to export and earn export income would be important. Indeed, the previous Labor government put a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> great deal of store in the export market development grants scheme. But, and it has to be said, in the determination to cut down public expenditure, this current government has neutered the scheme and cut out of it huge amounts of support that would otherwise have been there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, they have slashed $426 million out of the export market development grants scheme for the next four years. That means that the scheme, through which small and medium sized companies in this country would receive what would be a very moderate grant to enable them to send some of their hard-pressed partners, executives or, indeed, workmen in small companies where very few people are involved into a foreign market to find ways and means in which they can sell their good in that market&mdash;that is, to visit their potential customers and to get some refund on their air fare for doing that&mdash;has now been reduced and made largely ineffective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a major pity. It is a major pity because, first of all, it undermines this government's credentials when it speaks on small business. Cutting back this scheme undermines small business directly. It is a pity when this government speaks about its need to reduce the current account deficit because cutting back on this scheme undercuts the ability of hard-pressed small companies to find the necessary finance to go to a foreign market and meet their customers in order to make a sale. Thus, it reduces the ability of Australian companies to export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity that there is only one conclusion one can draw. Whilst almost every other country in the world that has a sophisticated manufacturing sector like Australia provides these schemes and offers this assistance&mdash;and some have an even more sophisticated market&mdash;the Australian government chooses to reduce that assistance and narrow the level of opportunity for those companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity too because this is a scheme which has been refereed by an independent authority over many years to see how effective it is. The universal conclusion of all the single opportunities that have been exercised to referee this scheme to see if it works is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3064"> that, yes, it does. It works to this extent: for every $1 of taxpayers' money spent under this scheme, $25 of foreign exports are generated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one needed to ask oneself where to put a bit of public investment to generate export, on a one to 25 return on investment, one would choose a scheme like this. If any of us as private individuals had an opportunity to put $1 down and get $25 back, we would snap it up. But this government, taking a public policy position, chooses not to go down that route and to reduce the effectiveness of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document before the Senate is one that is for disallowance. The opposition will consider what it will do about this document after it has fully studied it and all of its ramifications. It was tabled today. We have not had an opportunity to look at it until just now. We have 15 days to make up our mind, but we will make up our mind in that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without prejudicing what the conclusion will be from an opposition point of view, can I say, though, that, in the recent Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the export market development scheme, considerable concern was expressed by the business community about the purpose of this document and the regulations it now introduces. It is important to place on the record what were the concerns of Australian business when it looked at the new regulations this government was introducing for export market development grants applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first reservation was that this government had gone to the election, flags flying, promising to reduce the amount of red tape and compliance costs to business, and here they were dramatically increasing it. They were, in fact, flying in the face of one of the solemn vows that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made to the small business constituency on election day; that is, he would reduce red tape. What has to be said, irrespective of the merit of the proposal, is that on the plain face of it this massively increases red tape. It does that on small business, who can ill afford the time that it takes to fill out all the forms necessary to get an entitlement to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> improve the Australian economy and their export performance. That was the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that business made is that there are two ways that governments can go about limiting outlays on a program like this. As we have seen in the budget&mdash;and they were only too accurate in their foreboding about what would occur&mdash;the first way is to reduce the amount of funds available to the scheme, which the budget did. It cut $426 million out of the scheme. The second way is to impose hurdles that make entry and access to the scheme very difficult, if not impossible, so that companies that would normally expect to achieve recognition under the scheme, and thus take advantage of the subsidies, would not be able to get to the scheme at all. Their concern was that, no matter what type of regulations are structured, it will have that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key reasons the government was introducing this test was not only to make firms export-ready&mdash;and I might say that, if it were the only issue here, would be a laudable thing&mdash;but also to impose extra and unnecessary regulation in order to prevent firms getting into the scheme at all. Thus the gnomes and bean counters over at Treasury who are concerned about expenditure at all, irrespective of whether it is in a good or a bad cause, would be happy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a quick look at it in the few minutes available to me. This is not a considered or mature view, but off the top of my head it seems to me that the professionals over at Austrade have again done what one expects to be a professional job. They have consulted exhaustively with industry over the regulations they are now bound by the government, not by their own decision, to introduce on business, and they have seemingly transcribed their brief in a sensitive and responsible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third consideration that industry raised at the Senate hearings is applicable on this point. It is a point that those who have imposed on them the task of drafting regulations always have a problem in interpreting. So it is not a criticism of Austrade to say this. The first point is that, ultimately, any series of regulations like this is intrusive. They want to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3065"> know all of the ins and outs of a company before they would consider making a grant. Some of the things that they ask questions about, you could ask yourself: is that really necessary, and why do they want to know that type of complex detail about a company's books when really the thrust of this should be about export market opportunity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point about it is that at the final point Austrade themselves will be making decisions based on the information provided by the forms that small- and medium-sized business will now have to fill out. What is the knowledge base and market understanding and commercial acumen of a body like Austrade in making business decisions? To use what business said to me, is this an example of putting bureaucrats in charge of riding a shotgun on business about businesses' decision making for commercial purposes? One would have to say that it certainly bears a resemblance to that. Are those bureaucrats, therefore, fit to make those decisions? Business would say no, and I think they have a fair argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without prejudicing what we will finally decide, I think it is important to put those facts down on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> now, because this set of regulations, if it is finally approved, will be what governs the access for first time exporters to the export market development grants scheme.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I move that the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into effect of an agreement negotiated between the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) which was signed on 29 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will insert the text of the agreement into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953. The bill will also make consequential amendments to that act, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983. The consequential amendments to the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 will provide for certain source rules necessary in Australia for the operation of the agreement and for the amendment of previous assessments as a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3066"> consequence of provisions of the agreement having, or being capable of having, retrospective effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983 reflect the fact that the agreement is between trade offices and that, as such, the agreement would not fall within some of the current definitions of "agreement" and "double tax agreement" in those acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has decided to give effect to the undertakings made by the ACIO in the agreement and does so on the understanding that the TECO has received assurances from appropriate authorities of reciprocal tax treatment in Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement paves the way for greater business dealings between Australia and Taiwan. It will significantly enhance the development of our commercial relationship with Taiwan by providing more favourable tax conditions for Australian business operating in Taiwan and by freeing up prospects for investment in both directions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a flourishing economic relationship with Taiwan. The Government is committed to encouraging this relationship to grow still stronger in the future. Taiwan is now our ninth largest trading partner and sixth largest export market. Over the five years to 1994/95, merchandise exports grew by 10.5 per cent per annum. Two&hyphen;way trade totalled A$5.9 billion in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the undertakings in the agreement are that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> income flows between Australia and Taiwan will not be subject to double taxation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> taxing rights over various categories of income flows will be clarified; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> co&hyphen;operation between the respective tax administrations will operate to prevent tax evasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement will have effect in Australia and Taiwan from dates specified in the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shipping and aircraft profits will be taxable solely in the territory in which the operator of the ships or aircraft is resident for tax purposes. This treatment will apply from 1 January 1991 being the date on which approaches were first made on taxing shipping and aircraft operations solely on a residence basis. Income of certain organisations promoting trade, investment and cultural exchanges between Australia and Taiwan will also be taxed solely in the territory whose interests the organisation promotes and this may be from a date earlier than the date of entry into effect of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interest at source will generally be taxed at 10 per cent. Royalties will generally be taxed at source at 12.5 per cent. Taxation of dividends at source will be effectively limited in Australia to 15 per cent on unfranked dividends (with Australia's domestic law <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dividend withholding tax exemption continuing for franked dividends). In Taiwan its tax will be limited to 10 per cent where the Australian company receiving the dividends holds at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company resident in Taiwan, and to 15 per cent in other cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as is customary in agreements of this type, the agreement does not require that the nominated limits apply to dividends, interest or royalties that are effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital gains are to be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each territory but there will be special rules for gains made on the alienation of real property; assets used by permanent establishments; ships; aircraft and shares in companies used principally to hold real estate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business profits derived from one territory by an enterprise of the other territory will be subject to tax to the extent that they are attributable to a "permanent establishment" that the enterprise has in the territory in which the profits are sourced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other income that will be subject to full taxation at source will include income from employment (except in relation to visits of short duration) and income derived by entertainers and athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shipping and aircraft profits derived from international operations; pensions and annuities; and most independent services income will be taxable only in the territory in which the recipient is resident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income which under the agreement remains taxable in both territories will continue to be eligible for tax relief under the general foreign tax systems of the respective territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the terms of the agreement the competent authority for the exchange of information under the agreement and the institution of mutual agreement procedures in Australia is the Commissioner of Taxation, or an authorised representative of the Commissioner. In Taiwan the competent authority is the Director&hyphen;General of the Department of Taxation, or an authorised representative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government of China and acknowledges the position of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan is a province of China. The Government of Australia thus declares that its decision to implement the agreement providing for the Commissioner of Taxation to be the competent authority does not constitute, and should not be interpreted as constituting, an implied or express decision to recognise Taiwan. The Government further declares that any contact necessary between the competent authorities for the implementation of the terms of the agreement is considered functional in nature and hence does not constitute, and should not be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3067"> interpreted as constituting, an implied or express decision to conduct official contacts with Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also note that it is the longstanding practice of the Australian Taxation Office that references in Australia's taxation laws to `country' and `foreign country' have been interpreted as applying to the territory in which the taxation laws administered by the taxation authorities, Taipei apply. The implementation of this agreement will not alter this interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill gives effect to the Government's decision, announced in the context of the June Premiers conference, to remove the wholesale sales tax exemption currently enjoyed by all levels of government in relation to motor vehicles, and parts for those vehicles, provided wholly or partly for private use as part of remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Affected governments and government bodies will no longer be able to acquire sales tax free cars that are to be used, or made available for use, for private purposes by employees with little or no restriction. For example, cars that are typically made available by Governments to Senior Executive Service officers, which those officers are free to use more or less as they please outside working hours, will no longer be able to be acquired free of sales tax by the Government employer. This will be the case whether or not those cars are formally provided as part of a salary package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, cars that are to be used for private purposes infrequently and irregularly, or where the private use is to be restricted to travel between home and the workplace or other travel incidental to the employee's duties, will still be able to be acquired sales tax free. This will cover, for example, most `pool' and government&hyphen;plated cars, where the private uses of the cars are restricted in the ways I have outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The institutions affected by these changes include Commonwealth and State Governments and authorities, State/Territory bodies, local governments, public transport authorities, ATSIC, the Reserve Bank and State libraries, museums and art galleries established in the capital city of a State. Schools, universities, public hospitals and public benevolent institutions will not be affected by these changes. Vehicles that will be affected include motor cars, station wagons, panel vans, utilities and 4WDs, provided they are designed to carry a load of less than one tonne, and motor cycles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes apply to dealings with cars after 3.15 p.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time on 11 June 1996, and are expected to raise additional revenue <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of between $50 million and $100 million in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the taxation and superannuation laws in a number of significant respects. These include giving effect to an election promise by the Government in respect of fringe benefits tax. It will also relieve uncertainty in the business and taxpaying community regarding several measures outstanding from the previous Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Forgiveness of commercial debt</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will introduce new taxation rules relating to the forgiveness of commercial debt. The new measures are based on provisions introduced by the previous Government into the Parliament which lapsed when the Parliament was prorogued prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures I am introducing today depart in several important respects however from those lapsed provisions to take account of public concerns that have been expressed about certain aspects of the lapsed provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will apply to commercial debts forgiven after 27 June 1996, and not from 9 May 1995 which was the proposed commencement date announced by the former Government. Under revised transitional arrangements, if forgiveness occurs after 27 June 1996 pursuant to an agreement or arrangement entered into on or before 27 June the forgiveness will not be affected by the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commercial debt forgiveness provisions will not affect the creditor's taxation entitlements. However, the total amount of debt forgiven in a year of income will be applied to reduce the debtor's entitlement to accumulated deductible losses and other amounts that would otherwise be taken into account in the future in calculating the debtor's taxable income. In certain circumstances, the net forgiven amount of a debtor which is a company will be apportioned among a group of companies related to the debtor company. The measures incorporate rules relating to the forgiveness of debts by a company forming part of a company group. Such provisions, which are anti&hyphen;avoidance in nature, were foreshadowed but not introduced by the former Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forgiveness of commercial debt measures will correct a structural weakness in the present law which does not properly tax the economic benefit to a taxpayer from being forgiven a debt. The present law creates scope for duplication of deductions in circumstances where the creditor would be entitled to tax relief for a loss on a debt that is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3068"> forgiven or otherwise settled for less than full value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding that the act of forgiveness relieves the debtor of the economic loss represented by the debt, tax losses that accumulated before the debt was terminated generally remain available to shield future income from taxation. On occasions, accumulated losses of a corporate debtor have been used to absorb future income after being acquired by new shareholders under arrangements that include the forgiveness of pre&hyphen;existing debts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue from the proposed amendments is $20 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $40 million in 1998&hyphen;99 rising to $130 million by 2003&hyphen;04.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Extended use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains a number of safeguards to meet concerns about the privacy of individuals. The proposed means for TFNs to enter into the superannuation system is by the beneficiary voluntarily quoting the TFN to either the trustee of a fund or the employer who passes it to the fund.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to repeal section 261 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1 July 1988, when the income of superannuation funds and ADFs became taxable, a complying superannuation entity is unable to claim a deduction for expenses that relate to an investment in a pooled superannuation trust, life insurance company or registered organisation. The entity's ability to claim a deduction for expenses incurred as a result of investing in a PST or life policy is limited by the fact that any amount received upon redemption of units in a PST or surrender of a life policy is treated as tax exempt income. By contrast if a superannuation entity had made a direct investment in a product which was taxable in its hands, then it would be allowed a full deduction for its general management expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This treatment is anomalous. Accordingly the measure will apply from 1 July 1988.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate. I also commend to the Senate the explanatory memorandum, which describes the measures in the bill in considerably greater detail.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes amendments to veterans' affairs legislation designed to safeguard the interests of veterans and their families and to minimise the action needed to grant certain claims for pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of the proposed amendments is to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 and ties in with the start of the uniform Consumer Credit Code which all States and Territories are to implement later in the year. This code will apply to credit provided wholly or chiefly for personal, domestic or household purposes by banks and certain other lenders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the code comes into force, people eligible for housing assistance under the Defence Service Homes Scheme will gain consumer rights comparable to those of other borrowers. The amendments in this bill will ensure that they also retain the scheme's benefits. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Westpac Banking Corporation provides subsidised Defence Service Home loans to veterans and other eligible people under an agreement with the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill identifies elements of the code that Westpac should not apply to loans provided under the scheme so as to preserve the scheme's benefits. For example, a veteran's age may affect the chance of obtaining a loan elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the scheme's agreement, the Bank cannot take this into account when deciding whether to provide the veteran with a Defence Service Home loan. The concurrent operation of the Consumer Credit Code will not be limited except for matters set out in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One important aspect of the Consumer Credit Code addressed by the bill is the payment of the loan interest subsidy to Westpac. The Commonwealth now pays this subsidy in advance. In adopting the approach of the Consumer Credit Code, the calculation of interest charged on loans will be linked to unpaid daily balances instead of unpaid monthly balances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new method of calculating interest will be more favourable to borrowers who repay on or before the due dates. It will result in the Commonwealth paying the subsidy to Westpac in arrears. This changeover will result in a one&hyphen;off saving of over four million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second of the proposed measures is an amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. It will mean that a dependant of a veteran, who has died from a disability already accepted as being war&hyphen;caused, will be eligible for a pension without the relationship between the veteran's death and war service having to be re&hyphen;established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an important change and is consistent with the coalition's undertaking before the election to make the system for claiming pension as simple as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any claim for pension for a dependant, made since 1 June 1994, is determined according to Statements of Principles, prepared by the Repatriation Medical Authority, for the kind of death met by the veteran. In many cases this will require additional investigation into the background of the fatal disability to enable the criteria in the Statements of Principles to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This retracing of the war service link is time consuming and often quite complicated, even where the disability had previously been related to the veteran's war service. Sometimes, the war service relationship cannot be re&hyphen;established. This could happen because advances in disease research have changed our understanding of the causes of the disability. It could also occur because of changes in legislation made since the disability was determined to be war related. As a result, a veteran's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3070"> death from a war disability is now no guarantee that his or her dependants will have access to repatriation benefits. This uncertainty is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will do away with these uncertainties, and also the time consuming investigation process. The change will reassure veterans and their families that financial support will continue to be available should the veteran die from a previously accepted war&hyphen;caused disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, Mr President, this is a bill that will preserve the interests of veterans and their families and streamline access to certain benefits.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make just a few remarks in the 10 minutes that I have available today. I will begin by thanking the committee. The committee was put under enormous pressure because of the very short time that we had to get this report completed and presented to this chamber so that we did not hold up the government's legislative process. Therefore, I thank the committee and all the extra people who were called upon to assist us. I also thank the Democrats' staff&mdash;in particular, Victor Franco, who worked with the committee long and hard into the evenings, night after night, weekend after weekend, to make sure we had this report before us and on time today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly outline three of the main recommendations and then go on to discuss some of the issues that came to light during this inquiry. The first recommendation was that Telstra should remain in full public ownership. After looking through the 650 submissions and listening to the more than 130 witnesses who appeared before the inquiry, it became very clear that the government's decision to sell a third of Telstra was driven more by economic fashion than by any economic fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second recommendation was that we should split the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill into two bills. This follows on from something Senator Harradine did in 1995, when he asked for the Human Services and Health Legislation Bill to be split into its two component parts&mdash;one dealing with therapeutic goods and the other dealing with health. The committee argues that this bill should be split into two&mdash;one dealing with the sale and the other dealing with customer service, consumer obligations and a range of other issues that relate to service quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important recommendation concerns the fact that environment programs are too important to be funded from the sale of anything or linked to any other issue. Environment programs should be funded from recurrent expenditure or a percentage of Telstra's profits, rather than relying on the passage of this legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now move on and look at some of the issues that were highlighted in the process of putting together this report&mdash;and the first is privatisation. This is nothing new but, certainly, the degree of angst in the community about the privatisation of this particular asset was something that came to the fore during the hearings. On the question of the worth of Telstra, we also had a range of different views put to us, and we found that the government's value was very much at the bottom of the scale. We heard evidence from Professor John Quiggin, from James Cook University, who said the figure was closer to $54 billion, rather than the $24 billion that the government was looking to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the committee found that arguments for privatisation hinged upon dubious international studies which had little, if any, relevance to Australia's social, economic or geographic conditions. Here, initially, I want to highlight the World Bank study, which was much cited by those who supported the sale. Basically, it did not relate to any major telecommunications company anywhere in the world. I think some 7,000 cases were looked at in the study, and 6,100 of those occurred in Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee came to agree with the Communications Law Centre, which said of the World Bank study that some caution would seem advisable in applying its conditions to the Telstra case. This was highlighted by the particular organisations cited by the study as examples of the benefits accruing from privatisation. These included a near moribund textile company in Niger, a finance company in Swaziland and an agroindustrial enterprise in Mozambique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also cited frequently by those supporting the sale was an example of a successful private telco&mdash;US West. But, again, when we looked at the evidence we found that you really cannot compare US West with Telstra, thanks to a range of issues. These include contracting out, the fact that there are a lot of other small companies involved in that part of America and, in particular, the success or otherwise of US West in its provision of services. Time does not permit me to go <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through and quote anything but a very brief example from a media report in the States, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">US West will have to wait until Monday to learn whether a judge will stop the state from ordering the company to lower phone rates and reduce revenues by $91.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA>I find it amazing that so many of the submissions supporting the sale actually cited this particular company, which employs practices which are far removed from what we would consider to be anything like best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue highlighted was the whole area of downsizing&mdash;although I do note that the original instigator of downsizing recently decided that it was not such a good idea. In looking at what is planned for Telstra and project Mercury, it seems that those who are really going to suffer are the some 24,000 employees who are now identified as expendable in this company's push to become more attractive to those who might be tempted to buy in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, some job losses are expected. New technology will mean that there is a natural process of reduction in the number of people who are required and the different service practices available. Indeed, once the roll&hyphen;out ends, we will also be looking at some job losses. But the scale of the job losses and the reasons for them are highlighted in this report as being a major concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research and development was another area that was highlighted. Our concern is that privatisation, rather than increasing funding to research, will foster a reduction in research expenditure. Before the ink has even dried on our final copies of this report, we have yet another announcement that Telstra is already looking at significantly reducing its commitment to research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that cutting down the TRL from 530 people to 380 by the end of the year is an enormous cut&mdash;the committee was astounded at the size of this cut. It will mean that Telstra's stated aim of being `the leading provider of electronic communications and information services in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and a significant global provider' is a highly questionable aspiration. The cuts are likely to undermine TRL's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3072"> ability to perform long-term strategic research in the national interest; there will be a much reduced research capacity which, if we look at overseas examples, will probably be largely devoted to short-term, commercially focused research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Raised in many of the submissions from consumers, consumer groups and individual members of the public is a range of issues relating to actual provision of adequate services. As I stated before, one of our major findings is that these issues should be dealt with separately from the sale itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look at what exactly is a `local call'. There is no definition anywhere. We have already seen suggestions that perhaps we are looking at reduced sizes of the call zones. While the government may be able to talk about continuing free local calls, we still have no-one saying precisely what is meant by that. Do we, for example, include faxes; and what do we do with Internet services? Consumers are concerned about a range of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major consumer area, of course, is the one of cabling. I find it amazing that the government can stand up in this place and say, `The cabling issue has nothing to do with the sale.' Obviously, that is simply not correct. If we let the telcos go ahead, as they are, stringing cables from tree to tree, pole to pole and putting a major blight on our landscape, that is a lot cheaper than doing what they should be doing, which is going underground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telcos, including Telstra, can be required to go underground, although that will reduce their profits as it is far more expensive to go underground. Therefore, the sale price will be affected, as people will not be able to see the green light for higher and higher profits if they are actually looking at what really are proper planning regulations. I would suggest that the government, by trying to push the area of cabling off the agenda, is really trading off appropriate planning in pursuit of a higher sale price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final area that I just have one minute to deal with quickly is the fact that the government should not even be talking about privatisation at this time. Even most of the submissions from business organisations which talked about supporting privatisation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> questioned why they are doing it now with some six other pieces of legislation before this chamber. The reason given for each of those pieces of legislation having to be dealt with this session is that they have to be through before any shares in Telstra are offered for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment the regime is so uncertain that the government should not even be considering privatisation for at least 18 months from the time of those new regulations coming into place and the new regime being understood. That will be in July of next year. So we are looking right through into 1998 before the government should even be discussing any possibility of selling Telstra.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to take note of the report of the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telstra: to sell or not to sell</EMPHASIS> . On behalf of the opposition, I join with Senator Lees in supporting the majority recommendation in this report that Telstra be maintained in full public ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, in doing so, I would thank the staff of the secretariat for the work they did, whilst under a lot of pressure, in putting together the report and in servicing the committee members&mdash;and they had to service both those committee members who put in the majority report as well as those who put in a minority report based on a dissenting view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I thank my parliamentary Labor colleagues&mdash;Senator Carr, Senator Reynolds and Senator Lundy&mdash;and our staff for the hard work they put in and the resources that we had available to us compared with the resources that the government members had available to them, either informally or formally, with information being provided by government departments. In particular, I want it thank my own staff member Jenny Fox, Matthew Cossey who works for Senator Lundy and Steve Herbert who works for Senator Carr for the very hard work they did in putting together this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All throughout the two&hyphen;month period of this inquiry, I waited for the government to come forward with overwhelming empirical evidence to justify the privatisation of Telstra&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3073">one-third or full privatisation. It did not come through the hearings. I even waited for the handing down of minority report that is now with us&mdash;because as majority members, under standing orders, we did not get access to the minority report until it was tabled today, whereas the minority members do have access to the draft majority report which they comment upon. I again waited, thinking that there may have been something sensational appearing in the minority report to justify the privatisation of Telstra which had not been apparent to those of us in the opposition during all these hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that there has been nothing startling, nothing new, nothing of an empirical basis to justify the privatisation of Telstra. In fact, in the minority report of the government members, they consistently justify their position by quoting either Telstra, the department of communications or the Department of Finance. What they do not point out, of course&mdash;and we accept this&mdash;is that all of those are arms of executive government that directed by policy to provide support for the government's view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be an astonishing position if the secretary to the department of communications were to turn up at a hearing and say, `I disagree with the minister; I do not believe in the privatisation.' He then would have to do the honourable thing and resign. The same applies to Telstra. It is government owned; the shareholder is the government. I would be astonished if Frank Blount and Telstra's senior executives had turned up and said, `We don't favour the privatisation of Telstra.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, if government changes, I would expect those government departments and Telstra to fully support the policy of the elected government of the day&mdash;and that is the way it should be. To have the minority report of the government members overwhelmingly relying on their own government departments for justification is no independent evidence at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was astonishing was the fact that all these government departments&mdash;and, therefore, the government&mdash;relied on a World Bank report and one other report to justify the privatisation of Telstra. The majority report <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> points out the stupidity of relying on such a report. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be interested to hear that the World Bank report quotes 6,000 examples of privatisation. They did not tell us initially that, of the 6,000 examples of privatisation, 4,000 were from the old East Germany when they were privatising corner stores that were going broke and 2,000 were from companies going broke in the Third World. Out of the 6,000, only 180 came from the First World or the OECD and, of those 180, only one was a telco, that is, British Telecom when it was privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we examined the privatisation of British Telecom we found that the private sector made quite a killing but, on balance, it is probable that local domestic consumers took a loss&mdash;prices went up. In fact, in some cases there had to be re&hyphen;regulation so as to ensure that standards of service were maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even those in favour of one&hyphen;third or full privatisation said the biggest improvement in customer service and efficiency in Australia has come from competition, a model we have had working since 1992. I emphasise, competition has been the overwhelming driving force for benefits in consumer service and lowering prices in Australia, not privatisation. Companies which are in favour of privatisation, like BZW, point out that the privatisation may add a little bit more but competition is the main driving force for improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We asked the government to provide us with examples, once competition is separated out, of what privatisation provides. To our astonishment, the Department of Communications and the Arts went away and came back some weeks later saying they had found two examples: two electricity companies in Chile in the early 1980s at the height of the Pinochet regime&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, you were relying on it. That was the only case you could give us, Senator Tierney: Pinochet in Chile and two electricity companies which were loosing money and being privatised. Of course, at the height of the Pinochet regime its abuse of workers and ordinary citizens is well known. Read any Amnesty International report about the abuse of human rights in Chile under Pinochet. That was the only example they could give. It is speculated that, in the next couple of weeks, the publicly declared profit for Telstra will be the biggest profit in Australia's history for a publicly owned company. All the examples in the World Bank report are of companies that were going broke and having to be propped up and subsidised by taxpayers. Telstra is making a substantial profit. It does not have to be propped up and subsidised by the Australian taxpayer. The economic justification is just not there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reports quote a Polish lime and cement company and a Mozambique agrocompany. Of all the reports which Telstra listed, the one that I found most astonishing quoted Haiti as an example of what we should be taking account of. I know Haiti is the home of the voodoo followers of the world, but it really is getting a bit much for the government to quote privatisation in Haiti as an example for privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee report also has a major chapter on employment. I am sure my colleague Senator Carr will speak on this at some length. We found that, after the government changed, Telstra commissioned project Mercury to look at getting rid of jobs in Telstra. How many jobs? Over the next three years, 24,000 to 26,000. One&hyphen;third of the jobs in Telstra would go to make the company ready for privatisation and more profitable and advantageous for the private sector. As we found in the report, those jobs will overwhelmingly go from rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing is certain: if you privatise Telstra, Australia will not get equal access to a broadband telecommunications system serving all Australians in urban and regional Australia. Telstra, Optus and other carriers will not put <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the money into places such as rural Queensland, rural South Australia or Tasmania because they are not profitable. If people want an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date, 21st century telecommunications system, Telstra must be publicly owned so that it can be directed by the government to provide an equal and open system for all Australians, not just for those who are rich enough to pay for it or who live in certain suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. That is the real issue here.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government senators who participated in this inquiry strongly recommend that the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 be passed by the Senate in its present form. We reject the key recommendations that have just been outlined by the combined opposition parties that Telstra remain in full public ownership, that the bill be split and that the $1 billion environment package be funded from other sources. The government members of the committee concluded, on the evidence given at the hearings, that the passage of this bill for the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra to the public is absolutely in the best interests of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The integrity of this inquiry into the part-privatisation of Telstra has been compromised severely by the ALP and the Australian Democrats right from the beginning. They sent the matter to the references committee, not to the legislation committee, so that the opposition could have the majority. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate announced on day one that the Labor Party would vote against the Telstra bill anyway, so what was the point of having an inquiry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry was also compromised by the throwing together of a grab bag of unrelated issues in its terms of reference. Sixty per cent of the submissions, for example, actually dealt with overhead cabling, not with the core matter of the inquiry, which was really the Telstra bill, which should have gone to the government committee. The game is given away by the title of the report that was tabled&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telstra: to sell or not to sell</EMPHASIS>. That is what the inquiry was really all about and that is why it should have gone to a government committee. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3075">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This inquiry was held at a time when there is an international revolution going on in telecommunications. Telecommunications is undergoing dramatic change worldwide. To successfully adapt to what is happening, Telstra must undergo many changes. Markets that have previously been dominated by government monopolies are being opened up worldwide to full competition. Government owned telcos are being privatised, including those in Albania and Cuba&mdash;the old bastions of communism. The new open telecommunications market is deriving enormous benefits to consumers in these other countries with a fall in prices and a sharp improvement in services. There are measurable improvements in overseas examples that we saw in the range and quality of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full public ownership of Telstra is like tying one hand behind our main telco's back in the race to adapt to this new open marketplace. Partial privatisation can only provide the framework for Telstra to operate successfully in the new competitive market. The partial sale can be conducted to protect taxpayers' interests, to preserve and enhance consumer protection and, in particular, the universal service obligation, and advance Australia's overall economic and social prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me canvass the basic case for partial privatisation of Telstra, as set out in the government's report. Firstly, it will make Telstra more efficient. Greater efficiencies will improve the equality and reduce the costs of telecommunications services to all Australians. Telstra admitted in the hearings on a number of occasions that it was 25 per cent below world benchmark practice. It acknowledges that it can actually improve its performance, given the benefit of privatisation, by at least 40 per cent. Just say that the efficiency gain was 30 per cent, it would realise savings to Australians of $1.6 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra would boost economic activity and employment levels in rural and regional Australia by reducing the cost of telecommunications in country areas. As the costs reduce, the scope for job creation increases. We have seen many cases of overseas countries taking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advantage of this new regime in country areas by setting up things such as inquiry centres for banks and company service centres and catalogue sales. Tele&hyphen;industries for bookings in hotels, airlines, reservations, insurance and car rental firms are always assisted in the overseas examples by the part&hyphen;privatisation, leading to greater efficiency and lower costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sort of change will have a very positive impact on employment in the telecommunications industry and the other user supplier groups. This will more than offset&mdash;I think this is a very crucial point&mdash;the claimed job cuts in Telstra. Employment changes in Telstra that have taken place between 1986 and 1996 have largely been driven by changes in technology, not by any move to part&hyphen;privatisation. Mr McLean, the Branch Secretary of the Queensland Communications Division of the CEPU, admitted as much in his evidence. Allan Horsley, from the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, ATUG, gave evidence that members of his industry group face a desperate shortage of suitably qualified employees. With job shortages and staff redeployment from Telstra because of technological change, they will have no trouble finding another job in the telecommunications industry, particularly as the industry is now growing at 18 per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite various wild charges, the government is delivering on putting in place world-class consumer protection in this partly privatised arrangement. The USOs and consumer service guarantees are firmly entrenched in the Telecommunications Act. They are not diminished or affected in any way by this bill. Telstra's obligations to consumers are not diluted by part&hyphen;privatisation. Ownership of Telstra has no bearing on the government's commitment to universal service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides new benefits to business with a guarantee of no timed local calls. This was not previously provided under the old legislation. Public ownership is not necessary to guarantee Australians adequate access to telecommunications services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill in no way affects the existing legislation and other protections to things <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3076"> such as directory assistance, untimed local calls and the provision of public telephones across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now finally turn to the quality of the opposition parties' majority report. We are very surprised&mdash;in fact, we are not so surprised; we are probably more disappointed&mdash;about the very poor quality of this document. It simply does not reflect the weight of evidence given in the inquiry, which clearly favoured the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra. It is intellectually dishonest. The majority report ignores the evidence to produce a pre-determined majority recommendation that the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra be opposed. Nobody in Australia has been sweating on the delivery of this report. The result was well known before we started the inquiry process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This inquiry has been a total waste of taxpayers' dollars. In reality, the inquiry discovered that there was no significant community concern about the core issues raised by the partial sale of Telstra. The number of hearing dates was cut by 50 per cent when substantial submissions failed to arrive at the secretariat. There was only one regional hearing, which was in Townsville, and that only concerned two people, who were university academics. They were the only ones who came out in the whole of northern Queensland to speak to us and to give us some evidence, which was later discredited. That was $25,000 wasted on that day's hearing. It went for two hours, so that hearing cost $12,500 an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other disappointing thing about the submissions was their length. Some were often just one page. A lot of them were poorly presented and were based on hearsay, not on facts. But a substantial number of submissions expressed support for the part privatisation of Telstra, including a number from rural and regional Australia. The NFF survey found that 64.4 per cent of people in the country areas answered yes to the question: `Do you think the part privatisation of Telstra is a good idea?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the majority report is flawed in a number of other ways. It relies on fear and misinformation. It makes continued reference to full privatisation when the bill is only for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> part privatisation. The majority report is a document of lamentably low quality. The outline of it and its findings, we believe, should be rejected by the Senate, particularly in light of the very expert witnesses whom we had from Communications and the Arts, Finance and Telstra&mdash;all of whom commend the benefits of the part privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the Senate. I have only had this report in my hands for some 30 minutes and my remarks will be preliminary only. Naturally they will relate to the issues I have publicly stated are of concern to me in respect of this matter. It is clear that the government intends that it will issue shares to the public for the sale of a third of Telstra. What also has emerged from today is that it intends to do this to ensure that there will be an amount of $1.5 billion for the Natural Heritage Trust. The residue, which is assumed to be about $7 billion, will be used to pay off debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had to take those matters into consideration and to consider the various statements made by the government on their face value. Areas of great interest to me are whether state-of-the art communications technologies can be guaranteed to regional Australia, including to my state of Tasmania, either by revised universal service obligations or in some other way and whether Tasmania's natural heritage pre-eminence would be recognised in the disbursement of funds from the Natural Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the latter matter I notice that the report says that funding of the Natural Heritage Trust should be made out of consolidated revenue or in some other way, including the use of some of Telstra's profits. I have heard the arguments put forward by the Democrats in respect of the latter matter but you would not immediately get the sums of money in that way that you would need to sustain the Natural Heritage Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter is state-of-the-art technology for regional and rural Australia. That <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3077"> matter is partly dealt with in this document. It concerns me considerably that, because there is considerable cross-subsidisation, this may, certainly under full sale but also under partial sale of Telstra, cause a decline in services to rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that this is already happening to a certain extent. The intention of Telstra prior to the decision of the then opposition taken to the people of Australia at the election, as I understand it, was that it would not roll out broad cables to provide top quality broadband services to my state. That is a matter of great concern. That is a matter we ought to be looking at. I will certainly be looking at the matter that has been raised in the report as to whether we can tighten up the legislation, whether or not the third sale goes ahead, to ensure that top quality state-of-the-art technology is provided to regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obligation should fall not only on Telstra but also on the other communications companies. It seems to me that ever since the competition policy was pushed through the Labor Party's federal conference in 1990 or 1991&mdash;I think it was 1990&mdash;there has been unfair treatment of Telstra to the benefit of the so&hyphen;called competitor. That is something that we have got to be very concerned with. What has happened, of course, is that a situation has developed in Australia whereby there has been a duplication of cables from Cairns to Perth with something like $8 billion of wasted money. That is a matter of some concern. Even Professor Bob Officer at the National Press Club had something to say about that today. As you know, he is the Chairman of the National Commission of Audit and he expressed his concern about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report does advert to that and I am glad that it does, because it is something that we should be looking at: it is something that the government should be looking at and it is something that we in the parliament should be looking at. If there is this tremendous waste of money in this area then we should be looking at it. Furthermore, let me say this: the previous government&mdash;as members of the previous government would know&mdash;has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reaping millions of dollars out of Telstra in a number of ways, and that is by the recall of debt and by the enormous dividends that it has received from Telstra. This has been going on and perhaps it may have affected the decision of Telstra not to extend the laying of cables which would give further access in Australia to state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art broadband technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that I did not see in this report&mdash;I must say that I have only had it very briefly&mdash;was the issue that I in fact raised with Senator Alston, that is, the disadvantage that Telstra has in respect of its structure. I will quote what I said to Senator Alston:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has been overlooked in the public debate over corporatisation of so&hyphen;called business enterprises at Treasury level is that the playing field is essentially not level. Government&hyphen;owned companies such as Telstra are subject to company tax but do not have shareholders who can make use of the dividend franking tax credits in respect of the company tax they pay.</PARA>
<PARA>Telstra is disadvantaged. One argument that the government members could have used is that, presumably, if there is an issue of shares&mdash;in my view, they should be looking at this question of the issue of redeemable preference shares&mdash;in that particular case you would be able to take advantage of the tax system and there would be less advantage to Telstra's competitor. What does concern me is that that particular issue does not seem to have been looked at by the committee, and I believe that it should be looked at. I will study this document further and I hope that I can enter into the debate more fully informed later on.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three major areas of regulation over the impact of airports contained in this bill. The first area is the master plan&mdash;a 20&hyphen;year plan for airport development, renewed every five years. The second area is the development plans which are specific to each major development, and the requirements relating to these are found in part 5, divisions 3 and 4 respectively. The third area of regulation is found in part 6 which specifies requirements for an environment strategy to cover a five&hyphen;year period to be broken into 12&hyphen;month chunks for management plans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendments are intended to strengthen or clarify these areas. These amendments are to include a requirement in the master plan that the lessee should not only note the problems their plan creates in relation to noise and to environmental impact, but should also say what, if anything, they propose to do about the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that it is appropriate that these things be included in the document when the document goes before the minister for approval. Both the master plan and the environmental strategy are submitted for periods of five years, yet there is not a requirement for the timing to be the same. There are requirements to make replacement plans but, in the absence of approvals, the old plan simply remains in force. This could lead to alterations and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impacts to be permitted without a synchronicity about how to manage such impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment plan, by limiting impacts to the airport site itself, may also not be as broad as the requirements for the master plan are clearly designed to be. There is also some compliance requirement regarding the master plan in section 76 which requires notification of the minister if the achievement of elements in the master plan fall into doubt. But there is no requirement or penalty for non&hyphen;compliance with the environmental strategy and no requirement for notification if achievement of elements of this plan are in doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inclusion of a requirement to state how the noted impacts will be managed will at least result in notification of the minister if the lessee is likely to fail to manage them. It is not much good saying, `We have a problem,' if we have no requirement that the lessee be required to fix them. It seems that, at the very least, when a minister is considering a master plan containing notice of an environmental impact, including off&hyphen;site impacts, there should be an environmental management plan and it should be considered an integral part of the plan since approval of the plan should be contingent on proper environmental management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The noise issue is currently not very straightforward. There is a requirement to include forecasts of noise impacts, but there are not any real specifications about what noise impacts are significant or regarding the management of noise impacts. There is not really even a firm definition of what is meant by forecasts. This may simply be a general average level of noise unless lessees are required to do more detailed profiles of how different areas will be affected: the likely noise exposure and the timing of such exposure, whether there is a variation expected with weather or wind pattern and what such variation is likely to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that prevailing wind patterns and traffic patterns change annually, as well as diurnally, a detailed profile would really be needed if a prediction of likely objectionable or serious noise impacts is to be derived. There is some potential, within the scope of regulations, for requirements of forecasts to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3079"> be specified under 61(4). There is no certainty they will be. It remains optional and I do not think this is satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By requiring the lessee to specify which areas would experience what noise levels and what, if anything, they would do about noise levels of over 20 ANEF&mdash;or over 25 ANEF or 30 ANEF if the Senate will not support the lower noise thresholds from my next amendments&mdash;the lessee is obliged to give some detail of areas of exposure to level of noise and to provide profiles. A sound of 80 decibels corresponds to the maximum acceptable figure provided as an external sound level from aircraft for the vicinity of dwellings within Australian Standard 2021 in table F1. This is a level slightly lower than the national industrial health standard for harmful noise, set at 85 decibels. If sound is close to the level at which a worker in a machine shop would be required to use hearing protection, it is certainly worth noting what, if anything, will be done when we are exposing householders and their children to these noise levels on anything but an infrequent basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, 85 decibels is sufficient to cause unacceptable levels of hearing damage. In New South Wales, occupational health authorities noted 6,000 cases of industrial deafness in 1986, and this is not acceptable. Aside from the effect on the quality of life, it also imposed a financial cost on the community of about $70 million in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to realise that the people most likely to be affected are children playing in yards and that the personal impact of so&hyphen;called industrial impact is likely to be life long. Let me give you some idea of this. One of my staff is affected by industrial deafness. His hearing is damaged in certain ranges of sound, so he cannot hear the normal range of voice. In a quiet room, he can make out conversation but, in a group or a conference or anywhere there is background noise, conversational speech becomes difficult or impossible to follow. A hearing aid which amplifies some frequencies selectively helps but will always tend to amplify background noise along with the desired sound.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that if children playing in their yards are affected, they will not be able to properly hear their teachers in an average classroom. They will always be at a disadvantage in a group, at a lecture, at a party. They will be unable to hear a loved one whispering something sweet into their ears. It is children perhaps more than adults who will be affected by this noise and they will pay for the outcomes through their entire lives. It will impose indirect costs due to lost productivity and reduced educational potential and a personal cost due to lack of social function and aspects of intimacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A noise level of 80 decibels occurring two or three times a day should not necessarily trigger a building insulation program. This is why the ANEF figures are used. ANEF noise levels relate to both the intensity and the frequency of aircraft noise, as well as factoring in things like time of day. ANEF levels are the standard means of measuring aircraft noise impacts. AS2021 standards set land use planning guidelines down to 20 ANEF levels. I think this is an appropriate level, but I have specified that remediation should take place where significant ANEF levels occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the next amendments I will put later, I will ask the Senate what it accepts as a definition of this term. In the meantime, it is enough to establish that something must be done when a significant level is reached. What my amendment here says is that, where there is such a cost likely to be imposed on a community, its people and children, note should be taken and some explanation of what will or will not be done should be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I specifically requested that, in addressing the noise problem, explicit attention be paid to how the internal sound level is to be kept to the AS2021 standard for noise insulation in relation to aircraft noise. This standard states that the noise levels from aircraft flights should not rise above 60 decibels in residences. I understand that the same standard specifies that the maximum noise level for a bedroom during a plane flyover is 50 decibels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Australian standards mean anything, then there is a substantial requirement for noise insulation in many residences. How this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3080"> will be met deserves consideration when a lessee puts forward their plans. Basically, what we are saying is that there needs to be a clear understanding of what level of noise needs to be taken into consideration and given attention. There are standards that are clearly set out and it is time we were prepared to admit to those standards. If that increases the cost of airports, then that in fact is the cost of airports and that is the cost to the community. We all gain from the benefits of airports in some way, and the community must therefore be part of that solution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>This amendment sets out the definition for `significant ANEF levels' in our other amendments. I have asked in this amendment for any projected noise exposure over 20 ANEF levels to be addressed. I further point out that often the noise level from overhead planes is significantly greater than this. I understand that within two kilometres of the runway the noise level of a jumbo jet is likely to exceed 100 decibels, roughly equivalent to putting your ear next to a jackhammer. Of course, that is something not many people would volunteer to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the mornings particularly, planes may pass overhead every two or three minutes. We are talking about significant noise exposure in many cases. The National Acoustic Laboratories did testing on the noise impacts of various ANEF levels. Starting at 15 ANEF, the NAL found that about one-third, or 33 per cent, of residents were moderately affected by this noise while half were moderately affected by 20 ANEF. It is worth reading now how ANL defined moderately affected. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A majority of those described as moderately affected cited three activities disturbed by aircraft noise and most rated their neighbourhoods as bad for noise and report that the noise causes their houses to vibrate or shake.</PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned, this situation applies for a third of the people in the 15 ANEF profile and about half of those in the 20 ANEF profile in the general study. In the Sydney area, however, the third runway draft EIS stated at figure 22.1 that over half the people in the 15 ANEF profile for this would be moderately affected. Their houses would shake, activities would be disturbed and aircraft noise would be their most significant neighbourhood problem. I think it is impossible to claim that the noise impact for such people is negligible. If it is not negligible, something needs to be done and this is what we are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment would set 20 ANEF as a significant ANEF level, but there are strong arguments for it to be even lower, perhaps to 15 ANEF. I strongly suggest that the 20 ANEF level, if supported, be seen as an interim measure and that the fairly compelling argument for dropping that even further, to 15 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3081"> ANEF, should be examined as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I noted previously, the AS2021 standard set land use planning guidelines for noise exposure down to the 20 ANEF level. Currently, the government takes some action in insulating houses where the noise exposure exceeds 30 ANEF levels, yet there are many houses where residents experience what they consider significant impacts who do not live in a 30 ANEF profile. Areas near the flight path and directly under the incoming flight paths may be in the 20 to 25 ANEF profiles but they are having planes fly overhead or a bit to the side every few minutes during the prime breakfast time, after 7.30 a.m. This continues until about 9 a.m., then slackens off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the evening there is an evening rush with fly&hyphen;bys and flyovers every few minutes from 6.30 p.m., so through dinner and the late evening, to 9 p.m. or later. This is exposure of 22 or 23 ANEF. The noise of the planes is sufficient to interrupt phone conversation in the house. It interrupts dinner conversation. It interrupts television or radio news and it occurs every few minutes during the prime period when working people and children are at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true: it does not continue at that level through the midday period. It is true: it does not continue at that level all night. It has a significant impact however on people's lives. The distance between the 30 ANEF profile, the 25 ANEF profile and the 20 ANEF profile in an area like Leichhardt can be only a few blocks. We are not talking about the whole of metropolitan Sydney. An extension of management programs to houses in the 20 ANEF level would triple the current Sydney program, according to advice from the minister's office. But the current program is not considered adequate by the people who live near the flight path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While remediation is a great difficulty, we are concerned that new developments, both urban developments and airport developments, should occur in a context in which the projected noise situation is clear as far into the future as possible. Building codes and standards can be set for new dwellings requiring <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> noise insulation from the outset. Airport developments in many cities allow take-off and landing to be directed over water minimising noise impact. But for forward planning purposes, it is crucial that plans and projections be made clear and well in advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that based on the Sydney experience a 20 ANEF level causes a significant human impact. It does affect people now. It is likely to cause physical harm over time. At such noise level the activities of children playing in a yard or someone gardening all become high risk activities in terms of permanent hearing damage to say nothing of the general impact on health or such levels of stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, by setting a level of 20 ANEF you actually provide a means by which there is, if you like, a graduated means of dealing with that. There are some people for whom this is obviously a very high noise level and there are other people who might be just above that level. There is a means of dealing with that that relates to the actual noise and harm caused by that level of disturbance. I commend this amendment to the chamber and ask the chamber to support 20 ANEF as a significant level.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on this amendment as proposed by Senator Margetts, which would impose a very significant ANEF noise level if the measurement is taken at the 20 ANEF level. The government will certainly be opposing this proposed amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When taken with other amendments to be moved by Senator Margetts, this amendment would create expectations of potential acoustic insulation treatment of buildings over an unreasonably wide area. I heard Senator Margetts refer to the area around Leichhardt where she obviously wanted to move the areas just by several streets, but let me point out and illustrate that the number of people living within the current 20 ANEF zone around Sydney airport is estimated to be between 75,000 and 100,000. If all the residences and public buildings were to receive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3082"> acoustic insulation the cost would be likely to run to between $1 billion and $2 billion, which would need to be passed on to the travelling public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party established, and we agree with the policy, that it is not the airport operator that pays for noise but the airline. We need to avoid placing a burden on a party that cannot control it. I am sure that Senator Newman, who is sitting here with me this evening, would be horrified to learn of this figure of $1 billion to $2 billion that would be required for the insulation material at a time when the needs of both public housing and the wider community just cannot be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A general policy of acoustic insulation of buildings to the 20 ANEF contour has no precedence at major airports elsewhere in the world. The overall level of aircraft noise experienced by the population and the 20 ANEF contour is not out of line with the levels of noise which the population at large experiences from other sources. For example, OECD figures suggest that 46 per cent of the Australian population are exposed to road transport noise equivalent to the 20 ANEF measure. For that reason, I think it is important that this amendment be not supported.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I have had reason to speak on these issues on three previous occasions. The first occasion was when six coalition members missed a division. I think it was on an education bill. It was 8.30 at night and people were still in the dining room. On that occasion, the six senators gave an explanation as to why they missed the division. They did not explain why I started 30 yards behind them and finished 50 yards in front of them. Nevertheless, we took the attitude then that this chamber should represent the will of the people, if you like, and misadventure in a division should not change legislation, even if the misadventure was due to stupidity or lack of organisation et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was given great reason to regret that decision when, a few months later, through poor organisation and stupidity, the then Labor government failed on a clause&mdash;a crucial clause, as I understand it&mdash;in the industrial relations legislation. We sought to have the matter recommitted. We sought to cite the previous example when we recommitted, and we were extended no courtesy at all. From my memory, it took us two hours and 12 divisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me record, for the first time, why we in fact won those 12 divisions. We won them because the opposition whip, Senator Reid, on a matter of principle&mdash;and I do not think with reference to party leadership or anything else&mdash;paired this Senate to a point where we could win those 12 divisions. I do not know whether that has ever been recorded. It was her view, long before she became President, that the will of the Senate should prevail and not misadventure. Having gone through all of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3085"> that, I remember saying at the time, `Well I hope this doesn't come up again.'</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it did. Senator Teague missed a critical division. We must be mugs. Again, we said `No, we won't force you into 12 divisions. We will, in fact, recommit it.' This place does operate on convention. If I am just getting up to say, `I told you so', well, I am. Therefore, it should be understood that, if the opposition says that this should be recommitted because the will of the Senate was not properly there, it should be a courtesy extended just as a general principle, retaining of course that little bit of embarrassment for the senator who misses&mdash;they have to come in and explain why they missed. That is part of the price you pay for missing a division.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My leader may have other things to add to it, but I just make that point. If it does become an established convention that people miss a division through misadventure, then in fact, there would be a courtesy granted to all sides. We went through terrible times with those 12 divisions. I could be wrong but I am sure it took us about 12 divisions with contingent notices of motion coming out of our ears to actually get it through. Again, I say, had we actually voted strictly on who was here at that time, we would have lost those 12 divisions. I think Senator Reid granted up to eight pairs before we could get over the top and actually win the 12 divisions, much to her credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is my experience as a previous Manager of Government Business. This place does not just operate on standing orders. It does not always operate on courtesy and there is no greater transgressor in this chamber than me. This place does operate on convention and, if we are establishing that convention tonight by saying, `Yes, you can recommit the clause', then indeed it should apply to everyone in future, Mr Chairman.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I might say that, for this particular division, I was paired, so I was not in the chamber at the time. I am recorded as being paired on the division lists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3086"> Let me say that I think there are a number of principles involved in this matter. The first, and I think the most important, is really proper process in the Senate. I think it is possible that throughout the life of this parlia ment&mdash;given the nature of the balance in this chamber and given that we are all aware that a number of votes will be tight and close, whatever they may be in relation to&mdash;this may not be the only time we will have to deal with an issue such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What ought to be said of course is that, in terms of this particular parliament, we are about to establish a precedent as to how this issue is dealt with. As I understand it, Senator O'Chee is indicating to the Senate that he missed this division inadvertently. The Senate has two choices. It can either accept that explanation from Senator O'Chee&mdash;that is, accept his word on this matter&mdash;or reject it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that, when a senator makes that sort of declaration and explanation to the Senate, the Senate ought to accept the word of the senator. We can establish at a later stage&mdash;through perhaps the process that you have indicated, Mr Chairman, or through some other process&mdash;whether or not the bells rang in the press gallery. We have a situation where a senator has come into this chamber and indicated that, inadvertently, he missed a division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that my mind quickly goes back to a long debate we had in this chamber in the first sitting week of this session in relation to the granting of pairs in the ballots for the positions of President and Deputy President. There was much talk about proper process. I indicated at that time what the view of the Labor Party was and always had been. I would refer interested senators to a notice of motion I gave today which outlined one of the very clear precedents in relation to that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the Labor opposition takes the view in these matters that proper process and the will of the Senate is fundamental. We do not believe that there is a necessity for us to assist Senator O'Chee, even though we have been forced because of a number of experiences in recent parliaments, into a longwinded process and basically an enormous waste of time to establish what would have been the will of the majority of the Senate.</PARA>

When we talk about polluter-pays, the industry gains the benefits from the subsidy that the community otherwise has to pay. In this case we realised that it was only a partial repayment of the subsidy. As was admitted, there would be people receiving an reasonable amount of noise who would be uncompensated under that measure because it was only a part way measure. Even so, it was considered not to be reasonable to ask for a users-pays or a polluter-pays principle, which is an important principle for ecologically and socially sustainable economics.

<PARA>I apologise for the lateness of this amendment, but with a lot of work and few staff it is difficult to operate at the same speed as a full party would. This change was requested by a number of members of the community who felt that we must not deal in this bill only with the current Federal Airports Corporation airports that exist, but that we also need to refer to those airports which may exist in the future. Therefore, we have asked to be inserted into clause 14 a provision that, if the airport is Sydney West Airport, an inquiry under section 11 of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1944 be conducted in respect of all of the environmental aspects of the site selection and proposed operation of Sydney West Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recognition of the fact that there are other states where future Commonwealth airports not only may be considered but also may be under consideration now, we also included `if the airport is any other new or proposed Commonwealth airport'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be strongly opposing this amendment. I must say that we are in the same position as the government on this in terms of the late advice that we have had on it. I believe that Senator Margetts will acknowledge the cooperation we have extended in respect of a whole raft of other amendments that she has moved and which we have supported, but we certainly will be parting company on this one.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The major reason, I might add, is that, should the amendment be carried, it will have the effect of significantly delaying the construction of the much needed airport in the Sydney basin. It has to be built.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I might add that there is also a noise factor associated with this matter and, in respect of the people currently using the existing airport, the sheer capacity problems of the airport are going to be interfered with. It would be irresponsible&mdash;I have to say I do not think on this occasion the word is misused&mdash;for senators to support this amendment, because there is, as Senator Margetts is well aware as a frequent user of the airport, a noise problem as well in terms of Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of capacity also eventually impacts on the question of safety. There is a real safety problem in delaying for any undue length of time any process that would get a second airport built to cater for the needs of Australia. That is what we are talking about: it is a fact that that airport is the major gateway into this country. It is an airport the operations of which interact with every other major airport in this country. It is an Australian national benefit that will come from constructing the second airport: it will not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> simply be a benefit for the residents of Sydney or, indeed, even for the residents of New South Wales. We are rapidly running out of time in terms of delaying the construction any longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts might be in a position to clarify this, but my understanding is that this proposal has, in fact, emanated from people who are concerned about Holsworthy. I do not know if that is correct or not, but the reason I raise that point is to make it absolutely crystal clear that the firm position of the opposition is that Badgerys Creek should be the site of the airport; Sydney West is where the airport should go. With the problems that we know exist, any suggestion that the airport should go to Holsworthy would, in our view, simply have the effect at the end of the day of being ruled out at the end of such an examination. It would potentially again delay the process by which this major undertaking has to be completed&mdash;and major undertaking it is. I am indicating that we are strongly opposing this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collins for his clarification of the opposition's position. There is, obviously, concern among the community, whichever part of Sydney people live in&mdash;and I must say in other states as well, because the proposals for new airports are not confined to New South Wales. There are proposals in all states and potential problems, even in Western Australia. I am sure this is the case in all states where new airports are being proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems that I have heard from the people under the flight path of the current Sydney airport relate to what they believe were poor planning processes. I understand the nature of the pressure that Senator Collins referred to in relation to getting a quick decision, but it seems to me that he expressed a preference for one airport over another. That is fine except that the community has the right to make sure that those decisions are made not on any political basis but on proper, sound decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are asking for is that a proper inquiry take place so the community can feel that all the aspects have been opened out to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3092"> them and that the decisions that were made were not simply political decisions but decisions made on the best advice, environmentally and socially, and that all of the processes have been followed correctly. If that is a terrible thing, you have to refer back to the fact that we have had an amendment knocked out&mdash;the previous amendment which said 25 ANEF was an unreasonable amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, if the argument was that 25 ANEF was an unreasonably low amount and that 20 ANEF was out of the question, we have a situation where the dollar is ruling and that decisions are not being made for necessarily environmental reasons. They are being made on the basis of prospective costs. More than that, the conflict of interest involved is one of prospective sale price for the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that, if you require substantial public input, we have a delay&mdash;a delay which perhaps could be dealt with slightly if we increased the cost to passengers for using Sydney. If it is going to be a severe inconvenience for Sydney passengers to pay an extra $3.60 per passenger, perhaps they will do what I and some other senators do&mdash;that is, try to avoid flying through Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On two occasions in the recent past I have used the train from Sydney to Canberra when I had the time to do that. On other occasions I have tried my best to fly through Adelaide or Melbourne so I would not put that extra pressure on Sydney. It is only when I have to go to a meeting in Sydney that I cannot avoid putting extra pressure on the Sydney community. I wonder whether other people think the same. Would it have been too much of an expense? Would people's travel have been changed? If not, that was not an unreasonable thing to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to be somewhat hypocritical if, having refused an extra cost impost of $3.60 per passenger, we now say that it is absolutely imperative&mdash;as Senator Collins said&mdash;because of this increasing demand for Sydney airport that we make an immediate and fast decision as to where the next airport will be. It seems that nothing has been learnt. If what we are saying is that a fast planning process is a good planning process, nothing out of all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this argument in relation to Sydney airport has been learnt. All of the assurances about the best environmental processes are worth nothing if we have no assurances that any future site selection will be subject to the highest level of scrutiny and public input.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME>
<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.29 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to address the Senate on a matter which has been of longstanding interest and involves the royal commission in Western Australia which is currently investigating a variety of matters surrounding the City of Wanneroo. On Tuesday, 3 September of this year, that royal commission released its first interim report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say at the outset that that report cleared the names of the Hon. Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services in Western Australia, and her husband, Colin Edwardes. The findings of Royal Commissioner Davis show the allegations levelled at Mr and Mrs Edwardes to be totally unsubstantiated. The Leader of the Opposition, Jim McGinty, and the member for Peel, Norm Marlborough, based their claims against Mrs Edwardes and her husband on information passed to them by, among others, justice ministry employee Mr Barry Corse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while to note that in the course of its findings the commission referred to a meeting which was organised at the Armadale lockup by Ms Diane Rowe, a trade union official and ALP state executive member in July 1994, between Mr Corse and a former Wanneroo city councillor and convicted informant David King. In the interim report Commissioner Davis found that Ms Rowe was described by Mr Corse as `Jim McGinty's lieutenant'. Commissioner Davis said in his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The verifiable facts surrounding Ms Rowe's participation in the Corse interview strongly point to a deliberate exercise planned by a politically committed person to embarrass those of the opposite political persuasion from herself. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Jim McGinty, the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, seized upon his `lieutenant's' information and thought he could make political mileage out of it. It just shows how desperate the opposition in Western Australia has become if it chooses to attack a minister of the state with little more than lies, innuendo and gossip. The allegations by Mr McGinty and Mr Marlborough in relation to Cheryl Edwardes and her husband are without fact. There was no evidence to  support any of their allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commissioner has been justifiably critical of those who have been guilty of peddling those unsubstantiated rumours. Firstly, there was Labor's suggestion that an audio tape existed on which Mrs Edwardes's voice could be heard discussing the exchange of money or a bribe. Despite 21 officers of the internal affairs unit having been questioned, there is no evidence of such a conversation. Then there are the allegations made by David King. His evidence to the commission shows there were no facts to support his allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 May 1996, under examination, Mr King was forced to admit he had raised allegations dealing with potential corruption without evidence. He admitted so in relation to the allegations which concern Mr and Mrs Edwardes in their home extensions, the death of former Wanneroo councillor Mr Robert Baddock, and a trip by the Wanneroo City Council to Italy. Mr King repeatedly told the committee he had no evidence. Cheryl and Colin Edwardes were the victims of these unfounded allegations, based on no factual evidence, which were seized upon by the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia for his own political gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted recently in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, which was dated 5 September 1996, that a Dr Sandra Egger, apparently a criminal law expert, accused Royal Commissioner Roger David of `shooting the messenger'. Dr Egger wants an independent review of the process and conclusions of the royal commission. I question whether she was present during the hearings and had the benefit of testing the demeanour of the witnesses. I also question whether in fact she has read <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3094"> the total transcript of the hearings. She says, however, that the commission's interim report was seriously flawed and its findings based on a selective interpretation of the evidence. If one looks at the evidence, the transcript and the findings by Royal Commissioner Davis, one can see that there was no selective interpretation at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, Mr McGinty, has accepted the commission's findings but it is unfortunate that Mr Marlborough, the member for Peel, has not. The royal commission, I would submit to this Senate, has returned the only finding open to it and it is time that those who spread the rumours admitted that they were wrong and that they were purely working on a political agenda. Once again, I say to the Senate that it is unfortunate that Mr and Mrs Edwardes had their reputations smeared in this way, but it is gratifying that a properly constituted royal commission has cleared them both. It stands as a searing indictment on the opposition in Western Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I6">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</NAME>
<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to express my concerns about the budget impact on ABC's youth national broadcaster Triple J. As Senator Ellison has talked about the smearing of reputations of one sort, I thought I might talk about how young people in this country are having their culture cracked down upon and the fact that the reputation of Triple J itself has been smeared somewhat by comments of other politicians in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is worth noting that on the weekend in Adelaide, my home city, thousands of members of the public rallied to show their support for the ABC. Many were concerned that their favourite programs would be downgraded or indeed axed. I think the most pressing or disheartening vox pops that I heard were those from young Australians, especially young people in remote and regional areas who expressed that Triple J, Australia's only national youth broadcaster, was in fact their lifeline&mdash;it was the lifeblood for many young people. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should point out to the Senate that a book has been published <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Save the ABC</EMPHASIS> compiled by Morag Fraser and Joseph O'Reilly, who should be commended for getting together a group of media commentators, political commentators and other ABC program hosts. I am honoured to be involved in that publication, submitting a chapter, as I did, on Triple J. Since <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Save the ABC</EMPHASIS> book was published, we have seen the budget come down and we have seen various programs within Triple J being cut. First of all, we will see the cessation of the Triple J net site. We will also see the cessation of the Triple J expansion program and also the cessation of the Triple J unearthed music competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year Triple J turns 21. It should be thrown a party, not thrown out. I am appalled by some of the comments made about this national broadcaster. In particular, I have to refer to those comments of Mr John Bradford, a National Party MP from Queensland, who has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To allow swearing and disgusting topics to be discussed on a regular basis would potentially influence the ethical standards of most demographic groups. But Triple J is targeted at youth&mdash;the most vulnerable of all groups. Some segments boast they broadcast the music parents hate and politically correct toilet humour.</PARA>
<PARA>More disturbing, however, was when Mr Bradford received some impassioned pleas from young people, from one young girl in particular in his state, as I understand, and he went public with that young woman's letter not only releasing it to her parents but making it so that she was subject to ridicule in the nation's press for her somewhat colourful language at times as well as her spelling errors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that calling for the axing of Triple J entirely, as Mr Bradford has done, raises wider concerns and broader issues: first of all, how we treat young people in this country today. Why is it that the answer to everything, both in the budget process and I think generally, is about cracking down on young people's expressions, cracking down on young people's outlets for expression and clamping down on youth culture? I think that is a sad reaction.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3095">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, why do we seek to limit freedom of expression and speech in this way? Comments by people such as Mr Bradford overlook the fundamental role that Triple J has played in not only introducing politics to a new and younger generation but discussing previously taboo subjects, like issues to do with sex, drugs and rock and roll&mdash;issues that other commercial networks have not necessarily been brave enough to tackle, whether it is in a talkback form or in other ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for politics, there are a few people in this place&mdash;in fact, in both chambers&mdash;who took advantage of Triple J's excellent political election coverage. Whether it was the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), or the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), many of them were taking advantage of the election coverage and were involved in the Hottest 100 competition on Triple J. I do not see all of them being quick to stand in support of Triple J now that its reputation and longevity is threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time the Deputy Prime Minister opened his mouth, `Smashing Pumpkins' or `silverchair' seemed to tumble out. So I call on these politicians to start defending young Australians instead of clamping down on their outlets of expression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget is a sinister example of this. Young people are being attacked not only through Triple J cuts but through labour market programs, changes to social security, and higher education, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen when we lose Triple J's unearthed competition? What other commercial or non&hyphen;commercial station will pick up the responsibility of unearthing raw, real Australian young talent? What other broadcaster is going to ensure that young people who have few opportunities and few outlets of expression&mdash;certainly in regional and remote communities&mdash;will be given the opportunity to express themselves now that the expansion of the Triple J program is to be ceased?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge all people in this place to do what Triple J advocates; that is, `beat the drum'&mdash;not simply for Triple J but for young people. I have yet to hear any meaningful discussion <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on  how we treat, celebrate or reward young Australians in this country. The past two weeks have seen a litany of attempts to clamp down on young Australians, from regressive juvenile justice laws in various states right through to the regressive budget cuts that target young people more particularly than any other group in this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way that I ended my chapter in the book, I say to politicians like Mr Bradford, et al.: if you do not like what is being said, do not turn off. Listen harder and you might actually learn something.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) During my visit to Jakarta in April this year, I had wide&hyphen;ranging discussions with President Soeharto, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Alatas, and several other Cabinet Ministers. I was frank and upfront with my interlocutors about the concerns of many Australians about the human rights situation in Indonesia. In this context, I specifically raised Irian Jaya with Mr Alatas. I did not raise the death of Dr Wainggai during the visit given that an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) doctor was present at a post mortem which confirmed that Dr Wainggai died of natural causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I discussed the security situation in Irian Jaya and the role of the Indonesian military in the province with Mr Alatas.</PARA>

While the Indonesian Government has not formally responded to recommendations in the report, there have been some recent developments:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the release of the report, the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) conducted further investigations into the allegations of human rights abuses and determined that six procedural violations had occurred. Three soldiers and one junior officer were arrested in connection with these violations. In February 1996, after a court martial investigation, the four were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of between one and three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The directive on human rights issued by the Jayapura&hyphen;based Military Region VIII Commander, Major&hyphen;General Dunidja, earlier this year for use by officers and soldiers under his command has been a positive step in ABRI's approach to the province.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney&hyphen;General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relevant agencies within my portfolio have provided the following advice:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On 21 November 1990 at a sitting of the inquiry open to the public, Counsel assisting the Coroner tendered an affidavit declared by Mr John William Daniel Doohan of Willagee on 17 April 1990. In his affidavit Mr Doohan reported statements made to him by a Mr Noel Sharp. The matters raised in the affidavit relevant to the death of Assistant Commissioner Winchester were investigated by the AFP. The affidavit, together with a number of other documents produced in the course of the investigation, were tendered to the Coroner. For the purposes of the inquiry, a member of the AFP reviewed the investigation. His statement was also tendered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The affidavit of Mr Doohan was received in evidence by the Coroner as exhibit 471K. The Coroner ordered the suppression from publication of names mentioned in the affidavit and other documents or any material that might tend to identify people so mentioned. The suppression order did not extend to names mentioned in the statement of the AFP member reviewing the investigation. Before making the suppression order, the Coroner heard submissions from Counsel assisting the Coroner and had the benefit of the views expressed in the statement of the reviewing AFP member. It was not put in those submissions or in that statement that Mr Doohan was mentally unstable but, rather, that the statements made by Mr Sharp were not to be believed. The Coroner <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3098"> accepted that submission and also expressed the view that there were reasons for disbelieving the statements made by the two persons, one of whom was Mr Doohan, which were said to corroborate the statements of Mr Sharp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) When the affidavit was tendered Mr David Eastman did not appear at the inquiry either in person or by a legal representative. In about January 1991, a copy of materials tendered to the inquiry up to that time was provided to the then legal representatives of Mr Eastman. It is believed that a copy of Mr Doohan's affidavit was probably included in that material. A copy of the transcript of the proceedings from 3 July 1990 to 4 December 1990 was provided to Mr Eastman's legal representatives on 21 January 1991. This transcript included the proceedings in which the affidavit by Mr Doohan was tendered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) to (6) At the time Mr Doohan's affidavit of 17 April 1990 was tendered, Counsel assisting the Coroner appeared on behalf of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to section 6 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983. However, as the function of assisting the Coroner was taken over by the Director of Public Prosecutions for the ACT prior to 1996, questions about what the Coroner received in 1996 concerning the inquiry are matters for the Attorney&hyphen;General in the ACT Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The AFP has no record of providing the Coroner with a copy of, or advice of, Senate question No. 72, notice of 1 June 1990, asked by Senator Jenkins of the then Minister for Transport and Communications and which related to the monitoring of telephone calls.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In 1995, a total of 10,575 recipients of AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY benefits received the Dependent Spouse Allowance (DSA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) There were no recipients of Home Child Care Allowance (HCCA) in 1996 because from 1 July 1995, the HCCA was subsumed into Parenting Allowance, a Government assistance for low income families with dependents, in particular, where one of the partners has little or no personal income. The Parenting Allowance has two parts, one of which, known as the Basic Parenting Allowance, is the equivalent of the old HCCA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The student or the partner may individually be entitled to receive AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY or the Parenting Allowance. Each individual cannot receive concurrently assistance from more than one of the three schemes. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For efficiency of administration and privacy concerns, the Department does not collect information on student's spouse who receive the Parenting Allowance. Conversely, the Department of Social Security has no information about the number of people who receive Parenting Allowance and who have partners in receipt of AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) As indicated in my answer to Question (2)(a), there are no data available to answer this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) From 1 January 1996, the AUSTUDY DSA was abolished and most of its clients transferred to the Parenting Allowance. As I pointed out in replying to Question (2)(a), DSS has no information about people receiving existing Parenting Allowance whose partners are also in receipt of AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY. There is also no information about students whose partners are not eligible for Parenting Allowance and who would have been eligible for DSA had it continued in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Projected savings for the Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs portfolio as a result of abolishing DSA and replacing it with Parenting Allowance were $23.1 million in 1995&hyphen;96, $46.3 million in 1996&hyphen;97 and $47.5 million in 1997&hyphen;98. There were no savings projected for the Social Security portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(a) The former AUSTUDY DSA was reduced by 50 cents for every dollar of the spouse's income above $60 a fortnight. The Parenting Allowance income test has a 50 per cent withdrawal rate on each dollar of the allowee's income between $60 and $140 a fortnight with a 70 per cent withdrawal rate for each dollar of income above this level. While the AUSTUDY student income test did not affect the level of DSA, Parenting Allowance is reduced by 70 cents for every dollar of partner's income above $484 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The DSA was abolished and replaced by Parenting Allowance&mdash;not by HCCA. This change removed the anomaly whereby basic Parenting Allowance could be paid to persons attracting payment of the DSA, when the two Allowances had a similar purpose. The change is consistent with moves to provide an independent payment to partners and to direct family assistance to the principal carer of children in any family group. Most clients were not affected by the change as they merely transferred from the then Department of Employment, Education and Training payment to a DSS payment at the same maximum rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Several groups have been affected, namely families:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> where the partner of the AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY recipient is not an Australian resident or does not have a qualifying residence exemption for Parenting Allowance; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3100"> </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> those affected because of the differences in the income test for Parenting Allowance and AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A small number of people were also affected by the change because they were already receiving basic Parenting Allowance in 1995 (at the same time that their spouse was receiving DSA) and had this subsumed into their overall rate of Parenting Allowance in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Students receiving the DSA in 1995, whose partners are not receiving Parenting Allowance, may be able to claim the `with&hyphen;child' Dependent Spouse Rebate on a pro rata basis when completing their 1995&hyphen;96 taxation returns, subject to the level of their partner's separate net income.</PARA>

Pursuant to section 9 of the AIDC Act 1970, as amended, AIDC is not subject to direction by or on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. AIDC Ltd, a subsidiary of the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), is not a Government Authority; it is a public company, 99.98% of the shares of which are held by AIDC.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) The aircraft was reported by Moorabin ATS to have infringed airspace shortly after take&hyphen;off. The incident was initially reported to BASI as an online electronic safety incident report on 14 September 1995.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Prior to issuing an export permit, an authorised officer must be satisfied that the live animals have been prepared in accordance with the relevant model codes and the requirements of the importing country. This is determined by the veterinary officer responsible for issuing the health certificate covering the consignment which is only issued after a thorough inspection of the livestock and the pre&hyphen;export preparation/isolation facilities within 48 hours of export. Consequent upon this action, export permits and health certification can be withheld for part or all of the consignment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Mortality rates are determined by examination of reports submitted to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) by ships' Masters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Corporation (AMLC) maintains a regular promotional program to encourage increased consumption of sheepmeat. Through its overseas offices in key markets the AMLC promotes the trade through a comprehensive program of consumer and trade advertising and sales promotion backed up by a technical support service. The advertising strategy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3105"> focuses on newspapers and magazines portraying Australian sheepmeat as high quality and produced by a professional industry. General merchandising and point&hyphen;of&hyphen;sale material is also provided to stores carrying Australian sheepmeat to differentiate the product from competitors. The AMLC technical officers advise retailers and consumers on the characteristics and specifications of Australian meat and conducts butcher training programs on handling, preparation and presentation. The AMLC's efforts to promote sheepmeat consumption also extend to regularly contacting government officials, importers and agents to maintain Australia's reputation as a supplier of high quality and safe product and reassure them, where appropriate, of the integrity of our export certification system.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Technical Review Process employed by AQIS to measure compliance with minimum standards for export meat has recently been strengthened for the purposes of ensuring uninterrupted access to international markets and protection of Australia's reputation as one of the world's premier suppliers of fresh meat.
