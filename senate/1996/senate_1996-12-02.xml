<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Assistant Treasurer. Is the minister aware of reports that the Reserve Bank Chief of Bank Supervision, Mr Brian Gray, has slammed the Treasury plan for a buyer beware system of bank regulation, labelling it as `naive conceptually' and `certain to compromise the stability of the financial system'? Is the minister further aware of Mr Gray's comments that the Treasury plan could put Australia's financial system at risk of a major collapse? Given Mr Gray's comments, what are your views on the Treasury plan, or do you think Mr Gray is wrong?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry is referring, I suspect, to a submission made by the Treasury to the Wallis inquiry. A large number of organisations, government and otherwise&mdash;250 in all&mdash;made submissions to that inquiry. Senator Sherry will be aware that a discussion paper was released last Thursday. He will also be aware that further papers have been called for by the Wallis inquiry from people who wish to make further submissions and comments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it hurts the Labor Party for us to be talking about the interest rate levels. I remind senators opposite that when they were in office and when the election was called home loan interest rates were in the order of 10.5 per cent. Now they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are 8&frac34; per cent. For the family who has an average mortgage in the order of $100,000 this has meant an interest rate benefit of over $140 a month. Some loans are at 8 per cent or less, the lowest rates in two decades. This is a tremendous benefit for Australian families, a benefit which the proven fiscal failures opposite continue to oppose and, with their efforts in the Senate, try to put at risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It cannot be stressed too much the important role that responsible fiscal policy plays in helping to take the pressure off interest rates.

This has to be the most bitter and divisive factional struggle we have ever seen in this country. I can understand why Senator Robert Ray and Senator Conroy wanted to raise Emily's list in the national executive recently. It is simply because Senator Carr is doing untold damage, not just to your party&mdash;that does not particularly trouble us&mdash;but he is certainly doing enormous damage to one of Australia's greatest institutions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lost savings from the amendments to the bill are comprised of the following. Lost savings from the change in the start date from 1 April 1996 to the date of royal assent, assumed to be 1 January, for the newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance total $124.9 million over the four years. Included in this figure are the savings lost from the non-exemption of partners, which cannot be singled out from the total.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to the second item, it is a question of special benefit. By not applying a 104&hyphen;week waiting period to special benefit, it is estimated by the department that 30 per cent of those covered by the 104&hyphen;week waiting period for the newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance will be granted special benefit during their waiting period at an additional cost of $65.3 million over the four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third item relates to the parenting allowance. The loss of savings by not extending the parenting allowance 26-week newly arrived residents waiting period to 104 weeks will be $90.7 million over the four years.</PARA>

Has the department made recommendations about what might be appropriate reasons for terminating clients?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6401" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for his question. I have a long and detailed brief&mdash;if I am thinking of the right one&mdash;with respect to the circumstances under which it is appropriate to exit case management. I will have a good look at that and will come back to you with some detail on it. I am happy to provide you with such information as I can. You will understand that we are at the moment in what I would describe as a `transitional phase' between the one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one case management, which was introduced by your party, the previous government, and which was one of the things of Working Nation that did work, and a system that we would like to introduce where some 90 per cent of our funds will go into the intensive employment assistance&mdash;you might describe it as a contract of case management by another name&mdash;of those who are either long-term unemployed or at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a detailed brief for consideration because, in that transition phase, we will have some people who will have entered case management under the old system and who perhaps have not concluded that case management. There will need to be a sensible alignment as to what to do when the two systems merge into one. I do not see that there are any difficult policy decisions in the sense of differences that there might be between the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two major parties, the Democrats or the Independents on this. It is a case of simply considering the complexity&mdash;`complexity' is the wrong word because it is a matter of who entered on which dates, what date you shift to a new system and where you put the people who were on the old system. It is not as if it is intellectually difficult; it is `technically messy', if I could explain it to you in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, Senator, one of the things that did work in Working Nation was the recognition by your party that some people need one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one case management; they need a really significant boost to get them back into the work force. That part of Working Nation worked and that is the part we are building on and expanding. I look forward to your support and that of your colleagues when we seek legislative approval for the changes we want to make. The changes we want to make are basically those which will cash out all of the labour market programs and shift to a system where the majority of assistance&mdash;in financial terms and in other terms&mdash;goes to people who are either long-term unemployed or at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without wishing to be political about my criticisms of Working Nation, one of the mistakes the previous government made&mdash;not intentionally, in my view&mdash;was that it did not pay enough attention to those who were at risk of becoming long&hyphen;term unemployed. So, what you had happening is that people who were long-term unemployed were put into make&hyphen;work schemes in the hope that they would end up in a real job. You and I know the effectiveness of that was not very good: 22 per cent for some programs and up to 30&hyphen;something per cent for others. They were very ineffective; they are the programs we are discarding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that time they were not considered unemployed. When they came off that program and did not get a job, they went on the short&hyphen;term unemployed list. They have started to channel through again&mdash;it is a funnelling process. That will always happen unless we devise a scheme to stop people flowing into the long-term unemployed bucket. As to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6402"> detail of the question you raised which specifically related to those already in the bucket and already getting contracted case management and the appropriate exit point for them, I will come back to you on that.</PARA></ANSWER>

That is what the previous government did. They picked out and focused on the long-term unemployed at the expense of those who were at risk of falling into the bucket so that they could churn the people through to make the figures look better.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time, Senator Collins asked me a question with regard to the surplus of valencia oranges. It relates to the falls in the international price of frozen concentrated juice with increased local and overseas production of valencia oranges. This has caused serious concern in the citrus growing areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is fully aware of the adjustment pressures faced by citrus growers and has programs in place to assist adjustment in the industry. Citrus growers have been aware for many years that they need to diversify away from dependence on income from processing fruit used for concentrate production which does not cover the cost of production. Thus they have been reworking their orchards to produce a higher proportion of fruit suitable for sale as fresh product, and a higher proportion of fruit has been processed for fresh juice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These industry efforts, supported by government programs and agencies, are paying off, with exports in 1995-96 accounting for 20 per cent of the crop or 100,006 tonnes worth $107 million. Exports have increased over the last six years from 35,000 tonnes in 1989&hyphen;90, and the industry's goal of exporting 30 per cent of production by the year 2000 is now in sight. The government support programs include an $8.4 million five-year citrus market diversification program and a dollar for dollar matching of industry contributions for R&amp;D, the tri&hyphen;state fruit fly program and adjustment assistance under the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next meeting of the citrus market development group on 16 December, which manages the citrus market diversification program, is to consider the current pressures facing the industry. Assistance with improving citrus orchards is also available under the rural adjustment scheme and includes: grants and loans for acquisition of farm management <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> skills and professional advice, interest subsidies, loans for enhancing farm productivity and re-establishment support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were to return to the protectionist measures of the past, it would amount to assisting the unprofitable sector. Returns to growers from exports range from about $450 per tonne in Asia to $1,000 per tonne in the United States, whereas oranges used in the production of concentrate returned $50 to $100 a tonne. The industry has taken the right decision to move away from dependence on juice concentrate, and the government will continue its support for those industry efforts.</PARA></QUESTION></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In discussing the minister's answer, I should place on record comments made today in Parliament House by the Bishop of Bathurst, the Right Reverend Bruce Wilson, and a member of the executive of the NCCA. He made this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a National Council of Churches task force meeting in September, Aboriginal leaders had never looked so depressed. From all over the nation, indigenous people were reporting outbreaks of racial hatred such as they have not experienced for years.</PARA>
<PARA>When you start the bushfire of racial intolerance, it hits everybody. When you target migrants, it hits the blacks; when you target the blacks, it hits migrants. This government is about playing that political football&mdash;kicking it for as much as it is worth for their own grubby, direct political advantage&mdash;regardless of what it does to this country's cohesiveness and prosperity. It is cohesiveness and prosperity that are at stake here. This minister has shown absolutely no morality or responsibility. But, unfortunately, she is following the lead of her Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and she is encouraged by the new <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Mr Le Pen, Peter Costello, the Treasurer in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen is that, when people migrate to Australia, two-thirds of them find jobs within the first 12 months and 75 per cent find employment within the first 18 months to two years. What this government has sought to do willy-nilly&mdash;without review and without policy analysis&mdash;is to deny all these people rights of access to services for two years. What the Senate did last week was to make this government fit the commitment they made at the last election, and that was to extend the waiting period to two years for some selected benefits which are paid to permanent residents of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we saw after that was nothing short of disgraceful. We had the Minister for Social Security who was not sighted at the front table in the course of the debate but she hovered around the back&mdash;I do not know what she was paid for on those days&mdash;watching Senator Tambling do the hard work for her. She was sitting there bludging on the backbench whilst the work was being done by the parliamentary secretary. But this minister, who chose not to be involved in the debate, then went out on the public airways and together with the Treasurer deliberately went out to stir divisiveness&mdash;something that should have no place at all in modern Australia&mdash;on race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were stirring up antagonism towards migrants and migration, people like Senator Panizza who probably arrived here without the English language but who very quickly learned how to make a buck, how to get employment and pay taxes here. From day one, people pay indirect taxes in this country. This minister shows absolutely no sense of social responsibility, and that is unfortunate for this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Peter Costello and other government ministers and members go out there and say, `We're making sure that migrants don't from day one get access to services,' they are not telling the truth. They are denying the fact that for many benefits in the past migrants have had to wait six months and that for many benefits, even now, migrants have to wait not just six months but two years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6406">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done in the past in this society is to recognise the importance and value of migration, the importance of getting a cohesiveness together and the importance of social assistance in that. We have also recognised that, no matter where the migrant group has come from, Australia has been the winner. We have benefited from that migration. As a whole, Australia has broadened and prospered enormously on the basis of continued high growth migration in the 1950s and 1960s, and continued migration ever since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if we are&mdash;like this government is&mdash;going to go out and continually stir the flames of racial divisiveness, then it is going to be our society that will suffer. Bishop Wilson this morning made another plaintive plea. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our unity, prosperity and wellbeing as a nation is also at stake.</PARA>
<PARA>He called on all political leaders and all opinion makers, both secular and spiritual, to become a lot more sensitive in treating these issues. It is a pity this government has lit the bushfires of racial divisiveness. They came into government on the back of it and they have kicked it for all it is worth ever since. But fortunately for this country it is starting to backfire. You are looking sleazy, you are looking amoral. The church leaders are coming out calling for a better standard on your part. Let us hope, for this country's prosperity and cohesiveness, we get it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we should look at what the coalition election policy said and then compare it with what it has cost and the claims that are being made by this government. The coalition's election policy proposal on this matter was to extend Labor's existing waiting lists from six months to two years, and that means on the same allowances and the same conditions. Part of that policy was to expressly exclude family allowances and Medicare and to provide a safety net in the form of special allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We remember vividly when the coalition held this policy up and said, `We've had Access Economics independently cost this.' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Their costs were $616 million over three years, which would have been $900 million over four years. Where do we get this $400 million that the government is now talking about?  The first thing is that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is blaming the Senate for not starting its work until May. The government is saying, `But, look, our start-up date was April.' Is it the Senate's fault that this government did not call the parliament together in order to meet the start-up dates of their election policy promises? I hardly think so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part that I want to point to in this $400 million total is the special benefit, the payment of last resort, which is paid in lieu of newstart, sickness and youth training allowances which will be $65 million over four years. This government is now blaming the Senate for the cost of implementing an important part of their election policy commitments. This is really rich! It is the Senate's fault for not starting before the start-up date of their proposed legislation and it is the Senate's fault for implementing the cost of coalition election policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest the minister take another look at these costings. I have the paper that she has given me. I certainly will examine it overnight. But, from a cursory look, it seems to me that the government is still using these two excuses. They are unacceptable excuses. In interviews around this country over the past few days, the Minister for Social Security and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) have deliberately given the impression that the coalition's election policy was not about the four allowances&mdash;the six which had the six-month wait under Labor&mdash;but about 14 to 16 separate measures that the Senate was refusing to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government&mdash;specifically, the Minister for Social Security and the Treasurer, and on occasions the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;have quite deliberately and distinctly given the impression that all measures were blocked, when in fact the waiting period for the dole, sickness allowance and youth training allowance was increased from six months to two years. And this is where the bulk of the coalition's savings were to come from.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6407">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition&mdash;specifically, the Minister for Social Security on the John Laws program&mdash;gave the impression that this wait applied only to the dole; that the Senate had only given permission to extend the six months to two years for the dole. This is absolutely deliberately misleading, and we know why. Nobody could say it better than Alan Ramsey, actually, and I want to quote him in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An underlying thread of the Government's policy behaviour ever since it came to office is the divisive way it always seems ready to play one group or other off against so&hyphen;called "mainstream Australia", or what it likes to constantly invoke as the country's "battlers".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Either it's Aborigines, or the unions, or public servants, or Asian migrants, or groups as undefined as the "elite" and the "politically correct".</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now it's the turn of new migrants, or what Peter Costello calls "those people", as if somehow they're just bludging off "good Australian taxpayers". . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on this motion because I want to pick up where Senator Kernot just left off, in terms of what is disgraceful and what is not. I believe that the Australian Democrats went to the people at the last election saying that they would keep the bastards honest. They have gone to election after election&mdash;successive elections&mdash;promising the same thing. What they have done on this occasion is try to make us dishonest, because what was a key and instrumental part of our election <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> platform at the last election, and for which we received a very clear mandate, was to introduce a two&hyphen;year waiting period for most welfare payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened is that the Labor Party and the Democrats have seen fit to make sure that we do not keep that promise. We believe that the people of Australia are owed more than that. This measure would have simply reinforced the commitments made by intending migrants or their sponsors to support themselves when they first enter Australia. All we are saying is that the commitment that they give to this country and to the taxpayers of this country should be upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government, during its 13 years in government, failed to implement that. This government is trying to do the right thing by Australian taxpayers and is saying that this is an important part that is owed to Australian taxpayers&mdash;where intending migrants and their sponsors give that commitment, they are asked to honour that commitment. It is unreasonable to expect Australian taxpayers to help people to dishonour a commitment of that nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a race issue and it disturbs me that Senator Kernot and the Labor Party are trying to turn it into a race issue. The Labor Party has been incessantly suggesting that it is a race issue. I am now disturbed to hear that Senator Kernot is jumping onto that bandwagon. It is simply that these new migrants have given that commitment and they are being asked to honour that commitment. The opposition parties have simply deliberately flouted the views of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6408"> What the opposition parties fail to accept is the decision of 2 March 1996. At some stage they have to come to accept that they lost this election. They lost it, and they lost it comprehensively. We gave commitments at that time to make sure that measures such as this were to be taken to protect the interests of migrants, sponsors and Australian taxpayers. But the Labor Party and the Democrats are deliberately and simply playing games with the revenue contributed by the battlers of this country. They don't seem to mind that, for every dollar they snatch away in these meas ures, they put an extra burden onto the battlers of this country. Again, they have no regard for the taxation contribution of those battlers and want to see bigger and bigger government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference between what we are trying to do in government and what has happened over the previous 13 years is that they simply went on spending and spending. We cannot live in that society any more. We cannot pretend that it is utopia any more. We have to put the brakes on somewhere along the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that the actions of the opposition parties have increased government expenditure by approximately $130 million in a full year and, as Senator Newman said in question time today, just a smidgin under $400 million over the first four years. And that is nothing to be sneezed at. The opposition parties are quite happy to impose that $400 million on the battlers of Australia, and that is unfair. Any pretence that the opposition parties are fiscally responsible is shown up for the great lie that it is. It cannot be considered responsible. We have a very generous social security system in terms of easy access to payments which is, of course, of some genuine concern to the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament needs to have greater respect for the people of Australia and the battlers of Australia who make these payments. All the gains that the government has made in terms of savings from reduced social security fraud and greater debt collection have been decimated by the intransigence of the opposition parties, who will not accept the result of 2 March 1996. The fact is that this was an integral part of our promises&mdash;to make sure that the waiting period on most welfare payments was extended to two years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in this debate to take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman). Senator Kernot's interjection is correct: there is no intransigence on the part of opposition parties in this place. This government has got exactly what it promised, but it changed its policy halfway. Better than that&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I am sorry that Senator Knowles is leaving the chamber&mdash;the government has acknowledged that its policies have changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its policy during the election period was to extend to two years the waiting period for those allowances which already had waiting periods of six months for newly arrived migrants. Those payments were: newstart allowance&mdash;the dole&mdash;sickness allowance, parenting allowance and youth training allowance. This government made it very clear when it went to the polls that those were the social security payments which were to be affected by this measure&mdash;those which previously had six&hyphen;month waiting periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Somehow the government neglected to mention 12 other social security payments to which it was attempting to apply a two&hyphen;year waiting period. Some of those social security benefits include the carer's pension, the disability wage supplement and the widow allowance, benefits that largely apply to the most vulnerable in our society, not simply migrants but primarily migrant women, as with the parenting allowance and maternity allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not one mention was made of those particular social security payments and benefits in the coalition's election policies. In fact, on 22 May this year, in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I just make it perfectly clear to the Leader of the Opposition . . . You introduced a six&hyphen;month period. All we have done is to extend your six months to two years.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, he was referring specifically to those social security payments that had a six&hyphen;month waiting period&mdash;that is, sickness allowance, youth training allowance, newstart allowance and the parenting allowance. They were the four measures that this government referred to, but it has since changed its policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In correspondence between the Prime Minister's office and the offices of Minister Vanstone and Minister Newman after the election, the Prime Minister made it clear that the government had changed this policy and that it now wanted the two&hyphen;year wait to apply beyond those payments to extra types of safety net support. The government has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6409"> acknowledged in correspondence that it changed its policy after winning office on 2 March. Between the pre&hyphen;election promises, commitments, policies and statements it had made and getting into office it decided that it wanted to extend that waiting period to a range of other benefits, some of which I have referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate does foster division, fear and loathing in our society. Senator Knowles is incorrect in claiming that it does not. It perpetuates the notion in our society that migrants are somehow the `other'; that they should be treated differently. Moreover, Senator Knowles, in her concern for the taxpayer, overlooks one fundamental fact: migrants pay tax. They pay it through indirect and direct taxation. They also provide other economic contributions through assurances of support and through contributions to other migrant financial programs. Taxpayers are migrants; migrants are taxpayers. I think we are perpetuating the notion that migrants are other in our community when we talk about concern for battlers and taxpayers, as though migrants in our society are not battlers and taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the issue of retrospectivity, what hypocrisy! The attempt to make the waiting period for these payments effective from 1 April this year is outrageous. The coalition, when in opposition, was on record so many times complaining about not moving the goalposts and opposing retrospectivity. We have kept them honest; we have made sure that there is no retrospective application to these benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has misrepresented this issue on radio, through the other media and now in this place. It got what it wanted; it was held to its election promise&mdash;the extension of the waiting period to two years for the dole, sickness allowance, parenting allowance and the youth and training allowance. Any attempt by the minister to claim otherwise is a blatant misrepresentation.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am appalled by the lies that are circulating pub <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> licly about the decision of the Senate last week on the proposed two&hyphen;year waiting period for social security benefits for newly arrived migrants. The lies I am referring to are, first and foremost, the promises with which the coalition parties went into the last election&mdash;vague promises but, nonetheless, promises. They promised publicly that certain social security benefits would be subject to a two&hyphen;year waiting period before migrants could access them. They stated that before the election. Implicitly, they were referring to those benefits for which a six&hyphen;month qualifying or waiting period was already applicable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the time the minister made the announcement in March or early April that the extended waiting period was to cover 10 or 11 other benefits, the lies have really become abundant. The bill was introduced into the parliament to facilitate the extension of the waiting period and the election commitment was forgotten. The assertion was that the bill contained what was in the election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate found out that this was clearly not the case when the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee under the chairmanship of Senator Chris Ellison. The committee held hearings both here in Canberra and also in Sydney. None of the government members of the committee could point out where the measures in the bill were to be found in the election commitments. They just were not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have certain ministers and senators who wish to rewrite history. They are not going to be able to do it, because the Senate has deliberated upon this matter and made its determination through decisions of the Senate. It was not through decisions of the opposition and not through decisions of the Democrats&mdash;it was through decisions of the Senate. By a majority decision, the Senate has kept the government to their promise, and Senator Hill knows this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect even the part-time Minister for Social Security knows this. I say `part&hyphen;time' because she has spent some little time in the chamber in recent times at question time. She has not done very much. She did not make an appearance, give a second reading speech or even handle any of the committee stages <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6410"> when this very important piece of legislation was going through the parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing Senator Newman has done in recent times&mdash;which we on this side of the chamber can acknowledge&mdash;is work for Tony Blair, the leader of the Labour Party in Britain. It would appear from the media reports we have heard that she went over to Britain canvassing against the conservative government in the United Kingdom&mdash;and one would think in favour of the Labour Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don Dobie was born on 28 July 1927 at Glasgow in Scotland. He was educated at Brisbane Grammar School, and went on to complete a Bachelor of Commerce degree at Melbourne University and a Master of Business Administration degree at Columbia University in New York.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before entering federal politics, Don worked for the Bank of New South Wales from 1943 to 1966. He also served with the 2nd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6412"> Australian Artillery, Citizens Military Forces, with the rank of gunner between 1951 and 1952.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don became a member of the House of Representatives in 1966 when he won the New South Wales seat of Hughes for the Liberal Party. In his maiden speech in the House in February 1967, he placed on record his total commitment to the welfare of his constituents and spoke on a range of issues, including housing finance for young people, education and the need to ensure quality of teaching, services for the disabled, and the importance of international trade for Australia's economic future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, Don was Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Deputy Chair of Committees and Chief Opposition Whip and he also served on the Speaker's Panel. During his long service in this parliament, Don also contributed tirelessly to the work of a wide range of House of Representatives committees, including the committee on environment, recreation and the arts; the House committee; the privileges committee; the long&hyphen;term strategies committee; the community affairs committee; and the members' interests committee. He also served on a number of joint committees, including foreign affairs and defence; the Australian Capital Territory; the new Parliament House; the parliamentary zone, and public accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don made many friends in this parliament on both sides of politics as well as among the Comcar drivers and staff of the parliamentary departments. He made mention of this in his valedictory speech on the eve of his departure not so long ago from this parliament. Characteristically, he also made special reference to his constituents and the personal satisfaction that could be gained from being a local member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don will be sadly missed by all of us who knew him. Personally, I regarded him as a good bloke and he gave me a lot of good advice. I enjoyed his company and learnt a lot from him, particularly in my early days in this parliament. He will be remembered by all of us as a fine parliamentarian and a dedicated local member.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the opposition to support the motion of condolence that has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. On behalf of opposition senators, I would like to join in expressing our deepest sympathy and regret at the death on 25 November of Don Dobie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Hill has indicated, Don Dobie was first elected to parliament in 1966. He beat Les Johnson for the seat of Hughes in New South Wales in that election, which was not a good election for the Labor Party. We were washed away in many seats at that time. That saw Don Dobie elected to the House of Representatives for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1969, the old seat of Hughes was divided and the new seat of Cook was created. Les Johnson found his way back as the member for Hughes, but Don Dobie came back into the parliament as the member for Cook. Don had a difficult early parliamentary career because he was defeated in the 1972 and 1974 elections in the seat of Cook by Mr Ray Thorburn, whom I knew very well. Ray was then defeated by Don Dobie in 1975. There was a bit of musical chairs in the seats in southern Sydney at that time. They were always very well contested elections down there and tough battles indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said, Don Dobie served as Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister from 1971 through until the defeat of the McMahon government in 1972. He had some very distinguished parliamentary committee service and was Deputy Chairman of Committees for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don Dobie was a very vocal advocate for the electorate of Cook. When I first became a senator, I had my own electorate office in Caringbah in the electorate of Cook and I knew Don Dobie well. He was a man who was very dedicated to representing the interests of his constituency. He certainly always argued that face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face contact with the electorate was what politics ought to be all about in this country, and he lived up to that principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He spent a very long period in the parliament as a representative of the electorates of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6413"> Hughes and Cook. I am sure that that long service is genuinely testimony to his skills as a very effective local member. He was very dedicated, as I have said, to his electorates, and many of us in the opposition knew Don Dobie well for quite a long period. I can assure you, Madam President, that we join with the government in expressing our sincere condolences and expressing our sincere regret at his death.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join the Australian Democrats in this motion of condolence on the death of Mr Don Dobie. I knew Mr Dobie reasonably well from the time that I was a staffer. I must say that he treated me as a member of staff of a member of parliament with great courtesy at all times and was always very agreeable, which is something that does not always happen, but it did in the case of Don Dobie. I found him very pleasant to deal with. Being a Democrat senator sometimes puts people's backs up in other parties, particularly in the House of Representatives, but that never happened with Mr Dobie. He was always a very urbane and pleasant man who was agreeable and easy to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a very active local member for both his electorates&mdash;his constituencies. He was dedicated very much to serving his constituents, and he did that very well for a very long time. He was a very well&hyphen;known figure in the Cronulla area, even right up until very recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was saddened and quite surprised to hear of his death, although he had not been well for some short time. I have pleasant memories of dealing with him and I think that the parliament is the poorer for his having resigned only a very short while ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the Democrats, I would like to join in adding our condolences. We express our condolences to Mr Dobie's family&mdash;I believe he has a niece, so there is some family to send our condolences to&mdash;and also to his many, many friends, who, I am sure, will miss him considerably.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate mem <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> bers of the National Party in the Senate with the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill on the death of the Hon. Don Dobie. Don Dobie passed away last week at the age of 69. He was a former assistant minister in the McMahon government. He was one of the parliament's longest serving House of Representatives members, serving for 26 years and winning 10 elections on the way. He first entered parliament as the member for Hughes in 1966 in the big Harold Holt win. Following a redistribution, he was re-elected in 1969 in the seat of Cook, which he held until 1972 and then regained in 1975. He held Cook from then until his retirement last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don Dobie was born in Glasgow in 1927, and his parents relocated to Brisbane, where he went to the Brisbane Grammar School. He then went on to study commerce at Melbourne University. In 1943 he joined the Bank of New South Wales, where he pursued a banking career for the next 20 years. He served from 1951 to 1952 with the anti&hyphen;aircraft regiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His capabilities were recognised by the bank, and it sent him to New York to study for an MBA at Columbia University. He returned to Australia, where he was approached by the Liberal Party to stand for Hughes, and his long parliamentary career was launched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He attained a ministry in 1971 as Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister. He was Deputy Chair of Committees from 1970 to 1971, 1979 to 1983 and 1987 to 1994, and he was chief opposition whip from 1983 to 1985. He stated in his final speech last year that he saw being a member of parliament as an end in itself, not as a means to pursue further ambitions. He derived immense satisfaction from being an effective local member who succeeded in getting things done for his constituents, in particular with their battles against the bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He participated fully in committee work in the parliament. He was a member of the public accounts committee from 1967 to 1971&mdash;serving as the chair from 1969 to 1971&mdash;and also from 1976 to 1977. He took an interest in the foreign affairs and trade portfolios, and he served on the foreign affairs <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6414"> and trade committee from 1978 to 1983. He was the special parliamentary adviser to the 37th UN General Assembly in 1982. He was Liberal Party representative on the New Parliament House Arts Advisory Committee, and I know that he enjoyed that job immensely as he had a very strong interest in the arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a hardworking member. He was known affectionately amongst the coalition as a strong whip. He used to have a few little jokes with us in the party room. He was hailed by the Prime Minister during the valedictory debate last year as a `quintessentially superb local member', a great accolade with which everyone who knew him would concur.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put on the record my sadness at the passing on 25 November of the Hon. Don Dobie, the member for Hughes from 1966 to 1969, the member for Cook from 1969 to 1972 and, again, from 1975 to 1996. Also, as has been mentioned, amongst many other things, he was the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister&mdash;that is, Prime Minister McMahon&mdash;in 1971-72.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don Dobie had a long and meritorious record as a distinguished member of the federal parliament. I had the pleasure of being a member of the House of Representatives with him between 1975 and 1980 and, during that period, found him to be very generous in the way in which he shared his earlier parliamentary experience with newcomers like me. On his retirement earlier this year, Don was second, I think, only to the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, the member for New England, in the length of service of the then still sitting members. That is a terrific record of achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don Dobie contributed much as a member of parliament both as a local member and as a parliamentarian. He was probably best known as a local member and, as Senator Boswell said in his comments just prior to this speech, in the valedictories last December the then opposition leader and now Prime Minister, John Howard, described Don as a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `quintessentially superb local member'. His record in holding the marginal seat of Cook for such a long period with just one glitch, the period between 1972 and 1975, bears eloquent testimony to that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He saw the full and effective representation of all his constituents, regardless of political allegiances, as his primary responsibility as a member of parliament. Important as that was&mdash;and it was primarily important to him&mdash;Don, though, was also a significant parliamentarian. He had strong academic qualifications. He had a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Melbourne and a Master of Business Administration from Columbia University in New York. He was an employee of the Bank of New South Wales&mdash;now Westpac&mdash;for more than 20 years before entering parliament. That prior career experience enabled him to contribute effectively over many years to economic issues in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his maiden speech way back in February 1967, he drew attention very correctly to the fundamental importance for Australia of international trade and our ability to compete in an increasingly competitive world. That is something we hear much about nowadays, but perhaps it was not so much in those days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was also interested in a wide range of other issues, particularly foreign affairs, the environment and the institutions of parliament. He represented the parliament on many parliamentary delegations to other countries and to international agencies. I, along with my friend Senator McKiernan, was privileged to be a fellow member with him on one of these occasions: namely, the parliamentary delegation to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in November 1993. Don was a very amiable member of that delegation and we benefited from his long experience of such representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don was appointed as Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister in 1971-72. He was also Chief Opposition Whip between 1983 and 1985 and, as has already been outlined, he occupied many other positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The respect and high regard in which Don Dobie was held by his coalition colleagues was reflected in his being the coalition's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6415"> nominee for Speaker of the House of Representatives after the elections in 1987, 1990 and 1993. He was seen by his colleagues&mdash;and I am sure by many in the Labor Party too&mdash;as a person who had a real feel for the institution of parliament, who could command the respect of both sides of parliament and who could enforce the authority of the House with his admirable qualities of fairness and courtesy, which I think were widely recognised. Don Dobie was very much a very courteous man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did not enjoy good health in his latter years, but he bore that with good humour, fortitude and courage. It is a great pity that Don did not live to enjoy much of his retirement. Perhaps, however, that was not of particular concern to him because, in essence, parliament and the electorate for which he cared and worked for so long were not just work for him. They were his delight, his enjoyment and, indeed, in many respects his whole life. I think we are all the poorer for his passing. We have benefited greatly from the life he led.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks to the memory of Don Dobie. I did not know him well, as previous speakers in the condolence motion did. I knew him quite a deal less than them, but I did get to know Don during the parliamentary delegation to Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, which Senator Short just mentioned. I would also like to pick up Senator Short's words and make mention of Don Dobie's very good humour and how he coped with circumstances and situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian parliamentary delegation to Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in 1993 was particularly grateful that he had such a good humour, such a tolerance of situations. When we were in Laos, the delegation was leaving Vientiane to go up to Sayaboury province for two days. We got away from Vientiane okay but, when we got to the other end of the trip, it was realised that Don Dobie's bags were missing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Poor Don had to endure almost three days of over 40 degree celsius heat, a very long four hour trip in a four&hyphen;wheel drive on very rough roads, three or four trips on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Mekong River, and a number of lunches, dinners and other ceremonies that we had to go through&mdash;all in the same set of clothes. He bore the burden well, but I must say that some of the colleagues were less tolerant of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was unfortunate that no other member of the delegation could in fact lend Don some clothes to wear to get him through the visit. Of course, we were in Laos as well and the people of Laos are generally very small and, as we would all know and remember, Don was a man of considerable size. But I particularly mention his humour during that visit. The trip itself taxed us fit members of the delegation, but he certainly bore it with very good humour and made his contribution to making a success of that delegation through the three countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well remember a number of discussions that he had with various embassy officials in each of the three countries that we visited to promote trade and trade opportunities between Australia and those countries&mdash;links that he had earlier established with those officers from the various embassies. So he was not just somebody who talked about it. He actually did it on the ground on behalf of his electorate and on behalf of his nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, we all have to go some time. I too share Senator Short's sadness that Don Dobie was not able to enjoy more of his retirement&mdash;he left this parliament only in March of this year. I have great sorrow in joining the previous speakers and adding my and my wife's words of condolence to Don's many friends and those family members who will sadly miss him.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to also make a few remarks on this condolence motion to the late Don Dobie, a former member for Hughes and, more recently, Cook. I have probably known Don Dobie as long as just about anybody in this parliament even though I have been a member for only a short couple of years. I say that because I lived in Cronulla from very my early days&mdash;in fact, since I was born&mdash;and, therefore, as an active member of the Cronulla branch of the Australian Labor Party, I naturally came into contact with Don <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6416"> Dobie on many occasions. My first recollection is in 1966. At that stage I was still one year short of being able to formally join the Labor Party but, like all people from political families, you get involved at an early age doing the letterboxing and things like that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner and other speakers referred to Don Dobie's career in politics. At that time the Cronulla&hyphen;Caringbah area was part of the seat of Hughes which had been held by Les Johnson ever since it had been created in 1955. Previous Liberal candidates had rolled up at elections and been unsuccessful. Hughes was regarded as a pretty safe, solid Labor Party seat. Unfortunately for the Labor Party, but fortunately for Don Dobie, in 1966 the great swing against the ALP, largely due to the Vietnam issue, saw Les defeated and Don Dobie elected as the member for Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very surprising result but, of course, at that time it was a landslide against the Labor Party. I also recall&mdash;and I say this out of fondness for Don&mdash;that even he was surprised at the result, as indeed the current member for Hughes was probably pretty surprised at the result earlier this year. I know that there were other people in the Liberal Party, locally, who wished they had put their hand up but did not think that the seat was winnable. Anyway, Don was the candidate and Don won the seat. Don then set about becoming a household name in the Cronulla&hyphen;Caringbah area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1969 the seat was split and the new seat of Cook was created. Don, quite wisely, chose that seat to further his political career and he won the seat of Cook in 1969. As pointed out, in 1972 he lost the seat for a short period of time until 1975 and then won it back again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two humorous things I remember about Don. Firstly, as correctly referred to, he was made the assistant minister to the Prime Minister by Billy McMahon when he became Prime Minister in, I think, 1971. In the Sutherland shire area everybody knew Don Dobie as the assistant Prime Minister. The term `assistant to the Prime Minister' was appropriately shortened to `assistant Prime Minister'. Don was never guilty of calling <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> himself that. Nevertheless, I think he also enjoyed the higher honour that people in the area bestowed upon him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I recall that after he won the seat back in 1975, he continued to hold it with ever increasing majorities, due very much to his local popularity. Don Dobie was just a very popular member throughout that area. It was not until 1983 that he again was in any danger of losing the seat and I think in that year he won it by around 61 votes&mdash;it was very close. So the seat of Cook was once again marginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the next time around, the Labor Party, I believe, got it wrong when we picked the wrong candidate to run against Don in 1984. Many of you will probably have seen the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Democracy</EMPHASIS>, which is the saga of the preselection for the seat of Cook. Don actually had a brief but starring role in that movie, which was about the 1984 election. Of course, our new candidate believed that he was going to take a 61&hyphen;seat defeat, turn it around and win it. But Don had a terrific win, in his terms, and went on to effectively make Cook a pretty solid, safe seat for the Liberal Party thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that I am now the duty senator for Cook, having succeeded Bruce Childs and Senator Faulkner. We seem to have a long line of duty senators for the seat of Cook. That is due, no doubt, to the legacy of Don Dobie, who, as somebody said, was the quintessential local politician and local member, who served his electorate well for many years. I found it somewhat ironic that, having been an activist in the ALP at a very young age when Don went in and having dreamt in those days of being a member of parliament, when I finally arrived, Don was still here. That was a pretty big tribute, I think, to his service to the community and to the parliament, as has been recognised by other speakers. I join with other speakers in supporting this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

Don had some very close family friends in Townsville, and he would often drop into my office to lend encouragement during his visits to the north.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before putting the motion, I wish to speak briefly. This morning, at the Presbyterian church in Cronulla, I attended the thanksgiving service for the life of Don Dobie. Senators have spoken of Don's service to his community, and had you been there this morning and seen the number of organisations represented&mdash;many in blazers with pockets indicating the groups they belong to&mdash;you would have been left in no doubt about the way he was regarded in the electorate of Cook. There was representation from the surf&hyphen;lifesaving club, in particular, where there was to be a reception afterwards for those who were able to attend; from scouts, guides, schoolchildren; from older and younger people. Clearly, from the grief and emotion at the service, it was very obvious that what has been said today is absolutely true. The story recounted just now by Senator Forshaw about Don being assistant to the Prime Minister was also recounted there and enjoyed by those in the church, many of whom, of course, remembered those days.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For most of my time since I came to the Senate, I have been the only Liberal senator for the ACT, and that was sufficient for a man like Don Dobie to take an interest in me, knowing I had no other party colleagues from my own area. He always took the sort of interest that Senator Ian Macdonald has referred to in relation to himself. I valued the friendship that grew. I did serve on two joint standing committees with him and had the opportunity to know him and to appreciate his work as a local member&mdash;which I tried to emulate&mdash;his skill as a parliamentarian and his commitment to the parliament and what it meant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mourn his passing. Although we all knew he had suffered from diabetes for a long time, I do not think any of us expected the end to come so soon. It was a heart attack in the end, but I think we all would realise that it was the diabetes that was the underlying problem that he had. I think we all would have imagined him living on for a number of years, enjoying travelling, as he did. It is sad that he has died so soon after leaving the parliament. This morning many people mourned his passing but gave thanks for what he had done for them over so many years. I invite senators to stand and signify their support for the motion by their silence.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government expresses its appreciation to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee for its report on the development of a system of national citizenship indicators and benchmarks. The Government recognises that a sound system of social statistics is vital to the  effective development of social policy, to informed decision making on policy issues and to the evaluation of the impact of social and economic policy. Reliable and well focused social statistics are also vital for informing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public debate both within countries and at an international level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the Committee's report provides useful recommendations for further developing the extensive array of information already available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), agencies such as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) and the  Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC), and the many other Commonwealth and State agencies involved in the compilation and analysis of social statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The thrust of the Committee's recommendations is generally supported, although any new initiatives that may arise from proposed review activities will need to be considered within the context of normal budget review processes. The ABS will seek further submissions from State and Commonwealth government agencies to inform these processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Bureau of Statistics be resourced to carry out a two stage audit of its collection of statistics on human well&hyphen;being with the aim of identifying the areas where potentially valuable nationally consistent data is not available. The second stage of the audit should concentrate on ways that the identified `gaps' can be remedied. Relevant bodies, such as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Institute of Criminology, should be involved in both stages of the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts the on&hyphen;going need for the ABS to audit national statistical collection activities, with reference to other agencies such as the AIHW and AIC. This will ensure the availability of statistics on  human well&hyphen;being to support the government and community in the  development and evaluation of policies and programs. While additional  funding might expedite the audit process the Government is satisfied that existing processes within the ABS will address the Committee's concerns. The Government therefore does not intend to provide additional funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Comment: </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes that the ABS, other agencies charged with informing debate on issues of social concern (such as AIWH and AIC) and many other agencies at both Commonwealth and State levels, produce a vast array of  social statistics. In 1996 the ABS alone expects to publish 36 titles relating to social topics, including labour force, education, child care, women, Indigenous people, sport and recreation, health, crime and justice, and income distribution. An indication of the breadth of information available is evident from the annual Australian Social Trends publication (ABS Catalogue 4102.0) which presents social statistics and indica <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6423"> tors from both the ABS's own collection program and from other sources. The range of available data reflects the interests and priorities of the community and government in addressing issues of ongoing social concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the central statistical authority, the ABS has the task of  co&hyphen;ordinating government statistical services as well as collecting and compiling statistics across the broad range of population, social and labour statistics. Many other agencies, at both Commonwealth and State levels, also have responsibility for statistics in a particular area or produce statistics for and about their own administration. In these cases, the ABS seeks to coordinate the activities of the other agencies, placing particular importance on statistical standards and classifications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ABS Review of Social and Labour Statistics, published in 1990, assessed levels of demand and unmet need for statistical information taking into account the full range of statistical activities and responsibilities of other agencies at State and Commonwealth levels. This comprehensive review, involving extensive consultation with key stakeholders, has been complemented by an on&hyphen;going program of reviews in various areas. These continuing audit processes identify information gaps and the strength of demand for such information. They assist in setting priorities within the ABS work program for the provision of timely and relevant information taking account of the costs associated with meeting those needs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indicators and benchmarks are currently being developed in a number of areas. The COAG review of Commonwealth/State service provision has as its main task the development of agreed national performance indicators for  key services delivered by governments. The first annual report of the review, `Report on Government Service Provision: 1995' was released on 20  December 1995. It examined the effectiveness and efficiency of the following social services:  public acute care hospitals, public rental housing, primary and secondary education, vocational education and  training, police, courts administration, corrective services and support services for individuals and families. The review will report annually with the second report to be released in February 1997. Furthermore, and as noted in the Senate Committee's report, the Government has also given attention to development of benchmarks of adequacy as a basis for monitoring well&hyphen;being. These have direct relevance to income support programmes. More recently, Commonwealth, State and Territory  governments have agreed to the development of a set of benchmarks for primary school literacy and plan to conduct surveys to determine whether  those benchmarks are being reached. These developments complement those associated with the current review of performance information (being co&hyphen;ordinated by the Department of Finance) which aims to improve the clarity of objectives, and associated performance indicators, for the activities of Commonwealth Departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4 proposes steps towards implementing a National System of Indicators and Benchmarks. While additional resources will not be  committed to this task, the Government considers that the ABS, as the  national statistical agency, is best placed to perform the role of drawing together and reporting on the indicators of social well&hyphen;being and associated benchmarks, as they develop over time (Recommendation 4a).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee presented to the parliament in April of this year is one of the many legacies of former Senator Spindler.

<PARA>The response mentions the government service provision report which was released on 20 December 1995.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that more information is necessary to ensure that people with mental disorders and associated psychiatric disability receive access to appropriate health and family services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the NMHS, a "National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing" is currently being developed (see also the response to recommendation 6). The survey is expected to estimate how many Australians have specific mental disorders, what disablement is associated with these disorders, and what use is made of health and family services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The survey is expected to be conducted in early 1997. Survey results will be available for analysis. Subject to the continuing development of the survey design, the survey results are expected to enable some assessment of the number of people with a psychiatric disability requiring access to support services to help them sort out practical issues such as housing and money problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Home and Community Care (HACC) Program provides financial assistance to basic maintenance and support services for people living in the community who are at risk of premature or inappropriate long&hyphen;term residential care. The Program is not currently aimed at funding specialist psychiatric services. The presence or absence of psychiatric disability, per se, is not taken into account in determining a person's need for services funded under the HACC Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The demand for HACC funded services is estimated using data on recipients of HACC services, together with Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on moderately, severely or profoundly handicapped people living in households. It is possible to use ABS data on moderately, severely or profoundly handicapped people in households to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6427"> establish how many people living in the community have a difficulty or need personal help or supervision with self care, mobility and verbal communication.People with a psychiatric disability would be included in this population and some of those people would require access to appropriate HACC funded services. However, as the HACC Program does not fund specific disability services, where services would be specialist or intensive in nature, the need for information about the nature of a person's disability, as opposed to the level of that person's handicap, is not really relevant for effective service planning and delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HACC funded services are but one part of a network of support available to those in need and the demand for HACC services is influenced by the dynamics of this network. Accordingly, data obtained on the numbers of people with a particular level of disability or handicap, are not necessarily indicative of a need for HACC funded services. A range of other factors, including the availability of informal support, as well as the cost effectiveness of community versus residential care, must be taken into account.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key point is that, under the Commonwealth/ State Disability Agreement (CSDA), state and territory governments are responsible for the administration of accommodation and other support services for people with a disability (other than nursing homes and hostels for aged people), while the Commonwealth is responsible for the administration of employment services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement gives both levels of government (Commonwealth and state and territory) joint responsibility for funding disability services, but does not provide for funds to be tied to particular services, models of service or target groups.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review is being conducted by an independent consultant, Professor Anna Yeatman, of Macquarie University, who will report to the Commonwealth and state and territory ministers for disability services. An interim report was published in February 1996, with a final report due to ministers in      mid 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations of the Report on "Psychotherapeutic Medication in Australia" have been passed to Professor Yeatman for consideration in the context of her review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the objectives of the NMHS is to increase the number and range of community&hyphen;based supported accommodation services to ensure a level of support which is appropriate to the needs of consumers. State and territory governments may use mental health reform and incentive funding (provided by the Commonwealth) to enhance these services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Mental Health Forum on Intersectoral Linkages (established by health, housing and community services ministers at both Commonwealth and state and territory levels) examined the effectiveness of existing links between the health, housing and disability services sectors in meeting the needs of people with mental illness and associated psychiatric disability. The Forum's report (entitled "Report of the Mental Health Forum on Intersectoral Linkages&mdash;July 1995") contains 24 recommendations to enhance linkages between these three sectors at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6428"> Commonwealth, state/territory and regional/local levels. The report was accepted by ministers and consideration is being given on how best to implement the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a broader housing context, the Department of Health and Family Services (HFS) recognises the importance of appropriate accommodation services for homeless people with a psychiatric disability, or for people at risk of homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence, HFS is funding several boarding house pilot projects from SAAP reform funds to provide outreach services for people in boarding houses, particularly those with a psychiatric disability. The people assisted through these pilots are recognised as very vulnerable in terms of possibly falling into homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While SAAP services are available to people with a psychiatric disability, the legislation which governs SAAP specifies that the program is unable to provide or duplicate services and assistance which are the responsibility of any other government programs or services (unless otherwise agreed jointly by the Commonwealth and state or territory ministers). Examples of such services include those which cater predominantly for clients requiring substitute care or specialised clinical treatment, or exclusive services for people with a disability (including psychiatric disability).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in recognition of the fact that a significant number of people currently using SAAP services do have psychiatric problems, the Commonwealth has directed that a proportion of SAAP reform moneys be directed to developing better ways of meeting the needs of these clients. Through the introduction of quality case management standards generally in SAAP, greater emphasis will be placed on ensuring that clients with mental illness and psychiatric disability are effectively linked with existing support and specialist services, both state and Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the specific mental health projects, 10 other RHSET projects (at a cost of $422,700) have been funded to increase the knowledge and skills of rural pharmacists and other health care providers in the use of medications, of which psychotherapeutic medications are an important component.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In opening my comments I would remind everybody that the report on psychotherapeutic medication in Australia was the last report in which the late Senator Olive <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Zakharov had any involvement. As we all know, she had a major interest&mdash;like you, Madam Acting Deputy President Patterson&mdash;in the area of psychology, and it was an interest that was dear to her heart. Unfortunately, she died before the report was able to be presented. Today we have the tabling of the government response to this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at the response to this report&mdash;the committee was given two copies under embargo&mdash;the first thing that strikes me is that on the front page is the date `July 1996'. I know the response has been a long time in coming, but I would ask: what the devil has the government been doing with a government response to a report dated July 1996? It is now December; four full months have elapsed. The government has presumably sat on this report doing nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look inside the response document, I am quite heartened to see that the government has accepted most of our recommendations, but there are several that it does not accept. It does not support recommendation No. 15 and only partly supports recommendation No. 12. The government says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While agreeing with the principles behind recommendation 15 the Government does not support the specific reporting and data collection activities associated with this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 15 is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That reports be made available by the Department of Human Services and Health&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as it then was called&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to determine:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the percentage of re&hyphen;admissions resulting primarily from a failure to take medication; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the percentage of re&hyphen;admissions resulting, primarily, from other factors such as shortage of required support services in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>The response document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not support this recommendation in its current form, but it will take into account re&hyphen;admission factors in developing indicators and targets for future reporting.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that, when you are dealing with psychotherapeutic medication for people with mental illness, it would be an elementary necessity to have some indication, some quantifiable data, as to the level of non-compliance with medication taking, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6442"> readmission rate to hospital, and the other factors that are involved in this. This is elementary in the provision of a mental health scheme, in the use of psychotherapeutic medication. In fact, it should be elementary in the use of all medication. We know there are interactions between different drugs. We know that some drugs potentiate the action of others and that some drugs impede the action of others. This is elementary sort of material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We frequently hear figures thrown around that such and such a percentage of people in hospital are there because of drug interactions or drug reactions or failure to take medication. We need to have those figures quantified. Somewhere along the line the government is going to have to bite the bullet and actually get some understanding of just how great this problem is. We know that there are a number of these sorts of drugs being used in nursing homes for people who have dementia and for the confused elderly. What we need to understand more is just what the interaction is with those drugs. We need to have a greater understanding of the fact that, as people get older, their requirements for the dose rate may well change, and we need to know about the drug interactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to be conscious that in some areas we could have people using this heavy medication&mdash;or any medication&mdash;as opposed to an alternative therapy. There are a number of nursing homes and hostels dealing with confused elderly and people with dementia who are relying on a policy of hugs, not drugs, for the care of these people. It is vitally important that we make sure that health professionals of all types understand that, while drug use is very important on occasions, there are occasions when alternative therapies can very easily be tried and can have a very advantageous effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also only partly agreed with recommendation 12, which related to providing information in annual reports on measures undertaken to ensure that prescribed drugs are the most appropriate available for the individual and for the condition and details of procedures for monitoring patients on long-term medication. In the committee's travels to the Northern Territory, during the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> brief inquiry that they did have, they came across a gentleman who had been on lithium for a considerable number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lithium is an excellent drug for the treatment of the condition that this gentleman had, but nobody at any stage in those years that he had been on the drug had done a blood lithium level to monitor just what the drug level was in his system. All psychiatrists, who utilise this therapy a lot, will tell you that you should be monitoring the lithium levels in the blood regularly. But this gentleman had gone for years and years without having his blood lithium levels monitored. Fortunately, he was obviously on a reasonable dose because it was not having adverse effects. He was able to cope and was managing to live in society very well. But there could well have been occasions when this was not the case. It behoves everybody to be conscious of these types of problems that can come with the use of drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to one of the committee's earlier recommendations. Recommendation 3 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That appropriate accommodation services be a priority for people with psychiatric disability. Such services must address the needs of people in all age groups.</PARA>
<PARA>The response reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation in&hyphen;principle, although the provision of housing and accommodation support for people with psychiatric disability is primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA>This comment is very interesting in light of the current budget. I would not be making these comments if this response had been tabled prior to the budget because I would not have known about them. In the budget we saw a tightening in a number of aspects of accommodation, such as rent assistance. There are a lot of people with psychiatric illnesses or other disabilities who are in the community sharing rented accommodation. They are single people who will be affected badly by the legislation that has been brought in to implement the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice in this response that a review of disability services was being conducted by an independent consultant, Professor Anna Yeatman of Macquarie University, who will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6443"> report to the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers for disability services. It states that an interim report was published in February 1996, with a final report due to ministers in mid&hyphen;1996. Because this response is so out of date, it is very hard to find the various reports and reviews that are spoken about here as occurring some time ago and to get them collated together. This is going to lead to a lot more questions being asked in the estimates committee hearings. If this had been a timely document, it would have greatly helped those of us who are involved in estimates. Recommendation 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That there be a specific program to facilitate the awareness of psychiatric illness in rural, regional and remote communities. This should include education and information packages on psychotherapeutic medication . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is all very good. In the response, the government acknowledges the need for improved access. What the government does not tell us&mdash;if this had been out before the budget, we would have been happy about it&mdash;is that there has been a general attack on health funding to the states. That must impact negatively upon the health services available in rural and remote areas, especially mental health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mental health is not seen in the medical and health fields as one of the `sexier' areas, for want of a better word. It is an area where people have a chronic illness which is recurrent in crises. It is an area that does not attract glamour. What are we going to see? Prior to this government's budget, mental health was already at the bottom of the pecking order. It is going to be further under attack by this government's attacks on health funding to people, particularly in the public health sector. This is a group of people who predominantly utilise the public health sector. They will be suffering very greatly from the attacks upon health. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today I table the committee's fourth report since September this year. It examines 17 non-controversial treaties which were tabled on 15 and 29 October 1996.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Two other treaties tabled on 15 October are not dealt with in this report: Protocol IV (dealing with blinding laser weapons) and the amended Protocol II (dealing with landmines) to the Inhumane Weapons Convention. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was advised soon after tabling that the committee would undertake a short inquiry into these important documents, and will report on them as early as practicable in 1997.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The committee supports ratification of all the treaties dealt with in this report. It makes only one formal recommendation: that Australia should press for the extension of the convention on nuclear safety to include research reactors of the type at Lucas Heights in New South Wales.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today's tabling provides an opportunity to review our first few months' work, which I am sure all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members would agree have been interesting and productive. In the four reports, we have covered a total of 50 treaties, commenting specifically on 28 of these. Productive as our first few months have been, we are still establishing our own processes as we aim towards a consistent approach.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We have found that certain types of treaties, such as investment protection agreements or air services agreements, are occurring in successive batches. Unless examples vary from model texts, we will not be commenting specifically on some of these in future reports.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Although the treaties dealt with in this report were all non&hyphen;controversial, they did raise some issues which deserve comment. We continue to have concerns about both the quantity and quality of consultation with the states and territories. As this report reiterates, the revised treaty-making process announced on May 2 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs was established in part to ensure inclusion of the views of the states and territories on treaties proposed for ratification. They have legal responsibilities for some of the matters on which the commonwealth enters into binding international obligations for Australia.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We have not made a recommendation on this matter, but we believe that national interest analyses should in future include information on the actual responses received from the states and territories about the texts of treaties proposed for accession.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">For example, examination of one of the treaties in the group tabled on 15 October revealed that an important industry organisation had not been consulted. Although support was forthcoming from that organisation, as the result of the committee's review process, this oversight was a matter of concern.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Just as the committee has had to establish and adjust its own processes in a short time, so the coordinating activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade need a chance to settle down. This includes our suggestions for making further administrative improvements to the revised treaty-making process. However, we will be devoting some attention in future to assuring ourselves that, as far as possible, appropriate consultation has taken place with all the interested parties.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In its short existence, the committee has dealt with a wide range and large number of treaties. It might be said that we have not provided much time for an input by the community. To some extent, this is true. Under the revised procedures, we aim to table reports on treaties as close as possible to the end of the 15 sitting day period specified in the resolution of both houses.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">So far, there have been six tablings of various numbers of treaties under the new arrangements, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6445"> and the `15 sitting day' rule has made it difficult to seek and receive comments or submissions on these documents.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the case of our 3rd report, two international agreements on tuna which was tabled two weeks ago, we were able to seek, and received, substantial community comments. We then held public hearings and inspections in Canberra, Hobart, Perth, Port Lincoln and Adelaide. Many organisations and individuals with an interest in the tuna industry gave us their knowledge and experience. We believe that the report has not only made a contribution to the treaty-making process, but also to the Australian tuna industry. We thank ordinary Australians for making that possible.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The level of response to this relatively simple inquiry demonstrated the genuine interest in the treaty-making process throughout Australia. It would be a mistake to assume that treaty-making can now be conducted in isolation from the  Australian community.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thus, we believe that we are already fulfilling the purpose for which we were established: to provide parliamentary scrutiny of the treaties Australia proposes to enter, before these documents are ratified. As the committee and its work becomes more widely known, we expect community interest in and responses to our work to grow. In 1997, we hope that the sitting pattern will allow us more time to seek the appropriate responses.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In particular, I would like to place on record the committee's appreciation for the cooperation and assistance it has received from all the ministers and their departments with whom and with which we have dealt.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I want to thank my deputy chair, the hon member for Barton, and all members of the committee for their interest and participation in the work of what was certainly the newest and arguably the busiest committee of the parliament in 1996.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A committee depends heavily on its secretariat, and I thank Peter Stephens and his team for their alacrity and professionalism under testing conditions.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I have great pleasure in tabling the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's report on  Australia's relations with Southern Africa.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry commenced in April 1995 under the very able chairmanship of Mr Colin Hollis, MP and had progressed to report stage when the election was called in January 1996. Following the re-establishment of the Committee we reviewed the evidence gathered and agreed to conclude the inquiry. The Minister for Foreign Affairs formally re-referred the inquiry in August 1996, updated evidence was sought, and the report is now before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry focused on Australia's relations with those countries that make up the Southern African Development Community, or SADC. There are 12 member states: Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland, Tanzania, South Africa and Mauritius.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the difficulties facing the Committee during the inquiry was that submissions largely focused on South Africa, and to a lesser extent Zimbabwe and Mozambique. This may be due to the limited knowledge in Australia of many of the smaller African countries, but it is also a reflection of the dominant role of South Africa in the region. We took particular care, however, to stress in our hearings that we were not conducting an inquiry into just South Africa, but that we wanted more broadly to examine Australia's contacts with the region as a whole. As honourable senators would appreciate, looking at 12 countries was a fairly challenging task as there is enormous diversity among the SADC members. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6446"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we note in the report, unfortunately many Australians still perceive Africa in terms of stereotypes. When the media reports on Africa, it tends to show the ethnic conflicts, such as we have seen recently in Rwanda and Zaire, or humanitarian emergencies arising from civil war or drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to this perception, there are many success stories still to be told, and Southern Africa has more than its share. The region has been described as a `beacon of hope' in Africa, and certainly there is much that we should applaud, particularly in the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Southern Africa is one of the most democratic regions in Africa, with successful multi-party elections having been held recently in Malawi, Mozambique and Namibia and complemented by South Africa's transition to a multi-racial democracy. While the successes to date have been encouraging, there is no reason to be complacent&mdash;much remains to be done, and the peace in both Mozambique and Angola remains fragile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, for us all it is South Africa and the remarkable transformation that is occurring in that country that holds the key to the region's future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few commentators a decade ago would have believed that the South Africa of today was possible. Much of the successful transition to a multi-part democracy can be attributed to President Nelson Mandela. While he did not do it alone, President Mandela was crucial to the whole process, and remains a potent moral symbol for the new South Africa, and indeed for the whole African continent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some have expressed concern about South Africa after President Mandela, and it is true that South Africa will be at its most vulnerable in the lead up to the 1999 elections, in which President Mandela has indicated he will not stand. However, there is a depth of talent among the various political parties in South Africa that augers well for the future. The Committee was fortunate to meet both Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, and then Vice President F W de Klerk during their separate visits to Australia in the first half of 1995. Although from very different political backgrounds both men showed a commitment to peaceful reform in South Africa and the role Mr de Klerk played in achieving change should not be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Negotiations on the draft South African Constitution have demonstrated a willingness by most participants to work within the system to achieve the best possible outcome. It is of concern that the Inkatha Freedom Party under Chief Buthelezi, while part of the Government of National Unity, did not participate in the constitutional reform process and is still seeking a high degree of autonomy for the KwaZulu/Natal province. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Africa faces a number of significant economic problems, and its economic success is vital not only for its own population, but because of the central role the South African economy plays in Africa. To quote from Austrade's submission, South Africa:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">produces 42% of Africa's industrial output</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">generates 60% of Africa's power</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">produces 75% of Africa's iron and steel</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">mines 40% of Africa's minerals</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">carries 65% of Africa's total freight</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">produces 40% of Africa's food</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">drives 40% of Africa's cars and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">uses 40% of Africa's telephones.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Africa is rich in natural resources, has a good infrastructure, and a well established corporate sector. However, it has a narrow export base, large sections of the population are unskilled and uneducated, unemployment is about 45% and a significant number of highly skilled South Africans have emigrated during the past 20 years. It is clear, therefore, that the challenge lies ahead for the leaders of South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After many years of comparative isolation, it is encouraging to note the positive role that South Africa is prepared in play in its immediate region. It is remarkable to see the former Front Line states, once the target of destabilisation by apartheid South Africa, now working closely with their old enemy to bring about greater economic integration and prosperity. Cooperation is well advanced in areas such as power generation, transport and communications, and environmental management. SADC is redefining itself, and South Africa is playing an important role in that process. The organisation is beginning to take on a regional security dimension, and the Committee has made a number of recommendations on assistance to SADC to encourage its development and strengthen its institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is much that I could speak on today&mdash;the business opportunities for Australian companies in southern Africa; the educational links that are being established between Australian universities and those in the SADC countries, the involvement of a number of the SADC states in the Indian Ocean Rim processes, both governmental and `second-track; Australia's development assistance program in Southern Africa and the real need that exists and will continue to exist for many years to come. However, time is too short to do more than refer honourable senators to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I conclude by thanking all of the individuals, NGOs, academics and business groups who assisted the Committee in its work. The Committee was particularly pleased to receive a number of submissions from Southern African <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6447"> countries and we hope the report reflects something of their concerns and viewpoint. I would also like to thank the honourable member for Groom who, as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Sub&hyphen;Committee, saw this report through to its conclusion in this Parliament, and to all the members who participated in the inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The inquiry which resulted in this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was started under the previous government. A separate subcommittee was set up as part of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. It was considered to be important enough to set up a subcommittee on Africa because southern Africa, and Africa in general, is one of those areas in relation to which there is a fairly large gap in the knowledge of many parliamentarians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My remarks relate mainly to the issue of the original terms of reference. It was a concern which was shared by a number of the community groups who also wrote to the committee. The terms of reference were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To investigate and report on Australia's political, security and trade interests in Southern Africa in the Post Apartheid era, in such areas as:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the role of Africa in Australia's global interests&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of course, these days, read `trade interests'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's bilateral interests in key African countries&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>read `trade interests'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">how Australia might be in a position to contribute to the improving regional security environment;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">trade and investment opportunities for Australia, including niche markets.</PARA>
<PARA>There are sub&hyphen;topics, but, largely, the irony in relation to Australia and Africa is that Australia's aid relationship, which has been of concern to a lot of community groups, is inversely proportional to the per capita income of many countries. It seems that aid is often used as a means of attracting trade or being involved with trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is very sad, because we really have not had an opportunity to look at whether Australia's aid program is meeting the need <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of addressing poverty in Africa or southern Africa. By dealing simply with the SADC countries, we have probably avoided dealing with many of the countries which are suffering some of the biggest shifts and upheavals. The problems are economic and social, and they end up being ones that involve loss of life and also some very serious environmental problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee dealt with some of these problems, but unfortunately, because of cutbacks, we no longer have an Africa subcommittee; it ended up being sent to the foreign affairs subcommittee of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. I think it is quite sad that we put less emphasis on that area due to cutbacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think it is important that at some time in the future we look at some of the issues relating to Australia's relationship with Africa. We should look at some of the political issues so that in the future Australia does not feel that it needs to support, or otherwise, an international military effort into parts of Africa, in order to try to sort out a huge social and military dilemma, when we have so very little understanding of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is time for the Australian parliament to look further into those areas. It is time for us also to look at the connections between economic policies and some of the other issues that eventuate from that, be they social upheaval or even environmental upheaval. I am pleased that, at my request, on page 143 of the report there is a small section on environmental issues. It was pointed out to the committee on a number of occasions that there seemed to be a connection between structural adjustment programs as a result of internationalism and the impact of World Bank and IMF programs. At page 143 of the report, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has happened with the structural adjustment programs, by and large, is that they have tended to pressure countries to export more of their agricultural produce . . . It has also pushed agriculture into very marginal areas . . . and that has stressed the land . . . [It] has not been done in a way that is in any way environmentally sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The report also quotes from Marter and Gordon's `Emerging issues confronting the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6448"> renewable natural resources sector in sub&hyphen;Saharan Africa' in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Food Policy</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of urbanisation, the proportion of population not producing its own food is rising fast and has profound implications for the region's food security. Urbanisation also raises major issues with regard to pollution. Air pollution associated with vehicle emissions and industry, solid waste, most of which is not collected or treated, contaminated water supplies, will all have serious implications for public health. The failure of many structural adjustment policies to date is attributable to the failure to address such issues effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that we start seeing those connections, whether in nearby regions or in Africa, and start building them into our support structures and looking beyond our base desire to make money out of a particular area of the world. We need to start looking at what kinds of decisions of a political or military nature Australia might be required to make in the future and try to understand what the issues are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very rare in Africa that a drought is simply a drought. There is often some political and military story behind it which exacerbates the situation, leading to extra pressure on the land. There has been a history of people moving to areas or being forced to use areas that should not be used because of climatic conditions, and the creation of deserts where deserts did not exist before. It is important for us to understand such things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are still way short of that level of understanding. We, as a parliament, need to be able to make decisions in relation to these issues. I certainly hope that in the future we take the opportunity of going past the desire simply to make money from trade and look at what are the real issues affecting Africa which might spill over into decisions required to be made in this parliament. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, when the debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1996 was adjourned last week I was explaining that the Australian Democrats support the immediate increase in funding to ANTA, an increase of around $13 million for 1996. But I was dismayed by the then budget changes to the 1997 and 1998 funding of ANTA, which will see ANTA lose funds of around $58 million&mdash;$57.5 million&mdash;over the next couple of years. I think that is very sad. It is an indictment of this government's commitment to vocational education and training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we are set to debate further changes to the education sector&mdash;specifically, changes to the higher education sector&mdash;and last week we saw quite radical changes to schools policy and schools funding. That all sends a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6449"> very warped message to the community about the commitment that this government has to the pursuit of academic excellence and to vocational education and training integrity and excellence. I find it hard to understand why, at this time in our history, when we have unemployment rates of around 8.7 per cent, we seek to cut the funding available to a sector that would allow people to develop the skills that would improve their employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I also mentioned my concern about the notion of efficiency dividends. A lot of funding cuts in this bill come in the guise of an efficiency dividend. Last week I pondered whether that was economic jargon to enable us to make quite drastic cuts in funding to a range of institutions in this country, or whether it honestly led to increased viability, efficiency or productivity in the TAFE and higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder why this government has chosen to apply a five per cent efficiency dividend to TAFE when all other Commonwealth own purpose outlays and specific purpose payments will be subject to only a three per cent efficiency dividend in the first year, with an additional one per cent efficiency dividend in each succeeding year. I wonder why TAFE has been singled out in this way. It is at odds with a government that talks about creating real jobs and getting Australians back into the work force. I wonder how we can expect people to get back into the work force by developing their skills when we are cutting the funds available to vocational education in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Training has a crucial role to play. It is fundamental to ensuring that workers' skills are compatible with the jobs available. Anyone with an understanding of how labour markets work would agree that it is difficult to overstate the importance of vocational education and training and the creation of a highly skilled and highly employable work force. That is why the Democrats strongly voice their objection to the cuts proposed for ANTA and the funding cuts to the labour market program that have also been a part of this government's budget.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to labour market programs run far deeper than any five per cent efficiency dividend. In fact, funding for labour market programs in this country will be slashed by $1.8 billion over the next four years, with $574.7 million being slashed from labour market programs in 1996-97 alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Democrats do not believe that the government is going to find its answers to solving the massive problem of unemployment in this country by slashing vocational and educational training funding as well as funding that is available to labour market programs. We believe that these government policies will fail to provide a lasting solution to unemployment because they are primarily driven by a theoretical economic model which does not make sense because it does not take into account the needs of real people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What real people need in this country is access to skills development, and access to jobs and training programs which are linked to real jobs&mdash;something that Senator Vanstone talked about this afternoon in the chamber. However, the rhetoric that we have heard from government ministers and backbenchers is not met by any reality&mdash;certainly is not matched with any funding commitment. My understanding is that former Senator Robert Bell from the Australian Democrats was very much involved&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I would like to acknowledge Senator Macdonald's suggestion that Senator Bell was&mdash;and is still&mdash;a great man. He was very involved in the Senate Employment, Education and Training committee report of the inquiry into the Australian National Training Authority which was tabled in November 1995. One of the recommendations put forward in the dissenting report, in the minority report, was that funding to ANTA and certainly to vocational education and training generally should be at least maintained, and certainly increased if that was available. I urge those members of the department and the government to read through and perhaps refresh themselves with the recommendations in that committee report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6450">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware also of a recommendation to which I believe ALP and Democrat senators did agree, and that was the notion of increasing the composition of the ANTA board by two members, from the current five members to seven members. That, I understand, is an amendment that is being put forward today by the coalition. However, there are a few problems with the government's amendment. As I understand it&mdash;and I look forward to enlightenment on this if I have it wrong&mdash;the motivation behind this government amendment, that is, the intention of increasing the board by two members, is to put two more representatives from the business sector on the ANTA board. That is unfortunate because it runs contrary to a Democrat recommendation in the dissenting report. That is, the committee recommends that an independent education and training specialist be appointed to the board of ANTA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale behind the original recommendation of increasing the board from five to seven members was to ensure broad representation on that board, not to make it top heavy with business and industry representatives but to include independent educationalists and, as I understand it, trade union members and members with, in one case, regional and rural backgrounds. So I look forward to finding out progress on those recommendations. Generally I would be keen to find out how the recommendations from that Senate committee have been or are being implemented. Perhaps a report on their progress for the Senate would be appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Australian Democrats will not be supporting the government amendment as it currently stands. But I am happy to listen to the minister's statement and in the committee stage be swayed by argument if I have got it wrong. If the intent behind the amendment to increase the board's membership is to ensure that there is that kind of broad representation on the board then I will be happy to reconsider the Democrat position. But we stand by our recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I hope that the government can ensure that independent educationalists and certainly people with broad backgrounds are appointed to the ANTA board. The Australian Demo crats again voice our concern that this government's agenda does not seem to include allowing people access to skills development and education&mdash;education on the basis of merit and brains and not bank balance&mdash;at a time when we have such high levels of unemployment and such high levels of youth unemployment specifically and when such massive and drastic cuts are being made to education and training in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.05 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has been trying its hardest in this bill to cover up the extent of its cuts to vocational education and training. They focus on the relative spending from year to year instead of facing up to the enormous cuts to projected spending. We do not know how deeply these cuts go beyond 1997 as the 1998 funding decisions have not yet been revealed. This bill is touted by the government to provide a $10.6 million increase in 1997 compared with the 1996 funding. However, the lies are exposed when one considers the projected funding for 1997 of $927.2 million, which has been cut by around $58 million to a new figure of $869.7 million. This perhaps is a further extension of the pattern by the previous government where they underspent in a number of portfolios to pretend that they were not cutting expenditure. They looked at the actual expenditure rather than projections. This seems to be a further creative accounting way of looking at or presenting figures so they do not look like cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also establishing a pattern of hiding behind these figures. We know that these are big cuts for ANTA and bodies in receipt of the funding. The government, however, is providing minimal detail and sticking to dollar terms that cannot articulate what the impact will be on the ground. The $57.5 million is actually $45 million in real cuts because there is a transfer of $12.5 million for workplace coordinators to another portfolio. Out of the real cuts $19 million is a cut of ANTA national projects from $42 million down to $23 million in 1997; $10 million is the abolition of the interstate cooperative projects; $27 million is a cut from capital funding from TAFE and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6451"> private provider training infrastructure such as industry based skills centres and $4.5 million is a so-called `efficiency dividend'&mdash;read `cut'&mdash;to the off-the-job training for traineeships state by state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been calculated that the real figure is somewhere around cuts of $170 million over four years to ANTA. This is on top of the $1.8 billion cuts to the labour market programs and the TAFE efficiency dividends which are found in the appropriations bills alongside the cuts to industry training bodies or ITABs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the limited information available, I have tried to shed some light on who will actually be affected. It appears that the major cuts of $27 million for capital infrastructure will have a deleterious effect on TAFE's ability to provide courses to industry. This comes on top of the cuts in growth funding to TAFE and the five per cent so&hyphen;called efficiency dividend. Outside of the TAFE system, the cuts will also particularly affect industry based skill centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ANTA's national projects budget will be halved from $42 million to $23 million in 1997. This will cut many research and development projects such as those on how to implement equity measures for individual client groups, develop management and statistical information systems, develop quality curriculum, and provide incentives for best practice and a number of literacy and numeracy projects for the workplace and within schools. It is unfortunate to see the budget halved for projects which set standards and consistent models across states and provide the basis for equity and education projects which improve the accessibility and effectiveness of training to disadvantaged client groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further major cuts include $10 million by abolishing the interstate cooperative projects. These are particularly alarming, because they not only facilitate interstate cooperation, but provide a lot of equity and proactive training projects in disadvantaged, rural, isolated and Aboriginal communities. The government's response to these cuts is that the states should pick up this kind of work. However, it obviously was not being done before, which is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> why the federal government had to step in in the first place. There is no guarantee that any of these projects will be picked up by the states. Has anyone seen extra money going to the states to allow them to pick these projects up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In New South Wales, the cross&hyphen;border project on the Queensland&hyphen;New South Wales, Gold Coast&hyphen;Tweed Heads border was receiving $1.8 million to teach a range of office, hospitality, business and Aboriginal studies. Also in New South Wales, the wide area learning project was a joint New South Wales&hyphen;Queensland project delivering training to isolated and disadvantaged communities, by computer, to people without access to training at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a range of projects to bring certain professions training through open learning, such as farm management, horticulture and modules for remote Aboriginal communities. I might add that people sourcing their training from<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">open learning will be greatly affected and disadvantaged by the new up&hyphen;front fee regime proposed by the government for open learning in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1966. It is double or triple jeopardy for some people. Optical dispensing and wine industry training are available through the Open Net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the projects to be cut are also targeted at Aboriginal people. These include pastoral training, Aboriginal rural training, Aboriginal community education, and the Gold Coast&hyphen;Tweed Heads cross&hyphen;border project already mentioned. In my electorate of Western Australia, the Central Western Desert Aboriginal people are particularly hard hit. They were receiving vocational education and training towards a certificate in remote community essential services work, with literacy and numeracy modules as well, but this will be abolished. Western Australia will lose the delivery of environmental management studies to students. It is hard to believe that this government believe in anything remotely associated with self&hyphen;determination when they are pulling the rug out from people fighting hard to try to establish that and to learn how to meet their own needs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6452">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia, Aboriginal communities who were being trained in the building industry to build their own homes in remote communities have had their funding taken away. The project was called Wali Palyantjaku. Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory were able to gain their applied science diplomas in horticulture, conservation and tourism training through a heritage and interpretive tourism course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these cuts are cloaked in the rhetoric of economic rationalism and the<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">naive belief that the states will take over these programs when there is little reason for them to accept the Commonwealth cost shifting equity programs onto the states. I would like a guarantee from the minister that these programs will continue under the relevant state governments, because what is obvious to me is that anyone who lives in a rural, remote or Aboriginal community and is interested in self-determination and self-reliance or in studying about the environment or farming will be disadvantaged in terms of access to vocational education and training. This is an appalling indictment brought about by this bill and the Greens  (WA) are fundamentally opposed to the cuts that will bring about this disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to add my voice in relation to the proposal for the proposed amendments to increase the representatives of the Business Council of Australia by two. I have nothing against the Business Council of Australia, but I do think it has a bias against community participation and a bias further in business favour. I do not think that is going to achieve the outcome that many people are hoping for and have been concerned about in relation to the current move to economic rationalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the Greens (WA) are forced to vote for this bill to ensure that the funding that remains is able to be passed to the states. It is not a particularly happy picture and I would like some level of reassurance from the government that they will be addressing the serious concerns we believe will eventuate as a result of the cuts from this program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to indicate, on behalf of the opposition, our opposition to these amendments to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1996. The government has belatedly placed these amendments before the chamber, and the effect of these amendments is to increase the size of the board of the Australian National Training Authority by two. That in itself is in line with the recommendations in the report of the review of the ANTA agreement, which was commissioned by a Labor government and conducted by R. M. Taylor, which reported in February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Our difficulty arises in that the amendments before the chamber do not reflect that review but in fact go some way to undermine it. The office of the Minister for Employment, Edu cation, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has made it clear to the opposition in briefings that it has conducted that it intends to fill the two positions that are being proposed in this amendment with further representatives of the business interests, especially with representatives from the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This is clearly not in line with the recommendations of the Taylor review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This review recommended that the Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, a senior state or territory official and, desirably, the chairperson of the Standards and Curriculum Council be added to the board. The purpose of these additions was to bring about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . greater cohesion, ownership and shared values by the states and territories and the Commonwealth to the system and to add to the board's deliberation by bringing the expertise of two of the nation's top public sector managers to the consideration of resource allocation, Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations and government administration.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is ideologically committed to the business domination of training rather than to the provision of adequate and, through the government, appropriate public administration accountability. This is the same ideological underpinning which we see in their desire to replace the area consultative committees with more business dominated regional employment bodies and the general philosophy that is now running through the TAFE and the VET sectors more generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When speaking before the estimates committee about what industry domination of these bodies meant to this government, the minister said she meant specifically excluding workers' representatives from the vocational education and training sector. She understood business to mean the owners of business, the owners of capital, not the persons who made capital productive&mdash;that is, the workers in industry. She quite consciously and deliberately set forth the government's position to be one that was founded upon this very premise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6454"> Therefore, the opposition is clearly not going to support the proposition. The major policy reversal that this government is pursuing through this bill contradicts the gov ernment's push to put more employer representatives on ANTA and contradicts the various points that it made prior to the election about broader consultation in the area of education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only fairly recently that a senior official of the ACCI, Mr Mark Paterson, was appointed to the ANTA board ex officio by virtue of his former association with the Standards and Curriculum Council. Representation from senior state and territory officials on ANTA would make far greater sense at this time, given that there was considerable resistance from the state training authorities and some state governments, especially the New South Wales government, to aspects of the MAATS program, which needs to be very carefully negotiated if this government is to pursue to any degree of success its proposals with regard to the modern apprenticeship and training scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is noted that when the ANTA board was first constituted there was general agreement, including by the coalition state governments, that members should be there for their expertise, their commitment and the contribution that they themselves would make rather than their being representatives of particular interest groups. These proposed changes turn that policy direction on its head as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see more generally in the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill that the New South Wales government has recently exposed the harsh cuts that will occur in TAFE colleagues as a result of the budget cut to vocational education and training, which this bill gives effect to. We see, for instance, that TAFE institutes in areas of high unemployment in Sydney's south&hyphen;west face enrolment cuts of more than 1,000 and TAFE institutes in the Hunter region of New South Wales will lose more than 4,000 places. As I say, we will oppose this bill and the new amendments. We already sought to highlight our opposition through the second reading amendment, which was defeated, and we will be opposing these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the case of New South Wales that I want to highlight in terms of the draconian effects that these changes will have. The state systems will be adversely affected by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these changes. We see, for instance, that in the case of Victoria there will be quite significant impacts in terms of the Commonwealth's withdrawal of funding from the vocational education and training sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see it at every level. The operating budget cut to ANTA head office of 25 per cent will see the removal of positions. The level of service invariably will have to fall. The abolition of pre&hyphen;vocational programs or their reduced funding for access will have an impact in Victoria. There will be a requirement that labour market programs themselves will decline as a result of this budget measure, which has an impact on all states, particularly Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, labour market programs will decline to the tune of some $80 million for Victorian TAFE institutes in 1997. There will be a significant reduction in residual labour market funds to support training for a number of apprentices as part of the new MAATS scheme. There will be new tendering arrangements for labour market programs which will also impact on the provision of services within Victorian TAFE institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be ongoing price pressures, including the state's own 1.5 per cent saving dividends instituted through its budget, which will present real difficulties for small TAFE institutes by forcing many of them to reconsider their viability, especially given the continuing maintenance of efforts requirements which, I trust, will be pursued by this government. It will lead to pressures for mergers of institutes which can be expected as a result of the failure of the states to provide adequate moneys for the smaller TAFE institutes&mdash;and on top of these cuts that will be quite dramatic.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of those expected mergers in Victoria could result in the loss of some 40 staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will see reductions in labour market training programs having a significant impact on TAFE institutes and various other programs which currently employ up to 560 teachers, although that funding will be lost. There will be an introduction of user choice through the MAATS program which will result in the relocation of funds away from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6455"> the TAFE institutes to the so&hyphen;called registered private providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For every 20 per cent shift away from TAFE on apprenticeship training in 1997, it is anticipated that up to 200 staff are likely to be made redundant. The pressures on allocating the growing proportion of vocational education and training funds on traineeship and apprenticeship under MAATS, or to respond to the increases in the HECS payments which are being pursued through the next bill we will look at today, will see added demands on local training priorities which must in fact reduce the level of services at a regional level. You will see reductions in Commonwealth capital expenditure which will see Commonwealth capital funding to local TAFE colleges equally reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these measures, you are likely to see increasing reductions in support for industry training boards for staff professional development&mdash;the important process of statistic collection, the normal vocational education and training research. You are likely to see additional pressure right through vocational education and training as a result of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill ought to be looked at in its totality. Although the amendment before us today might look simple, it is about the expansion of the board&mdash;an expansion which runs quite contrary to the recommendations of the Taylor review and those of the Senate committee into ANTA which reported in November 1995. In this context, I would ask the minister: what is the progress towards the implementation of the recommendations of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee report which was brought down in November 1995?</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts, you did rightly ask about the contribution that you thought the states were going to make and whether there were any guarantees. Forgive me, I took that as a rhetorical question that was a bit of polemic on your part. I simply respond to you by saying that I do not have a view that there are states looking to make adverse funding decisions in the vocational education and training area more than they would be in any other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is a matter that Senator Carr probably well understands, Senator Stott Despoja seeks to avoid and on which I have yet to hear you, Senator Margetts, make much comment, although you may have when I have not been tuned into these debates. The bottom line is this: if we want to generate more real jobs, we have to be fiscally responsible. We have to demonstrate that we can actually run the nation's books as efficiently as any business is expected to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When members opposite were in government, they chose to keep running a deficit. They chose to tell the Australian people prior to the last election that everything was okay, that the budget would be in the black&mdash;by diminishing amounts, I admit. During the election campaign we said, `Let's open the books. Let's have a good look. Let everybody see the basis on which there will or will not be a change of government.' And the then government refused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6456"> We can argue at the edges about the size of the deficit but I do not think anybody disagrees that it is enormous. That needs to be repaired. If you want to generate real jobs, you have to be a fiscally responsibly government. I made the point in a debate last week, Senator Margetts&mdash;and I do not think you were here&mdash;that it is no politician's dream to come into government and have to put a budget back into the black. There is no joy whatsoever in telling people, whether they are states, training authorities or whatever that they will now get less from the Common wealth. There is no joy, no fun and no short&hyphen;term political gain in telling people that they will have to pay more for things that they otherwise would have paid less for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the difficult decisions that this government is prepared to take. This is one of the reasons that we were elected. There was a sense in the community that the previous government was not prepared to take the difficult decisions; that it was not prepared to make decisions that people would criticise by saying, `People don't want to get less' or `People don't want to pay more'&mdash;the easy, short&hyphen;term catchcries that we hear from people with short&hyphen;term political vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People realised that it was about time we again had a government that was prepared to make the hard decisions. If you walk away from these hard decisions, you walk from those people who are already without jobs, those who are in jobs but the least skilled. Unskilled and semi&hyphen;skilled workers are the ones that are the most at risk when you have a further economic downturn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can all sit and pretend on the other side of this chamber, if you like, that everything else was okay and that we do not have to worry about a deficit reduction strategy, that that is not a problem, that somehow somewhere else this matter will be addressed by other people. The bad news for members opposite is that the matter has to be addressed by the federal parliament; it is our responsibility to fix this; it is our responsibility to put the budget back into black. You cannot walk away from it and just come in here when there are good decisions to make&mdash;easy decisions, decisions that give out money, that ask people to pay less. That is not what our jobs are about, either in government or in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently, across portfolios there has been a requirement to contribute to the deficit reduction. As I say, it is not an easy task and not one in which any politician in a pick&hyphen;a&hyphen;box contest would say, `Oh, that is for me. Why don't I have the job of putting the budget back into black? That sounds like fun.' Nobody is going to say that. These are the difficult decisions that have to be made.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make these points because there were comments by Senator Stott Despoja, by you, Senator Margetts, and, I think, by you, Senator Carr, as to the fact that, against forward estimates, there is going to be a reduction. That is right: there is to be a reduction in the growth. And that is a function of having to contribute to the deficit reduction strategy. As each bill comes through, we can say, `But not in this area,' but sooner or later you have to find out where the reduction is to come from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made what we think are the best decisions possible about how to spread this burden to pay off the Beazley bankcard. Members opposite may have different views about how they would go about doing it, but it would be a pleasure to hear what those views are, on some occasion perhaps other than today, about the difficult decisions they would be prepared to make&mdash;not the easy ones, not the ones in which you say, `We'll stop you having to pay more' or `We'll stop this cut here', the easy short&hyphen;term stuff, but some of the difficult decisions that would actually address this problem. It would be a pleasure to hear some of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, you indicated that you still did not know the 1998 funding, I think, but that is in the bill and it is a total of $893.7 million. You referred to a real cut in 1997. As I have indicated to you, no&hyphen;one is denying that it is a reduction in forward estimates, but it is still an increase next year over this year. I do not think that is an inappropriate way to phrase that at all. You look at a reduction in student places, whereas in fact these reductions in funding are basically being sought from capital projects and we are looking to maintain places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is probably appropriate at this point to mention just a couple of other matters. There has been some reference made by all speakers to the two extra members it is sought to have on the board. Senator Carr seeks to make much of the fact that the Taylor review recommendations are not being accepted. Of course, I do not believe that Senator Carr would put a proposition that any government is bound to follow the recommendations of any review, because the government then would simply be a rubber stamp.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6457">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a perfectly appropriate question to ask. What it is not appropriate to do is to suggest that, because a review has been held and some recommendations have been made, a government should simply say,`Oh, good. Thanks.' That would mean that people would sit here in government and opposition and simply pass off the work to other people by way of review. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that the government would agree to accept all recommendations of a review on any particular matter or the notion that an opposition would agree to accept all recommendations on a particular matter is frankly laughable. One only has to look, for example, at the National Commission of Audit and ask whether Senator Carr would be happy to shift university funding to basically a scholarship basis, which might otherwise be described as vouchers. He would have lots of reasons why that was a bad idea&mdash;I am sure he would. He would not for one minute give up not so much his right but his obligation to offer an alternative view, if he had one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to this matter, the government is seeking to put two extra members on the board. I hear from people opposite that the Taylor review ought to be followed. With respect to the secretary of DEETYA, members opposite may not know that there is an ANTA&mdash;Australian National Training Authority&mdash;CEOs meeting, which the secretary attends with the other CEOs. You could easily argue the case that, to put the head of DEETYA, that is, a Commonwealth senior administrator, with one state administrator is dead set to cause further trouble in other ways by virtue of the fact that not all the states get represented. This is a difficult area. It is part of our federal system&mdash;where the Commonwealth has to work with the states and not all states get represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states are sensitive about the numbers that they have. By increasing the numbers by one Commonwealth and one state member, you may well have a number of states saying, `Hold on. There are a lot more of us. We should have more space.' From mechanisms such as the fact that we have the National Training Authority chief executive officers meeting at the same time as the ANTA <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> board&mdash;and as a consequence of the change of government, those people now get to meet much more fully with ANTA Minco as well, that is, the ministers meeting&mdash;we can improve the cooperation that is required when the Commonwealth is putting in some money, the states are putting in the rest and there is no unanimous agreement across the states as to how to proceed with any reforms. This is not ever going to be an easy area to administrate. The previous government clearly discovered that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why two extra members? I think there is general agreement that the board could be larger and more usefully structured, but there is disagreement between the government and the Taylor review&mdash;and, presumably, from what I hear, from members opposite&mdash;about how we ought to go about that. I hear pretty well all speakers saying, `Isn't this a shocking thing! This government wants industry training to be industry led, wants business to have a say.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sharp reality for everyone ought to be that one of the problems with any form of training if you want to get people jobs is: if you do not consult with industry, if you do not understand clearly what industry wants, if you do not develop mechanisms that industry not only can work with but wants to work with and is prepared to work with, and if you do not bring industry into the tent, then you can have the best laid plans but you will not get the cooperation or the implementation. So, far from being put off or embarrassed in any way at the prospect of putting on more business representatives&mdash;representatives who may well provide an adequate link into the broader business community&mdash;I think it is a very good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, people said in the beginning that they did not want the board to be a representative board. We could all point to boards like that where there are problems because of it. But this is not a suggestion to turn the ANTA board into that at all. It is a suggestion to quite wisely link the existing board members, such as Bill Mansfield from the ACTU, who is a recognised leader in the training area, with people who have been selected because of their own business contribution, like Stella <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6458"> Axarlis and others&mdash;to mix in those people who have this coalface industry experience themselves with others who may be an appropriate link into the broader business organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is that? Is it any fun for people to come along and give time from their job to another board? No, it is not. That is not the reason. Why would you do it for that reason? It is because you want to provide industry led training that will be accepted by industry and will lead to people being taken on into real jobs. To suggest for one minute that you can do that in isolation from the broader business community is crazy. I really do not understand the criticism of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is basically taking what was initially started: `Yes, there needs to be a broader scope.' But let us ensure that that scope further links the ANTA board with the broader business community, with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia. These are people we want involved in the training process. We want to bring them in; we want them to feel some ownership of the new training systems. Industry needs to recognise that training is an investment on which they will recoup. You cannot do that by shutting these people out. That is the reason. It is a very good reason. I am amazed that some people have indicated they will not be supporting it.</PARA></SPEECH>

I asked questions about the impact of the effective cuts in the forward program and I got a lecture on why it is necessary to make slashes right across programs, no matter what the outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the major goal of any government is `to run the books as efficiently as any business', the reality is, first of all, that the main role of any business is to make a profit. It is not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about outcomes. I do not want to see any federal government running that as their prime motive. Secondly, we have a situation where the government say that their major motive is to get the budget back in the black. But there are two sides to any ledger. Apart from slashing programs, the second side is to look at your revenue options. Minister, I am very happy to say that we have some ideas for that and I am happy to offer them to you. In the next week or so you will see some of them. I would be pleased to see you lining up to support revenue options so we can fund the things which people are expecting&mdash;not of a business but of a government; the things that state governments currently are not offering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If you believe that all we need to do is to put more  business people on these boards, then you seem to have missed the reports that many of us are getting about the very low morale level, about people who have worked their hearts out in the TAFE sector, who believe in what they are doing and who believe in providing a good quality of education. This is  across the training sector. Those people are becoming so disheartened because of this very narrow business and corporate focus. Putting a greater weighting on, say, the Business Council of Australia simply means that the focus will continue in that direction without addressing the outcomes or the community and social needs that this sector is trying to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard the black hole argument, but yesterday there was a blow&hyphen;out in the balance of trade.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe I indicated that, as a consequence of changed arrangements since the change of government, the linkages between the ANTA board, the ANTA ministerial council and ANTA CEOs have improved. We are not denying that it is obviously important to have good links with the ANTA CEOs, but we are simply making the point that it can be done by alternative means and that it is appropriate to take steps to involve industry to a greater extent than it is at the moment.</PARA></SPEECH>

We have made it very clear that we are strongly opposed to the position being taken by the government with regard to these measures. We are particularly concerned about the way in which you are seeking to administer cuts to the national training agenda. As I read the documents, we would see national training programs reduced by $70 million, national projects reduced by $44 million and capital projects reduced by $225 million in 1996. This would have a detrimental effect on the capacity of this country to respond effectively to the training and vocational educational needs of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very concerned about the manner in which these budget cuts are being implemented as part of your general strategy to secure savings of $4.3 billion from the department over the forward estimates period and to reduce the whole of government percentage outlays going to DEETYA from 11.1 per cent to 9.1 per cent over that same period. To us, this is wrong. It is wrong that you should be inflicting these sorts of cuts upon future generations of Australians. We believe this will have detrimental effects on our economy and on our social development.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was speaking on this piece of legislation the other day I had made the point that it had taken the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) and the Howard budget to get students, staff and vice-chancellors to unite in public protest against reduced funding to universities, increased costs for students and reduced places. It is a litany of broken promises and very family unfriendly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had said that the families of Australia are now concerned about the costs of education and are anticipating that they will have to start saving now to cover the costs that their children will face in years to come, to which Minister Vanstone said, `rubbish.' She then tried to explain that she was only saying `rubbish' to me and not to the families of Australia. But Minister Vanstone is saying `rubbish' to the families of Australia. She is saying that these protests are really nothing to fuss about; they are just people protecting their own territory; they are not serious; and they are not family unfriendly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not only very family unfriendly but are also very unfriendly to our society. When the Labor government came into office in 1983, it took over from Malcolm Fraser's very low record in education. Retention rates at schools were about 37 per cent and the number of university places was some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6462"> 200,000&hyphen;plus less than they are now. It has taken a decade or more of commitment by the former Labor government to turn this society around into valuing education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well remember objections from those opposite when we talked about students being retained at school. They wanted to argue, `You're just doing it to get the unemployment numbers down.' No, we were not. We were doing it because we were committed to education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That commitment to education is something that clearly makes a difference not only to individuals and to their families but also to society. Australia has a much better prospect if we have a very large education base on which to build our businesses, our jobs, our research and development, our hospitality industry and our sporting facilities&mdash;everything. Based on education, our society is only going to do better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see a very negative step being taken in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill. One of the most amazing arguments being put by both the minister and Senator Tierney is that if we allow people to pay then we will increase their choices. Under the previous system there was an option of going to university and paying back a HECS charge when and if you earned sufficient income. Nobody was denied access. But now that they have the pleasure of paying to be able to go to university, it is extraordinary to argue that this is somehow an increase in choice. Most people do not see the option of paying for what previously they did not have to pay for as being an increase in choice. They see it as a setback, as an increased liability and as a very big negative. When families talk about the challenges of job insecurity and making their money go further, they are already citing increased costs of child care and education as two very big outlays that are causing them grave concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasing the so&hyphen;called choice by allowing people to pay means that those people have not been able to get into university on merit&mdash;on the figures as a result of their higher education, mature age entry or whatever. In other words, it is clearly for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cream of society&mdash;the thick and the rich. Poor people will not be able to get in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator Vanstone that the poor people are not going to be able to find the money. It is clearly only for those who will be able to afford to get in, the people who have not been able to get in as a result of a sufficient matriculation score or tertiary entry score&mdash;only those who did not achieve their place under those results and those who can afford to pay. It is not a way to increase representation in our universities of the broad scale or people from the poorest income end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is not obvious to the government, it certainly is obvious to the community. They know full well that to be able to pay for a place means you have got to have sufficient income. That is not the way you define the poor or the lowest income end of our society. It is an absolute nonsense to say that you increase choice by allowing people the option to pay for what previously they did not have to pay for.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a misleading contribution. It seems pretty obvious to my colleagues on this side and it is obvious to people in the community. It is no increase in choice to now be able to pay for what previously you did not have to pay for. The reason that you would be exercising that choice is because you did not rate a place under a sufficient tertiary entrance score. If that is not obvious to you, then you are being sold a pup, minister. I actually think you know full well what you are doing and you are actually selling the pup. The community is not going to cop it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6463">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another special message that you have for people under this bill is that they can start repaying their higher education charge on an income of $20,000 instead of $28,000, as was previously the case. What is more, they will pay at three per cent, which is about $12 a week. To quote the minister, `That's not much, just a night at the cinema,' I think you said, but it might have been a night at the pictures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the other place, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, wants to boast that an $8 a week increase in wages to those at the lowest income end is a great contribution from this government. Tell me: who is going to get the $8 a week? By and large, people on such low incomes as $20,000. Those are your low income earners&mdash;well below AWE, which is about $28,000. So here are these people, whose income is well below average weekly earnings, being asked to pay $12 a week&mdash;just a night at the pictures&mdash;and at the same time Mr Howard wants to tell us that giving those same people $8 a week means that those people are now in clover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increase will not even pay for their HECS repayment. If it is just a night at the pictures, then ring up Mr Howard and tell him not to make a song and dance about $8. If it is just a night at the pictures to pay back $12, then $8 a week is no great contribution. The idea of giving battlers a great gift of an increase of $8 a week in their wages but whacking $12 out&mdash;just a night at the pictures&mdash;to make their HECS repayment is very, very contradictory.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Choice, if you talk about options at a tertiary college, is now being dramatically reined in. It is not choice to say that previously you could do a certain course at the Adelaide University and as of next year you will not be able to do it. Most people see that, very clearly, as a significant reduction in choice, to say nothing of the loss of jobs of the people who taught those courses or helped to administer those courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, your own colleague in South Australia, Minister Such, knows full well the impact of these cuts in terms of the economy of South Australia, which is not exactly rippling along. You could call Mr Olsen on this matter. You certainly called in a lot of your Liberal colleagues to dump the premier who was mismanaging the economy of South Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, can she give us her response to the point made very well by Senator Carr in his contribution about two teachers in a school, one teaching science and one teaching history, both earning the same income but with a very significant difference in HECS debt and rate of repayment? Does that not cause the minister to worry? It does not, the minister indicates with a shake of her head&mdash;it does not give her any cause for concern at all. That is an important point for the families of Australia to note, particularly any prospective science teachers. Don't worry, the minister does not care at all. She is not the slightest bit concerned that you might have a bigger debt than the teacher in the next room on the same income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people are concerned. The minister has indicated some concern, but is her concern only about the rate of applications to do science?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many points that need to be made in the course of this debate on the second <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reading of this bill. Other people have made a number of the points that I would like to make. I just note the point made on page 38 of the dissenting report from the Senate Employment Education and Training Legislation Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's stated intention is to limit the number of fee paying places available to Australian students to 25 per cent of domestic undergraduates in any course. By refraining from enshrining this limit in legislation, the Government is very clearly reserving the option to change the proportions at any time in the future. The point warrants repetition. If this amendment is passed, there will be no legislative impediment to prevent the Minister from so acting.</PARA>
<PARA>When the minister was asked whether that was the case and why the 25 per cent ceiling was not specified in the bill, her response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal was put and accepted that this is a clean way to do this. It is neat.</PARA>
<PARA>It might be neat in legislative design, but it is very dangerous that there is an opportunity for the percentage to be arbitrarily changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to say that the minister has taken some 17,000 places out of the higher education sector, and most of those are in postgraduate programs. This will have a very backward effect on education in this country. It will be one way in which we will positively encourage a brain drain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also significant is the number of people turning to postgraduate course work&mdash;people who have only that option or people who prefer that option. That is not a kind change to tertiary education. This is not a way in which we are expanding the number of places or the number of options for students. It is a way of introducing significant cutbacks, significant loss of choice, and a significant increase in the contribution students or their families make to the cost of tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that seems to have escaped the minister's attention is that most of the students in our universities are anything but flush. In 10 or 20 years time they might finish up on reasonable incomes. As students, they are doing it tough. This bill will not help them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.26 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. This bill should be seen in the context of this government's commitment to quality, diversity and innovative change in higher education. Firstly, contrary to some of the claims being made, this bill and some of the issues now being debated are not a bolt out of the blue, as is claimed by the opposition. Issues such as differential HECS were being debated as far back as the 1980s. In fact, the report of the Senate committee notes the report of former Premier Neville Wran on this issue when he headed a 1989 committee on higher education funding. The provision for undergraduate fees has also been an issue of public debate for some years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's report deals with the issue of the bill's effect on the low socio&hyphen;economic status groups. Again, there has been a great deal of misinformation put out by our colleagues on the other side of the chamber. The committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no conclusive evidence to prove that fees and participation rates by equity groups are inversely related.</PARA>
<PARA>As the report shows, both the department and Professor Bruce Chapman concurred that the introduction of HECS did not deter student participation in higher education. The department went further, stating that there has been:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . minimal change in relative numbers of different socio&hyphen;economic groups participating in higher education over the last twenty years, despite the changes to tertiary fees and introduction of HECS during this period.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to move to the issue of fee paying for domestic students, something that was mentioned by Senator Crowley. Before I do, I would like to detail the way in which this bill provides for the introduction of 4,000 merit equity scholarships between 1997 and 2000, the maintenance of the existing higher education equity program at an annual cost of $5.8 million, and the maintenance of the regional disability liaison officer initiative for another year at a cost of $750,000 to coordinate the provision of services for students with disabilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move to the issue of fee paying domestic students. The key point here is that the fee paying places are additional to the number of government funded places made available for Australian students. There is no sense in which fee paying places will replace government funded places. There is a ceiling on the proportion of full fee paying positions that universities can make available. That will act as a check to ensure that privately funded enrolments do not crowd out publicly funded enrolments in universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will be an opportunity for the higher education sector to respond more closely to market forces. Revenue from privately funded students is expected not only to increase the supply of places in higher education but also it should expose the sector to a greater degree of demand pressure because students will have increased scope to choose among universities. This bill deserves the chamber's full support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Troeth summed it up: `This bill will give higher education an opportunity to respond more closely to market forces.' It is a `let's leave it to the stock exchange' bill. It is a `let's divest government of its responsibility and hand it across to the private sector' bill. Increasingly universities are forced to act more like corporations than as centres for the extension of education and wellbeing to the whole community. As previous speakers on this side have put it so clearly, this is a device for giving favoured treatment to those with money in their pockets as against those without. Government members opposite, including the minister, can shake their heads as much as they like but that is exactly what it is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to relay to the Senate some of the lobbying that has come from people who represent those who are concerned about this issue, that is, the students. I quote from the release put out by the National Union of Students last week:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone is trying to convince the public of the merits of her proposal by highlighting the fact that disadvantaged people remain largely excluded from higher education. This is remarkably <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> poor logic and history on the part of the Minister. The period in which access to education has improved most was between 1974 and 1986 when there were no tuition fees and student financial support was set at a livable level. Senator Vanstone's comparison of participation of access between 1980 and 1989 in the Senate yesterday&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is last week&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shows that she either does not understand the history or she is wilfully attempting to mislead the public. The figures which she presents are quite damning to her own position.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If disadvantaged people are not gaining access to higher education under the current system of deferred fees of $2,400 per annum then the situation will only get much, much worse if these fees are increased to between $3,300 and $5,500 per annum and up-front fees are allowed to be charged.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems pretty logical to me. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is giving up on the idea of disadvantaged people going to university&mdash;they have decided it is just too hard, so they are not even trying to fix the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>As a Tasmanian senator I am particularly concerned about these bills. I want to read again from a letter by University of Tasmania Branch President Paula Baron of the National Tertiary Education Industry Union. Here is what she had to say in this letter, which has gone to everybody in the Senate and which represents not my point of view but the lobbying from the students themselves:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write to convey to you my complete opposition to the government's proposed changes to the Higher Education Funding Act, and to urge you to oppose the particular provisions which will result in Tasmanians being denied the opportunity of participating in higher education because of its prohibitive cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The particular provisions to which I refer will result in significant changes to the higher education contributions scheme, will allow the charging of up-front fees to over-quota undergraduate students, and will allow the charging of additional fees to undergraduate students in publicly funded places.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the University of Tasmania, the Federal Government's operating grant reductions, a clear breach of their election promise to `at least maintain higher education funding in real terms', mean that 500 less Tasmanian students will be able to study in 1988, and according to University management about 160 jobs will be lost over the next three years.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6467"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This alone will have a dramatic and negative effect on Tasmania. The proposed amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act will further damage higher education in this State. Because of Tasmania's lower than national average weekly earnings and depressed economy the proposed cost increases for study, ranging from 40 to 125 per cent for publicly funded places, and up&hyphen;front fees which currently average around $8,000 a year, will significantly reduce access to higher education, particularly for low to middle income earning families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's amendments will have a disproportionately large effect on Tasmania because it has only one university, because its people generally earn less than elsewhere in Australia and because Tasmania already has a poor record of attracting students to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For all these reasons I urge you most strongly to block the Government's proposals relating to changes to HECS and the charging of up-front fees for undergraduate places. These proposals will be nothing less than an unmitigated disaster for the people of Tasmania, and for the future of higher education in this State.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I only hope that, although he is not listed and has not spoken, Senator Harradine is going to respond to that sort of lobbying from Tasmanians, who are totally alarmed by the cuts to education at all levels that this government is bringing before the Senate. His is a pivotal vote in determining whether Tasmanians will or will not lose out in this matter. The electorate would expect that he would be here to explain his defence of the Tasmanian interests as he votes on this side or why he simply allows Tasmania to be opened up to the disproportionate disadvantage that we have just heard about and that will come from these cuts. They effectively mean that if you are rich you can get in, if you are poor you cannot and if you are in the middle you will have to make up your mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone and other government members can argue as they will. There is independent and very authoritative opinion, which I will not go into now, which clearly puts the thumb on the way in which this is going to distress students. It is going to deter them. We have already seen the turn&hyphen;off in numbers of people applying for important courses in tertiary education. It is going to simply see hundreds of people in this country, who ought to be getting an incentive to go on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to tertiary education and therefore their rightful opportunity to work and fulfilment in our society in the next century, not getting there at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is muddle&hyphen;headed. It is market economics. It is not thought out. It is doctrinaire. It is going to be very damaging to education in this country and very divisive in the long run to a society that has been well known for its fair go and egalitarian approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think even Bob Menzies would roll his eyes if he could hear that here we have a Liberal government in the 1990s going in the opposite direction to his ideal&mdash;that everybody should have access to and be afforded the opportunity of tertiary education. It is a pretty backward day for education in this country. I just hope that when Senator Harradine and fellow Independent Senator Colston cast their votes, they will be on the side&mdash;if not of the angels&mdash;of kids and all people getting a fair access to tertiary education, which is a right no less than that to primary and secondary education in this day and age in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to commence by referring to another of what has become a litany of broken promises by the coalition government. In its pre&hyphen;election higher education policy statement `Quality, diversity and choice' the coalition stated that it would:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding for universities in terms of operating grants and research grants.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition also undertook to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . maintain higher education funding in real terms</PARA>
<PARA>However, once again we have seen a massive turnaround. In the 1996 budget statement, the minister announced cuts of five per cent to operating grants to 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in their proposed legislation, intend significant changes to the higher education contribution scheme, to allow the charging of up&hyphen;front fees to over quota undergraduate students, and to allow the charging of additional fees to undergraduate students in publicly funded places. These proposed changes and cuts to operating grants will have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6468"> a disastrous effect on low income communities such as Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Senator Brown, I would like to take a moment to explain to senators the situation of university education in Tasmania. Tasmania has only one university. Students have no alternative institutions within the state. The university is divided into two campuses at each end of the state, so any cuts to services and course availability will have a severe impact on Tasmanian families. A five per cent cut to operating grants to 1998, based on current forward estimates, will mean that in 1998 the University of Tasmania will receive 2.9 per cent less in government funding than it actually received for 1996. In dollar terms, we are talking about $3 million less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Brown has indicated, we are talking about 500 fewer student places than had been allocated previously for 1998. Again, as Senator Brown has said, we are talking about 160 jobs which will disappear in that institution over three years. I do not think I need to tell the Senate that with Tasmania having one of the highest&mdash;if not the highest&mdash;levels of unemployment of any state in Australia, a loss of 160 jobs is devastating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on household expenditure and characteristics by state, the average income for Tasmanian families is the lowest in the country. And, as I said, Tasmania has the highest unemployment of any state. It also has difficulty attracting students to higher education. Tasmania has the highest proportion of young graduates who leave the state to look for employment elsewhere. An increase in charges to students in Tasmania may well mean that they decide to leave the state before commencing their course, because other metropolitan universities can offer more choice. In fact, now more than 50 per cent of all young graduates leave the state of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state cannot afford any reduction in the level of service provided by the University of Tasmania. The university council so far has already endorsed the following cost cutting measures in response to the budget: firstly, the relocation of the urban design course to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Launceston&mdash;previously this course was accessed by students in both Launceston and Hobart; secondly, the closure of the Italian department; thirdly, the closure of the Asian studies department in Launceston; fourthly, a reduction in access and services provided by the four libraries at the Hobart campus; and, fifthly, a review of the physics and engineering departments with a view to closing or substantially cutting their operations. There is also a question over the future of the medical school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Tasmanian students will have to relocate within the state, attempt to study by distance mode or leave the state in order to access the course that they chose to do. What kind of choice is that? According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures that I quoted earlier, the average weekly income for a Tasmanian family is $620. An increase in the cost of attending university will put the relocation option out of reach of many Tasmanian families. People on low incomes will not be able to seek a higher education if the cost is prohibitive. I ask the government again: where is the choice in these circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government shift to full fee paying students will, in fact, disadvantage the University of Tasmania. In Tasmania, there are only 115 full fee paying postgraduates enrolled out of a national total of 16,000. There just is not a market for fee paying students in many disciplines, so the University of Tasmania cannot hope to capture a big proportion of that market. I fail to understand how the government can believe that the University of Tasmania could be expected to benefit from this measure. It cannot offer the course variety in a low income state as it is not in the same market. The university is not going to be in as good a position to attract fee paying students as the large metropolitan universities in the mainland states. This is in fact a reduction of choice for Tasmanians and a reduction in access to higher education for Tasmanian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government also intends to charge full fees to over quota students. The proposed cost increases for study&mdash;ranging from 40 per cent to 125 per cent for publicly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6469"> funded places and up&hyphen;front fees which currently average around $8,000 per year and could escalate to $15,000 per year&mdash;will spell the death knell to the dreams of many low income earning families of a university education. A university education, which is a reality for all at the moment, will once again be a privilege that only the wealthy can afford. Is this offering choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a policy which reduces quality, diversity and choice. Yet Senator Robert Hill, in his role as shadow spokesperson for higher education, in a speech to the third annual meeting of deputy and pro&hyphen; vice chancellors at the ANU in November last year, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will . . . continue the HECS structure as an appropriate students' contribution to the cost of a student's education. Undergraduate degrees will continue to be funded as at present.</PARA>
<PARA>That is yet another broken election promise, demonstrated by the coalition's decision to lower the threshold for the HECS repayment to $20,700 per annum, or less than $400 per week, and increase the rate of repayment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Page 12 of the coalition document `Quality, diversity and choice' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth funding of undergraduate degrees, subject to the current HECS, will remain the principal contribution to access. The coalition consistently has opposed changes to HECS rules after a student has begun study and will maintain this position in government.</PARA>
<PARA>The Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill, however, will change the HECS rules for current students by immediately lowering the threshold at which payments would begin and by increasing the rates of repayment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, HECS is not payable for those with an income below $28,495. Some students, such as part-time mature age students, who may be supporting a family, will find themselves repaying HECS before they have finished their study. This is despite the assurances of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on Sydney Radio 2UE on 15 August of this year when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the HECS charge does not start until you have left university . . . you don't pay anything until you've gone through university. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>For a student or a recent graduate earning $20,700 per year, this will amount to over $12 per week. For students or graduates with dependants already struggling to survive on less than $400 per week, and that is obviously before tax, this could be a serious financial hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the low rate of average weekly earnings in Tasmania, many graduates may have to make the decision to move interstate in the hope of earning a higher income in order to meet the requirement to pay their HECS debt faster. The loss of talented and qualified Tasmanians to other states is detrimental to Tasmania's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among bachelor degree graduates aged less than 25 in their first full&hyphen;time employment, nearly 30 per cent already leave the state to find employment. Of other graduates in full&hyphen;time employment, nearly 22 per cent leave to pursue work. That is a figure which exceeds that of every state in Australia except the ACT. Already more than 50 per cent of graduates leave Tasmania, and this is a terrible loss to a small state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to touch upon the issue of differential HECS charges. Over 50 per cent of current students enrolled in the University of Tasmania are enrolled in discipline areas which fall into the middle or top band for new HECS charges. Those students will be paying greatly increased charges, amounting to between 30 per cent and 80 per cent of the real cost of their education. It is quite possible that these increased charges could deter students from entering disciplines in higher cost areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The faculties of science and law could be undermined in Tasmania to the point of having to close down. Already the Department of Physics is under review, and the law department has concerns for its future. The equity of this situation leaves me at a loss. There appears to be a blind assumption that students in these middle or top bands of disciplines will always earn middle or top range salaries. This, to me, seems to be inherently unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most commonly used example to demonstrate this flaw is that of a law graduate. According to the graduate destination <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6470"> survey of 1995 produced by the Graduate Careers Council of Australia, 32.3 per cent of law graduates are not working as lawyers. Of those that are working as lawyers, not all work in high paying corporate law offices. Some may choose to work in the area of legal aid, reduced though those services will be by the coalition's attack on legal aid funding. These people make a decision to work in an area of law which is not as lucrative as others but is essential for our community, and for this they should be admired. Instead, the government chooses to charge them an inflated HECS debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Graduates in medicine will be required to pay very high HECS fees whilst, on the other hand, the coalition government is commencing a system whereby they may not even be able to access a Medicare provider number. People with degrees who decide to work in lower paying disciplines&mdash;such as youth workers or counsellors&mdash;could be subject to grossly inflated charges based on what the coalition believes they might earn as opposed to what they will earn in the real world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer senators again to the findings of the graduate destination survey of 1995 conducted by the Graduate Careers Council of Australia. This survey clearly shows that, of those students who graduate in computer science&mdash;a band 2 course attracting a HECS contribution of $4,700 per annum&mdash;54.2 per cent have gone to full-time employment in the education sector, a career which will not afford them the high rate of remuneration that apparently the government has determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The survey also shows that 11.9 per cent of economics graduates are working in clerical positions. Over 20 per cent of aeronautical engineering graduates are not working in the traditional occupations of this industry. Also, 16.4 per cent of civil engineering graduates are not working in engineering. What about those graduates who work part time and earn more than $400 per week? They will still have to pay the higher HECS band debt, without the fulfilment of the earnings that the coalition has determined they will earn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The coalition must recognise that prospective students will be discouraged from undertaking a course of studies such as civil engi neering, which attracts a band 2 HECS debt, when there is a 16 per cent chance they will not find employment in the industry, yet they will have to pay the debt for working in that industry. In architecture, which is a band 2 course, 20 per cent of graduates do not find work in that field. Only 3.7 per cent of psychology graduates found work as psychologists. I refer senators to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 28 November, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that applications for science related courses have dropped by an average of 13% nationally.</PARA>
<PARA>The University of Western Sydney has already seen a reduction in enrolments for engineering `of over 40 per cent'. The Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>  of Saturday, 30 November states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A total of 5,057 applications have been received for 1997 compared with 5,412 in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>That refers to enrolments at the University of Tasmania. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Releasing the figures in Hobart yesterday, Deputy Vice Chancellor Rudi Lidl blamed the drop on uncertainty surrounding Higher Education Contribution Schemes increases.</PARA>
<PARA>Students are making decisions on their careers and their lives based on the increased level of HECS. Many people from disadvantaged communities will not be able to afford to study in courses that attract higher fees. We will be doing a disservice not only to the students but also to this country as a whole by limiting access to talented students for purely economic reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us think again about the threshold of $20,700. What of the people who are earning that rate of pay? What work might they be doing? What sort of award classification might apply to them? On what criteria has the coalition pulled this figure from the air? It has obviously not been done with any understanding of the lifestyle of someone on that income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at this scenario. A young person leaves university with a law degree. Their differential HECS rate falls into the top band. This person is unable to find work in the discipline of law because of the ever increasing levels of unemployment. So the person finds a job in a restaurant and, as a grade 3 attendant under the award, earns $409.50 per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6471"> week&mdash;$21,294 per annum. You deduct tax of $71.70. He or she could pay about $100 a week for rent, $80 for food, $10 for power and $10 for phone. The cost of petrol and repayments on, say, a car could be $80 per week. Insurance, clothing, consumables could be another $50 per week. In fact, total expenditure with tax out of that $409.50 would be around $401.70, which does not leave them enough to pay the HECS.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I challenge the government to show how this person can afford to pay HECS on this salary. The question I have for the coalition, which claims to be for the battlers of this country, is: are these people not the battlers? Should you not be honouring your commitment of 16 May 1995 to demonstrate a commitment to the Australian battlers, or is that just another non-core promise to add to the growing list?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask senators opposite if they have a commitment to the future of this country and if they believe that people of the same ability should be discriminated against on the basis of wealth, because, effectively, that is what this bill is saying. By these bills, the coalition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seeks to deny future generations of young Australians potentially an opportunity to be the best that they can be simply because they cannot afford to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears to me that this government is not committed to the battlers and is not committed to the future of this country in this regard. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) in the budget papers has promised a review of higher education funding. If the outcome of this bill is so uncertain that the minister has to promise a review, surely the minister admits that she lacks the confidence in the efficacy of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What controls will parliament have of the process of the review and changes to the legislation once it is in place? The cynics amongst us would say that in many cases government reviews only find what governments want them to. Even if the review finds against aspects of this bill, what rock solid guarantees are we being given that this government will backtrack on this issue? Given the government's performance on other rock solid guarantees, what would they be worth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government had any integrity, it would withdraw this bill and allow a full review now before progressing down a path which will have damaging effects on the future of higher education in this country. These are bad bills. If the majority of the Senate is minded to pass them, perhaps they should be subject to sunset clauses and the Senate should establish its own mechanism to review the effects of the bill over the next 12 months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak out against the privatisation by stealth of higher education in this country. We have seen this government move to take vital funds out of community based child care. We have seen them devastate regional Australia through cuts to regional programs, the closure of Medicare and tax offices and closure of essential Family Court facilities. We have seen them slash labour market programs and take away the employment hopes of tens of thousands of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6472"> Australians. No doubt very soon we will see the long&hyphen;term unemployed `exit case management'&mdash;a euphemism for dropping them off the books and relegating them to lifelong unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we are here to debate changes to higher education in this country which will see thousands of young Australians denied fair access to quality tertiary education. Over the 13 years of Labor government the participation rate for Australians in higher education grew to produce thousands of extra university places. A well educated population forms the basis of hope for the future of a progressive nation. A fair and equitable higher education contribution system extended that access to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government cannot see the social and economic importance of this. All they can see is a balance sheet and they do not like the total. Their answer is to pour money out of universities, reduce their quality and deny access to our young people. This is the mind&hyphen;set of the archetypal bookkeeper with the half&hyphen;moon glasses and the fingertips cut from the gloves poring over rows of numbers looking for a dollar to save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no vision in these bills. It is not only the young who are disheartened by the proposed changes. Let me quote from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed higher education contribution scheme increases soon to be debated in the Senate are being blamed for the national slump in demand for university places for mature&hyphen;age students. The drop in mature&hyphen;aged student demand will be devastating for universities. . . where preliminary figures have already shown applications from school&hyphen;leavers are down. Universities were hoping mature&hyphen;aged students would help make up the short&hyphen;fall.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is irrational and it is sending the wrong message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill will: allow universities to charge full fees to undergraduate students, subject to ministerial guidelines&mdash;for example, the percentage of students who are to be on HECS. These guidelines are subject to the minister's whim, and do not even need to be approved by parliament. They will allow universities to charge fees to students in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government&hyphen;funded places, again, subject only to ministerial guidelines; will completely deregulate open learning, allowing the Open Learning Agency unlimited power to charge fees&mdash;until now of course the cost per unit has been matched to the HECS charge, and payable through a deferred payment scheme&mdash;and will dramatically increase the level of fees payable through the higher education contribution scheme, reduce the threshold at which payments commence, and increase rates of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is breaking yet another election promise&mdash;adding to what is already a long list. This government, as other senators said before me, promised not to cut university funding and make no changes to HECS arrangements that would affect existing students. This bill will require current students earning above the new low repayment threshold to immediately commence HECS repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All current and future students will commence repayments when they are earning $20,700 per annum&mdash;well below average weekly earnings&mdash;and will be required to pay at an accelerated rate. This constitutes the worst type of breach of trust. This government has no mandate to make these devastating cuts to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government went to the election, as other senators have already indicated, promising to redress the problems caused by so&hyphen;called `underfunding'. Let me repeat that. This government went to the people of Australia and promised to redress the problems caused by the so&hyphen;called `underfunding' of education. Not only are they planning to cut funding but they are planning to deregulate open learning, increase HECS and permit universities to charge up&hyphen;front fees to undergraduates. The government has no mandate for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Places for students with fat wallets have been created at the expense of students without the dollars to buy a place. In the higher education budget statement, the minister states that full fees can only be charged for undergraduate places over the government funded quota and that only 25 per cent of places in any course could be filled by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6473"> full&hyphen;fee&hyphen;paying students. However, there are no such safeguards in the legislation. The percentage of fee&hyphen;paying places is up to ministerial guidelines&mdash;which can be changed at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities may well be forced to compete for students who can afford to pay up&hyphen;front fees. Universities may be forced to put more resources into those disciplines which provide them with the greatest return. What will we see? The return of medicine and law to family dynasties?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding cuts mean fewer places overall full stop. Access will be reduced for those who cannot afford to pay up&hyphen;front fees. By changing the threshold for HECS repayment many low income earners will be put off entering study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, Senator Vanstone, the minister responsible for this bill, and the Minister for Science and Technology, Peter McGauran, have agreed to `revisit' the increases to HECS if necessary. They plan to wait and watch things go wrong and then they will try and repair the damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have managed to overcome the barriers, decided to put yourself into debt and enter a higher education institution, now you have to start repaying the debt sooner. This is a direct breach of the promise to oppose changes to HECS rules after a student has begun to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A family with two children would commence repaying HECS while living below the poverty line. Some incentive! Part&hyphen;time students will be the hardest hit. Many of these people are working to pay their way through university, and these students may now have to start paying HECS immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Students in publicly funded places will be paying up to 80 per cent of the cost of their education under the new proposed HECS arrangements. Law and legal studies students will pay back 80.5 per cent of the cost of their course administration and business studies students will pay back 68.8 per cent of the cost of their course. Education students will repay 37.5 per cent. Science teachers will have to pay back more HECS than English teachers, even though they earn the same <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> salary. This is clearly a farcical situation. That is, of course, if we have any science teachers left over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By introducing differential fees for education, the government is supporting differential access to education. Differential fees mean differential access. This bill also allows universities to charge additional fees to HECS liable students. From next year, students will be liable for a range of additional charges, without any fixed restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New HECS and fee paying arrangements will create an administrative nightmare for universities. Each student will now have their HECS liability calculated on an individual basis, semester by semester&mdash;according to which subject they undertake and which band payment it fits into. With regard to fees, universities will have to institute new systems to charge fees and ensure that they fit within the yet unspecified guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to HECS will impact dramatically on my home state of Tasmania&mdash;and I would like to acknowledge the contribution of other Tasmanian senators so far in this debate. Tasmania's average student age is 27. Some areas like the north&hyphen;west coast of the state have an average student age of 34. Many of these people have families, and family income levels will clearly be adversely affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole disaster for higher education in Tasmania contained in these bills is compounded by the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. This bill reduces operating grants to universities. What are the estimated reductions to outlays over the next few years? They are: $23.4 million in 1996&hyphen;97, $118.5 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $215.5 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $266.2 million in 1999 to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Tasmania has already implemented its first stage of budget cutting. The university administration is trying desperately to cover the reduction in operating grants forced on it by the federal government in the August budget. They are talented, dedicated people, faced with the most unpleasant of tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction to operating grants is a clear breach of the government's promise made in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6474"> its policy document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quality, diversity and choice</EMPHASIS>, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding for universities in terms of operating grants and research grants.</PARA>
<PARA>This quote has been stated over and over again in this place. The University of Tasmania, the only university in Tasmania, has already begun to make some very tough decisions. The university has begun to rationalise programs between the two main campuses in Launceston and Hobart. They are attempting to negotiate shared resources with mainland universities. The university is being forced to outsource functions such as administration as far as it possibly can. It is increasing the number of full fee paying students and prioritising its capital works program. Three hundred and eighty student places are to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The university is reducing staff levels and axing courses. For example, as I think Senator O'Brien mentioned, students in Tasmania will no longer be able to study Italian. Tasmanian students will no longer be able to study Asian studies on the Launceston campus. Tasmanian students will no longer be able to study architecture in Hobart and they will be offered a significantly reduced range of science subjects. The education course is to close in Hobart and staff are to move to other areas in the south or to Launceston or take a redundancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Departmental amalgamations are to occur within humanities: the department of classics is to be absorbed into the history area. Engineering in Launceston is under threat. Staffing at the university is being reduced by 160 full&hyphen;time equivalent positions. This will obviously result in a reduction in research capability and teaching quality. Five staff positions are to go from the faculties of law and commerce. Staff reductions are occurring in aboriginal studies and physics. Class sizes will increase. Individual units in courses will be&mdash;and are already being&mdash;cut. Fewer tutorials will be held. Library staff are to be reduced. There will be reduced book and serial purchases and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even with these changes, the university will not have met its reduction target and it is looking at further cuts within areas such as health, science, engineering and fine arts. As <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I said before, the University of Tasmania is our only university. Students cannot choose between different universities offering different course mixes&mdash;this is it. You go to the University of Tasmania or you go to the mainland to university. Where would Tasmanian students go to study Italian, for example? They would have to go to the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government won the last election on votes from regional Australia&mdash;the very areas this government is now discriminating against. Tasmania is one of those. In Tasmania, 87.9 nine per cent of students remain in their own region while they are studying because they cannot afford the cost involved in travelling to study. Tasmanian students stay at home to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its Tasmania package the Liberal government promised to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">support higher education funding for student places based on other than just population growth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, participation rates, regional and historical factors&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensuring Tasmania receives fair consideration for higher education places.</PARA>
<PARA>That is as clear as a bell. You could not misinterpret that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">North and north-west Tasmania are well below the national average for tertiary participation rates and southern Tasmania barely makes the national average. Despite this, and despite the university's commitment to a state&hyphen;wide institution with campuses in all regions, there has been no growth in places allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As other Tasmanian senators have said before me, because of Tasmania's lower than average weekly earnings and depressed economy, because of the proposed cost increases for study, ranging from 40 per cent to 125 per cent for publicly funded places, and because of up-front fees which currently average $8,000 per year, access to higher education will be significantly reduced, particularly&mdash;and this is no surprise&mdash;for low to middle income earners. It is extremely unlikely that up-front fees for over quota courses will generate much additional income for the university. One university council member said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6475">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument about up&hyphen;front fees is one that this university is likely to abstain from. The only certainty in it is that the reputation of the university will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA>The combined effect of these higher education bills is to risk turning the University of Tasmania into a third&hyphen;rate university and as such, to us as Tasmanian senators and to this side of politics in general, they are completely unacceptable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Around the country at the moment, there are thousands upon thousands of students who have just finished, or are finishing, their higher school certificate and who are looking anxiously to next year when many of them would hope to be able to attend a university or a higher education institution. Equally, there are in excess of 600,000 students in universities or higher education institutions in the country who have probably just completed their university exams. They, too, are now anxiously looking to next year to see what is in store for them as a result of this government's legislative changes that it hopes to implement in higher education. In both those cases, the news is grim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is already enough stress on students these days, whether they be finishing their school or completing their higher education studies, without them coming to the end of the year and wondering whether they will be able to afford these increased HECS charges next year; whether, despite their results in the HSC, there will be a place for them at university next year; whether the principles of equity based upon merit&mdash;rather than on wealth or socioeconomic standing&mdash;that have long characterised the approach to higher education in this country will be abandoned; and whether there will actually be sufficient teachers, other academic staff and university staff in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Over the months since the government was elected, we have seen deep concern expressed right across the education sector. It commenced with the ill-advised, flippant remarks of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). It is one of the most important portfolios in terms of social policy in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country and in the delivery of one of the two most important sectors that the government is involved in: health and education. This minister for eduction responded to criticism from vice&hyphen;chancellors, students, academics, unions and people involved in the education sector by saying, `It's just a nick. We're not really doing much damage to education. We're just ripping out a few hundred million.' As people have watched the performance of the minister, the news gets progressively worse and her performance gets progressively worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us look at some of the concerns that have been expressed by people in positions such as vice&hyphen;chancellor and other senior positions in education. One concern is that this government has not actually included funding for 1999 within its proposals&mdash;that is, it has abandoned the previous practice of incorporating forward estimates for the last year of the rolling triennium&mdash;thereby creating uncertainty about what is likely to be the case down the track. That concern has been specifically raised by the Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee and other organisations which are deeply concerned that funding will be eroded further on top of what is proposed in this legislation. What is proposed in this legislation are substantial reductions in government funding in the years 1997 and 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We also have had the response from the minister whose attitude when she spoke to the vice-chancellors earlier in the year was, `Why don't they go out and think of a figure? Why don't they put a price upon what they think their universities should suffer in funding cuts?' She was conducting her portfolio like an auction&mdash;pick a figure, whether it be 10 per cent or five per cent. That was her approach when she first flagged these changes. We then had the official announcements some 10 days before the budget. What were those announcements? Cuts across the board within the vicinity of 10 per cent or more; substantial reductions in university places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, we had the announcement of a review. It seems to be the attitude of this government that you announce substantial cuts and then you say, `On top of that, we will have a review and see what is really <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6476"> required.' In other words, they put the cart before the horse. That is what they did with the bill relating to government expenditure on school education which we were debating last week. As was pointed out on numerous occasions during that debate, this government has introduced changes which will reduce funding for government schools and abolish the new schools policy. They then said, `We will have a review to see how it all really works.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has shown the same degree of arrogance with respect to higher education. It is clear, as previous speakers have pointed out&mdash;particularly Senator Mackay who told us about the position in her home state of Tasmania&mdash;that regional and rural areas of Australia will be hardest hit. A lot of universities in major cities will be hit hard, but universities in rural and regional areas will suffer the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the previous Labor government that substantially expanded the availability to university higher education for rural and regional students. In my home state of New South Wales, we established universities in places like Coffs Harbour, Lismore, Bathurst /Orange. This provided an opportunity for students in those country towns and nearby rural areas to attend a university nearby. This meant less expense with them not having to move to Sydney, Newcastle, Canberra or wherever to get a place at university. We also recognised the importance and the economic benefits to be gained from expanding the availability to higher education for those in rural and regional Australia. We are now seeing that policy gradually reversed. The cuts that are going to come will be felt particularly hard in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record of the previous government in higher education and school education is one of undoubted success. This is recognised by participants throughout the spectrum. The number of university students almost doubled from 350,000 to 630,000 in the period of the previous Labor government. Funding was increased in the order of 70 per cent. As I have said, we had policies which resulted in the expansion of universities into regional areas across the country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That achievement is going to be put at risk because of the changes in this legislation. Let us look at the specific changes. I will firstly look at the direct cuts in higher education funding. The minister says that the cuts will be of the order of $600 million. She calls this a nick. She says, `Nobody should really complain about this because it is just a small amount.' If that is just a nick, I would hate to see the full operation. In any event, this nick will have a permanent negative impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a real figure. As Senator Carr pointed out when making the opening speech for the opposition in this second reading debate, the net effect of these changes will be of the order of $1.8 billion. That is what we are looking at over the four&hyphen;year period. Those details were provided to the Senate estimates committee. They have not been refuted. Despite all of the wishy-washy attempts to juggle the figures and play with the statistics, that is what we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? It means for a start that there will be approximately 17,000 fewer Commonwealth funded places over the remaining two years of the current triennium. Members of the government and other senators should think for a moment what that means. Some 17,000 students, who could quite confidently have looked forward to a place at university, will no longer have that opportunity. It means that of the order of 1,500 teaching jobs in universities will go. Predictions are that the figure will be higher than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not just nicks to the system. These cuts cannot be ridden out. These are substantial cuts. We should think about the effect these changes would have on the students who have just left school, finished their HSC and quite confidently, based on their marks, looked forward to a place at university over the next year or two. That opportunity will go. If you implement these changes this year those people who have just left school will get caught. Where is the planning and where is the consideration that students actually spend three, four or five years at university. These decisions will affect their lives, career opportunities, employment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6477"> opportunities and so on. Why not have the review first? If you are intent upon having the review, do that first, rather than impose these massive changes, these massive cuts, and then try to put a bandaid over the results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the changes relating to the introduction of full fees for undergraduate courses. Once again this is opening up the opportunity to get into university for those who happen to be wealthy enough but not necessarily smart enough to get in. No doubt, again, this will impact upon regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is it that drives this government, that makes it want to return to the era where an elitist view of university education prevailed? Prior to the early 1970s, when fees were abolished, if you were not smart enough to get into university or you did not work hard enough at school to get the results to get into university through a scholarship system, which obviously provided for the vast bulk of students, you could pay your way in, you could buy yourself a degree. As Senator Mackay quite correctly pointed out, certain professions were the preserve of the wealthy because of that attitude. In the 1970s we got rid of that elitist view and I understood&mdash;I hoped, at least&mdash;that we had a bipartisan approach, whereby education was now about equity, about recognising merit and about giving opportunity to all kids, regardless of whether they had come from a wealthy background. But that does not seem to be the attitude of this government, not only in this area of policy but in a range of other policy areas. They simply want to turn back the clock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we get in response? We get people like Senator Tierney saying, `Well, we are going to provide 4,000 scholarships. In case anyone is worried about introducing full paying fees for undergraduate courses, we are going to introduce scholarships&mdash;1,000 a year for four years.' Seventeen thousand places go over two years, and you bring in 1,000 scholarships a year. What a joke. The other response is, `If any university does the wrong thing&mdash;if it does not first fill its quota of HECS paying students but actually enrols students on full fees&mdash;we will fine them $9,000. Senator Tierney made great play of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this. This is your approach to equity, Senator Kemp. This is your government's approach to equity: `We will impose a penalty.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that this government cannot look at any area of policy, whether it be industrial relations or health or education, without taking a negative approach. The negative approach is, `Let's take something away.' It will be the dental health scheme if you are a pensioner. It will be some entitlements to social security if you are a newly arrived migrant. It will be some government funding if you happen to be a student in a government school. In this case it will be places at universities. That is all negative stuff; it is all about imposing penalties. Your whole rationale about guaranteeing equity is: `We are going to fine a university.' What a joke. Universities do not exist to pay fines, they exist to educate students, to make this country a more clever country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally we have the increases to the higher education contribution scheme. That is a clear breach of promise. The coalition went to the election guaranteeing no changes in these areas. What do we get? We get this double whammy on students. Firstly, the fees will increase from a single rate of $2,442 a year to three variable rates commencing at $3,300 and increasing to $5,500 per year, depending upon the course studied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard enough for students as it is, working their way through the various options for courses at university. Anyone who has been to university knows that it is a pretty trying time when you first enrol. These new HECS arrangements are complicated to the extreme and will impact very heavily on students' financial wellbeing&mdash;both as students and in their future careers. It is an inequitable system because it targets students based upon some assumptions that they will have higher incomes in the future. They may have higher incomes if they are doctors or lawyers, but one would assume they will also be paying higher contributions through the tax system. Then we have the reduction in the threshold from $28,000 to approximately $20,000. Clearly that will have an impact upon students from low income families as well as part-time and mature age students.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6478">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government did get elected on 2 March, but it did not get elected to introduce these sorts of policies, which will lead to a serious reduction in the opportunity for students right across the country to have access to a higher education in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. These bills reflect a myriad of broken promises to the higher education sector. Before the election, the coalition's higher education policy stated that the coalition would address the chronic underfunding of our universities and that they understood the stresses and strains of underfunded and overcrowded universities. That is a very worthy objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we find after the election? That the coalition not only did nothing about their promise but also made it worse. Let me put a human face on these cuts. I will just tell the Senate one story from 1993 when I was the chaplain and counsellor at the Queensland University of Technology. I actually have many stories but I will tell you just one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A desperate female student came to see me, not very long before I came into this place, desperate and in tears. She had spent one year in the university and then, because she had no family support, she had deferred for 12 months to work and to raise enough funds to come back and continue her course. So she went back home to a fairly famous rural town in Queensland, Kingaroy, where famous politicians come from. She worked in hairdressing for 12 months and raised enough money so that she could come back to the university and set herself up in a residence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, she discovered after the first few months back at university at the beginning of 1993 that rent and food had taken more than the Austudy that she received, so she had cut into her savings. When she spoke to me, she had reached a stage where there was nothing left for textbooks. She could not get into the library because of the overcrowding that was there. So here she was in the middle of the year, having given up so much of her life and having saved to try to educate herself, finding <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that all of her effort had virtually been to no avail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was in 1993. It was bad enough then. The situation today in 1996 is worse. After we put in place the cuts which are proposed by this government, she would not even bother trying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me run through some of the election promises that have been broken. Before the federal election, the coalition promised universities, their staff and students many things. They promised that they would maintain university operating grants and that they would maintain HECS. They promised they would not lower the repayment threshold. Indeed, they put out a pamphlet crowing about how they had protected students from that dreadful Labor government's attempts to lower the payment threshold. If that is what Australian students thought of the Labor government, what does the coalition government think Australian students think of them? One of their promises was that they would not introduce a voucher system; yet this is exactly what they are doing for open learning students. They are doing this without Senate approval at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They promised not to raise taxes. When in opposition they insisted that HECS was a tax. They have now chosen to break that very public promise. Some calculations made by the Democrats on the level of increased tax which the HECS increases entail demonstrate clearly that any gains made by the living wage are negated by the HECS increases. This bill raises taxes for young graduates. If the changes to HECS are passed in this legislation, it will mean that a first year nurse will be paying an extra $24 a week in tax, that a graduate first year scientist will be paying an extra $25 a week in tax and that teachers and interns will be paying an extra $6 to $10 a week in tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition pledged&mdash;and I am sure many people voted for them because of it&mdash;that they would support higher education, maintain operating grants and enhance regional universities. They said that they understood the problems of the expansion of the higher education system without, as they stated in their policy, `a commensurate expansion in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6479"> the level of funding to the system'. The legislation before us shows very little understanding of these problems of chronic underfunding and chronic overcrowding, despite all the promises made before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems created by the constant erosion of funding and staff and student morale&mdash;these problems have not created a sense of hope for the clever country. Certainly, any idea of a compassionate country has gone out the window. The clever country rhetoric was never backed up with cold hard cash. It has come with the almost annual&mdash;even predictable&mdash;HECS hikes and other fees and charges, and with the increasing experience of overcrowded lecture theatres and even larger tutorials which are now the norm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats firmly believe that it is the obligation of the government to the society to provide education as an investment in our young people. This government, it appears, does not believe in its young people. They say to them, `Yes, we want you to get work. We want you to get a degree so you can get a better job but we are going to make sure that, having taken your first job, you will immediately be saddled with a very large debt.' Fancy saying to the young people of any nation that, as soon as you start work, you will have to start repaying this massive debt with which we have saddled you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said that universities are simply afraid of change. But change is not something that is a stranger to universities or their students. The adage that the only constant is change has rung particularly true for universities. The role of the 1990s university is markedly different from that of the university in previous generations, or even the university of a decade ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the Australian university was the focus of some of the Hawke-Keating government's major policy pronouncements with the overhaul of the binary system and its replacement with a unified national system and the push towards mass education and the clever country. The Dawkins reforms of the mid-1980s took the former binary system of universities and colleges and merged them to create the university system we have today&mdash;a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national system of large universities and a vast increase in student numbers. I give credit to the Labor Party for the incredible expansion in the number of the university places during their term in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us not say to universities that they are afraid of change. That is about all they have lived with over the last decade or so. Universities know what it is to change but they cannot change when the only changes they experience are cuts and more cuts. Universities have changed and the fear that has been engendered by the changes foreshadowed in this legislation are not fears of change or fear of the unknown; it is fear of the known, fear of more of the same&mdash;more underfunding, more debt, more broken promises. This government has the cheek to say that universities are just afraid of change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is much more I could say, but let me finish by saying that, disturbingly, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has continually invited the sector to break ranks and suggest to her the most appropriate cuts, which sounds fair enough. She has also threatened the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee that they will face further cuts if they do not kowtow to her legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me describe to you what is really happening. It is as though somebody had a group of disadvantaged people, put them in a ring, threw a few crusts into the middle of the ring and then said to them, `Alright, you scrabble, and the one who can scrabble the best will get the most.' That is an appalling way to suggest to universities that they must compete with one another for the very few, meagre crusts that this government is prepared to throw them. The President of the NTEU, Carolyn Allport, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister not only wants us to die from the sword of cuts, she wants us to manufacture the sword for her.</PARA>
<PARA>The role of the university in Australian society as a place of inquiry, as the cutting edge of social opinion, as the key to the future for many thousands of people, as the only institution which regularly challenges the status quo and so provides some of the checks and balances vital to our democracy, is too <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6480"> important to be treated as a sectoral interest. The fate of our universities is the fate of our society, and the fate of our universities is in our hands.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise at this late stage of the debate to put on record once again the position of the opposition in respect of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. As has been expressed quite eloquently during the debate by a number of speakers, there are some quite fundamental problems with this legislation. For that reason, the opposition will be moving amendments to try to overcome some of those problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about here are problems in a system of education which has, over recent years, been enhanced in such a way that there has been a revolution of participation in education and a major redressing of equity concerns in education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one has claimed that what has been achieved over the last 13 years of Labor government, for instance, is perfect. But we do maintain that from 1983 to 1996 there was an increase in student numbers from 350,000 to 630,000; participation of 17&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in higher education increased by 60 per cent as a percentage of the age cohort; total Commonwealth funding for universities rose by 70 per cent in real terms during the term of the previous government; and, contrary to claims from some quarters, we succeeded in maintaining and slightly increasing real levels of funding per student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Capital funding went up by 400 per cent in real terms; research funding went up by 200 per cent in real terms. A number of studies have consistently shown that we succeeded in achieving one of the most accessible higher education systems in the world. We wanted equity. We wanted to ensure, particularly, that disadvantaged groups shared in growth in places, so equity plans were developed. Participation by the disadvantaged was encouraged. In fact, there were some important achievements in this regard. Aboriginal participation went up by 50 per cent between 1990 and 1995 alone. There were substantial gains for people from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and, for women, participation in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> non&hyphen;traditional areas. The numbers from low socioeconomic backgrounds and from rural and isolated areas were up significantly, but unfortunately not their share of total enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we compare ourselves in this respect, we should compare ourselves in a world where there has been increasing difficulty for people to maintain equity ratios in tertiary education. We have managed to at least achieve increased numbers when the rest of the world has gone backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our major problems with this legislation are twofold. This legislation, in a broad sense, will transform Australia's higher education system, and transform it for the worse. There are problems, for instance, in terms of the Higher Education Funding Act and the implementation of full up&hyphen;front fees for Australian undergraduates. We find a particular problem with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find a particular problem with legislation which introduces a greatly increased and differential scale of HECS charges. We also find problems with legislation which reduces the income at which people with HECS debts are required to start making repayments. We also find substantial problems with legislation which deregulates the charging of fees under the open learning scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of some aspects of the legislation with which we agree&mdash;and there are some of those&mdash;we do support a number of routine measures which adjust various grant payments to institutions to take account of price movements. We find particularly perplexing&mdash;but we find no reason to oppose&mdash;the proposition in this legislation which raises maximum grant levels for the calendar years 1997 and 1998, contained in the Higher Education Funding Bill but, somewhat farcically, it comes at a time when the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has announced an intention to make determinations to pay less than the maximum amounts specified in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6481"> Other problems stem from the fact that this government was elected on a commitment to maintain triennial funding, a commitment that has also been broken by this proposed legisla tion. Under normal rolling triennial funding arrangements, we would expect this legislation to contain the funding level for the final year of the new triennium, which is calendar year 1999. This is a broken promise which will be of particular concern to the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there are other aspects with which we agree&mdash;the proposal to increase funding for research infrastructure, collaborative grants, and postgraduate awards. But while we support those measures, we also know that they do not go anywhere near offsetting the damaging impact of the government's cuts to university operating grants and the abolition of discretionary funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also will not be opposing the introduction of the new merit scholarships. But I note here that we are talking about scholarships, the number of which will peak at 4,000 after four years in a system with some 630,000 students enrolled this year. It is minuscule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned because this legislation represents a major dismantling of the way tertiary education has been run in this country for some time. It comes from a government which came in on the promise of not making such changes. We are seeing here the full extent of the government's surgery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is proposing to make major cuts to universities, thereby reducing opportunities and the quality of the learning environment while at the same time making students pay more for the privilege. The combined impact of cuts to public funding, higher education charges, and the introduction of full fees for undergraduates, in combination, will have a profound impact, not just on the individuals involved but also on the equity of the system. Bruce Chapman, the designer of HECS, summed up the impacts in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be an inevitable increase in the composition of enrolments towards students from rich backgrounds as the currently universal HECS arrangements are moved towards a system in which a significant minority of students are paying up&hyphen;front fees.</PARA>
<PARA>This government is ditching equity. Equity is not a core commitment. No matter how the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister tries to approach it, no matter how extensive her rhetoric is, she is trying to sell us a pup here. Unfortunately, she has support from her backbenchers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding cuts are of major proportions. It is not good enough for the minister to call them a `nick', as she has. There are elements of the cuts which, in all, amount to a massive reduction in the funding capacity of universities. Operating grants are to be cut by $624 million over four years. Discretionary funds are to be cut by $214 million over four years. There is a failure to provide supplementation for university salary increases at a time when the previous government was to provide some $250 million per annum for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has made some vague statements about funding assistance to ensure agreements, expecting people to be able to bring forward cash flows and so on. But the reality is that we are talking about more than a nick; we are talking about an effective cut that the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee estimates to be 10 to 12 per cent by the year 2000. Professor Gavin Brown, the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Sydney&mdash;a mathematician by training&mdash;estimates an effective cut of 15 per cent to his university by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already we are seeing the impact across the country. We are seeing reports of cuts to courses, loss of diversity, closure of campuses, staff reductions, and postgraduate works being devastated at many institutions, all as a result of this government's insistence that this area take the brunt of the cuts. This will have grave implications for professional development in many areas, including teacher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the minister's response to this? The response is one of bluster and blackmail&mdash;blackmailing universities to come in behind her proposal, otherwise she will make sure that the cuts are felt even more savagely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6482"> The HECS increases are in marked contrast with the way HECS was introduced under the previous government. It was introduced after analysis and detailed study of the impact of HECS on participation decisions, particularly regarding the disadvantaged. We also legislated to ensure that the Higher Education Coun cil, the government's independent advisory body, would be able to report regularly to the parliament on the impact of HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has preceded these measures? What analysis has preceded this government's changes to HECS? What assessment has there been? There has been absolutely none, just a decision by the minister and by the government that it would be fair enough to raise a certain amount of money from the students. As the minister said at the time, it would represent the cost of a movie ticket a week. But we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars which will have to be paid by young people who cannot afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a son who is going through Year 12. I have spent some time with him and his mates over recent months and I have seen them disturbed by all the debate about reduced funding levels to universities. I have seen them watch and analyse results over recent weeks. I have seen them read newspaper reports very keenly to see if the courses they want to choose are going to be there next year, whether the science courses will get the funding, whether the law courses will get the funding, and whether they will be able to go to the university of their choice. A lot of them have made substantial and radical decisions over recent weeks because of the impact of this government's cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the government: you could not have discussed this; you could not have done this in a worse way, particularly for the kids involved. Enough is the pressure of Year 12 without all this debate about reduced places and reduced opportunities, and a greater demand on them and their parents to pay HECS. Obviously, in my case, things are a bit different. But so many young kids are now being forced to make decisions about where they can go to study based on a fair degree of indecision and the fear that they will have to incur higher fees, higher charges, and have to pay them back in quicker time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing this already from the enrolment data across the country. It paints a worrying picture. It is not good enough for the minister to shrug her shoulders and say that it will be okay. It will not be okay, and we can see that already. Applications are an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indicator which need to be treated with a degree of caution. We are already seeing, particularly in disadvantaged areas such as western Sydney, that overall enrolment applications are down by some seven per cent. Specifically, engineering is down by 41 per cent, and science and technology are down by 14 per cent. There have been major declines in non&hyphen;school leaver applications in some states. In Victoria they are down by 12 per cent. In my state&mdash;the minister's state&mdash;South Australia, they are down by 20 per cent. If South Australia needs anything, it needs continuation of postgraduate work, particularly in the sciences area, in engineering, and in areas related to the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the minister does not care. The minister is taking a Marie Antoinette approach to all this. Basically she is saying: `They can like it or lump it.' That is not the way to run government or to develop policy in Australia. We have not been used to this `like it or lump it' approach over recent years, nor should we accept it. For that reason I find this government's approach most offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a particularly worrying trend with respect to science and technology courses. It is not just the opposition saying that; Dr John Rice, President of the Australian Council of Deans of Science, has expressed grave concerns, pointing to drops of some 20 per cent in some institutions in science applications for enrolment. There is a looming crisis in the supply of maths and science schoolteachers. Studies have shown that there will be a shortfall of around 9,000 by the year 2003. This decision will just make it worse. As Senator Woodley said, it is very much the end of the clever country when you are dissecting, when you are undermining, when you are attacking in a discriminate way, as this minister has, non-graduate students and courses across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always rejected up-front fees for undergraduates. This objection is based on the central tenet that access to various professions and career options for young people should be defined and determined by ability and motivation, not by financial means. This initiative raises some pretty massive equity considerations. Not only is it equity in terms of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6483"> individuals involved but it also raises some pretty severe national interest questions. For the minister to draw an analogy with overseas fee paying students is spurious. It is in our national interest as a country to ensure equity and participation in education. For that reason, if not for that reason alone, we should ensure that we continue to reject up-front fees for Australian undergraduates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other concerns about this proposal. The minister is not game enough or sufficiently competent to tell us how it is going to work. For a start, she is not prepared to put into legislation, into regulation, the guidelines, the provisions, the regulations that would govern this particular aspect of her initiatives. She says that she will attach strict conditions to universities providing fee paying places but she has not explained how the universities or the institutions or the sector will fill all HECS paying places first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is to say that many of those HECS places that the universities would have offered in future years will be available? Who is to say that these places will be filled first before the full fee paying places are provided? How is the 25 per cent rule to be interpreted, for instance? How is it going to operate? Is it going to be applied institution wide, faculty wide or sector wide? How are we going to ensure that the most popular courses are not quarantined off for fee paying arrangements? They are complex problems but they are problems that the minister has not been able to address or to satisfy the Senate on, and they are problems that are left outstanding at the end of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have problems in respect of the open learning changes. We introduced the open learning scheme as a way of broadening access to higher education, of taking advantage of the strengths of those universities specialising in distance education and also of taking maximum advantage of new learning media and technologies, be it TV, computer mediated learning, the Internet or whatever. This government now chooses to turn open learning into a Trojan Horse. That is obviously this government's preferred bundle of education funding&mdash;fully deregulated, fee <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> paying, and with minimal assistance for disadvantaged students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We required that open learning charges, for instance, be set at no more than the standard HECS fee for the same year offered by conventional means and we provided a funding mechanism, the open learning deferred payments scheme, to help students defer this expense with a HECS type loan. This government is choosing in this legislation to remove all constraints and fee charging through the measures contained in this bill. It will be severely limiting access to open learning deferred payment system loans as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has some pretty fundamental problems with this legislation, not the least of which was the approach taken by the government in announcing it and also in developing the policy that is reflected in this legislation. This government is fundamentally undermining one of the world's most accessible systems of higher education. It is diminishing the quality of the educational experience of Australian students. It is damaging this country's prospects of educating a technologically sophisticated and adaptable work force. Essentially what we are doing here is taking a step back down the road to when many key professions were bastions of privilege with access largely restricted to those with significant financial means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember also that this is a government that came to these decisions without any open review, without any open policy analysis or debate. It was the minister late one night announcing to a group of stunned academics that the cuts would be as high as 11, 12, 13 per cent. That is the analysis now of the leaders of the tertiary sector. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee estimates that the cuts embodied in this legislation, no matter what statements the minister makes, translate into a 10 to 12 per cent effective cut by the year 2000. Professor Gavin Brown says to his university that it is a 15 per cent cut by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have witnessed over the last seven months what I think most commentators would agree is a pretty dismal performance by a minister who was out of her depth at the start and a minister who has taken absolutely <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6484"> no opportunity over recent months to try to come to grips with the policy embodied in this. She does not care that so many young Australians will be denied access to the system. She does not care, nor does her colleague Dr Kemp, about so many targeted programs being washed away by this government's deregulatory approach. She does not care about the pressures she is putting on the tertiary system, pressure which already has led to a substantial number of courses being abolished or curtailed. She does not care, unfortunately, that Australia's future and future prospects are premised on our capacity to produce more highly skilled persons from universities and other aspects of the education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our future is based on the extent to which we can develop those skills and compete with those skills in a pretty fluid and open global economy. To the extent that we do not put the investment in through these programs through research and development, unfortunately this government is taking us down the road that the Menzies government took us in the 1950s&mdash;essentially, no vision for the future, a future hidden behind an isolationist policy and mentality and a future which really did not recognise Australia's capacity to interact and pick up enormous opportunities through the rest of the world.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;should not be amended. As Senator Bolkus said, we are not in committee, but I am giving the parliamentary secretary advance notice of something that may be raised. As you well know, section 2A sets out the objects of the act:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objects of this Act are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) to support a higher education system that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is characterised by quality, diversity and equity of access; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> contributes to the development of cultural and intellectual life in Australia; and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (iii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is appropriate to meet Australia's social and economic needs for a more highly educated and skilled population; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) to strengthen Australia's knowledge base and enhance the contribution of Australia's research capabilities to national economic development and international competitiveness and the attainment of social goals.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an exhaustive list of the objects of the act. The amendments do not purport to change that in any way. Yet, if the second reading speech is perused, it will be seen that there is a turning away in philosophy from the objects that are set out in the act. If you look at the second reading speech that was delivered with the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, it refers to 4,000 merit scholarships that are going to be created between 1997 and 2000. That is the only mention of merit that I can find in the second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we as a nation want to achieve the objects of the act, I would have thought that what we must do is concentrate on merit and not the ability to obtain tertiary education by means which include factors other than merit. This bill is a major shift in the approach that has been taken until now. To use the words of the act, the purpose of the act is to contribute to the cultural, intellectual, social and economic life and needs of Australia. As I say, the only way that is going to be achieved is to get the very best of the people coming through the education system and make sure that they receive the education to which they are entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From now on, one in four Australian students&mdash;25 per cent&mdash;will be able to enter tertiary education institutions by means which include factors other than merit. That does present a most dramatic change in the approach that we have and is something that is not accommodated in the objects of the act. Clearly, to encompass the changes made by the amendments we are looking at now, there ought to be changes made to section 2A of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988; otherwise the objects of the act are inconsistent with the other provisions contained in the act. That is the first thing I want to say about the shift away from the philosophy of the act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6485">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing is that it concentrates people's minds on the money they might make and the personal advantage they might obtain through education. Evidence of that comes from the second reading speech. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill introduces differential HECS contributions from 1997. This measure strikes a better balance between public and private funding of higher education. Students will now be required to make a contribution to the cost of their education which is more closely linked to both the actual cost of the course undertaken and the likely future benefits to the individual in terms of increased life&hyphen;time earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a factor that is not encompassed in the objects of the act. There ought to be another provision in the objects of the act which says that the purpose of this act is to enable certain people to make a lot of money and to give themselves a much more comfortable life by getting qualifications at a tertiary level. When we come to consider this in the committee stage, I will ask why that has not been included in the amending legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to advance Australia and if you want to see contributions made to the cultural and intellectual life of Australia to meet the social and economic needs of Australia, you need people with altruism. You need people who are skilled with tertiary education and who want to use those skills to further the good and the health of their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the thrust of the second reading speech. In fact, I do not think that the second reading speech talks in terms of Australia's future. I do not think it talks at all in terms of the contribution that students might make to the cultural and intellectual life of Australia. It does not talk in terms of what education can do for the social and economic needs of Australia. Its whole thrust&mdash;its whole philosophy&mdash;is directed towards ensuring that some people who get into education, either through merit or through merit and wealth, can make themselves a better living, and that is a great pity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Say somebody has studied medicine, law, engineering, or indeed anything, and would like to use those skills and that education not to make money for himself or herself but to contribute to the future of Australia. Of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> course, that might mean that they get a lot less in terms of remuneration than those who go ahead to gather unto themselves&mdash;and justifiably so&mdash;riches and wealth. Those who go to lesser paid jobs&mdash;this point has been made tonight&mdash;those who might want to work in a poorer area where the returns as a doctor are not as much as they might be elsewhere, and those who want to go and work in legal aid, are the people who are going to be punished for doing that because they will have to contribute just as much in HECS payments as those who go into the more remunerative sections of the various professions. It is a pity that this bill and this second reading speech send that message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lowering of the minimum threshold to $20,701 means that the current discount for voluntary payment at this income level will be discontinued.</PARA>
<PARA>That is obvious. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repayment required at this income level will be less than $12 per week.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a sentence which again sends a message, and the message is this: that the people&mdash;the department, the government&mdash;who are introducing this legislation do not know what the effects of paying $12 a week are to some people. If you are on $20,701 per year and you have responsibilities to take care of yourself and, perhaps, others, then $12 a week&mdash;that is over $600 a year&mdash;is a very significant issue. But this second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repayment required at this income level will be less than $12 per week.</PARA>
<PARA>It makes that point as if $12 was insignificant. The next sentence confirms what I am saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing discounts of twenty five per cent for up&hyphen;front payments and fifteen per cent for voluntary payments of $500 at any time, will remain.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is again the person who has got not wealth but a considerable amount in the way of assets and a considerable amount in the way of income who is going to be better off under these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another little thing in passing is this: under the amendments the concept of semester is to be taken from the act and is to be replaced by study period. For an old romantic like me this is a little tragic. Semester had that sense of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6486"> obtaining not only knowledge but culture, of sitting down and discussing things like Senator Brownhill and I used to do in the old days across the passage of the old House. Senator Brownhill, that aspect will be gone and what we will have now will be study periods. It is a bit like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. All the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters can do when they are in here is take down the golden words of wisdom. They cannot exchange words and talk about how they can better improve the culture and the social wellbeing of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, until they get back to their office. What you are really doing is introducing a situation where we will all be sitting down taking <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> notes the whole time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept that education should be more than, as it were, shovelling knowledge into the head has gone. Again, I keep coming back to the objectives of the act. With that has gone a higher education system which, according to the objects of the act, should be characterised by quality, diversity and equity of access, which contributes to the cultural and intellectual life of Australia and which is appropriate to meet Australia's social needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is intended that the new act meet Australia's economic needs, but the economic needs are only one of the factors that are looked for in the objects of the act. Object 2A(b) of the act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to strengthen Australia's knowledge base and enhance the contribution of Australia's research capabilities to national economic development and international competitiveness and the attainment of social goals.</PARA>
<PARA>When you read the second reading speech, it is very difficult to see where those objects of the act have even been turned to. Why do we not simply change the objects of the act, as I have been suggesting, and say that the idea of this act and these amendments is to enable people to enrich themselves, to get on in life and to flourish as individuals. According to the way this second reading speech seems to read, we can put aside all this nonsense about quality, diversity, equity of access and the development of cultural and intellectual life in Australia and instead put in the objects, which is exactly what these amendments are attempting to do.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also at times a little contradictory. One of the first paragraphs talks about the need for merit and, if you have merit, you get the scholarship. But, if you skip the next paragraph, the third paragraph says that as long as you have money&mdash;and no doubt you would have to have some merit as well; surely you are not going to be able to get into the university simply on the grounds of money&mdash;you can take the place that would otherwise have gone to 25 per cent of the people who would be applying who have more merit than you but less money. The last paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will enable Australian students to have a greater chance of obtaining the higher education course of their first preference, freeing up government funded places they would have otherwise accepted with their second or third preference. It will also generate additional income for the universities and will provide an extra incentive for diversity among institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure what is meant by `freeing up government funded places they would have otherwise accepted with their second or third preference'. I am not quite sure how that fits in with the general scheme of things or with the objects of the act. Perhaps that can be explained when we get to the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also talks about generating additional income for the universities and providing an extra incentive for diversity amongst institutions. That seems to be a message to the universities that they have to get out there and make the money they need to exist by charging fees to at least one in four of their students. It would be more than that because they would hope to get students from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the thoughts that I have on this legislation. I think they are thoughts that have been well argued during the evening. It is a pity, as has been said, that there has been this major shift in the philosophy that should guide our education sector, particularly the tertiary education sector. I could venture the thought that this is not going to lead to the great and clever country that could have been achieved to the extent had we persisted with the old scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6487"> It is an unfortunate piece of legislation. Perhaps the Minister for Employment, Educa tion, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) could tell us in her concluding speech before the committee stage, if not in the committee stage, how those objects set out in 2A are going to be enhanced by the latest piece of legislation in this area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to now enter this debate on higher education funding and acknowledge some of the things that have been said by the previous speaker, Senator Cooney.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I would like to remind the Senate that it was almost 150 years ago that William Charles Wentworth persuaded the Legislative Council of New South Wales in 1850 to provide a perpetual endowment to fund the University of Sydney. The motto of that university, as Senator Cooney no doubt knows, is: `Sidere mens eadem mutato'&mdash;that is, `the same spirit under a new sky'. Professor F.A. Todd translated it, I think, from memory as: `Heart to heart, though poles apart'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That reflects the long traditions of university education which span the centuries since universities such as Bologna, Oxford and Cambridge were founded in the Middle Ages.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opening of an University in the capital of New South Wales is an event greatly significant of the progress of the social and intellectual growth of the colony. Accordingly, the ceremony, which took place on the 11th of October last, in the Great Hall, College-buildings, Hyde-park, was attended by a very numerous audience. Soon after eleven o'clock the doors at the western entrance were opened, and every part of the hall appropriated to the general company was densely crowded before half-past twelve, when the doors were closed, and the ceremony of registering the names of the matriculated students was gone through. Professor Smith presented each of the young gentlemen to the Registrar, by whom their names were entered in the matriculation book, the first name upon the list being Fitzwilliam Wentworth. The matriculation entries having been made, the procession of those who were to take part in the official proceedings of the day was formed in the apartments of the principal, and entered the hall, the band of Her Majesty's 11th Regiment playing the National Anthem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Vice-Provost, Sir Charles Nicholson, conducted his Excellency the Governor-General to the state-chair placed for him in the centre of the dais, at the north end of the hall; and the scene at this moment was of the most animated character. On either side of his Excellency were seated the Fellows of the Senate. Before them again sat clergymen of all denominations, amongst whom we observed the Rev. Messrs. Allwood, Grylls, Walsh, Walker, Turner, Priddle, Stephen, Smith, Dr. Steele, etc. On the left was a numerous body of military and naval officers of the garrison and port. Near them were the French and other foreign Consuls, their glittering uniforms contrasting with the black gowns of the Solicitor-General and other leading members of the Bar, and of the young Alumni, who occupied the front seats. The Vice-Provost occupied a state chair on the right, a little in advance of his Excellency, and was supported by Professors Pell and Smith. On the extreme right of the reserved space was the Principal's chair, on the left, the Registrar's. A large portion of the area was reserved for the ladies. Over the Governor&hyphen;General's chair was a shield bearing the Royal arms of England, and on his right and left two others with the arms of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Over Dr. Woolley's chair was a shield bearing the arms of his own college, University College, Oxford. Immediately opposite, over the Registrar's chair, was the pure white shield of Sydney University; no arms yet emblazoned thereupon, but bearing the motto, "I will achieve".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir Charles Nicholson then rose and delivered an eloquent address, wherein he characterized the University as an institution founded for the promotion of all the higher branches of learning&mdash;an institution whose comprehensive design and ample <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6488"> endowment must enlist in its favour the sympathies of every generous mind, and afford a promise that the advantages which it holds forth may continue to be dispensed to the future generations of this colony, to the remotest period. In the year 1850 (continued Sir Charles) the Legislative Council passed an act to incorporate and endow the University of Sydney. The preamble to the Bill declares it expedient for the better advancement of religion and morality, and the promotion of useful knowledge, to hold forth to all classes and denominations of her Majesty's subjects resident in the colony of New South Wales, without any distinction whatever, an encouragement for pursuing a regular and liberal course of education. To carry out these intentions, provision is made for the appointment of a Senate, consisting of sixteen fellows, to whom are confided the granting of degrees, honours, and rewards of merit, and the general conduct and management of the institution. If any further argument were required illustrative of the necessity of such a foundation as our University, it is afforded in the partial, if not entire, failure of every attempt hitherto made for the establishment of collegiate institutions throughout the Australian colonies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The learned Provost then glanced at the cause of this failure, which he referred partly to the limitation of some particular religious communion: where the University of Sydney had been placed upon a more comprehensive foundation. The second feature to which Sir Charles adverted to as characteristic of Sydney University is the high privilege accorded to it by the Local Legislature, ratified and confirmed by a most marked expression of the Royal will, of granting degrees in the several faculties of arts, law and medicine. A third auspicious attribute is the comprehensive design and character. Limited to no sect and confined to no class, its sphere of action is calculated to embrace men of every creed and of all ranks. Dispensing more secular instruction, and leaving the inculcation of religious truth to the spiritual guardians of each denomination of religionists, the University presents the widest possible area for all who are willing to come within her precincts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir Charles then referred to the liberal provision made for the endowment of eighteen scholarships to the annual value of 50 each, tenable for three years; these being open to the competition of the youth of the whole colony. Sir Charles then explained the steps taken for securing able and accomplished teachers, recommended by a committee of gentlemen in England, consisting of Sir John Herschel, Bart.; Professor Airy, Astronomer Royal; Professor Maiden, of University College, London; and Henry Denison, Esq., formerly Fellow of All Souls, Oxford. Simultaneously with the means adopted for the selection and appointment of the professors, steps were taken for obtaining books <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and apparatus from England, for the foundation of a library, and for the necessary illustration of the lectures in physical science. The philosophical apparatus, selected by professor Smith, had already reached the colony; and our first consignment of books, of the value of 500, was daily expected. In conclusion, Sir Charles addressed himself to those for whose special benefit the University had been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Loud applause followed, and Sir Charles having resumed his seat, the Alumni were introduced by Professor Smith to the Vice&hyphen;Provost and Senate, and took the prescribed oath.</PARA>

<PARA>I have had that incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  for it shows the enlightenment which motivated that young colony.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6489">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering this legislation I have been deeply concerned that university funding should not be prejudiced and particularly in a serious manner. The government has made it very clear that if it does not achieve the revenue sought to be achieved by changes to the higher education contribution scheme, it will be obliged to consider the level of university funding in next year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the increases in HECS. In response to a number of concerns similarly expressed around the chamber and outside the chamber, the minister has indicated that if the government's objective is not achieved as described in this bill, it will mean cuts will be required in funding to universities and especially significant cuts in operational subsidies. In that event, the smaller universities&mdash;including the university in my state, the University of Tasmania, which needs to cater for students from all over the state and needs campuses in three and four parts of the state&mdash;will be affected considerably more than the mainland universities; not least of course because it does not enjoy economies of scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the government seems to be lacking the liberal spirit of Sir Robert Menzies who did so much for universities with funding increases and Commonwealth scholarships in the post&hyphen;war period. Senators, colleagues, you will be interested to read Sir Robert Menzies' account of his efforts for universities in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Measure of the Years</EMPHASIS>. You will read in there his reasons for promoting Commonwealth scholarships. I refer to chapter 9. I do so because I am sure the government will be most interested in this and I expect other honourable senators will be as well. But Sir Robert Menzies, in chapter 9 page 84 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Measure of the Years</EMPHASIS> says this, and you can almost hear him saying it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the significant things about this long period of office, one that I recall with great pride and satisfaction, is the dramatic development of the universities and of some aspects of secondary education. Since my own student days at Melbourne, I had maintained my interest in university education. As time went on, particularly after I entered politics, I saw its growing community importance and occasionally chided many of my business and banking friends for not giving it greater encouragement and recognition. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>I want to finish with this quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before the Second World War, a university training had been regarded as a kind of privilege to be enjoyed by students of unusual talent or of well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do or self&hyphen;sacrificing parents, or of both. Scholarships were very scarce, and hotly contested.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the present piece of legislation because I notice that half my time has gone. Given the current fiscal constraints that the government has indicated, what we might be able to achieve and particularly what we would hope to have achieved in this Senate may be very limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the Senate is set out in the constitution. The Senate is not&mdash;nor in particular am I&mdash;the government. We do have a responsibility, however, to ensure thorough review of legislation. The government is entitled to make the initial policy decisions and carry them through against the framework and the broad background of what it was elected to do. In general, elected governments should have to live with the consequences of their decisions. My concern, as I expressed before, is about what might occur in the operational subsidies and other funding for universities, particularly those in the regions. I am also concerned about a further burden being placed on the shoulders of battlers whose children do not go to universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of concerns, apart from the increase in HECS: the lowering of the thresholds for payments of HECS that affects graduates supporting families; the introduction of differential higher education charges for different courses; and the failure of the tax system to recognise properly the cost of investing in education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the first matter of concern, I can understand the government's wish not to leave HECS liabilities outstanding. Some HECS debts will never be repaid&mdash;whether by reason of death, emigration or failure of graduates to earn income. To require graduates to start paying HECS debts earlier, in some cases may turn out not to be such a bad thing if they are repaying debts while single, without dependants and with the capacity to repay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are graduates whose incomes are not high and who are supporting families. Lowering the repayment threshold to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6490"> $20,700 may&mdash;I say `may'&mdash;be reasonable for single graduates without dependants. It is not so if that graduate has a dependent spouse and children. That is a point that I believe the government should accept. I think the bill should be amended so that the repayment threshold takes account of family circumstances, and I will be moving accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second concern, apart from the level of the HECS increases, is the differential rates proposed. Already concerns are emerging that different charges for different courses are not justified. For example, law courses are not more expensive to provide than most courses and the level of cost recovery seems excessive. The need to charge differential fees for each subject raises all sorts of odd questions. I do not intend&mdash;and unfortunately I do not have time&mdash;to go into those at this point. I will be referring to them in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing which certainly concerns many people is that the differential charges are being based on supposed future income prospects. Is it logical to charge a person on the basis not of what it costs to provide something, not of what that person's income is, but merely on statistical expectations of what the person's future income may turn out to be? If we are talking about private sector practices, we might note that sellers of goods and services normally charge all customers the same price and do not base their charges on the incomes of their customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not charge doctors, lawyers, engineers or teachers more to use the roads or take the train. Where we do get a larger contribution out of higher income earners is through the graduated income tax scales. Those scales, unlike the differentiated HECS charges, are based on actual incomes people earn, not putative or expected incomes. To make graduates pay both higher fees and higher taxes through higher marginal income tax rates might seem by many to be a Treasury double&hyphen;dipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In talking about taxes, we should also examine the argument that students are being subsidised by taxpayers. What does that mean? Who pays the taxes? Is Treasury forgetting that students and their families are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taxpayers? Bureau of Statistics figures on fiscal incidence have shown that, on average, families with children are net taxpayers, not net beneficiaries from the tax transfer system, even ignoring the future taxes the children will pay. If students and their families are being told how much money it is costing the Treasury to provide university education, it at least ought to be acknowledged how much they are paying the Treasury in direct and indirect taxes both now and in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out another inconsistency in Treasury&mdash;and, no doubt, Finance&mdash;arguments on higher education. If the argument is made that higher education is relevant to gaining incomes, then we should be honest about it and repeal sections 51(6) and 82A of the Income Tax Assessment Act. These sections exclude in a quite unfair and discriminatory manner the deductions that would otherwise be available to many students in respect of HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also point out that it was the McMahon Liberal government which introduced deductibility in 1972 for the first $400 of self&hyphen;education expenses to avoid the many legal debates about when and whether an education expense was income related. Given where the debate is now on education and training in relation to income generation, I think we should pick up that precedent and liberalise it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Treasury and Finance cannot have it both ways. If they are going to argue that charges or fees for university students are justified because they are related to income, then they must accept the logical result that these fees and charges should be tax deductible. I hope that honourable senators give this some consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many areas we are seeing moves by government to privatise their spending or income support functions whether it be in income support for migrants, for child care, for students or for health and education funding. I understand the fiscal reasons advanced by the government&mdash;not just by this government but by a previous government&mdash;in wishing to devolve these functions. However, changes must be fairly implemented. To the extent that taxpayers are being expected <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6491"> to take over government expenditure, it is only fair that the tax system should recognise through deductions the amount of income that taxpayers are being made to spend on these formerly government funded functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The whole area of the tax treatment of education needs review. In the United States there is a much more generous attitude to education expenses and charitable gifts or trusts for education. Yet we penalise private funding of education. There is the explicit denial of deductibility of self&hyphen;education expenses that I have just referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also remind the Senate that the Industry Commission recommended abolition of capital gains tax on gifts of property to tax exempt charities such as universities. If we wish to encourage greater graduate support for universities, we need to reverse these sorts of tax disincentives. Wasn't that what Sir Robert Menzies suggested?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might point out that I am not alone in raising questions about some of the logical economic implications of charging more for tertiary education. Mr Stephen Koukoulas, an economist with Citibank Australia, observed in the bank's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Money Market Week</EMPHASIS> newsletter of 22 November 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the decision was great for the short&hyphen;term bottom line of the Budget, over the longer run, it means that there will be a reduction in the skill level of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I recognise that, yes, the government is the government and that the Senate has a role: one of audit, control and review. That role we must discharge in accordance with our constitutional duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to see the universities run down. I have taken note of what the minister has said publicly about that and that, in effect, action will be required in the next budget to make up the difference if we defeat this legislation regarding increases to HECS and repayment arrangements. As I understand it, and as the minister has said, a serious action will be required in respect of operational subsidies. However, I do think there are a number of reasonable amendments that the Senate might consider in the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all senators for the contribution they have made to the second reading debate of this very important package of bills: the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. I would like to take a minute to basically put the government's position in a very short, summary form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, the package seeks Senate approval to ask future students&mdash;not existing students&mdash;to make a higher HECS contribution, and it is a significantly higher HECS contribution. No-one has ever made any bones about that. Yes, the package seeks to change the HECS contribution from being a flat one for all students to a differentiated HECS which reflects the different cost of the courses and also bears in mind the differing expected income potential from each of these courses. This is a recognition by the government that there is a very public benefit in higher education institutions; we all benefit from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a private benefit received by each person who has the opportunity to participate in higher education, and that private benefit is acknowledged by the HECS contribution, introduced by Labor and supported by us at the time&mdash;if it was not supported by us, it should have been. The HECS contribution has one very essential characteristic that we would seek to retain: it is not pay as you learn; it is pay as you earn. Labor satisfactorily removed from the higher education system the need for you to have money to get there in the first place. If you had the merit, you could get in and you did not have to pay back until you were earning. By far, that is one of the better policy contributions from Labor in the last 13 years of its government and we seek to retain that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6492"> But we make no bones about the fact that we say graduates are very substantial private beneficiaries of higher education. They inevitably have higher incomes&mdash;yes, there are always exceptions to this, but on average they have higher incomes&mdash;they have much more sustainable employment, they have better status in the community and they have roughly half the unemployment rate of people who do not have that opportunity. The unemploy ment rate of people with an undergraduate degree is around four per cent. It is closer to 8.6 per cent or 8.7 per cent for all other Australians. We make no bones about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite particularly, this package has very small cuts to higher education institutions themselves&mdash;a one per cent cut next year against forward estimates. They were, by and large, growth forward estimates&mdash;in total, they certainly were and for many others they were. I am sure you, Mr Deputy President, understand the differences around Australia in higher education institutions in that institutions in your state and in Western Australia were to be the beneficiaries of very significant growth&mdash;places they should have been provided with in the past but were not. I congratulate the previous government on redressing that imbalance. It is a balance we would like to retain. The only difference is that we have returned to Victoria some places that we thought were inappropriately taken from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first element of this package is the recognition that students gain a very substantial benefit from higher education. We are asking them to pay a higher contribution while maintaining the essential element of HECS&mdash;that is, you do not pay until you earn. Secondly, there will be very small cuts in operating grants to institutions&mdash;one per cent against growth estimates next year. That means that universities will get more money&mdash;not much more, but it is still more&mdash;next year than this year. They will receive three per cent the year after and one per cent the year after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coupled with that, there will be an opportunity for universities to earn higher income&mdash;that is, to broaden the funding base for the universities and make them more secure. It will put them in a position where, when we have a government that has not run things properly for the previous 13 years and a savings target is being sought, the savings do not have to come straight out of operating grants. This will give universities a more secure base by giving them more funding through the HECS contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure students do not welcome this measure, but I have never met anybody who welcomes paying more for anything. This is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of no surprise to me. Nonetheless, this will give universities a broader funding base. Yes, it is true that there will be a greater contribution in HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will also allow them to sell places to Australian students once they have filled their government funded places. I have indicated in the past that a limitation will be put on universities that they have to fill their government funded places first. Contrary to the protestations of non&hyphen;government senators there will be an increase in funded undergraduate places next year. There will be an increase in government funded undergraduate places the year after and the year after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any pretence about this issue should now be stopped since we are at the serious part of the debate where it really counts. It is not the polemic that one runs out to a lobby with. We are debating the detail of what we are going to do or not do. There will be more government funded undergraduate places next year, the year after and the year after that. We have never made any bones about the fact that we have said to universities, `We do not expect you to teach the same number of people for less dollars, but we do expect you to find savings&mdash;that is, to reduce load&mdash;in postgraduate course work which the previous government introduced the opportunity to charge fees for years ago.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There should be no misconception that this government is offering fewer opportunities for young Australians to get into higher education. The opposite is the case. There are more government funded places at the undergraduate level being offered by this government than were to be offered by the previous government in each of the following three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities will have to fill those places by course. I did hear one of the senators on the other side say that they did not know how that was going to work. That question has been answered in this place on a number of occasions. Universities will have to fill their government funded places by course before they can sell places to domestic students. We have also indicated that we will put a 25 per cent cap on that so that under no circumstances could a university seek to fill the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6493"> more expensive courses with fee paying students at the expense of government funded students. In any course, fee paying students would not be able to form more than 25 per cent of the majority. We think they are appropriate protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had in mind, as has been mentioned in the debate, that the appropriate way to introduce that protection was through guidelines. It is clear to me that a number of senators are not happy with that and there is some suspicion about the government's intention in that respect. To that end, I have asked for an amendment to be circulated. I have indicated in the past that we are quite happy to put the limitation of 25 per cent and the filling of government funded places first into legislation. If the Senate is of the mind to accept that amendment we would be very happy. I do not mind if the Senate is not because I know what we believe in and I am happy to do it by regulation. I clearly understand that other senators are concerned about this and I would be happy to change it for that reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does give universities a significant income earning capacity which we would hope they would use for developing better infrastructure and for teaching. They do have a legitimate salary claim that needs to be addressed. Without the flexibility to earn extra income, they will not be able to do that unless they get more money from the government on any occasion they require higher salaries to be paid. The cost of some of those salary claims can be met by productivity gains. I am quite satisfied about that. I am yet to speak to anyone who thinks there are no productivity gains to be made in universities. Equally, a higher income earning capacity will add to the capacity of universities to meet those claims which are justified to a certain extent. The extent to which they are justified might vary from institution to institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Equally, this government is prepared to return to universities the HECS contribution from over load students. The previous government simply said, `You have taken students over load. That is bad luck. Thanks very much. We will keep the HECS contribution.' We think that is inappropriate and we are happy to return that contribution to universi ties who take students over load. Some will be happy to do that and some will not. Where there is the capacity to take extra students without adding substantial costs, the return of that HECS contribution is again another source of revenue available to universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe we are clarifying the capacity of universities to make ancillary charges. We do not want to change that in substance. They must not be able to charge for things that one is required to do to complete a degree. There has been some messiness surrounding ancillary charges and we think they should have that flexibility. Let me put it another way. Students should be able to pay for extra things they want. We are happy to provide that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at a very substantial ask from students. We recognise that they are by far the luckier ones leaving school. Much more is given to university students than is given to students at TAFE. Much more is given to university students than is given to those people who are asked to simply go and get a job and those who are looking for jobs. It is not only in terms of cash benefits but what in the end, for the rest of their lives, these students get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will mention briefly the total load arrangements as they have been advised to me by the department. The total load reductions are in fact a plus next year across Australia of just over two and a half thousand&mdash;2,675 places&mdash;with, yes, a reduction in total load of just over 4,000 in 1998 and just over 4,000 in 1999. That is nothing like the 17,000 and the 30,000 and any number of other figures that I have heard loosely bandied about by those seeking to get a headline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the undergraduate load places, the places that are very important to this government, because we do believe there should be an increase in access to higher education&mdash;your first foot in the door&mdash;I am advised by my department that between 1996 and 1997 there will be an increase of just over 6,000 places next year. Cumulatively that increases to 10,000 in 1998 and in 13,000 in 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to some of the specific contributions made in this debate. I noticed my old colleague Senator Crowley saying, `There is no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6494"> increase in choice here. What is the increase in choice if you pay for something that in the past you did not have to pay for?' She is referring to the opportunity for Australian students to buy places. What she is forgetting to say is that all those who have to pay now will not have to pay in any up-front sense. In fact, there will be more opportunities for government funded places. These are additional opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crowley refuses to recognise that there will be students who get a government funded place, who do not get it at the university of their choice or in the course of their choice and, as a consequence, will be happy to pay extra to get the university or the course of their choice. They will move out of a government funded place to get that. What will that leave? It will leave an unfilled government funded place. If that particular university wants to sell places in that course, it will have to fill that government funded place. What will that mean? It will mean an additional spot for someone who otherwise would not have got a spot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was with some dismay that I heard Senator Crowley, who has had a longstanding interest in education, refer to the rich and thick as being the people who will get in. That is failing to recognise two things. Firstly, there will be people who have got into government funded places who will give them up, and other students will take those places. Secondly, TER scores have got very little to do with the intellectual skill required to complete a course; they have got everything to do with the number of places available and the number of people who want them. The number of people who want them is largely to do with the degree of income one can earn if one completes a particular course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a very small reduction in the TER score for law, for example, you could easily fill a further 25 per cent of places with people who got not much less in their TER score, who are clearly intellectually capable of completing the course. The opposition would have us refuse this opportunity. They would have us say, `If you want to invest in yourself, if you want to take that chance, if you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are prepared to put your money at risk: bad luck, we don't want it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From so many people opposite, I have heard the chant in the past, `Make the rich pay.' Now we want to let them pay, it seems that some people opposite are unwilling to do that. They are unwilling to let universities take money from people who are prepared to pay, to give themselves that extra chance, that extra choice. These are kids that, for some reason or another, did not do what they should have done in year 12, and did not get the appropriate TER scores. These are kids who are happy to take the chance that, perhaps with a bit more discipline and application, they could pass, and you will not let them. You want to put the be all and end all of whether you get through that gate on year 12, and you will shut others out. In doing so you will deprive universities of that income earning capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will allow universities to sell places to overseas students. You presumably recognise the enormous value to universities, both the enrichment of the undergraduate experience in having a range of cultures on the campus and in the funding that is provided to universities, but you will not allow that opportunity to Australian students. As far as you are concerned, because government funding is limited, students can be limited and there can be no other way to fund it. You will not hear of any more people getting in than the government can afford to pay. I think it is very narrow minded, with respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus queries any previous analysis of our changes vis-a-vis HECS. I simply refer him to the Wran committee's report, clearly outlining the better equity of having a differentiated HECS, of not charging a teacher the same as you charge a doctor on a per annum basis. That should be indication enough to Senator Bolkus that these matters have been considered in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few other points I would like to refer to. Senator Woodley, Senator Bolkus and others say, `This is the end of the clever country.' That is the most smug and self&hyphen; satisfied remark that I have heard from people involved in the higher education sector. It is as though, because one was born with greater <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6495"> intellectual skills, the future of the nation rests on one's shoulders and no-one else's, that somehow a clever country is associated purely with the wealth of the higher education sector, and forget everybody else. It is the most selfish and self&hyphen;indulgent claim to come from the sector, and I have heard quite a few. Without a doubt that takes the cake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A really clever country, a truly clever country, seeks to bring out the best in all its citizens&mdash;not just the brightest. It will focus on the fact that even the lowest cost degree involves something like a $20,000 contribution, which we do not give to someone who leaves year 12 and goes straight into the work force, and which we certainly do not give to someone who goes into TAFE. That contribution towards degrees goes from $20,000 up to something like $200,000. Plenty of students want to talk about equity between students, but not between TAFE and people who do not even get that opportunity. Some in the higher education sector&mdash;not most, I might add, just some&mdash;would like the notion of a clever country to rest purely on the government funding of a higher education sector, not on what happens to TAFE students or apprentices who have to pay for their tools; they are other people. In these instances, `We the few are the ones on whom the responsibility for a clever country rests.' Clearly, this government has a different view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we want universities to prosper&mdash;that is why we want to give them greater income earning opportunities; that is why we want to allow Australian students to buy places&mdash;and to increase the competition between universities. But we also recognise the enormous private benefit that goes to students through participating in a university education. We think it is reasonable to ask them to pay more on Labor's HECS system; that is, do not pay until you earn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me refer briefly to the proposed reduction of the HECS repayment point from just over $28,000 to just over $20,000. Many of you will have heard of Mr Potter, a man whom I met during the campaign, whose income is about $25,000. He has a wife and two children. The children are at school. The wife chooses to stay at home. He gets a very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> substantial proportion of that income from a punctuality bonus by virtue of being on time&mdash;or no more than two minutes late&mdash;for work every day. We did not give him a higher education at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are saying, if you are telling me that students cannot pay back until they earn $28,000 plus, is that they should not pay back until they are earning more than the Mr Potters of the world and that it is too much for students to pay any contribution back until they are earning more than 60 per cent of income earners in Australia. I personally feel that is a peculiarly selfish view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had some discussions with Senator Harradine. He has raised with me the notion of an amendment he wants to move that might provide appropriate protection for students with families. I make no bones about that being an option that is available, and one the government would seek to support if it is appropriate. I am particularly thinking of sole parents&mdash;I previously referred to them as deserted wives&mdash;who want to go back and upgrade their skills and for whom that might be difficult. But let us not pretend they are in the same category as a student who is still living at home and earning $21,000 with hardly much in the way of other expenses, and that that student cannot afford to pay back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would be happy to have a look at what Senator Harradine has to propose by way of amendment. It is probably better to deal with some of the other points that have been made as we go through the bills in the committee stage. I conclude by thanking senators for their contribution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill provides for the deregulation of fees charged by the Open Learning Agency. It provides a new definition of `basic charge'. As I understand it, according to this definition, a basic charge refers to the smaller of either the statutory amount or the fee actually set by the agency. Under the act clients will still be able to defer their payments under the open learning deferred payment scheme. However, the effect of the various amendments is to maintain the amount which the Commonwealth may lend to clients under the open learning deferred payment scheme, although fees may be set by the agency at a higher level.

<PARA>This amendment, quite rightly, condemns the government for the measures contained in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill, particularly attempts by this government to end, as we know it, a system of publicly funded and accessible higher education in this country. I say that because the measures contained in that bill introduce a system of differential HECS which will see overall HECS increases and a fundamental and drastic decrease in the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their debts, and which will also allow institutions to charge up&hyphen;front and full cost fees for certain courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of these measures, as I outlined in my speech on the second reading&mdash;comments endorsed by my colleague Senator Woodley and others in this chamber&mdash;is to lock poor kids out of higher education. Contrary to the comments the minister made in her wrap&hyphen;up of the second reading debate, I have heard nothing which proves that the measures in this bill will not serve as financial or psychological disincentives to enter into and pursue higher education in this country. I speak specifically of traditionally disadvantaged groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find the measures contained in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill regressive. They will take us back 20 years at least in higher education policy in this country. The extent and pace of the changes are unprecedented.

If it is just machinery to issue guidelines for the proportion of fee paying, as opposed to non&hyphen;fee paying, undergraduate students, then we would have a lot of questions to ask before we finally agreed to that particular amendment.

<PARA>Senators will be able to read paragraphs (3) and (4), with the latter consisting of parts (a) and (b). This is the amendment that I referred to in summing up, indicating that the government has a clear intention that it does want to ensure that the number of fee paying domestic places will not exceed 25 per cent of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6502"> domestic student load and that universities would have to fill all their government funded places first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated that that was going to be done by guidelines. Senators opposite were less than charitable about that, suggesting there was a wicked plan&mdash;that somehow, in a very short space of time, I was suddenly going to say, `Ho, ho, ho, with the approval to do this, I will change the guidelines,' and, the guidelines not being disallowable, I would yet again be painted as the wicked witch. Not just to avoid that, but as an indication simply of the government's good faith in this matter, I said at the time that if someone wanted to move an amendment to put it into the legislation, I would be happy. I did not see it being forthcoming. We are happy to move the amendment. It is just an indication of the government's bona fides that we want to limit the number of fee paying domestic places to 25 per cent of the total load. That is contained in paragraph (3). Secondly, in paragraph (4), you see the limitations. Paragraph (3) says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Guidelines issued under subsection (1) must ensure that, on an equivalent full&hyphen;time student unit basis, the number of domestic students who may be charged fees for a particular undergraduate course does not exceed 25% of the total number of places available for domestic students . . . </PARA>

<PARA>In other words, it is clearly spelt out that you have to fill your places, the guidelines have to say what the penalty is going to be and the guidelines cannot allow the sale of more than 25 per cent. That is what we are seeking to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put in legislation, what we have told you we want to do by regulation. People were unhappy with that.

<TIME.STAMP>(10.53 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the guidelines are not disallowable. I think that is the reason Senator Carr and Senator Stott Despoja were most unhappy with the 25 per cent limit being put in those guidelines. With the guidelines not being disallowable, it is not possible for the Senate to say, `You've changed your mind later and changed the percentage.' So, if the limit is put in legislation, the guidelines must comply with that limit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the very purpose of the fuss that was created by my saying that we would simply follow the previous government's&mdash;your government's&mdash;experience in setting fees for postgraduate courses. We would do it by virtue of the same sorts of guidelines, that would be the clean and neat legislative way to do it, but people on the opposite side were unhappy about that. Why? It was because the guidelines are not disallowable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are seeking now to legislate to give parliament the opportunity that it would otherwise have if the guidelines were disallowable to set the limit and to say, `You've said it's 25 per cent. If we put this in legislation, you won't be able to go higher than that unless you come back and get approval of the parliament.' I think that is perfectly appropriate. I am not unhappy with doing that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I asked that question was that you came in here and rejected that self-claimed mantle of the wicked witch by saying that parliament would have control over how this 25 per cent applies. I put it to you, Minister, that the amendment is so general there are many questions left unanswered. There are questions that will have to be decided upon in the guidelines that you issued that basically parliament may have a limited degree of authority in terms of those guide <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6503"> lines by this particular amendment, but so much of what you are going to do, so much of the implementation of the mechanisms, which we would normally expect on something as crucial as this to be in regulations, in disallowable instruments, is not going to be in disallowable instruments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will go some extent down the road in terms of this amendment. But, for instance, in developing this amendment, what consultation has there been with the tertiary education sector in terms of how your clause 2A will operate in practice? Has clause 2A been circulated? Has there been any feedback from the tertiary sector on it?</PARA></SPEECH>

<ROLE>Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.55 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That has not been done, and I do not believe it is necessary for it to be done because what we are seeking to put in legislation is perfectly clear: the 25 per cent limit. If you have a suggestion that somehow clause 2A subparagraph 3 does not provide that 25 per cent limit, we are happy to look at an amendment you might want to make to the amendment in order to put it in legislation. Equally, I say the same with respect to subparagraph 4.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons we set this limit was, I believe, that without such a limit institutions would&mdash;as I think you suggested in your speech in the second reading debate we were happy to let them do&mdash;shift the loads around so that full fee paying students would be in the most expensive courses and the government funded students would be squashed out of other courses. It is precisely because of the very sharp minds of the university sector when dollars come before them, and the focus they have on how to get those dollars, that we believe these limits need to be put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I went and asked them whether they were satisfied with this, it would not surprise me if a number of them said, `No, why don't you make it 33 per cent or 50 per cent?' They would seek a lot more flexibility because giving them that flexibility allows them to obviously get more. That is what they are primarily interested in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said in the very beginning, on 9 August, that we want Australian students to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have the opportunity to invest in themselves, to take that chance if they want, and that these conditions would be there. All you are looking at now is, if you like, a concession on our part. I think it has been properly raised that people say, `You might say that now, but you might say differently next year.' It is nothing more than an acknowledgment of the intention of the government that we seek to put those critical aspects into legislation.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight in the adjournment debate to discuss two quite disparate measures. The first is a concern raised with me by members of the Western Australian community regarding a remote Aboriginal community called Mulan in the Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a number of representations concerning a decision by ATSIC to suspend CDEP funding for at least three months from 1 January 1997 in this community of Mulan. The concern raised with me is that, via this action, the community may face collapse. CDEP funds are used to provide the essential resources and infrastructure within the community of Mulan which, as I say, is an extremely isolated Aboriginal community some hours from Halls Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern is that with the withdrawal of CDEP funds some of the essential services like power, water, sewerage and rubbish collection may break down and that no provision would exist for them to be repaired or maintained. The human consequence of such action is obvious to all. I have reports that the primary school is already being forced to help feed children at Mulan because of a mix&hyphen;up in the payment of CDEP funding in the last fortnight and that a number of families are without money that they had expected and are therefore experiencing extreme hardship.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the wet season is approaching and communities like Mulan are often cut off from other centres as the roads become flooded at this time of the year. So there are real concerns about the future of the community at Mulan and it seems that the removal of CDEP funding puts at risk the essential functioning of this community of a couple of hundred people. As I understand it, over 100 of those people are receiving CDEP funding which is essential to the maintenance of that community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure ATSIC have their reasons for taking this action and I know they have a number of serious concerns about the administration of the community. From what I have read, that community has a chequered history. I do not doubt for one moment that ATSIC have some justification for the action they are taking. I have seen the correspondence they have sent to the community which outlines their concerns. They are very serious concerns which go to questions of violence, unauthorised expenditure and the failure of some young men to work in accordance with the CDEP guidelines. So they are obviously very real problems. ATSIC have seen fit, as a result of trying to resolve these problems, or having seen these problems in their view remain unresolved, to take the action to suspend CDEP funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some concern with that action because it seems that the suspension of CDEP funding in this community does nothing to help those people. It does nothing to advance the resolution of those problems in the community. I do not pretend to be an expert on those problems. I do not doubt for one moment that they have existed for some time and that they are deep&hyphen;seated difficulties. But what does the removal of CDEP funding do to assist these people to work through those problems? Nothing. What does it do to assist the people in this community survive in their very harsh environment in some of the most difficult circumstances one can imagine?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does ATSIC's decision to suspend CDEP funding leave the community in finding the resources they need to manage their community, to administer the basic needs that I have spoken about, such as water, sewerage, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6505"> rubbish collection et cetera? Clearly, without the CDEP funds there is a real danger that the infrastructure in the community will collapse and that the community itself might collapse, resulting in severe hardship to those people living in the community. They may be forced to leave the community. Some might think that a good thing&mdash;but it clearly is not a solution to the problems of this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really have to address the needs of the young children, the old people and the others who actually live there. Those who are trying to survive and who need the support of the CDEP funding to ensure that the infrastructure and the basic services in that community are maintained. So today I wrote to ATSIC asking them to reconsider the decision to suspend the CDEP funding. I asked them to remove the suspension and allow all those of goodwill who can offer assistance to the community to try to work through what ATSIC believe are very serious problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the 1996&hyphen;96 annual report of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations provides a positive view of the progress of the Mulan Aboriginal Corporation and of achievements that the registrar was able to make during their period of involvement with the community. In fact, the major criticism in the report seems to be of the role of ATSIC within the community and in particular its relationship with the corporation. So if in 1996 we had the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations having some positive views about prospects at Mulan, the removal of CDEP funding now seems very drastic action indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sought ATSIC's cooperation in seeking to find other solutions to their concerns, to work through with the community the real problems that exist in that community rather than merely remove funding that is essential to maintaining the basic services. Services that meet the basic needs of health, housing and infrastructure that these people at Mulan require. I would hope that, with the cooperation of ATSIC, we are able to do something positive to help this community address its problems, ensure that the community development that is at the centre of the CDEP program really occurs, make this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community more self&hyphen;sufficient and improve the lifestyle for its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time left to me, I want to make a few remarks in paying tribute to David Ian Campese. David Campese is the great Australian rugby union winger who played his 101st and last test match for Australia at the Cardiff Arms Park ground in Wales last night. A Queanbeyan boy, David Campese has become a legend in the game of rugby union and, I think, in sport generally. It was fitting that he played his last test at Cardiff Arms Park, a ground I consider to be the finest rugby union ground in the world and home of the largest Welsh choir in the world. I have had the pleasure of seeing England beaten by Wales there, but was never selected to play there myself which is one of my great disappointments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the great victory over Wales, Campese played his last test, and he will be a tremendous loss to the game. Campese was a brilliant and elusive winger and full&hyphen;back, and scored 64 test tries for Australia. His goosestep has become his trademark and is known around the world. He is regarded by some of the greatest players as the greatest attacking player in rugby union history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Campese has brought great joy to spectators the world over. He has brought a great number of new converts to rugby and has helped transform the game into a much better attacking spectacle than the dour sport that I started playing as a very young man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Campese has been somewhat of a controversial figure both for his public comments and also for the fact that he took risks in playing the game&mdash;some of which, of course, did not come off. Sometimes when things did not come off, Campese received a great deal of criticism in Australia. Perhaps he did not receive as much credit as he should have for the skills and the attributes that he brought to the game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6506"> His own unique style will be remembered by all rugby union followers and lovers of sport generally&mdash;even though at times we had our hearts in our mouths. David Campese has been a great credit to the game and to Australian rugby. I think it is a sign of his stand ing in the game that an old forward like me can speak so well of a winger.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with those remarks about David Campese. I watched him this morning live at half past one and enjoyed every moment of the game, especially since the Wallabies did win.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I will be reflecting on an often elusive concept in politics, and that is on truth. Prime Minister Paul Keating's highly publicised promise not to raise taxes as l-a-w law generated enormous public criticism. Despite public debate and the use of Keating's broken promises in the Howard government's election campaign, no attempt has been made by this government to establish legislation which prohibits false, untrue or misleading government advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">WA state and Commonwealth legislation should parallel South Australian legislation, which has prohibited misleading political advertising since 1985. Paul Keating's government failed to pass similar legislation introduced by the Democrats in the Senate. Now John Howard is the beneficiary of that failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, the Senate passed amendments proposed by the Democrats, which were based on the South Australian legislation, in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995. This legislation was to contribute to better standards. However, the amendments were not accepted by the then ALP government in the House of Representatives and consequently were defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia is the only state where legislation requiring truth in political advertising is in place. Misleading political advertising has been prohibited in the Electoral Act since 1985. This legislation has been tested in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia, where it was held to be constitutionally valid and, further, that it did not impede the implied freedom of speech right in the Commonwealth constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no good reason for governments to drag their feet on this issue. The legislation in South Australia is effective and has been held <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not to impede freedom of speech. There are however, a number of good reasons for governments to take action and implement similar legislation in the Commonwealth and states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A politician's reputation is one of those reasons. Public opinion of politicians in Australia places them well below other professions&mdash;including lawyers&mdash;but just above used-car sales representatives. This is indicative of the mistrust that the electorate holds for politicians and their general reputation as dishonest and unaccountable. That is not a reputation that any of us in this chamber enjoys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in our interests then to implement legislation which would not only serve to raise the debate among politicians at election time but which would improve the reputation of politicians. We need to pass legislation which will serve as a strong reminder to all politicians that false, untrue or misleading campaign advertising is not only unacceptable but would be illegal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is particularly relevant in my home state of Western Australian at this time. As you will be aware, the state election is set for 14 December. Government advertising and election promises have been flooding the media and the electorate is being pressured to make their choice. The electorate's choice between candidates, however, is hollow, unless it is based on adequate, accurate information. If the electorate is to rely on the politician's word, that word must be a representation of the truth and the politician must be held accountable if it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Truth in political advertising has not been part of the grab bag of promises that Richard Court and his people&mdash;or Dr Gallop and his people&mdash;have been on about at this election. While many welcome the fact that the Court government have opened their books&mdash;and I welcome that fact&mdash;we must ask why they have not passed truth in advertising legislation and why they have not established a complementary charter of political honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Premier Richard Court has had nearly four years to amend state legislation which the previous ALP government passed but did not proclaim and which was designed to regulate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6507"> government advertising. The electorate must question why Mr Court went to the trouble to amend and proclaim other sections of that same act at the exclusion of sections on the issue of government advertising and government travel allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments must follow the South Australian example and legislate for truth in political advertising. False, untrue and misleading electoral advertising must be made illegal. In this way, politicians may be held accountable for election promises designed to win over the electorate and which they know they cannot keep and will not keep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The passing of legislation similar to that in South Australia would advance political standards, ensure accountability and promote fairness. If Mr Court and other politicians want to be taken seriously by the electorate, truth in government advertising legislation and other accountability measures must be implemented.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

In his election campaign, he reached out to the small business community. They responded by getting behind the campaign and by actively campaigning and soliciting votes for the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Last week, Mr Howard made a submission to the ACCC honouring an election promise to give newsagents an exemption that would allow them to continue their zonal territory. In his submission, Mr Howard pointed out the significant public benefit that newsagents provide to the community. That was another promise honoured; another promise to the electorate that he has delivered on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I believe a government has the right to go to the community, to make election promises and, if it is elected, to honour the promises it made to the community. Today I am concerned because Professor Fels, the Chairman of the ACCC, has pointed out that even if the ACCC were to honour Mr Howard's commit ment to newsagents and give the exemption Mr Howard has asked for&mdash;I point out that Mr Howard is a very popularly elected Prime Minister with a huge mandate and an overwhelming number of seats to his advantage&mdash;he would have to take note of the Competition Tribunal. On the Competition Tribunal there is Mr Justice John Lockhart, Dr Barry Aldrich and Dr Maureen Brunt who in the early 1990s refused to back a Trade Practices Commission plan to authorise newsagents' home delivery monopolies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to the Senate, and to the Competition Tribunal, that, while they may have the power to technically override the Prime Minister, it would be a very dangerous thing to do. I believe the Senate would back up the notion that an elected government should have the right to deliver on its election commitments.  This government has gone to the electorate with a mandate for small business. Last week the Prime Minister sent his submission to the ACCC only for Professor Fels to say, `Even if the ACCC were to give you that exemption, then you would have to run the gauntlet of the Competition Tribunal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The purpose for my rising to speak on this matter is to urge all those concerned in the ACCC, the NCC and the Competition Tribunal to stand aside and to allow an elected government and Prime Minister&mdash;elected with an overwhelming majority of seats&mdash;to deliver their mandate to the people. If they do take an opposite view to that, they will be running in the dead opposite direction to what the Prime Minister has offered small business.</PARA>

I hope as this matter unfolds that these particular members of unelected bodies will take notice of what the Prime Minister has offered the small business community and say, `That is the wish and the will of the people who elected John Howard, and we take note of that.'</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
