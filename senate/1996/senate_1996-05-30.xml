<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Name of proposed Bill: Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Purpose of the proposed Bill: The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996 will, make consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to allow the payment of a proportion of the Medicare levy by members of the Defence Force, and certain relatives and associates of members of the Defence Force. The amendments are related to the measures introduced in the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons for urgency: These measures apply from 1 July 1996, and are related to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996, for which introduction and passage is also being sought in these sittings, because it will make it possible for amendments to the regulations governing tax instalment deductions to be made before that date. The amended regulations will increase the rate of tax instalment deductions to take account of the increased levy, both for ordinary levy payers and for Defence Force personnel. In addition, passage by 1 July 1996 will give the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) greater certainty, which will facilitate the implementation of the increased rates before the beginning of the new financial year.</PARA>

I wish to place on record my gratitude to Deputy Clerk Peter O'Keeffe for his patience and effective assistance throughout that time. The bill has been acknowledged as being comprehensive and well balanced between the competing demands of what our community will accept at this stage and the essential justice of the principle that all citizens should be treated as equal before the law.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AIRPORTS BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government's Approach to Airports</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that airports are vitally important to the communities and regions which they serve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In circumstances where airport usage is increasing rapidly, passenger and freight users need airports which are operating efficiently, are responsive to user requirements and which deliver the services necessary to meet the requirements of the Australian tourism, export and service industries which depend on air transport to compete in world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, airports can generate substantial adverse impacts, particularly for the communities located in the immediate vicinity of airports. The Government is acutely aware of the aircraft noise issues related to Sydney and Sydney West in particular. Our election commitments therefore included that: <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Sydney and Sydney West would be withdrawn from the airport leasing process until there is a solution to the aircraft noise issues there</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the east west runway would be opened</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a full EIS would be undertaken on Sydney West Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have already taken decisive steps to deal with these issues, and processes are underway to ensure permanent solutions to aircraft noise issues in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence this bill and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 provide the legislative framework for granting of leases to airport specific companies and the transfer of assets and obligations associated with those airport operations from the Federal Airports Corporation to the companies. They restart a process which stopped under the previous Government's heavy-handed approach to Sydney Airport and its role in the sales process. We have excised Sydney and Sydney West from the first tranche of sales. The process can thus recommence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills before the House substantially match those previously put forward by the Labor Party. The sales process demands continuity, if it is to proceed quickly. Given the familiarity of the House with the basic provisions of the regime previously proposed, I will run through the essential provisions and then concentrate on the improvements we have made. These improvements meet our election commitments which reflect the interests of airport users; the interests of local communities; and the interests of bidders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Airports Policy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decision to establish long-term leasehold arrangements at Federal airports will improve the efficiency of airport investment and operations in the interests of users and the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leasing of the airports will facilitate innovative management and greater local involvement and input to decisions on their operation and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airports deliver highly specialised services to the Australian economy. There will be opportunities for greater autonomy of individual airports post leasing and for airports to cater better for the particular markets which they serve and therefore to meet the needs of local and regional economies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aviation Regulatory Arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leasing of airports does not change the regulatory arrangements in other areas of the Government's aviation policy nor the fundamental roles played by the individual agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will continue to have primary responsibility for air safety in Australia. Airservices Australia will continue to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1384"> provide facilities and services required for the operation of the national airways system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulatory provisions authorise the establishment and monitoring of quality of service performance indicators and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission scrutiny to back up these aspects of the business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the advent of leasing, the Government is also aware that significant market power will move from the public sector to the private sector. The Government is thus committed to putting into place an appropriate regulatory framework to protect the interests of current and future airport users and local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the Federal Airports Corporation operates as a self-regulating Government authority in respect of land use, planning and building and on-airport pollution control. Post leasing, these responsibilities will need to be assumed by the Government itself to ensure appropriate public interest regulation of the activities of airport lessees and other users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as providing a regulatory regime which can replace those regulatory functions currently performed by the FAC, the Airports Bill establishes appropriate transparency and reporting obligations on airport operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary the provisions ensure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-majority Australian ownership</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-a 5% limit on airline (and associate) ownership</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-environment strategy requirements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-financial transparency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions apply to `core regulated airports' and other airports specified in the regulations. Core regulated airports are: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Darwin, Hobart, Launceston, Townsville, Coolangatta, Canberra, Alice Springs and Sydney West.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also provisions relating to demand management, protection of airspace around airports and other on-airport activities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill establishes several key rules for the leasing of Australia's major international and interstate gateways including:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the terms of the initial leases are to be 50 years, with or without an option for renewal for a further 49 years</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> only one company will be able to lease an airport. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will make it mandatory for joint ownership by the same airport-operator company of Sydney and Sydney West airports. The bill allows for Sydney and Sydney West to be structured as separate companies and leased together. Other airports will be leased separately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current leasing arrangements for airlines and other on-airport businesses will be transferred with existing obligations and benefits, in accordance with normal practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Restrictions on ownership of airport-operator companies </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be ensuring that airport-operator companies are majority Australian owned with central management to be exercised from within Australia and a majority of directors being either Australian citizens and/or residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The airport-operator company will be subject to the following ownership controls:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a 49% limit on foreign ownership of the airport-operator company</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a 5% limit on airline (and associates) ownership of the airport-operator company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes significant anti-avoidance provisions to cover schemes to circumvent the leasing, management and ownership rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government, in recognition of the excision of Sydney/Sydney West airports from the first set of sales, has not set down cross ownership provisions in the bill. Such restrictions could reduce the number of potential bidders for the first tranche airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Land use, planning and building controls </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There needs to be clarity and certainty on processes which allow Government and community input; and a greater compatibility between on and off airport development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly each regulated airport operator will be required to establish:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an airport master plan&mdash;essentially a long term land use plan to cover a 20 year period</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> major development plans for projects (eg runway, terminal development) at airports which can, where significant environmental impacts result, require appropriate environmental impact assessment processes as is currently the case and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Master and major development plans, and environment strategies will be subject to Ministerial approval.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of airport regulatory arrangements post leasing supplements the operation of existing legislation and regulations which cover the curfew, runway operations, flight path and noise acquisition/insulation programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important requirement imposed on airport operators will be the need to develop and implement approved environment strategies. These strategies will include specific measures which the airport lessee proposes to adopt to prevent, control or reduce environmental impacts associated with airport operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing such strategies, operators must have due regard to public comment requirements and report on consultations held with State and local Governments, airport users and others. Environmental strategies proposed by airport operators will be subject to Ministerial approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also provide the ability to make regulations on environmental standards and impose requirements to be complied with, in relation to the prevention or minimisation of pollution at airport sites. Significant penalties will apply to breaches of these standards backed by the ability for court injunctions if necessary to ensure regulatory compliance.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions have been included in the bill on access for new entrants which will trigger the access provisions of the national competition policy reforms.

It is the Government's intention to maximise the opportunity for commercial negotiation to solve access issues, but the ACCC may take an arbitration role if negotiation is unsuccessful. This approach will apply at the core regulated airports ie the major twelve FAC airports.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports Bill 1996 will form the central part of the regulatory oversight of the operations at Australia's major airports post leasing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The leasing of airports represents an important part of the Government's transport reform program. The Government's Airports Bill 1996 and companion Airports Transitional Bill 1996 will allow the leasing to proceed swiftly and with strong protection of the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's airport reforms will provide a significant boost to employment and investment in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AIRPORTS (TRANSITIONAL) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of long&hyphen;term leases over airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) forms an important part of this government's privatisation program. The government is confident that the leasing process for the Federal airports offers a number of long&hyphen;term benefits to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to sell long&hyphen;term leases offers benefits to airport users and the community as a whole. The leasing process should lead to further improvements in the operating efficiency and quality of service of the airports by exposing them to private sector disciplines. It will also provide an opportunity for the funds of Australians to be productively employed in the provision of national infrastructure through the involvement of superannuation and investment managers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of airport infrastructure has traditionally been considered the responsibility of government due to the large amount of capital required. However today, Australia's capital markets have reached a level of maturity and sophistication capable of supporting the evolving infrastructure requirements of airports. The commonwealth's involvement in the provision of such infrastructure will no longer be necessary given the protection to public interest considerations afforded by the proposed regulatory regime of the Airports Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of this bill is to put into place a framework to facilitate leasing of all Federal airports effectively as ongoing businesses under a two stage sales process. It is proposed that Mel <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1387"> bourne, Brisbane and Perth airports will be included in the first phase leasehold sales. Adelaide will also be added to the first tranche consistent with our election commitment, subject to decisions to be taken in the budget. The leasing of Sydney and Sydney&hyphen;West airports will be deferred pending resolution of noise issues at Sydney airport and an environmental impact study being conducted on Sydney&hyphen;West Airport. In the meantime, consideration will be given to how best to position Sydney and Sydney&hyphen;West airports for future sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the transfer of airport land and other assets from the FAC to the commonwealth; the granting of leases over the airports and transfer of associated assets to individual airport companies; and the orderly treatment of the FAC's debts during the sales process. Provision has also been made in the bill for the transfer of airport staff employed by the FAC to the airport companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The companion bill, the Airports Bill 1996, will establish the regulatory regime for airports post&hyphen;leasing. This regulatory regime is designed to improve the efficiency of airport operations while ensuring the protection of airport user and community interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leasing the airports permits the government to retain some control over the land on which the airports are located. The long term of the lease will ensure that sales proceeds are similar to sale under freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of long term leases is expected to produce a significant net offset to outlays in the forthcoming financial years. Provision has been made in the bill to allow for the orderly disposal of the FAC's assets and facilitate and account for the leasing process. The transactions associated with these provisions are expected to be budget neutral. As Honourable Members would appreciate, it would not be appropriate for the government to disclose details of expected proceeds from the leasing of the airports, as it is likely this would influence the outcome of the sale process, possibly reducing proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have indicated, a number of measures designed to facilitate the leasing of the Federal airports are contained in the bill now before the House. These measures provide for the land and associated assets of the FAC to be transferred to the commonwealth, as well as provide for the commonwealth to grant a lease over land at a particular airport to a company referred to as an airport lessee company. Following this, the bill provides the government with a flexible disposal strategy to grant an airport lease to a company either established by the commonwealth or the purchaser. In both instances when the lease is granted, the FAC's contractual rights, obligations and liabilities are transferred to the airport lessee company.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for airport staff to transfer to the airport lessee companies at the time a lease is granted over the relevant airport. The bill also contains provisions to enable transfer of accrued benefits and leave entitlements post sale. These provisions are designed to ensure fair and consistent treatment of staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that state and territory governments receive duties to which they are entitled on sale transactions which take place in their state or territory, the sale of shares in airport lessee companies or the sale of leases over the airports will be subject to state and territory taxes and stamp duties. The bill does, however, provide for the transfer of the lease or assets that take place while the airport lessee company is owned by the commonwealth to be exempt from stamp duty. This exemption does not cover the sale by the commonwealth of its shares in the company, nor the transfer of the lease or assets to a company where that transfer takes place after sale time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of taxation provisions have been provided for in the bill to ensure that both the purchasers and existing lessees of the FAC are not disadvantaged from a taxation perspective. The government has adopted these provisions in respect of transactions between the FAC, the commonwealth and the airport lessee company, to ensure that the tax effect of the transactions would be the same as if it were a sale by the FAC in the private market place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions have also been made in the bill to deal with the FAC's debt, which comprises both commonwealth and non&hyphen;commonwealth debt. These provisions, along with the existing provisions in the FAC's statute, provide the government flexibility to deal with the FAC's debts in the most appropriate manner. In managing the FAC's debt during the sale process, the government can assure the Honourable Members that the FAC bondholder's interests will be taken into account. The bill also provides for the treatment of the debt during the sale process to be properly recorded in the commonwealth's accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the leasing of the major Federal airports, the FAC Head Office will continue to have a role in overseeing the management of the remaining Federal airports prior to their leasing in the second phase of the sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These second phase airports present specific regional and administrative issues which will need to be addressed prior to their lease. Among these are the joint user airports at Canberra, Darwin and Townsville which are jointly operated by the FAC and the Department of Defence. The development of new operating arrangements with Defence will be required before the civil facilities at these airports can be leased. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1388"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that a number of the second phase airports which have been unprofitable in the past, should prove commercially viable under private ownership through cost reductions and improved revenues. The government will examine options to secure the future of the remaining few airports that may prove to be commercially non&hyphen;viable by taking into account the specific financial characteristics of each airport, as well as regional interests and concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is intended to provide a framework for the sale of leases over the airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation. This bill and the companion Airports Bill 1996 are designed to promote the most efficient operation and maintenance of Australia's airport infrastructure, while ensuring that the benefits of increased efficiency are passed on to airport users and the community as a whole. The government is confident that these arrangements will ensure a fair return from the airports while allowing it to divest itself of a function in which its involvement is no longer essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned until the first day of sitting in the Spring sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the order of the Senate of 29 November 1994, relating to the consideration of legislation, not apply to the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996 repeals the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995, with effect from 1 July 1996 and amends the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1995 to bring forward the existing sunset provision from 30 June 1997 to 30 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is essential that this bill be considered in the winter parliamentary sittings to ensure that there is no undue delay in implementation of the government's maritime program, which is not only a vital part of the transport reform required to sustain and improve Australia's economic growth but also will make an important contribution to the government's budget strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international shipping grants act provides for a taxable grant to eligible employers who employ Australian resident seafarers on Australian operated ships predominantly engaged in international trading. The grant is equal to the notional income tax payable on the earnings of seafarers serving on the ship. This scheme, which came into effect from 1 July 1995 but with grant entitlements not being paid until after 1 July 1996, was part of the previous government's shipping program announced in the 1995 budget. The program included a package of promised employment reforms agreed between shipowners and the maritime unions in the maritime industry restructuring agreement, or MIRA, aimed at yielding savings to shipowners in the same order as the subsidy from the international shipping grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industrial reforms have not been delivered. In fact, in important areas such as the crew to berth ratio and the implementation of an industrial peace accord, performance has deteriorated. The scheme has become a windfall gain for shipowners operating internationally trading ships while maritime unions have continued to spin out negotiations on the promised MIRA reforms. While the grant is in place, there is no pressure on either party to tackle the fundamental issues involved in reducing Australia's crewing costs, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1389"> remain among the highest in the world and a major impediment to international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is seeking to halt the outflow of taxpayers' money as soon as practicable. The bill will repeal the scheme with effect from 1 July 1996, as promised in the coalition's election commitments. It is crucial that this legislation is considered in the winter sittings to give effect to this commitment and achieve the significant savings to revenue of some $40 million over the five years to 30 June 2000. It should be noted that an employer who qualifies for the grant during the period up to 30 June 1996 will be able to claim the grant entitlements and be paid after 1 July 1996, as contemplated in the original act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ships capital grants scheme was introduced in 1987 as an incentive for the shipping industry to reduce crewing levels by providing a taxable grant of seven per cent of the purchase price of a new ship which is crewed by Australian resident seafarers at specified benchmark crewing levels. Separate but related legislation&mdash;section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act&mdash;also provides for a generous accelerated tax depreciation regime that allows a ship to be effectively written off within four years of delivery, compared to the asset's useful life being typically in the range of 15 to over 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ships capital grants scheme was originally given a five&hyphen;year life with a sunset date of 30 June 1992. This was considered more than adequate time to achieve the targeted upgrading of the trading fleet and reduce crewing levels to make Australian shipping internationally competitive. However, in 1989 the then Labor government decided to extend the act's life by a further five years until 30 June 1997, without imposing any further efficiency requirements on the industry. The coalition strongly opposed this extension as the scheme was no longer providing a taxpayer contribution to promote modernisation and re&hyphen;crewing of the Australian trading fleet but had become an ongoing capital subsidy to the shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of reform have largely been siphoned off into substantial pay rises to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members of the maritime unions, who already receive generous pay and exceptional leave conditions by Australian community standards and far beyond those of our international competitors.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the government seeks to turn off the tap of taxpayers' funds to the capital grants which have not led to the promised expansion in the Australian trading fleet. A large part of this subsidy has gone into the coffers of major, highly profitable, vertically integrated companies carrying their own cargoes. It is vital that this legislation proceed in the winter sittings in line with the coalition's election commitments to scrap the capital grants scheme by 30 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two, or possibly three, ships currently under construction overseas which will not be delivered in time to gain an entitlement to a grant prior to the new sunset date of 30 June 1996. The companies involved should have been aware of the coalition's longstanding opposition to the continuation of the capital grants scheme and, like any other business making such long&hyphen;term investment decisions, would have recognised the reality of a continually changing regulatory and economic climate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in an amendment the government will be introducing to section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, these companies will be able to qualify for the accelerated depreciation tax concessions provided the ships are delivered and registered in Australia before 1 July 1997 and so long as they continue to comply with the criteria set out in the Ships (Capital Grants) Act. This benefit is worth more than twice as much as the capital grant to a taxpaying company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A delay to this legislation will severely set back the government's maritime program, an integral part of our transport reforms, and simply add to the drain on taxpayers' money to the tune of $52 million over the next four years without any tangible improvement in the performance and competitiveness of the Australian shipping industry. Any attempt by the Senate not to consider this legislation in the current sittings will increase the hole in the budget left to this government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition strongly opposes the obnoxious action that the government is taking in respect of this matter in attempting to exempt this legislation from the cut&hyphen;off. The bottom line of our objections to it can be summed up, as far as I am concerned, in two words&mdash;Mackay Sugar. If any senator wants to understand that a little more fully, I would refer them to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of the Senate committee which is considering this issue at the moment, the reports from which, including a minority report, will be tabled, as I understand it, in the Senate this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Senator Tambling), I was fascinated to hear, said two things that I want to address. The first was that the repeal of the ships grants scheme would be, to quote him, as promised in the election commitments of the now government prior to the last election. This was an issue canvassed at length in evidence given before the Senate committee. The government comprehensively failed to make its case on this issue. I think I described it in terms of bush lawyer tactics, which I think was a pretty fair description.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three companies that are involved in what we believe to be, in clear terms, detriment under the retrospective, as we would term it, action that is going to be taken by the government in this matter&mdash;Shell, BHP and, as I have mentioned, Mackay Sugar. While the detriment to these companies is fundamentally the same, as shadow minister for primary industries I make no bones about the fact that my principal concern is with the wholly Australian company, Mackay Sugar, and the extraordinarily commendable initiatives they took in commissioning the ship in regard to which, if this goes ahead today, they will be cheated of the grant which they not unreasonably assumed would be theirs. Even if the cut&hyphen;off had not applied, it would have been theirs if it had not been for a fire that occurred and which delayed the delivery of their vessel, evidence on which was also given to the committee.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attitude of the government to this for Mackay Sugar was, `Bad luck. You only get this grant when the ship's delivered. The ship hasn't been delivered&mdash;tough.' Evidence was given at the time that the committee had its hearings by the current chief political apparatchik of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), John Wallis. I have some regard for Mr Wallis and his ability, but we were faced with the very interesting performance of seeing Mr Wallis appear at a Senate committee, sitting at the parliamentary secretary's left hand, and not only handing him notes and giving him advice on how to answer questions, but directly answering questions himself.</PARA>

I thought I spoke on behalf of all senators, including those from the government, in issuing that invitation to the House of Representatives minister to so appear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving that aside, Mr Wallis then attempted by omission to mislead the committee. We now know from a letter that we have received from the minister that he did attempt by omission to mislead the committee&mdash;and that has now been corrected&mdash;on this crucial issue affecting Mackay Sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tambling has repeated the nonsense in here this morning by saying that no&hyphen;one should complain about the ships' grants being cut off and these three companies being <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1391"> cheated of their entitlement under the grants scheme&mdash;and, I might add, in the case of Mackay Sugar, only because of a fire that occurred which caused the late delivery of the vessel.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And I am saying it again, Senator&mdash;and it is not a matter for trite observations. It is a matter of great concern to this Australian company. I say again, the company, in fact, deserves to be applauded for what they did, because they commissioned a ship unique in the world in order to provide Australia with a great plus for value adding an export product. This ship is an extraordinary vessel and it is entirely due to the initiatives of this Australian company that we have it. The value adding process can take place on the vessel and refined sugar can be delivered in either bulk or bag. Evidence, which was not questioned or rebutted, was given to the committee that the value adding advantage to Australia from this unique vessel&mdash;one of, I hope, a number that we will have in Australia&mdash;was in the order of $2 million of additional income for our country per shipment of sugar on board this vessel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, in that advantage of a $2 million plus boost for Australian workers and Australian processing from refining the sugar here and delivering it overseas in that refined form, the company deserves commendation, not having the government thumb its nose at them and saying, `Bad luck. Now you see it, now you don't. Yes, you commissioned this ship on the basis you'd get the money. Yes, you signed contracts on the understanding you'd get it. Yes, you knew that an incoming coalition would repeal the scheme.' Evidence, of course, was given from Shell, BHP and Mackay Sugar that they expected this would occur at the expiration of the scheme, which is next year, 1997, and that they had no understanding given to them by the government&mdash;none&mdash;that grants for the ships that were already commissioned on the basis of getting these grants delivered would be cut off. In fact, each company gave the committee evidence that they had factored the grants into <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their considerations of commissioning these vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government&mdash;and it has been repeated here again this morning&mdash;attempted to throw a bit of dust in the eyes on this issue and say that Mr Wallis specifically said, `I told the Australian Shippers Association, the ASA, and Lachlan Payne, its executive director, that this was all going to happen.' I do not know whether I said this at a Senate committee, but one thing I learned&mdash;and I learned a few things, actually, in the time I was transport minister&mdash;about the maritime industry was that if you are going to contest a sequence of events with anyone from the maritime industry, you had better be awfully sure that you keep very good notes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never seen notes in my life like the notes kept by representatives of the maritime industry about meetings and things that are said. I was told by an adviser I had at the time, one Jane Harmsworth&mdash;this was an adviser, I might add, for whom I have the highest esteem&mdash;that this was due to the log&hyphen;keeping responsibilities of people on ships. In respect of people, for example, like Bill Bolitho, if you sneezed, blew your nose or left the room to go to the toilet, all of this was religiously recorded in the notes that he kept of the meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were not surprised, therefore, when Lachlan Payne responded to these assertions by Mr Wallis about what was or was not told to the Australian shipping industry about these grants being cut off. What he delivered to the committee was fascinating, because he actually delivered advice by facsimile to his members. He was criticised by Mr Wallis, the minister's adviser, for being derelict in his duty in not letting Mackay Sugar, Shell and BHP know that they were going to be cut off. And that evidence was given to us, but a fascinating piece of advice was sent out on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One paragraph of that advice contained a direct reference to the retrospective application of these measures. This was a record of a conversation which Lachlan Payne, the ASA, had had with the then shadow minister's senior adviser on this issue and was circulated to their members. One paragraph of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1392"> that advice said that the government recognised that there was going to be a problem in the retrospective application of this measure and that they were therefore seeking further advice on the issue. The not unreasonable assumption was that this advice, when it was available, would be made available to the shippers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASA said to the minister's adviser, `Here's what we're going to tell our members.' It was read out over the telephone. A record was kept of the conversation. `If we don't hear from you in 24 hours, we'll assume that you've got no problem with the advice and we'll send it out.' Nothing further was heard and the advice was sent out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say to his credit, the chair of the committee, Senator Crane, did not question the necessary delay that we had to have in order to check this advice from the ASA. The result was we got a letter from the minister confirming the accuracy of the ASA's advice to its members and advising the committee of the results of the inquiries that had been made about the problems that would be caused by the retrospective application of this legislation&mdash;but no advice whatsoever that this had ever been then communicated to the Australian Shippers Association.</PARA>

I will not dwell on the point in any case, except to conclude by saying that I am satisfied, and the opposition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is certainly satisfied, that the evidence given by the minister's representative to that committee in public hearing is not correct. The picture was painted of a number of companies that, at the time they commissioned the vessels, should have fully expected not to have relied upon this grant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must make this point&mdash;it is a point I have made publicly before, and I made it in a committee this morning. I do not care whether it is the shipping industry, the mining industry, the dairy industry or any other industry: one of the things that gets up my nose is hearing politicians, political appointees or whatever, in Senate committees or anywhere else, telling business people who do this for a living what their business should be and, in fact, saying in evidence to a Senate committee in public hearing that, if they had known what they were doing, they should have been `prudent enough' to have factored into their considerations the fact that this grants scheme might be cut off before they got the ships delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that there was a strong reaction to this gratuitous advice from the minister's adviser to Mackay Sugar, BHP and Shell&mdash;and I support the reaction that was given. I will not canvass, this morning, the broader concerns that the opposition have with this bill&mdash;and they are far broader. We are concerned on environmental grounds, we are concerned on strategic grounds; that is, the strategic value of having an Australian fleet which, of course, as evidence which was given to the committee indicated, actively cooperates with the Australian Navy to the point of putting equipment on board some vessels specifically for the use of the Australian Navy in an emergency. I will not canvass any of those issues, because they are properly issues for a later debate on the bill proper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am simply addressing, this morning, the reason why we are opposing exemption for this legislation from the cut-off. As I have said before&mdash;and I make no bones about it: Mackay Sugar is the principal reason. Hopefully that company will be able to take delivery of its ship shortly, despite the fire that occurred to delay it during its construction. In fact, advice was given to the committee that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1393"> it hopes to take delivery of the ship in July, and perhaps even sooner than that. Mackay Sugar is entitled to receive, under this act, the assistance which it factored into its considerations when commissioning this vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add, just as a matter of record, the ships grants scheme, which we introduced, was a coalition initiative. It was the former coalition minister for transport, Ralph Hunt, who devised this scheme. That, of course, is why, when the legislation was brought into the parliament, the coalition so strongly supported it. I would have thought that, in terms of providing some fruit and some tangible evidence that there is a value attached to the scheme, this unique vessel chartered by Mackay Sugar has demonstrated just precisely that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not, again, canvass the PAYE issues that Senator Tambling has raised here this morning. I will do that, again, in the appropriate debate on the committee's report when that is tabled before the Senate. But I will simply conclude by saying that the opposition believes that the action the government is taking against Australian companies in this regard is iniquitous and it should be opposed strongly. I make no bones about saying this: I hope, should this motion succeed and should this exemption be thwarted, that Mackay Sugar will be able to safely secure its vessel in the meantime and qualify for the grant it is entitled to get.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mackay Refined Sugars is the only fully integrated sugar refinery in Australia at the present time. Fifty per cent of the company consists of the Mackay Sugar Cooperative Association Ltd, and that represents 1,100 canegrowers in the Mackay district of North Queensland. The cooperative is a 50 per cent partner in Mackay Refined Sugars. Its shareholders grow the cane. It is milled in Mackay and North Queensland. The raw sugar is produced there and, uniquely in Australia, the raw sugar is then refined on site in Mackay. It is a great industry for Mackay and provides jobs and wealth to the North Queensland region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mackay Refined Sugars then markets the sugar to the domestic and exports markets in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bulk. That is, it ships it out of Mackay in food grade quality in a ship that is purpose built, involving innovative technology in bulk&hyphen;in bulk&hyphen;out, or bulk&hyphen;in bag&hyphen;out. The joint venture Mackay Refined Sugars constructed that state of the art refinery in Mackay, building it adjacent to one of the mills. It was built, as I say, for the express purpose of value adding to the raw sugar that is produced. To distribute the finished refined product domestically to the main bulk refined sugar receiving facility in Sydney, it had to get a special ship, and Mackay Refined Sugars some years ago instructed that this quite unique ship be built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to go into the arguments, the place for which is really consideration of the bill or perhaps even the committee report that Senator Bob Collins has mentioned. But I do have a concern that the uncertainty over this matter be addressed at the very earliest possible time. If the grant to Mackay Refined Sugars, which it tells the committee is in the order of $5 million, is not paid, it means that it will cost each and every canegrower in the Mackay region&mdash;the shareholders of the cooperative who have a 50 per cent share in the refinery&mdash;something in the order of $2,500. Apart from all the other arguments, that is an amount which I would be most reluctant to see sugar growers in Mackay miss out on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is the element of retrospectivity in this grant. I understand the argument put forward to the committee by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Senator Tambling). His argument was that it is a grant and you only get the grant when the ship is finished; therefore, it is not retrospective. Perhaps technically he is right, but in practical commercial terms it is a retrospective taking away of a grant, the paying of which was a major factor in the commercial decision made by Mackay Refined Sugars to instruct this ship to be built several years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is some doubt about whether Mackay Refined Sugars will be able to have the ship registered in a way sufficient to enable it to access this grant by 30 June. The reason for that was, as has been mentioned <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1394"> previously, that a fire occurred in the shipyard in Amsterdam, in Holland, earlier this year and that delayed the completion of the ship. The ship was intended to be delivered by this time&mdash;it was intended to be navigating the Queensland coast at this very moment&mdash;but by an act of God, over which Mackay Refined Sugars had absolutely no control, that did not happen. So it is a rather difficult set of circumstances that Mackay Refined Sugars see themselves in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the company is looking at trying to get the ship registered in a state that will enable it to qualify for this grant by 30 June. Hopefully, that will happen in any case. I sincerely hope that it does happen so that the company can get its grant without having this uncertainty. It may well mean that, to do that, Mackay Refined Sugars will have to take delivery of a ship while it is still in the construction stage&mdash;while it is still in the shipyard&mdash;and before any of the sea trials are conducted. Whilst that is obviously a matter for Mackay Refined Sugars and for their commercial decision and judgment, it would seem unfortunate if in order to get this grant they were forced to accept a ship still in the shipyards and without having any trials conducted. That is of some concern to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I have some very grave concerns with the legislation, as other senators also have, and I think that concern should be addressed and dealt with at the very earliest time. I support my colleague Senator Tambling in his motion to exempt the shipping grants bill from the cut&hyphen;off, because I think the bill should be dealt with today, or tomorrow, so that all of the parties involved in the particular issue can have the matter resolved. As I understand it, from what I have picked up around the traps, all of the opposition parties&mdash;that is,  Labor, Democrats and Greens, the combined opposition&mdash;are going to oppose it. The bill, as I read it, is unlikely to succeed in any case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That being the case, why do we not deal with the bill now and get the matter resolved so that the uncertainty is taken away? That is why I think the bill should be dealt with at this very moment. I would hope that one of the opposition parties would move an amendment to address the problems that Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bob Collins said he was concerned about. Perhaps then Mackay Refined Sugars could go to bed tonight, or tomorrow night, quite happy and relaxed knowing that the bill has been dealt with in an appropriate way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support Senator Tambling's motion to have the matter dealt with at the earliest possible time. I would like to think that, whatever happens, Mackay Refined Sugars may qualify and may get themselves within the definitions or within the jurisdiction of the act to enable the grant to be paid regardless of what happens. In any case, the uncertainty should be taken away by the matter being dealt with at the earliest possible time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I refute Senator Collins's comments about my colleague the parliamentary secretary, Senator Tambling. Senator Tambling, in this matter, as in every other matter, has dealt with the issue in the most professional and competent way. Senator Tambling is certainly one of our very best&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The cut off-motion which the Senate has agreed to basically says that there are reasons for which the Senate can be asked to exempt from the cut-off motion. Those reasons include that the bill has been presented before, that the bill is urgent or that the bill is a budget bill. I have heard nothing today which indicates that any of those conditions apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it urgent to retrospectively cut off a grant that companies assume they were going to get? Is it urgent to be retrospective? No. The arguments that have been given in the past in relation to retrospectivity that seem to have some credence have been where there has been an unintended consequence of a bill that is going to cost a leakage of revenue&mdash;because it was unintended it was never the intention of the bill. That is not the case here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it urgent to present retrospectivity on PAYE? No. If you are saying you have to put it in this tax year, basically you are saying that all of those companies who have worked on the assumption that they could employ Australian seafarers on overseas shipping routes will have a retrospective tax burden on them. If you say you have to put in this year that means that that expectation during the year has been betrayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on the basis of the cut-off motion and on the basis that there are reasons by which a government can argue to the Senate that the cut-off motion should be exempted for a bill there has been no substantiation. I have a lot <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of concerns about the bill and they will certainly come up when the bill is debated. There is no reason why the bill will not be debated. But on the evidence that you have given as to why the Senate should exempt the bill from the cut-off motion you simply have not substantiated your case. You cannot substantiate a case to urgently retrospectively pull the rug out from industry. I am sorry; that has not been proven in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Margetts. To quote the Hill cut-off motion: `Where the government wishes to the Senate to depart from the general chronological priority the government should justify each such departure.' I agree that no case has been made&mdash;not in the committee and not in the chamber today&mdash;to justify this departure. There is one point I would like to seek clarification from Senator Tambling on, and that is the question of when the grant is payable. I think the discussion in the committee suggested that the grant was only payable after the ships had had sea trials and had actually been commissioned. So I seek some clarification on that from Senator Tambling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of issues came up during the course of the committee which clearly showed that this bill will move the Australian shipping industry backwards. There is no argument put forward by the government that the competitiveness of the Australian shipping industry would be improved. In fact, all the evidence to the committee was that the Australian shipping industry would be made less competitive by this bill. The government has not at any stage put forward a set of alternatives to improve competitiveness. They have suggested that some time down the track they might think about it. Then they come forward and say, `It is very urgent that we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1396"> remove this assistance to Australian shipping's competitiveness but we do not have any ideas at the moment.' This to me seems to be a contradictory position. If we want to improve the competitiveness of the Australian shipping industry we need to have a formulated plan in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a couple of furphies put forward in the committee by the government that all the money was going to overseas ship builders because Australian shipping could not get the sized ships it wanted built in Australia so it obviously had to get them built overseas. This again was a reason put forward for urgently needing to repeal this legislation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has dealt extensively with the Mackay shipping case. I can only reiterate that this is a shameful position being put forward by the government. Companies have acted in good faith. To be lectured, as they were, that they should have gone into those contracts with their eyes open is a shameful position to be coming from the government. I am sure that Shell, BHP and Mackay Sugar will remember those words for a long time that came from, I think, Mr Wallace and that were supported by the minister and Senator Tambling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contradictory statements were made to the committee which are also of some concern. In the evidence supplied by Mr Payne on behalf of the shipping association, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Wallace asked that I not race off to my members until he has considered the position to be put to shipowners in relation to the fiscal arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the government seems to be acting with a great deal of haste to try to remove the cut-off and have this debated but still has not yet come up with any suggestions to the shipowners of what those fiscal arguments should be. So I do not think the government at any point in time has justified its request for the Senate to exempt this bill from the cut-off.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear the coalition has not demonstrated the urgency for the consideration of this bill. Quite to the contrary, the best attempt at an argument was presented by Senator Macdonald, who wanted the matter resolved and wanted the opportunity for Mackay Sugar Cooperative shareholders to be able to rest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> easy tonight in knowledge one way or the other. The bill was put forward and successful. Its success meant that such people would be either faced with a cost which I think senator Macdonald indicated was $2,500 for 1,500 shareholders or, if it was not successful, the status quo would prevail and the grant and conditions upon which they had made decisions would continue and the status quo would prevail to suit their plans and the business that they were conducting.       </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tambling asserted that such businesses should be conducted in a way which took account of the continuing changing of the economic framework and the taxation regime and other decisions. I do not know what sort of business can do that. I do not know any business which would make plans based on the situation as it is today suddenly changing and their having to revoke the basis upon which decisions were made. I do not know what sort of business Senator Tambling has in mind, but the businesses that I have been involved in have been successful because they make decisions based on the economic and regulatory framework as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who are most successful are able to best fit not only what is happening at the time but a reasonable approximation of the future. I would suggest, for the reassurance of the people that Senator Macdonald is purportedly considering&mdash;his electors in the Mackay area&mdash;that they should be well assured that the Democrats and, as I understand it, the Greens and the Labor Party, will defend the position, the status quo, and will pursue the situation which was, with coalition support, passed in this parliament to resolve the problems of the lack of investment in the Australian shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The urgency of changing that has not been demonstrated to this Senate today nor might I say was that urgency demonstrated to the committee, and I carefully read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the committee inquiry. In fact, it was quite the contrary. Although most of the committee hearing was devoted to a spat between the chair, some of the witnesses and some of the senators, and although there was quite unseemly exchanges, which did not really illuminate the issue at all, there was certainly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1397"> no urgency demonstrated to that committee. I am sure that the committee will not resolve that this bill needs to be brought on immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of it will be retrospective. We do not have to get too precious about the actual definition of what it is that is occurring, we only have to look at the effect. It is undoubtedly retrospective in that it removes a basis upon which earlier decisions have been made. That alone deserves greater consideration and care and, I suggest to the government, greater examination before it is brought to this chamber. The Democrats are not convinced that this is urgent and therefore would not support exemption from the cut&hyphen;off.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am disappointed that the three opposition parties have collaborated to indicate to the Senate that they are not prepared to deal with the exemption of the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill, and have this matter brought on for good and proper debate in this area. As I indicated earlier, I think it is important to put on the record that the dealing of the legislation in this session is important because of the focus that has been given to that important date of 1 July 1996, and the intent of the legislation in that regard. I do not accept the arguments that have been pushed forward with regard to retrospectivity and I believe that was clearly established in the committee in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both Senator Macdonald and Senator Conroy addressed the issue of entitlements under this grant and, whilst we are debating this matter largely in absence of the committee report which is due to be tabled in this chamber later today&mdash;perhaps it ought to have formed a very important consideration for the actual debates&mdash;it is important to put on the record that, in relation to the entitlement to the grant under the Ships Capital Grants Act, a ship becomes entitled to a grant on delivery to the shipowner and registration in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grant is not payable until after the commissioning and the meeting of other conditions such as specified crew levels and engagement of Australian resident seafarers, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as required by the act. Therefore, if an eligible trading ship is delivered, and registered in Australia before 30 June 1996, an entitlement to a grant would be created. I think that is very important in this particular issue. It is relevant to the debate and the issues that are currently being pursued in appropriate legal areas by the issues relating to Mackay ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The date of commissioning of the ship is not relevant to the grant entitlement and any timing of the payment. I think it is a pity that the three collaborating opposition parties have precluded the good and proper debate that ought to have preceded this legislation either later today or tomorrow by the indication of how they are going to vote.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the order of the Senate of 29 November 1994, relating to the consideration of legislation, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not apply to the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>A bill in similar form introduced by the previous government late last year was aimed at addressing corruption within the Australian Federal Police. The 1995 bill, which lapsed due to the federal election, was given bipartisan support at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues to be addressed remain the same. Nonetheless, time has moved on. Police corruption continues to be a matter of concern for Australian governments and the public at large. Senators are no doubt aware that the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service has uncovered distressing instances of corruption and other serious misconduct and that a small number of serving and former members of the AFP have been implicated in corruption. Some senators may also be aware of the allegations of corruption within the AFP made on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program by a former member of the AFP, Alan Taciak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The core provisions of this bill are focused on ensuring that the Australian Federal Police remains corruption free by providing the commissioner with essential powers to combat corruption within the AFP. Regulations which exempt the AFP from the operation of the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act cease to have effect at the end of this year, therefore making it very desirable to achieve fairness for the AFP and to make these changes that will assist in the anti&hyphen;corruption fight. It is desirable that the bill be passed by parliament with a minimum of delay.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is just a slight change of emphasis in one respect; certainly not one in terms of substance. The emphasis is this: a person subject to the declaration of serious misconduct will, under the slight change, be able to seek a statement of reasons in relation to the commission's decision to make the declaration. However, where the reasons would disclose information that would not be in the public interest to disclose&mdash;that is, operationally sensitive information such as identity of informants or current investigations&mdash;the Attorney may, in the public interest, issue a certificate under subsection 14(1) of the AD(JR) Act preventing disclosure of that information.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> bill is a technical corollary to the new Customs Tariff Act 1995 which passed the Parlia <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1401"> ment in the 1995 Spring Sittings with bi&hyphen;partisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Act 1995, which will commence on 1 July 1996, implements over 500 tariff classification changes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System of the World Customs Organization. The passage of the act last year provided an effective six months lead time before its commencement and was necessary to enable the importing community to make the necessary computer and documentary changes resulting from the new Tariff Act. It has also enabled the checking and revalidation of 120,000 tariff advices on the tariff classification of goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Customs Tariff Act 1987 will be repealed by Part 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 with effect from 1 July 1996. There are several Commonwealth acts which presently contain references to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and its provisions. It is necessary to legislatively update all these references with references to the 1995 Tariff Act and its corresponding provisions, to ensure their continued effectiveness (Schedule 1 of this bill refers).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also several types of instruments, such as by&hyphen;laws and Tariff Concession Orders, which contain references to the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. These instruments include approximately:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 22,000 Tariff Concession Orders and Commercial Tariff Concession Orders;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 300 by&hyphen;laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As these instruments are intended to continue in effect for the purposes of the new Tariff Act, it is necessary in this bill to enact transitional provisions to apply to these instruments. The provisions, in effect, deem references which are contained in the instruments to the 1987 Tariff Act as if they were references to the 1995 Tariff Act. Where the tariff headings have changed, the provisions deem the references to be to those changed headings as set out in a partial concordance (Schedule 2, items 2 to 5 of this bill refer). In the absence of such a provision, all these instruments will lapse on the commencement of the new 1995 Tariff Act on 1 July 1996 because the 1987 Tariff Act to which they refer is repealed with effect from that date.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its election commitments, the Government stated that it will adopt a user pays approach to the funding of the Government's contribution to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). This bill will assist the Government in doing this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carrier licence fees are payable on 1 July 1996. The Government is unable to meet its election commitments without this amendment to the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991, because to collect the full telecommunications carriers' share of the ITU contribution would exceed the amount which the act currently provides may be collected from the telecommunications carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ITU is a United Nations specialised agency which is concerned with international cooperation in the use of telecommunications and of radiofrequency spectrum, including establishment of standards, and in the development of world telecommunications. Three ITU sectors carry out these functions, namely the Telecommunication Standardization, Radiocommunication and Development sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government pays an annual financial contribution to the ITU ($5.8 million for the 1996 calendar year) that covers the work of all three sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the major beneficiaries from Australia's involvement in the ITU are the telecommunications carrier and radiocommunication licensees, it is appropriate to recover the full cost of the ITU contribution from those licensees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will enable this to be done, through allowing an increase in telecommunications carrier licence fees to include full recovery of the telecommunications carriers' share of the Government's contribution to the ITU. The method used to calculate the share will be specified in the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will be acting separately to ensure that radiocommunication licensees also meet their full share of the ITU contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, telecommunications carrier licence fees include a component to cover the ITU contribution of about $1.2 million in 1995&hyphen;96 (the amount varies each year according to factors including the level of the Government's contribution, the ITU budget and exchange rate movements). The financial impact of the proposed amendment on carriers will be to increase the annual amount payable in licence fees by about $0.9 million in 1996&hyphen;97. The cost will be shared by carriers on the basis of their share of telecommunications traffic. I commend the bill to the Senate. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1402"> </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the committee debated the amendments at great length. I am indebted to Senator Cooney for drawing attention to one central difficulty that I have not been able to resolve, either in my mind or through the advice I sought from other people last night. I refer to the difficulty that is posed by the paragraph which states that the person targeted by the controlled operation is likely to commit an offence and that the judicial officer would have to be satisfied that the officer is satisfied that such an offence is likely to be committed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think that example is close to the many other examples where judicial officers are requested to approve warrants for searches and such like procedures, but it does take it just a step further. I am conscious of the fact that there is a remaining possibility that a subsequent trial could be affected by a judge having made a statement that he or she is satisfied that the targeted person is likely to commit an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various suggestions were made that one could soften this particular statement, including suggestions made by Senator Cooney. I think that is undesirable because that would weaken the criterion for the controlled operation being approved and being instituted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition I would like to place on record that we do not support the sunset clause. We were supportive of the concept of an external accountability mechanism; but we understand why Senator Spindler has not proceeded with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of a sunset clause in this legislation is one that is quite inappropriate for the sorts of operations we are talking about and for the time over which those operations may operate. By putting a sunset clause in you could jeopardise the act of operations. So, as an alternative to that, given <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1403"> the 12 months of operation, we obviously will be using the mechanisms of the parliament to assess how the operation of this act has been implemented&mdash;mechanisms either in here or through the committee process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Spindler, we do share your concern. That concern was driving both of us in terms of the external accountability mechanism. But, failing your amendment, this is not the appropriate way to go. We will resort to the mechanisms of this parliament to maybe check how the process is continuing. If it is not going as well as we would have hoped, then we can look at other options that the parliament has.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put the Greens' position on the record. Sunset clauses do not work, or at least they do not work to achieve the purpose that I am sure Senator Spindler would wish they did&mdash;that is, to alert people; to stand as a signal that this is a bad bill, that bad powers are being put in place and that we should watch it and in two years do something about it. Sunset clauses simply allow unpalatable bills to be proceeded with and lull objectors into silence. Then the sunset clause provisions slip off unobtrusively, leaving the powers well and truly entrenched.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would prefer to see this bill go through in the full position being put so that people can be aware of what a dangerous bill it is. A sunset clause merely says, `It's not quite that dangerous, because it has a sunset clause.' I remember the state government of Western Australia doing the same thing on the juvenile justice repeat offenders legislation which was an international disgrace and made mandatory provisions. Members of the government excused themselves by saying that there was a sunset clause provision. At the end of that sunset clause provision the mandatory powers were maintained and the legislation was made even worse by the next government that came into power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> So I could not speak more strongly against the use of sunset clauses. I do not think they work for the intention that they are designed and desired by people who have concerns about bills. The amendments Senator Spindler was moving were very good amendments. The concerns raised about them constitutio nally and in this chamber on both sides of the chamber are illustrations of the provisions of the bill and the unconstitutionality of what we are presently doing by passing this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Health Insurance Commission's special powers, we saw how effective that sunset clause was.

That report, fortunately, was able to be received before we passed the bill, removing the sunset clauses. But the kind of scrutiny we gave was very limited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be delighted if any senator in this place could give me an illustration of where sunset clauses have succeeded in taking back powers that had been given and about which people had expressed concerns, because I would be willing to review my position on sunset clauses in the light of such evidence. In the absence of such evidence, we indicate that we would much rather have supported Senator Spindler's amendments, with the questions about them notwithstanding, because we felt that they honoured and tried to put some kinds of controls over the mechanisms being bestowed by this bill upon the police to actually engage in illegal activities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Spindler for giving further consideration to this matter last night. I will not rehash the arguments made in the very productive debate yesterday. I thank Senators Spindler, Cooney and Bolkus for their consideration to the debate on the important issue of the accountability for controlled operations. The government is very pleased that the accountability mechanisms have been left as the government proposed&mdash;namely, that judicial officers will have the opportunity to check over these matters when these things come to trial and that the constitutionality of the bill is not put at risk by trying to bring judicial officers in at an earlier stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to briefly comment on why the government also will not be supporting the sunset clause proposed by Senator Spindler. One reason is that it automatically brings an end to the legislation after two years, which brings down the shutter on the legislation. That could operate at a time when it is not convenient to re-enact the provisions&mdash;for example, when parliament is prorogued. It follows from that that officers could be in the middle of an operation and the protection offered to them would be lost; so they might lose the opportunity to successfully prosecute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to recognise that there are other accountability mechanisms, as Senator Bolkus points out. He indicates that the opposition will use those within 12 months. I and the government believe that that would be too short a time and that there may not be enough information available. But we will know in 12 months time whether there is much information available on which to make a sensible review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises the difficulty with this sort of legislation and would be happy to cooperate with such a review at a time when there is adequate information. The guess at the moment is that it would be something like two or three years down the track. But Senator Bolkus may be right, and the committee may find something useful to look at within one year. But at least we all recognise that this place does have the capacity to change things and that a bill, once passed, is not cast into stone forever and a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the surface, the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill is a very simple bill, the explanatory memorandum going to only a few paragraphs. It in essence seeks to repeal the Training Guarantee Act 1990 and the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990, and amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992. In regard to the latter amendments in particular, the opposition has no difficulty in supporting those propositions, particularly as they go to providing a rectification of an oversight in regard to support for the open learning initiative, which facilitates access and increased flexibility for the provision of quality tertiary education throughout the community, especially in so far as it provides computer access to students. Therefore, we strongly support that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education) Assistance Act, the bill provides amendments to allow for $20 million in capital funding for non&hyphen;government schools&mdash;which, of course, was a Labor government initiative as well. Those two propositions were, in essence, Labor government initiatives. The main thrust of this proposal is to repeal the Training Guarantee Act 1990, which was a commitment that the Labor Party made in the election. That, too, will be supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concerns, nonetheless, go to broader issues which relate to the philosophy of these measures. In particular, our concerns go to the philosophy of this government in relation to the training and education agenda. For us, the issue of training and education stood central to the political agenda in government, and that was reflected in expenditure for this department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue which is at the very heart of the way in which the government approaches economic and social issues. If we were to look in broader terms at the main forces of economic development, one often talks about the needs and the rights of capital, but it is not so often the case that the needs and rights of labour are given equal treatment. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> As far as I am concerned, the issue of training and education has to be seen in that context of being of equal importance to the needs and rights of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who have nothing else but their labour to sell, the issue of the skill of labour could not be more basic. Upon that rests the capacity of this country to develop to its full potential. This is particularly important not just for the economy at large but for each and every individual in particular. Therefore, the approach that government takes to the skilling of labour goes very much to the heart of the issue of what sort of country we are trying to develop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we are in the business of developing a clever country. That means to the fullest extent possible, every person in the country should be able to enjoy the benefits of a quality education and training system and, to the fullest extent possible, the state&mdash;that is, the government of this country&mdash;ought to be supporting such an approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is precisely what we did in government. Of course, that has not been followed by this government. It is not the case in terms of the coalition philosophy at large when we look at their activities and programs at a state level. They have done everything possible to undermine and frustrate the work of the national Labor government in terms of the policies pursued in the education and training areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is seen quite clearly in the case of Victoria, my own state. Commonwealth outlays for schools, for instance, which showed a very importance level of commitment, increased by 40 per cent, whereas cuts to state education programs in real terms were about 10 per cent. We saw that pattern right across the board. So while the Commonwealth was increasing its commitment to training and education, the states were reducing their commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 13 years during which Labor was in office, we increased funding to schools by 55 per cent in real terms&mdash;a huge commitment. In terms of TAFE and the vocational sector, the increase was in the order of 56 per cent in real terms. In terms of the university sector, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1408"> the increase in funding was something like 69 per cent in real terms. In terms of the number of university places, there has been a 70&hyphen;odd per cent increase in provision. So as far as Labor was concerned, the philosophy of a decent, proper and quality education and training system was predicated on the presumption that there should be an integration of programs&mdash;that all citizens should have access to proper education and training at a level appropriate for their needs. That could be at university; it could be at school, through formal school programs; or it could be through the vocational education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw quite massive increases in school retention rates. We saw quite massive increases in the number of people enjoying the benefits of apprenticeships and we saw massive increases in the number of people participating in tertiary education. At all levels, the increase in expenditure was reflected in increased access and equity for Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at what has been achieved in terms of training programs in particular, when Labor came to office in 1983 there were 34,000 apprenticeships per year. There were no traineeships at all. At that point traineeships had not even been considered. I refer to briefing notes of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), a copy of which I have here. The department advises the minister that there will be funding provision for 64,000 program places, which includes 34,000 traineeships and 55,000 apprenticeships. As I understand it, the department is saying to the minister there are ways and means by which those programs could be accelerated to improve the capacity and momentum of the training agenda. I am quite happy for that briefing note&mdash;a briefing note to the minister from the department entitled `Labour market training assistance for the remainder of 1995&hyphen;96'&mdash;to be tabled, if the minister has no objection to that.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. I will come back to that. The whole contrast between the approaches of Liberal and Labor could not be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sharper when we look at the reports appearing daily in the press as to what is occurring in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I refer specifically to the propositions that the Expenditure Review Committee has put to the department and which the secretary to the department has put to meetings of officers around the country aboconstitution the possibility of indicative cuts of 12 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to newspaper reports&mdash;for instance, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 15 May 1996&mdash;it has been suggested that the targeted cut for DEETYA should be set at $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. That translates to a disproportionate contribution by DEETYA towards the government's proposed budget cuts. It would mean a total contribution of 22 per cent of the so&hyphen;called $8 billion budget cuts from a department that receives only about 11 per cent of total budget outlays. According to the reports, that will involve cuts of $600 million in the forward estimates of higher education programs and cuts of some $400 million from the labour market programs which include the provisions we are talking about generally today. Such cuts have to be also considered to the additional programs for schools, ANTA and other vocational programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have, in essence, a sharp contrast between the philosophy and approach taken by Labor while it was in government and that taken now by a government seeking, basically, to bury this very fine record of achievement. That concerns me greatly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech there is reference to a modern and relevant training system. What that really means is open to anyone's guess. It is one of those nice buzzwords that bureaucrats come up with and which governments seek to trot out from time to time when they are developing rationales for their positions. I am concerned about the possibility that a relevant and modern training system under this government will mean a market driven training system&mdash;a system of training dependent upon market forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a substantial change in the attitudes of employers towards training as a result of the training guarantee levy. A survey was undertaken last year&mdash;it might have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1409"> the year before&mdash;of some 6,000 businesses and 17,000 households which showed that, whereas in the past, before the scheme was introduced, less than 60 per cent of employers were providing adequate funding for training, that figure had increased to some 90 per cent as a result of these measures. Prior to the introduction of the scheme, employers with a payroll in excess of $200,000 provided very few structured training programs for their work force. As a result of the introduction and development of this levy that figure rose to some 90 per cent. It was predicated upon the assumption that there was an obligation on employers to meet some of the training costs. That was by way of the introduction of this measure which rose, eventually, to 1.5 per cent of payroll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often in this country the extraordinary proposition is advanced by employers that only the state has responsibility for contribution towards the payment for training. We see that attitude often reflected in the demand that immigration programs be changed according to either the skill shortages or surpluses that occur in this country at any given time. We also see it reflected in the demand that the state provide moneys for apprenticeship and TAFE training generally&mdash;that it is not the employer's responsibility to meet any of those commitments. We are now seeing all of those attitudes breaking down. I am concerned whether we will see a change in attitude back the other way as a result of the so&hyphen;called free market policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of concern that I have is the contrast in the performances of the previous government and this government on trainee wages. In recent times we have seen the government propose that employees not be paid for time when they are not directly engaged in productive work, despite the fact that we already have existing awards that cover these conditions in apprenticeship and trainee wages generally. I am concerned that if that proposal were taken through to its logical conclusion, for example, you could see an 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;old shop assistant have his or her wages reduced to some $138 a week. As far as I am concerned that would be an inadequate wage and would lead to a substantial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drop in the capacity of people to earn a decent living. This whole issue of training ultimately goes to the quality of life that people can enjoy as a result of the training and their capacity to fully participate in society. This parliament ought to be very concerned about trainee wages being reduced to such a level that people cannot enjoy the decent conditions of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has advanced proposals in other areas demonstrating a trend towards market domination of training proposals. Looking at an issue such as occupational health and safety, there are clearly areas of considerable need yet to be attended to. It is my grave concern that, if there is not sufficient encouragement from government, there will be too great a reliance upon the employer's capacity to pay for training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to surveys undertaken by the National Safety Council, in this country some 500 workers a year die as a result of occupational work accidents. As has been demonstrated again and again, that is largely due to a failure to provide adequate training on the job. Some 10 workers a week are dying as a result of a failure to provide adequate training at work. So there is a considerable need for this parliament to maintain vigilance on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the opposition supports these proposals, I believe that there are areas of concern that need to be attended to. I am sure this will be an issue that will have to be attended to in the future. You cannot have a situation where market forces alone determine the level of contribution made by employers to the training of workers in this country. You cannot have a situation where the government exempts itself from its obligation to ensure that all people in this country have adequate access to proper training and proper educational facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, we do not have the right to turn our backs on issues such as that of proper training for workers on the job to ensure their adequate health and safety. As it stands, some 655,000 workers are injured every year largely as a result of inadequacy of the training provided for the use of equipment, and safe work practices. There is, of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1410"> course, a range of broader issues that go to the issue of proper training. But I would have thought the issue of occupational health and safety demonstrates just how important it is for employers to provide adequate training at work, and the government has an obligation to ensure that that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we see at the moment? The government is cutting back moneys to the National Safety Council. We have a problem here costing this economy some $20 billion a year. What does this government do? It cuts $20 million out of the budget of the National Safety Council of Australia&mdash;an organisation which is primarily concerned with these matters. We have seen this government repeatedly talk about cuts and the reduction of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that this government attended to the issue of the effects such cuts would have on the quality of services provided. In the case of training, this is often not just a matter of improvement to people's lives but, for some workers, a matter of life and death. Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask that this document be tabled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. One of the first aspects of this bill before the chamber today is to provide for the abolition of the training guarantee scheme and the training guarantee levy&mdash;something that the Democrats have supported. In fact, we put this forward in our 1994 budget proposal but, in doing so, we not only proposed a three-year suspension of the training guarantee levy but advocated a 10 per cent training investment allowance. So we have long recognised that the training guarantee levy has become, indeed, a tax on labour. But we believe that our idea would have provided an incentive, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through rebates and other tax incentives, to encourage investment in labour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Democrats did support the advent of the training guarantee scheme in 1990, as we saw then, as we do now, a clear need for greater input from business and industry into the training needs of this country. In fact, at the time of the introduction of the training guarantee scheme, we moved a series of amendments designed to devolve the responsibility for the administration of the training guarantee scheme away from the Australian Taxation Office. We have always had a concern about the amount of red tape involved in the TGL, and that has been based on extensive consultations we have had with groups in the community&mdash;be they business and industry groups, or academic or union groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always expressed concern over the somewhat or sometimes dubious accreditation of schemes. Also, we have consistently called attention, in this place and others, to the flouting of approved industry standards and practices when it has taken place. We recognise that there is still a need, an increased need, for training in our workplaces, and we have long supported a greater role for employers in the provision of training. So today I urge the government to ensure that the abolition of the TGL does not occur in a vacuum; that it is replaced by other initiatives and incentives for business and industry to get involved in workplace training. I concur with Senator Kim Carr's comments on that note.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, at the time of the TGL suspension bill, the former government claimed the act had achieved its purpose. While I would like to think that was the case, I do take some issue with that statement, and I was heartened by Senator Carr's comments regarding the increased expectation among employers that they should invest in training schemes. However, we did note that there were still a number of employers who were paying directly into the ATO the money that they perhaps should have been spending on levies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly hope that since the introduction of the TGL there has been some kind of an attitudinal shift in this country. I believe it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1411"> reflected in the most recent ABS figures which note that changes to training expenditure in industries are now most likely to occur because of technological change and quality assurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last financial year it seems that technological change had the most impact on employers in the communication and public administration and defence industries, where 81 per cent and 51 per cent of employers respectively reported an increase in training expenditure as a result of this. In the manufacturing and construction industries, quality assurance most often caused employers to increase training expenditure, with that reason being cited in 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively of these employer cases. However, in the electricity, gas and water industry it was legislation other than the training guarantee legislation that most often caused employers to increase their training commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly hope that there is a greater recognition given by business and industry groups in our community to the fact that they have a responsibility to ensure that quality accredited training is available to their employees. It is also essential that this kind of training be available to all workers&mdash;and I should stress, the newer and younger members of the work force. As I stated in here a number of weeks ago in my first speech, I still believe that there is no other group in society which has been more subjected to the cruel and cutting edge of structural and technological change than that of young Australians. But of course it is not just young workers who need constant updating of skills and skill acquisition. I guess that increasing access to education and training in this country is a prerequisite now&mdash;not an option, but a prerequisite&mdash;for today's work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should add that quality training should not come at the expense of worker benefits, and it should not be considered an optional extra but an obligatory part of the contract between employees and employer, business and industry groups. Nor should we see workers&mdash;any workers, but specifically young Australians&mdash;penalised for their desire to undertake training and skill acquisition. I really hope that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coalition bear that in mind when considering the industrial relations changes that they have proposed, and also that they stick to their election pledge that no worker shall be worse off under their strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of this bill&mdash;I refer to the changes to schools&mdash;fulfils a commitment by the previous government to provide an additional $20.7 million to the non&hyphen;government schools capital program in 1996&hyphen;97. I should add that the Democrats support these proposals. We recognise the ongoing need for government expenditure on non&hyphen;government schools. However, we are firmly of the opinion that such expenditure should go to the less well&hyphen;off non&hyphen;government schools&mdash;those that are struggling to meet basic standards in equipment or facilities. We can see no justification at a time when the public school system is crying out for additional resources for us to be directing taxpayers' funds into the well&hyphen;off non&hyphen;government school sector. After all, it is the public or government school sector which is educating more than 70 per cent of Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to remind the coalition of its election promise&mdash;another one&mdash;to take up the issue of Australia's low OECD ranking on government expenditure for school education. That was going to be taken up at the first COAG meeting after the election. The promise was to `at least maintain' Commonwealth specific purpose payments to schools in line with the forward estimates. I would like to hear from the minister today, as part of this debate, as to whether these commitments still hold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask that question in light of recent comments by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Kemp) suggesting the possibility of a significant shift in government funding away from the public school sector into the non&hyphen;government school sector. In fact, just last week the minister claimed that the favourable impact on public sector savings of the surge in private schooling is justification for `more flexible funding' for non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am just curious as to what `more flexible funding' really means. Does it mean relaxing the rules so that the well&hyphen;off non&hyphen;government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1412"> schools get more public funds? Does it mean increasing funding to the non&hyphen;government sector at the expense of the government sector? Does it mean shifting even more of the costs of education from the government onto individual parents and students? I am curious to hear from the minister today in regard to those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the standard answer is that nothing can be revealed until the budget, but I believe the government can at least give a commitment that any increase in funding to the non&hyphen;government school sector will not come at the expense of government schools. I think that those parents with children in the state school system&mdash;and that is the vast majority of parents, I might add&mdash;are entitled to an answer on that particular question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also entitled to know whether such an increase is going towards the wealthier non&hyphen;government schools at a time when, as I said, the government school sector is struggling and experiencing real difficulties across the board. I believe that most parents, despite reservations, probably have little argument with the idea of their taxes going towards assisting poorer non&hyphen;government schools. Most parents believe children should not be penalised simply because of the decision their parents may have made as to what school they should attend, where it is or what kind of school they should be educated in. I do believe that parents draw the line at their taxes going towards well&hyphen;off non&hyphen;government schools where the services are already of a high standard, while their children are struggling to attend government schools that are resource strapped. So I ask the minister today if she is able to reassure Australian parents and the Senate that that proposal is not on the government's drawing board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last part of this bill corrects an oversight which would have prevented the minister approving expenditure for the open learning initiative. Obviously, the Democrats support that plank. In fact, we note that, when the open learning initiative was established by then Minister Dawkins, he claimed that all Australians would have access to education if they had a television and a letterbox. We know that that is not always the case; that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there are many fees and charges associated with the open learning initiative and many of those charges occur up front. Certainly, the Australian Democrats have been involved in an ongoing debate since the inception of that scheme to argue that the minimum course load requirement in order to get a deferred payment option for OLI should be lowered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always argued that the advent of the OLI initiative should be an exciting technological advance, especially for those groups in the community that have previously been disadvantaged or not had access to higher education and further education&mdash;be it because of home duties, disability or distance. I urge that we recognise once again in this chamber that fees and charges for education at whatever level are a psychological and financial disincentive to enter and pursue education. I would hate to see that a scheme that offers such access to different groups in the community had barriers such as fees and charges associated with it. I hope that that is something else that the coalition will keep in mind, especially at budget time as they are considering changes and possible cuts to the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They might also want to reflect on their promises not to cut operating grants to the higher education sector or their promises not to increase fees and charges such as HECS for current students. I say that on a day when we are seeing unprecedented academic and general staff strike action around this country&mdash;action that is being strongly supported by students, many vice&hyphen;chancellors, I believe, and of course the Australian Democrats. I guess that is relevant in the context of today's debate, while we are talking about achieving a higher class, quality, contemporary education and training system. The Democrats know full well that we cannot aim for such a system while we have barriers to achieving and developing skills, especially in a work force that is subject to such massive structural and technological change&mdash;so much so that workers do require those skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the parliament recognises today the profound changes that have taken place in our work force and the dire need for all workers to have access to skill development and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1413"> acquisition. I hope that the coalition, when talking about these issues, bears in mind their election promises, especially their promise that no worker will be worse off under a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, it is time we talked about increased commitments&mdash;financial and otherwise&mdash;to education and training, not a reduction in the amount that we are spending on our schools, on higher education courses, on further education, or on courses such as the open learning initiative. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few remarks with respect to the bill before the chamber, the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. As has been indicated by Senator Carr, the opposition is supporting the proposed amendments. I wish to make some comments regarding the importance of the training guarantee levy when it was first established. And while it is now being repealed it was, at that time, a fundamental initiative of the Labor government to get investment in training in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of investment by the private sector in training over many years is lamentable. This country ranked very low by international comparison in terms of a preparedness to invest in training and to recognise that the training of employees is good for business and good for the economy. For too long many businesses in the private sector relied heavily upon state governments, state instrumentalities and the federal government to gain access to a skilled work force. If one thinks back to the 1950s and 1960s, the post-war era, when much of the major infrastructure development in this country occurred in resources industries and in the provision of services, roads and electricity and to the development and expansion of the economy after the war, it was the state governments, particularly the state instrumentalities&mdash;obviously funded both through their own resources and through the federal government&mdash;that provided the opportunities for employees to become apprentices and gain their skills. One can recall that such bodies as state railways, electricity commissions and the like were the source of much of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the skilled labour. Many employees, for instance in the metal industry, in the private sector, in the private business area, gained their apprenticeships in such places as state railways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have seen over time, those instrumentalities or work forces have been cut back substantially through restructuring of industry and, as a consequence, that pool of training, of apprenticeship, has very much disappeared. I can recall in my period of previous employment in the union movement that the Hydro-electric Commission of Tasmania was probably the largest single employer of apprentices in that state. We have seen over time how there was a shift away from a reliance by private industry on gaining its employees from the public sector. With a private sector that was not terribly committed to investment and training, this country had a real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had massive changes in technology and the expansion of the global economy. Australia was going through a period of the necessary removal of tariffs protecting manufacturing industry and changes in our export base. All of these things meant that unless we had initiatives to get investment in training in this country our future was looking very bleak. I think it is still the case that we do not have a culture in this country in the private sector that considers investment in training as the highest or one of the highest priorities. I would acknowledge that we have made some very substantial gains towards that, I think largely because of the introduction of the training guarantee levy at the time, which was one of those occasions where government had to act to force industry to invest in training, to invest in its own future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time the legislation was introduced in 1990, the then opposition, the now government, was violently opposed to it and many sectors of industry were opposed to it. Now the attitude has changed because of that initiative. Employers had to be dragged screaming and kicking to the table but, once there, recognised that they actually did have a real interest in investing in the training and, in many cases the retraining, of their employees. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1414">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would not have been able to achieve some of the restructuring of industry that has occurred in this country and opportunities for employees to become multi-skilled, to be able to more easily move from one sector of the work force to the other, which is an increasing feature of any modern society, without the impetus of the training guarantee levy and as part of that overall broader approach to improving education, higher education, and access to training in this country. Many employers, I can recall, were violently opposed, firstly, to putting any substantial investment into training and, secondly, to the government, the state or the union movement having any say in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the traineeship system first started a few years back, I, and many other union officials, went around this country trying to get employers in industry to take on trainees under the traineeship system that was available whereby they were able to be subsidised over the course of 12 months for taking on additional employees to undertake training. Slowly we got them there and I am pleased to say that in the rural sector, for example, where once there was an absolute opposition to this sort of a concept where you could actually have structured training for farmworkers, we now have a situation where my old organisation, the Australian Workers Union, and the National Farmers Federation, have a partnership for training rural workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the days are gone when rural workers were regarded as jacks&hyphen;of&hyphen;all&hyphen;trades, or jills&hyphen;of&hyphen;all&hyphen;trades, and the masters of none. Just as employees in other industries are able to gain recognition for their skills, whether it be in the metal, mining, hospitality, or clerical industries, or whatever, we are also now looking at farmworkers, in what is still very much the productive heart of our export industry. We are looking at recognising their skills as marketable throughout the rest of the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I am indebted to Senator Carr for raising the issue of safety, and the importance of training in safety, because the rural sector has one of the worst records for accidents amongst farmers and their workers. There is a very high incidence of injuries and acci dents, both with machinery and also with the use of such things as chemicals and poisonous substances. Through the initiatives of Worksafe Australia and Farmsafe, employees and, indeed, employers, have been able to gain the requisite skills needed to look after their own safety and that of their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these sorts of initiatives have come about in recent years and I believe that it is in large measure due to the initiatives of the trade union movement, together with enlightened employers and the federal and some state governments, who have pointed out the importance of competency based training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what does concern us is that, whilst these achievements have been made, we now face a situation where the government, through its savage budgetary cuts and its attack upon a whole range of programs in the employment, education and training areas, can turn back the clock. I do not think that there is ever a time when you seriously look at slashing or even reducing expenditure on education and training. But if ever there were a time that you should refuse to do that, it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country stands at a very critical point in its history, having taken on the hard task of restructuring industry, of opening up our economy to the rest of the world, and of establishing the opportunities for expansion of trade in Asia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that education, training and health are the most fundamental responsibilities of government in any society. The old saying is that if you have got good health and you can get access to a good education, then things will usually flow pretty well from there on. But if we do not have those things, then many <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1415"> kids in the future are going to be denied the opportunities to participate in this vastly changing technological world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst quite clearly the opposition is supporting the proposed amendments, we also appeal to you&mdash;if you can actually listen to an appeal over there on the other side of the chamber&mdash;to rethink your proposals with respect to higher education and the vast range of employment and training programs that exist at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I close by saying that through Working Nation&mdash;something that is continuously attacked by the now government out of some blind, ideological view more than a real analysis of the success of those programs under Working Nation&mdash;we have seen there the development of a tripartite approach to training and employment. Governments, employers, and employee organisations have got together in communities with area consultative councils, as well as at industry level through industry training bodies, to promote training and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the north coast of New South Wales, in the Coffs Harbour area, a rapidly expanding population area of this country, the `Jobs North' program has been a marvellous success. There have been 1,000 new employment placements in six months&mdash;achieved in half the time of the target that was set. It was achieved because of the cooperative approach of businesses in that area, the local Commonwealth Employment Service, DEET agencies, the trade union movement and the local government representatives, all getting together and looking at the needs of that area. The industries that needed to be promoted, such as tourism, did some really great work in providing training opportunities and employment opportunities for young people. I would hate to see that sort of initiative disappear, but I am very fearful that those sorts of programs are likely to disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I appeal to the government to rethink its priorities, for the sake of the future of this country and for the sake of the future of the many kids who will want to get jobs in it in the future, and, in particular, to revoke the proposed cuts in education and training that it is going to inflict upon them.</PARA>

The minister can actually approve the money allocated to open learning for 1996, 1997 and 1998. The bill does not actually change the amount; it just makes the payment possible. The bill also gives an additional $20.7 million to the non-government school capital program in 1996, which was a commitment made by the previous government in 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens do not support the complete scrapping of the training guarantee levy without a replacement mechanism to encourage training by small business and industry. We will not be moving amendments, because we realise this would not have the support of the chamber, and we will not be opposing this bill, because of the funding arrangements for open learning and non-government school capital works dependent on the passage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to elaborate on why the Greens do not support the scrapping of the training guarantee levy without a viable alternative to this real policy problem. The policy problem is how to ensure that industry and business are providing adequate structured training for staff. The training guarantee levy system was implemented in 1990 and was suspended in 1994 for two years. It imposed a levy on businesses with payrolls over $226,000 to spend 1.5 per cent of their payroll on structured training for staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We admit that the training guarantee levy was not a perfect system. There were problems with rorting and misuse. However, any taxation based system has problems of avoidance and of people making use of loopholes. There were problems associated with inflationary costs for some forms of training, like conferences, especially right near the end of the financial year. There were problems of compliance, with some 500 businesses opting to pay the penalty levy to the Australian Taxation Office instead of spending it on training. This was pretty illogical considering they could have got a tax deduction if they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1416"> had opted to pay the levy to an educational institution instead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial compliance of this scheme was quite clever, with compliance disguised as a levy which could be revenue neutral if made tax deductible with the benefits going to an educational institution. It is now quite ironic that this scheme will not be renewed when this same government is making the largest cuts to educational institutions in decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not agree with simple assertions that the training guarantee levy should be abolished because `it's a burden on business' or `business said it would have spent the same amount of money on training anyway'. This is the simple rhetoric of an ideology that says business can be self-regulatory without checks and balances in such matters. Business does have a responsibility to its work force to provide training and should pay for it. The other alternative is that business is saying that the taxpayer should pay for its training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to be committed to a culture of training, we must tackle this policy problem with improvements to the current training guarantee levy scheme with alternatives to the scheme. What is disturbing is that there is little or no debate about alternatives coming from either of the major parties. There has been little attempt to make the scheme workable, and the lack of effort has almost been to set the scheme up to fail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also no attempt to challenge rorting opportunities by changing the definition of what constituted legitimate training. There was also no attempt to make the scheme more flexible to live up to its criticisms by extending the definition of legitimate training to include, for example, study leave, occupational health and safety and industrial relations. The Australian Democrats in the past have proposed the replacement of the training guarantee levy scheme with tax incentives for training, such as a 10 per cent training investment allowance. The Greens would be concerned, however, that the burden has shifted more to the taxpayer instead of remaining with business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no sincere attempt to measure the effectiveness of the scheme. I have not seen <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any analysis on the amount of training expenditure during the two years in which this scheme has been suspended. We have a dire need with such policy matters to evaluate the outcomes of such a scheme so we are fully informed in our decision making. I believe this has not occurred with this scheme. This therefore explains the rash approach to do away with the scheme without looking at whether there is a real need for a more appropriate mechanism to take up the scheme's functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now left with no accountability mechanism to ensure business provides adequate training. There is no less need for training, especially in blue collar work. A National Safety Council study showed that 600 people were dying per year and that 500,000 Australians were injured at work as a result of the failure to provide adequate training in the workplace. This study examined 100 injuries and discovered that 56 per cent of employers did not provide employees with induction training and 70 per cent neglected refresher training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We know the training guarantee levy scheme has been effective because we had a 95 per cent compliance rate under the scheme. Prior to the scheme's operation in 1989, we had 58 per cent of businesses spending nothing on training while 74 per cent were spending less than one per cent of their payrolls on training. This was despite the government providing $2.5 billion in subsidies to employers, yet employers were not giving anything back on top of employment to employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an aside, I want to see how long it takes before industry comes to the government on particular issues and says, `We've got a real shortage of trained people in this particular sector. Please, can you provide an exemption for immigration for those particular workers with those skills because we don't want to have to pay the premiums to attract people in that industry back from other industries.' Just you wait and see how long that takes. I believe that is beginning to happen already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I believe that in scrapping this scheme, without giving serious consideration to improving it or replacing it with something more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1417"> workable, we are throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The government cannot be serious with its training program without such a scheme that renders business accountable for the amount its spends on training. If one were completely cynical, one would say the government does not require such a scheme because it believes that subsidised jobs with a large unpaid training component will make businesses look as though they were training anyway. The Greens believe this approach will mean an increase in the amount of working poor and will result in deskilling and heightened occupational safety concerns, particularly in blue-collar work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To recap, because there are elements of this bill which are of benefit to the community, we will not be opposing the bill. We very much regret that we are left with this very unsatisfactory arrangement in relation to the training guarantee levy, which now has no replacement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our productivity can only go up, Senator Carr, from this point. This legislation does three things and I want to address each of those in turn. First of all it abolishes the training guarantee levy, which was created by the previous government in 1990. The second point relates to the open learning initiative and a technical amendment to finish off funding for that particular program over the next two years. The third point is the provision of an additional $20.7 million of capital grants that have been promised to non-government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On the first matter, this bill finally buries the discredited and defunct training guarantee levy. This measure was introduced in 1991 by the former Labor government and was suspended by amendment in 1994. There is now, as you have heard round this chamber today, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bipartisan support for that approach. The ALP realised finally that this scheme was ineffective. It was best summed up in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Weekend</EMPHASIS>, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, in 1993. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This act has spawned an industry in which abseiling down a cliff is called team building; in which cosmetics demonstrations are training for receptionists; in which gym membership is written off as a stress management program and in which the definition of a corporate classroom is a five star resort.</PARA>
<PARA>They were some of the rorts that were occurring under this particular scheme in the name of training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry was very much opposed to this very blunt instrument to improve training in our country. A 1992 Australian Taxation Office survey of companies' attitudes to the training guarantee levy and what it was actually doing to the companies revealed the following. Seventy per cent said that the act created more administrative work; 63 per cent said they were spending the same amount of time, or even less time, on training; nine per cent admitted they were undertaking unnecessary training to fulfil the requirements of the act; and only four per cent&mdash;only four per cent&mdash;had a positive response to the act. It was a very ineffective piece of legislation created by the former Labor government. The training guarantee levy, along with the so-called Working Nation program, failed. What they did show was a commitment, under Labor, to off-the-job training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This government is committed to on-the-job training. We will set out, as one of our highest priorities, to revamp the apprenticeship system in this country, particularly at a time when we have such high levels of youth unemployment. The apprenticeship system was allowed to run down shamefully by the last Labor government. There were only 50,000 places a year under the ALP's scheme in 1995-96. That is exactly the same figure as 12 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the training guarantee, employers have no recognition for taking on apprentices. Labor had set up a scheme that was supposed to guarantee training but they had forgotten to include apprentices in that scheme. No wonder apprenticeships in this country declined so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1418"> drastically over the period of the previous government. As I indicated earlier, the training guarantee allowed executives to go off on stress relief to resorts, and that was claimable. The scheme became discredited, DEET did not monitor the scheme properly, and what should pass as real training in this country, in terms of apprenticeships, was not being done. Good riddance to another failed Labor program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter in the bill gives the minister discretion to approve funding allocated under the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990 to the open learning initiative, and in particular to its centrepiece, the Opening Learning Agency of Australia. This is to correct the minor anomaly to allow money to be spent in the last two years of the program, and then the OLAA is supposed to be self-sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was an initiative by the last government in 1992-93 to improve flexibility in higher education. In reality it was at that time&mdash;as senators will remember, in the depths of the recession&mdash;really part of the government's quick fix solution to long and lengthening unemployment queues. We also had at that time long and lengthening university queues. People were trying to get into a university and could not. When I came into this parliament, 50,000 people were being turned away each year from university gates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the last government came up with this open learning initiative. Treasurer Dawkins hailed it in the 1992 budget as `creating a new era in higher education'. It was supposed to do this&mdash;and I quote from the budget papers of 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every person with a TV or a letter box will have the opportunity to access higher education.</PARA>
<PARA>What overblown rhetoric that was. The reality is that several years later the Open Learning Agency, which was supposed to be the saviour of the system and allow proper access to higher education, had only 5,000 students. It has been a pimple on the pumpkin of the system. When compared with universities like Deakin, where there are 50,000 external students just in the one area, quite a contrast is created with this particular failed initiative.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee which I chaired examined this initiative in 1994 and 1995. It brought down two reports: one on the Open Learning Agency and one on open learning more generally. The committee, as a result of those hearings, did table in the Senate a number of unanimous recommendations on what the future of the OLAA should be. We felt that the whole thing needed to be integrated more into the university system and come under the auspices of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. The feeling was that, if we had done that, it would then be owned by all the universities and could become a tool for developing open learning right across the whole system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, because the system was set up on a cheap quick&hyphen;fix basis, this was not going to happen. The sums were all wrong. The amount of money the students paid&mdash;it was supposed to be self-financing&mdash;was $310 per unit. Our best estimate for the cost of running a university course, even in the arts, is from $600 to $800 a unit, and they were only allowing $300 a unit. Worst still, the participating university got only $185 of this off the top and the faculties got only $100 to administer the course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how can we have quality in that sort of system? There is not enough money to meet the cost of running the course. There is not enough money for the libraries and there is not enough money for administration. It really worked in only a rough sort of way because the universities that wanted to participate were prepared to cross-subsidise this system, which is hardly fair. We need to integrate open learning with the rest of the universities. Perhaps, in this revamped form, we could use it as a tool to take open learning into other countries and provide those people with access, on a fee-paying basis, to Australian university courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third and final aspect of this bill that I wanted to deal with relates to the amendments to the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act, which provides another $20 million for the non-government schools capital works program. This was promised by the last government and this government is honouring that promise. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1419"> very important because of the very long and proud tradition of the private schools in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was young, there used to be great division in society over whether there should be state aid to private schools. When Menzies was Prime Minister in 1963, he ended this sort of sectarian division that existed in Australian society. From that point on, from 1963 on, there was agreement that the Commonwealth government should have a role in providing funding for these schools, particularly capital works funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, over the last 13 years under the last government there have been some changes that have put a major brake on the development of new schools in Australia. We had what was called&mdash;and I think it is somewhat ironic, given the nature of what it did&mdash;the new schools policy. This policy, which allows private schools to be set up, was administered by the last government. We have renamed this so-called new schools policy the `no new schools policy', because the new schools policy stopped new schools from starting up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was instructive to hear what the Steiner school people had to say to our committee on employment, education and training. They said that, if the rules under this government for new schools existed 30 years ago when they were established, they would not have even got off the ground. Out there there is a whole range of schools which want to get started and the government has stopped it.</PARA>

Over a financial year the consolidated revenue fund, commonly known as the CRF, cannot be in deficit&mdash;that is, the expenditure over a year must not exceed the moneys available in the fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For the information of the Senate, the consolidated revenue fund is named in the constitution. Where there is projected to be a shortfall in the CRF, governments have adopted the practice of supplementing the CRF with moneys in the loan fund and balancing the loan fund by borrowing. In addition, and I think quite peculiarly, defence funding can be made directly from the loan fund to reduce the payments necessary from the CRF. I am not sure why that is so. It may have something to do with some sorts of financial arrangements adopted during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes to authorise borrowings to be undertaken and to authorise payments <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1420"> from the loan fund, firstly, to support the CRF if necessary, secondly, to use the borrowings to pay for defence expenditure and, thirdly, to pay for the costs of undertaking the borrowings. This is a routine machinery provision that will finance the 1996-97 budget measures. Such a bill is passed annually, except where it is unnecessary due to a surplus being achieved in the CRF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the CRF is usually in deficit, it is arguably archaic to require an annual act authorising the financing of such a deficit. The parliament's time could be saved by the passage of legislation which grants standing authority to borrow and to supplement the CRF. I will talk with Senator Short about that at an appropriate time. It is important that we have modern mechanisms in place to save the parliament's time with respect to what are fairly standard machinery matters. The opposition supports the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the government, I welcome the opposition's support for the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill. I would like to say very briefly in concluding the second reading debate that the opposition's chronology of events leading to this legislation is slightly awry. This whole issue was brought to a head by my motion that this issue be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, chaired very ably by Senator Chris Ellison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government had refused repeated attempts by the New South Wales government&mdash;then under the excellent premiership of John Fahey&mdash;SOCOG and the AOC to have such legislation giving property rights not only in relation to the symbols and motives of the Olympics but specifically for the words `Sydney 2000 Olympics' and a range of others associated with the organisation of the games. The coalition in opposition believed that, unless there was a serious public debate about this issue, the government would not act on this, as it had refused to do so for some two years since Sydney, New South Wales and Australia were successful in gaining the games.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was through an initiative of the opposition that this matter was referred to the Senate legal and constitutional committee. That committee did very good work, as Senator Schacht referred to. It brought all the issues into the public arena. Senator Vanstone, who is in the chamber, was a member of that committee. That committee made a unanimous report supporting what was at that stage the position of the coalition in opposition in relation to this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We encouraged the government month after month to bring forward this legislation. As we all know, as the games become closer, the opportunities for ambush marketing&mdash;that is, people associating themselves with the games whilst not having a licence to do so&mdash;become more of a problem and more of a drain on the cash flow to the organising committee. We made it publicly known that we thought the former government was tardy in bringing forward this legislation on the second last day of last year's sittings. I only seek to put that chronology in order. We do welcome the support of the  opposition. Since that Senate legal and constitutional committee brought down its report, there has been almost entire bipartisanship, as shown by the fact that the bill is listed today as being non-controversial.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wanted to ensure that the legitimate rights to get value from the Sydney Olympic Games were maintained without affecting the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1422"> people I have mentioned.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am delighted to speak in support of this bill, which will provide an additional $95.7 million to improve Aboriginal educational opportunities. I am especially pleased because this bill is the result of an initiative of the Federal Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In setting up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Review of Education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples</EMPHASIS>  in 1993, the former government was recognising the fact, stated in the 1994&hyphen;95 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social Justice for Indigenous Australians</EMPHASIS> , that `Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were. . . the poorest, sickest, most unemployed and least educated of all Australians'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review was established to examine the operation of the first triennium of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (AEP). The AEP began in 1990 as a national effort between the Commonwealth, the states and territories and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to strategically address the educational needs of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AEP identified 21 goals under four main themes: involvement, access, participation and outcomes, particularly recognising the fundamental importance of the involvement of indigenous people at all stages of decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original joint policy statement of the AEP in 1989 acknowledged the power of education to improve the quality of life for people from financially impoverished backgrounds:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Numerous reviews, inquiries and consultations conducted in recent years have all demonstrated that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people place a high priority on education. They want for themselves and their children no less by way of educational opportunity than is afforded other Australians. They expect that educational processes should lead them to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to realise their individual potential, lead satisfying lives, and contribute actively to the community. They look to education as a means of moving out of poverty and welfare dependency, enabling them to earn <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1424"> income through employment or enterprise and to manage the development of their communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Five years after the AEP was established was a suitable time to consider the extent to which it had met expectations in terms of the 21 goals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review praised the AEP for delivering more funding stability in the form of triennial rather than annual arrangements, for fostering co-operation between governments, federal, territory and state, and between education sectors, and for identifying the need for more culturally appropriate curricula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not surprisingly, it also found that the AEP's first three years held some lessons for its future operation. In terms of educational participation and attainment, the review found that improvements, although evident, were inconsistent across sectors and systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It found that many parents now have an avenue for becoming directly involved in their children's schooling through the establishment of over 2,500 parent committees under the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Program (ASSPA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also found that the co-operative national approach of the AEP had encouraged the development of Aboriginal studies and Torres Strait Islander studies as part of the curriculum in an increasing number of educational institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These kinds of improvements were not seen uniformly across the country, however, and addressed to only a limited extent the extreme educational disadvantage facing our indigenous population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review made 44 recommendations designed to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's experience of education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sixteen of the recommendations apply specifically to the Commonwealth, while others involve the state and territory governments and non-government education authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former government responded to the review in September last year, announcing a package of measures which included those incorporated in this bill. The response announced the Labor government's intention to make the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program recurrent, and this measure is a key part of the bill we are considering today. It will provide greater stability of funding as well as ensuring that funds remain commensurate with enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also simplify funding arrangements, addressing complaints made to the review about the time spent preparing submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with review recommendation 37, the proposal is to provide funds on a per capita basis, and in a way which reflects the differing costs of educational provision across sectors, and in remote and non-remote areas. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the government intends these changes to accompany a more accountable, outcomes-focussed process for the distribution of Commonwealth funds. There is no doubt that we need to continue down the path set by the previous government in placing a high priority on establishing comprehensive and up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date data bases across all sectors of education and training, so that the performance of the AEP in meeting its objectives can be properly evaluated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous government also obtained agreement from most states to increase their effort in Aboriginal education expenditure in order to access a pool of Commonwealth money in the form of strategic results projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition will be most interested in arrangements made with the states as a result of this bill. We would expect the government to ensure that commitments made by the states to increase effort are not permitted to lapse due to any reduction in commitment by the Commonwealth, or any diminution of resolve on the part of the Commonwealth. There is far too much at stake.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In closing, I would like to congratulate the chair of the reference group overseeing the review, Mandawuy Yunupingu, the deputy chair, Romina Fujii, and the other members of the reference group, on the excellent job they did.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also like to say that real improvements can be made in indigenous education if all governments work together with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We have come some of the way; this bill takes us further toward our goal.</PARA></INTERJECT></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a positive change for the funding of Aboriginal education. Funding is primarily now going to be on a per capita basis. That means that you get paid on the basis of the number of indigenous students, and there will be some extra money for Aboriginal education as approved by the Expenditure Review Committee. The poor retention rates, particularly at higher levels of secondary schooling, are a very major factor in the educational disadvantage of indigenous Australians. At year 12, for example, the retention rate is only 33 per cent, compared with 76 per cent for other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current funding arrangements under the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program are based on submissions which obviously fail to provide certainty and continuity. Funding levels have no direct link to outcome and do not reflect levels of enrolments of indigenous students. Now that we are shifting to a per capita basis of funding, it is going to be much more predictable, because it will be based on changes in enrolment demands and there will be this separate money from the per capita money for strategic results projects, which are, of course, going to be time limited and outcomes orientated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that the bill builds on an agreement, reached at the December 1995 meeting of the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, to set literacy, numeracy and employment targets within the 1997&hyphen;99 indigenous agreements with the Commonwealth for AESIP funding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to the newly arrived resident's waiting periods in this bill are modest and reasonable and will ensure that taxpayers only pay for those in need. As an adjunct to the changes, the government is reviewing sponsorship arrangements with a view to ensuring that anyone who sponsors a migrant should provide financial support for that person before any calls are made on the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also implement legislation aimed at streamlining information gathering from third parties and clarify that income data for different financial years may be used in a single data-matching program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 1307 of the Social Security Act 1991 and section 346 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 allow the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to require a person&mdash;usually employers and other third parties&mdash;to give information about a class of persons with a view to:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> verifying the qualification of persons who made claims for those pensions, benefits and allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both sections define the type of information that may be sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, information about when people start and end their employment may not be sought under sections 1307 or 346. The result is that employers are often faced with having to respond to a request for information under section 1307 or 346 and then having to deal with a follow&hyphen;up request authorised under another section of those acts if, on the basis of the initial advice provided by them, it appears to the Department of Social Security that there has been an overlap in payment of a social security payment or youth training allowance and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government wishes to reduce the paperwork burden on business. To that end, it would be more efficient if only one request had to be made to employers. It would also be beneficial from an individual's viewpoint. In many cases, the initial provision of more information about a person would confirm that the person was legitimately entitled to a payment and so there would be no need to undertake a follow&hyphen;up that might, quite unjustifiably, result in employers drawing adverse inferences about a person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also serves to make a minor amendment to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1427"> Act 1990 so as to put beyond doubt the ability of using Australian Taxation Office income data for different financial years in a single data&hyphen;matching program cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would ensure, for example, that income data in respect of the 1994&hyphen;95 financial year could be used so as to review the entitlement of a person to family payment for 1996 even though the person might have already lodged their 1995&hyphen;96 tax return. It would also ensure that income data in respect of the 1994&hyphen;95 and 1995&hyphen;96 financial years could be used in a single matching cycle to enable checking on student and parental personal income details for 1995 and 1996.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, senators would be aware that Senator Margetts, a moment or two ago, drew your attention to the state of the chamber when a quorum was not present. I think most senators would also be aware that it is a very unusual circumstance to have a quorum call now, when there is an agreement not to have a quorum call or division during consideration of non&hyphen;controversial legislation dealt with at lunchtime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I appreciate Senator Margetts's point.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate to the Senate that the opposition was informed by the government whip's office that the second reading of the Housing Assistance Bill 1996 would not be dealt with today during this period of non-controversial legislation. On that basis, it was a surprise not only to me but also to my colleague the opposition whip when this matter was called on. We understood that the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1996 would be adjourned. In fact, that was subject to an adjournment motion moved earlier by Senator Newman during this period of non-controversial legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my own part, I am happy to continue with the second reading debate, although I believe our convention is to engage in matters of non&hyphen;controversial legislation only when there is agreement around the chamber to do so. To be fair to all parties in the chamber, that is a convention that has nearly always been honoured. Clearly, we were given an inaccurate message by the government whip's office in relation to this matter. I state that fact to clarify the reason for Senator Margetts's concern and for the unusual quorum call during this period of non-controversial legislation today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I did take an unusual action a little while ago. The reason is that the last time I was able to get to a whips' meeting two nights ago&mdash;last night I was in the chamber when the whips' meeting took place&mdash;I made it as clear as possible that there was not yet agreement on this list of bills. It could not have been more clear. In fact, I stopped the meeting and said, `We have not agreed to this list of non-controversial bills. Senator Panizza, is what I have just said clear?' Having made that as clear as possible, I would have thought that somebody would have checked the list and got back to us. We were as busy as everybody else. There is no way anyone can say that this list was cleared with the Greens, because it was not. I did not say, `If we do not get back to you, it will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1428"> okay.' I said, `At this stage, these are not cleared; we need to check.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We apologise for the fact that we have been, as we often are, rushed off our feet by the volume of work, given the number of staff we have to do it. However, nobody checked with my office to see whether this list was okay. Therefore, when we rang and said, `We have problems with No. 8; could you please take it off the list?' I thought that the right thing would be done. I did not think I would come into the chamber and be told, `This is okay; it is just a second reading.' That was not what was agreed to. Whatever your arguments are for slotting in a second reading of what we believe to be highly controversial legislation at lunchtime, we do not think it is the appropriate place. Therefore, I request that this debate be adjourned and that we have proper time to consider this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to make a short statement to try to clarify some of these issues. I think there has been some confusion and I am not sure that it is necessarily anyone's fault. There may have been some misunderstanding because there are two housing bills. Just before coming in for the non&hyphen;controversial legislation, I had a discussion with someone from the whips' office who indicated that the government was happy to pull off the second reading debate on the Housing Assistance Bill. Senator Faulkner's adviser was with me at the time and he indicated, given that there were to be some amendments moved in the committee stage, that he was quite happy for that debate not to go on today, if that was generally agreed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I came in here on the understanding that the second reading debate on the Housing Assistance Bill 1996 was also to be pulled off today. I think there has been some confusion, a bit of toing&hyphen;and&hyphen;froing, because there are two housing bills. In terms of that debate, I do not think it is worth trying to pursue who said what to whom and why the misunderstanding occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I think there is a genuine problem from the Greens' perspective because there has been a bit of a misunderstanding in the last couple of days about whether that bill and the indigenous education bill ought to be allowed to be non&hyphen;controversial. Senator Margetts obviously had a different view from the opposition. While we are concerned that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this has occurred, I think there have been some misunderstandings with two bills having similar names and, from our point of view, Senator Faulkner has made his point about the second reading debate going on.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RC6">Senator WHEELWRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Alston, Minister for Communications and the Arts. I refer you to the Telstra bonds which are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange with a total value of over $2.6 billion. Can you confirm that there is a requirement under listing rule 3A(1) to provide the exchange with any information which might materially affect the value of those bonds as traded or that might influence an investor to buy or sell them? Can you further explain why no information has been given to the exchange on the proposal discussed by both you and the Prime Minister to set up Telstra in another company?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1430" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is probably no great surprise to Senator Wheelwright that I am not particularly familiar with the licensing requirements of 3A(1), or whatever else it might be. I will certainly seek advice on that. I am not aware of anyone having brought any particular concerns to my attention. I am sure you understand that at this stage of the game the ultimate way in which Telstra is privatised is very much a matter within the hands of this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who subscribe to Telstra bonds would have well understood the various <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> permutations and combinations that could flow down the track. Undoubtedly they would have understood&mdash;or they could be selling out right now&mdash;our policy which did not limit us to the legislative route, although that was always our preferred option. They would certainly have understood, and I would be very confident that they would take the view, that having a significant slice of private investment in Telstra would make a very significant positive difference to the value of the company. In no way would their investment in bonds be jeopardised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the senator well knows those bonds are underwritten by Telstra&mdash;if not the federal government&mdash;and on my understanding, although I will take further advice on this, unless the value of Telstra actually fell below the value of the bond, the value of their investment could not depreciate. They would always get the guaranteed interest payable and would be able to redeem their bonds when they fell due. The only time there would be a risk would be if the value of the company fell below the value of the bonds on issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think Senator Wheelwright is suggesting that on any stretch of the imagination Telstra could be worth less than $2 billion. I would have thought that all investors out there would be looking forward very much to a privatised Telstra. They would very much like you to do the right thing and allow it to happen, instead of filibustering in 11 regional centres around Australia and supposedly taking advice or evidence about a matter on which you have all made up your minds. In other words, this is a huge, costly and elaborate charade all of which is designed to reduce the value of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The investors out there know that whichever path we go down we will always do it in accordance with the law. At the time of issuing our policy we did not rule out going down the extraparliamentary route. The real answer is that it never occurred to you that we might, so you did not call on us to give any assurances prior to the election. We assumed in good faith that you would understand the overwhelming merits of the case and that you would be prepared&mdash;after a proper examination by a committee&mdash;to actually <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1431"> allow Australia to do what every other country in the western world has done&mdash;in other words, substantially increase the value of the dominant telecommunications carrier by allowing the injection of private capital, allowing ordinary Australians to take shares and allowing Telstra employees to get a return on their own labour input as well as having a direct stake in their own company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of those reasons, you will find that potential investors in Telstra&mdash;and I presume that does not include Senator Wheelwright&mdash;would want to see us proceed down the privatisation path by whatever legal means as quickly as possible. Therefore, it would not seem to me that there would be any concerns on that score. I will take advice on the matter and if I have anything further to add I will bring it back to the Senate.</PARA></ANSWER>

The only bad news that those mums and dads have had in recent weeks is that you lot are not prepared to do what anyone else around the world will tell you needs to be done in this case. This is simply designed to enhance the value of a major Australian asset. Senator Schacht thinks it is the biggest company in Australia. I hope he has learnt that it is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that they are very interested in having a direct stake. They would like an investment in the company. They want to be sure that their bonds are secure, and I have no doubt that they are.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that there is any legal obligation on us to notify whoever is notified in these circumstances&mdash;perhaps it is the Australian Stock Exchange&mdash;then we will obviously do that. If it is simply a matter of judgment about whether there is likely to be a depreciation in the value of Telstra as a result of our current proposals, then I can assure you we certainly do not take that view.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the March quarter figures show is that the economy is growing soundly. The government welcomed that yesterday on the release of the figures. But it is important to remember not to get too carried away with one quarter's figures, however welcome they may be. The number of factors that contributed to the strong growth of 1.8 per cent in the March quarter are unlikely to be maintained, as was acknowledged yesterday, and allowance has to be made for those when you are forecasting future growth in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out to the Senate that the trend rate of growth in the GDP in the March quarter was less than the trend growth in the preceding December quarter. In addition, as we pointed out yesterday, government revenue data for the March quarter is consistent with the Treasury budget forecast released by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1432"> Treasurer on 12 March. Senator Sherry said in this place yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 4.8 per cent growth rate . . . shoots one very big black hole in the black hole assertion we have heard coming from those opposite over the last three or four months.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me remind Senator Sherry and those opposite that they were responsible for not just one black hole but a veritable galaxy of black holes. In 1991&hyphen;92, the underlying deficit was $11.5 billion; in 1992&hyphen;93, it was $17 billion; in 1993&hyphen;94 it was $17.1 billion; and, in 1994&hyphen;95, it was $13.2 billion. All of those years were characterised by economic growth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite who seem to think this is a joke seem to think that one quarter of strong growth means that fiscal responsibility should be thrown out the window. For far too long in this country the living standards of Australians have suffered because of the fiscal vandalism of the previous government. We have been able to achieve some periods of solid and, at times, strong growth but we have always suffered from high deficits in our external accounts and amongst the highest interest rates in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

It provides further stark evidence of Labor's utter failure to ensure a healthy economy and an adequate level of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has put a carefully constructed medium&hyphen; term fiscal strategy in place because we have a major short&hyphen; and medium&hyphen;term problem with national savings. That is reflected in our internationally high interest rates and in our current account, which have constrained employment growth. As we know, it went above a million under Labor and is still stuck at 8&half; per cent. Those figures have constrained growth, they have pushed up interest rates and unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am fascinated to hear Senator Schacht say that he knows precisely what I am going to say, because if he did know that he would not be here today; he would be outside correcting this press release right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He starts off by calling on the coalition to ensure that Optus does not become a foreign controlled company. He ought to know that it cannot because of some changes that were put in place in 1995. Then he goes on, on three occasions, to say he is seeking an assurance that the government will not vary these rules and thereby guarantee maintaining <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1434"> Optus in majority Australian ownership. And twice more he goes on to talk on about ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that he has no idea of the difference between ownership and control&mdash;a pretty fundamental distinction in this whole debate. Ever since the 1991 and 1995 changes made therein, it is certainly possible to have more than 50 per cent foreign ownership&mdash;precisely because of your efforts!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just take you back to the history of this matter. Back in 1991 when you were a not so humble backbencher and Mr Beazley was actually the minister for communications, your government announced that the successful bidder for the second telecommunications carrier licence would have to have majority Australian ownership and that the potential bidder would be required to achieve majority Australian ownership within five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in fact, when Optus won the bid they had a structure that already delivered majority Australian ownership. Mr Beazley, who I take it is still the Leader of the Opposition, granted a licence which did not require the maintenance of a continuation of majority Australian ownership. In other words, a massive oversight&mdash;absolutely unforgivable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To compound that matter, the Treasurer then went ahead and granted FIRB approval on the same basis. In other words, without seeking any similar obligation for ongoing Australian majority ownership. That remained the position for four years. It was possible to have had majority foreign ownership from 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, when the government discovered this massive flaw in the course of preparations for the Optus float, what did they do? They were not game to come clean and change the rules. So, to create a bit of a smokescreen, they put in place some obligations to require Australian control but not ownership. In fact, they made it worse. They actually introduced a scheme that allowed you to have passive unrelated holdings of five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, indeed, ever since 1995 it has been possible to have up to 80 per cent foreign ownership in Optus as long as they acted in concert. That was the problem. You allowed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that to happen. You were the ones put in place a regime. And you seek an assurance that we will not vary these rules because you want to maintain Australian ownership. The fact is you put in place the rules that allow Australian ownership to be in a minority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand Senator Kernot's desperation in the sorts of scare campaigns we have about BT being a potential buyer for Telstra when she knows full well that they could not possibly, under our bill, buy any more than two per cent. As a strategic investor, a foreigner, they would be limited to 1.7 per cent of the total company and they clearly would not have a vote on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht's fundamental problem here is that he simply has not done his homework. He does not understand the difference between ownership and control. Why do you talk about ownership and control in different paragraphs of the same release? What were you on about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You want us to ensure that it does not become a foreign controlled company. It cannot; it cannot because of the rules. You want us to give you an assurance to maintain the status quo in relation to foreign ownership when that very status quo allows for it to happen&mdash;all your own work. This is outrageous.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very good question from Senator Troeth. The mining industry makes an enormous contribution not only to regional Australia but to the whole Australian community and to urban Australia&mdash;something that often does not get through to the people in urban Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just take some of the contributions made by that particular industry. Firstly, we could look at infrastructure. The mining <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1441"> industry provides roads, rail, ports, towns, communications, water, and so on, in a whole range of communities stretching right across Australia&mdash;and at no cost to the taxpayers of this country. Often on the tail of that flows a whole lot of other industries, whether they be manufacturing industries associated with mining or tourists in tourism industries themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry directly employs 86,000 people in Australia, which is 1.1 per cent of the work force, and it generates 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product. From the urban point of view, it is interesting to note that something like 300,000 people are indirectly employed through the mining industry's efforts. Most of these would be in urban areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry now exports some $36 billion worth of exports, which makes it the largest exporter in Australia&mdash;35 per cent of total exports and 46 per cent of merchandise exports, a massive contribution. With regard to the mining industry's direct contribution to the Australian economy by way of direct company taxation, it gives about $1.3 billion. That does not include PAYE taxes through the direct or indirect system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry makes a contribution to the states in the order of $800 million in royalties, and that does not include the petroleum resource rent tax. It is the only industry, I would have to say, that makes those sorts of contributions to the states. No other industry does that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our major export industry is the coal industry, as Senator Hill referred to previously. It exports about $8 billion worth of coal. That is notwithstanding the treacherous action of one Bill Kelty, the secretary of the ACTU, who represents the industrial arm of the Australian Labor Party. He attempted to undermine the exports of that industry in his infamous letter to a major coal buyer earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing worth pointing out, and the Senate should note this, is that the Industry Commission, in its report in February 1991&mdash;after eight years of Labor government&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current government&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

They obtained a degree of credibility in Australia because the source of their forecast&mdash;it was never hard economic statistics; it was a forecast, and all forecasts are susceptible to change&mdash;was the Australian Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way in which you can assess how the economy is going, broadly, is by going to the national accounts every quarter. The national accounts for the March quarter were the national accounts for the last quarter of the Labor government. Therefore they were the accounts that we, while in government, delivered to this country. They show a growth rate of 4.8 per cent for the Australian economy. That is a very high growth rate. It will ensure that the economy finds work for every school leaver and sops up the level of unemployment. Yesterday Senator Short acknowledged that this was a very good figure. It blows the cover story that there is an $8 billion black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that it was referred to on the AAP wire yesterday as the mythical black hole. Also, I notice that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> today there was the headline `Illusory black hole'. Even the economic commentators and reporters have pricked the balloon of the government's contempt for Australia in its trying to pull a swiftie and pretending that the economy of Australia is in dire straits. It is not. It is growing faster than most of the economies in the Western world and it is healthier and more robust than most of the economies in the Western world. If you were to embark on the cost cutting spree that this government now has set its sights on doing, you would withdraw public sector investment from the economy and bring on a minor recession in Australia which would put more people on the unemployment list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did we get from the government today; any acknowledgment of that? Of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1447"> course not. We got a story&mdash;more of the same; the bad medicine, the harsh medicine, must continue. This flies in the face of what respected forecasting agencies and economic commentators are saying. Let me quote professors John Nevile and Fred Gruen and Mr Fred Argy. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 20 May, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the figure of $8 billion is itself not a firm figure.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we have been saying. They go on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a Treasury forecast assuming no policy changes and a rate of growth of the economy of 3.25 per cent . . . a small difference in the assumed rate of economic growth can make a large difference in the size of the projected deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>The assumption was 3.25 per cent. What did we get? We got 4.8 per cent&mdash;a big difference. Therefore, even in your wildest of fantasies that $8 billion black hole does not exist. Education cuts ought not continue. Welfare cuts should not go ahead. Higher education should not be put back. People in the environment should not be disadvantaged by having their programs cut. Business programs that stimulate investment and create jobs in this country should not be cut back. All of those sectors and everyone else affected by your cuts should stand up to this government now and say, `Don't proceed. What you're propounding is a lie. The deficit is not there. There is no need for this type of approach.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The so-called $8 billion black hole was a calculation by Treasury at a point in time. Under prudent financial management every Australian would expect an improvement in Australia's financial position over time. It is very interesting that this confidence is beginning to return to Australia under the new government. Apparently this is a confidence that the Labor Party is somewhat embarrassed about. The nature of the questioning in recent days does suggest this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at a number of favourable statistics and trends. One degree of confidence that particularly overseas investors have in Australia is perhaps reflected in some of the exchange rate figures. For example, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strengthening in the value of the Australian dollar in relation to the American dollar, indicates a high degree of strengthening and confidence in Australia by people overseas. This is something that has occurred in the period since the coalition came to power. It is not a figure that is three, six or eight months old; it is something that has happened since the coalition came to power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy for the Australian taxpayer is that the previous Minister for Finance failed to indicate the full extent of the deficit. In proper fashion, on coming to government, the first thing the coalition had to do was to audit the books to see the true extent of that deficit and to take appropriate corrective measures to bring the future budgets back into balance for fiscal rectitude and to protect inflation from getting out of control. That was an entirely responsible action by this new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government has a great responsibility in turning around what has been referred to as the chronic deficiency in domestic savings. A major way of doing this is to return the budget from chronic deficit to surplus. This single act will have a tremendous impact in improving the savings level in Australia. For example, the previous government took credit for every ray of sunshine, in terms of income, and then spent the proceeds almost immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A financially correct approach is to accumulate each of these gains progressively until a surplus is achieved. Over time, with prudent financial management, this responsible National-Liberal Party coalition will return the economy to surplus, improve the level of savings and make secure the retirement incomes of all those Australians including those who now have over $240 billion for future superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thrust of the questioning unfortunately appears to indicate that every bit of good news in terms of extra income should be spent at the earliest possible opportunity as was the past practice, rather than saved to reduce the deficit. I certainly hope that in the coming months we will see a more responsible attitude taken by members of the Australian Labor Party currently sitting opposite <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1448"> as the $8 billion black hole is diminished and a budget surplus is achieved..</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Herron obfuscated and implied quite erroneously that the delay by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in honouring his commitment to the changes to and increase in funds of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 was in some way due to the cut-off motion and some degree of obstruction on this side of the chamber.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, recently met with the board of management of Kakadu National Park. At that meeting&mdash;he was accompanied by Senator Parer&mdash;the future management of the park was raised not surprisingly with Senator Hill by the Aboriginal traditional owners.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paper lays out the position very succinctly, as papers from the Parliamentary Library normally do. The parks are leased back to the Commonwealth government for 99 years. The parks are on Aboriginal owned land by virtue of a grant in freehold title to the relevant Aboriginal land trust under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. These 99-year leases specifically include provision for joint management of the parks by the Aboriginal owners and the Commonwealth parks service. Clause 9(b) of the lease agreement with the Commonwealth agrees not to transfer, assign, sublet or part with the possession of the park or any part of the park without the consent in writing of the lessor of the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer that in a minute. A number of other clauses are enshrined in the lease to ensure against the enactment of any act or regulations that could substantially be detrimental to the interests of the owners&mdash;that is, the Aboriginal people. Any such action could be seen as a breach of a legally binding agreement by the Commonwealth, and would expose the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1450"> Commonwealth to a substantial claim of damages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paper concluded that persuasion and coercion would be the more likely tactics to succeed in any alliance between the Commonwealth and the territory government to transfer management against the wishes of the owners. The reason I raise that is that the paper&mdash;it is an excellent paper on the legal position regarding Kakadu&mdash;makes it very clear that the most obvious way this would be done would be through a decline in budget funding for the park. I am assured by the statements made by the Minister for the Environment that there is no hidden agenda, and that that will not be the result in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Campbell, in response to your interjection, we had thought of coming in here today and asking Senator Hill a question on these issues. But, on reconsideration, we decided that we would direct the question instead to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was genuinely surprised that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, on an issue this significant&mdash;it got lots of publicity in the Northern Territory, let me tell you&mdash;was completely unaware of the assurances that his colleague had given to the Aboriginal traditional owners of the park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are important matters. We were interested in hearing a response from Senator Hill, but it was decided to ask the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs if he was aware of these widely publicised matters in order to find out just how much importance the government places on the Aboriginal affairs implications of this major issue. Judging by the performance of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs here in Senate question time today, the answer is: very little.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry requested, and the Senate so ordered, on 22 May that there be laid on the table by no later than 4 p.m. today all documents prepared by the Department of the Treasury and the Depart <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1451"> ment of Finance, including since 2 March, regarding their analyses of the costing of the coalition's election commitments encompassing both spending and saving commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated to the Senate at the time that the motion was debated, in matters such as this the government wants to cooperate wherever it is proper and reasonable to do so in providing documents which are appropriate to be in the public domain. Such an approach is consistent with the government's strong commitment to open and accountable government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Our commitment in this regard is evidenced by our intention to establish a charter of budget honesty to increase the accountability and public scrutiny of government fiscal policy. That charter will provide a legislative framework which will ensure that governments are more accountable by increasing the quality of publicly available information on fiscal policies through the imposition of regular reporting requirements on a range of fiscal measures. The charter will prevent the re-occurrence of Labor's outrageous tactic of not releasing updated budget figures in the run&hyphen;up to an election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let there be no doubt that we are keen to see open and honest government. It is in this spirit that I table a large number of documents today. These documents have been identified by the departments of Treasury and Finance as being covered by Senator Sherry's motion. They relate to the costings of both the coalition's spending and savings commitments. The documents have been prepared by senior officers of the departments and other agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The documents include material prepared for internal information, responses to requests for costings of the coalition's election commitments from the offices of the ministers of the previous government, and requests from the departments of Treasury and Finance for information from other agencies. Taken together, they will amount to over 150 pages of information pertinent to Senator Sherry's request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I also pointed out when we debated Senator Sherry's motion, there are documents which will not be released. I have decided on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> behalf of the government not to release these documents because the potential damage to the effective operation of government by their release outweighs any public interest in their release. These documents are cabinet documents and budget related material. I would expect that Senator Sherry and the opposition more generally would agree with me that the release of such material would not be in the public interest. As former Senator Gareth Evans said on another occasion in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is . . . perfectly understood and accepted that there are legitimate grounds for non&hyphen;disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA>The protection of cabinet and related documents from public release is well established. Of course, there is a very close link between cabinet papers and budget material, with much of the budget related material being prepared as the necessary groundwork for the development of the cabinet documents themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the release of budget material prior to the budget would compromise the government's ability to deliver a coordinated and complete fiscal policy. It could also disrupt financial and product markets by creating possibly false expectations about future decisions affecting such matters as prices, interest rates and the like. Release could also encourage groups to influence the budget process in ways which could be detrimental to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Release of budget material is clearly inappropriate. It is a principle which the former Labor government stood by. I can see no justifiable reason, either for them or for this government, to move away from it now. As former Senator McMullan said in this place in relation to the release of government documents:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very important that we . . . make responsible decisions with a long term view rather than irresponsible decisions in the fervent hope that some short term benefit may flow.</PARA>
<PARA>The withholding of budget related material clearly falls within the ambit of such a statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I point out that I will not be tabling deliberative documents dealt with by certain ministers of the former government. As I made clear during the debate on Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1452"> Sherry's motion some days ago, under longstanding conventions the current government is not privy to these documents. Former ministers, of course, have a right to access these documents under the Archives Act. It would be a matter for them to decide, first of all, whether to access them and, secondly, what they might wish to do with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me emphasise once again that the government is more than willing to provide the Senate with documents that can be released in the light of longstanding convention and principle in this place. I must say that that is much more than the previous government was prepared to do on many occasions in recent years. In that respect I would like to quote my colleague Senator Alston when he had asked for some documents in relation to the media and foreign ownership and received no more than a Foreign Investment Review Board document which was already in the public arena. He said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that the government has no justification for withholding those documents. . .</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the heavy suspicion has always been that the government's decisions were motivated by political considerations rather than legal or national interest considerations. Senator Evans has come in here and confirmed that. For all his supposed ability of fast footwork, he has not even had the guile to disguise this as anything other than a matter of politics.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the attitude of Labor on public disclosure is well known, the most notable cover&hyphen;up in recent times being the repeated claims by the then Finance Minister and now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, that the budget was in surplus and would continue to be in surplus, when he knew perfectly well that that was not the case. It is an incredible irony that the opposition should only now be so interested in the costings that can be prepared by Treasury and the Department of Finance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was saying before those points of order were taken that it is incredible that the opposition should only now be so interested in the costings that can be prepared by Treasury and the Department of Finance. When the resources for such costings were available to them as a government they chose instead to shut their eyes and pretend that that information was not available because they did not want to see the stark reality of the fiscal black hole that their ineptitude had created. I could hardly put it better than Prime Minister Howard who, in response to the first question that he received as Prime Minister, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You had all the resources of the Treasury and the Department of Finance at your disposal, but what did you do? You chose to close your eyes. You chose not to ask the question. Every time you told the Australian people the information was not available, you knew that was wrong. Every time you told the Australian people that it was too hard to get it together, you knew that that was deceit.</PARA>
<PARA>As I say, I could not put it any more clearly than was put in that way by the Prime Minister. We have not and will not be party to such a deception. We have a clear aim to be open and accountable to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I reiterate that, in good faith and in accordance with longstanding convention, I table these documents today. The task would have been substantially less costly to the taxpayer had Senator Sherry been prepared to recognise those conventions in the framing of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1453"> his motion&mdash;a matter that I took up with him at some length prior to the motion being made formal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do we need these documents? We believe that the government is embarking on a campaign of gross deceit of the Australian people. It has largely been exposed in a number of ways, but particularly by the release yesterday of the national growth figure of 4.8 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank you for the documents you have tabled today. But I do note your excuses for failing to table other documents. It is not an exact quote, but in releasing some of the material you said that it `may compromise a coordinated approach to the budget. It may pressure or force interest groups to attempt to influence the budget outcome.' What has the National Farmers Federation been doing? That is not an exact quote, Senator Short, but it is as close as I could note of what you said without the availability of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. You also said, `Or the effective operation of the government may be somewhat thwarted and that is not in the public interest.' As a Senate, certainly as an opposition, we will be putting forward our view of your meaning of those particular words.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do believe in open and accountable government. You have talked considerably about your charter of budget honesty.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Australian Government must put in place domestic policies consistent with this position.</PARA>
<PARA>Before beginning, could I say that, thanks to other business taking some 20 minutes of our time, we may need to make some adjustments to those speaking times. Therefore, I will try to be a little briefer than I had planned to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at why this is urgent, we are aware that in July this year the ministerial conference will be held in Geneva and that we will be making some major decisions in this area. In particular, this government will be meeting between now and when we resume in a fortnight's time to decide Australia's position <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at this conference. It is a matter of national importance. I would go so far as to say that it is about time we started actually meeting our international obligations under the framework on climate change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most senators, hopefully all senators, would be aware of the rather unfortunate position that the Australian government took last year to the conference in Berlin. Indeed, the former ALP government was responsible for a set of policies which will ensure that, in fact, we do not meet the targets that were set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government set such a low benchmark in this area that there are no domestic mandatory requirements. It also failed to institute a number of `no regrets' measures&mdash;measures such as mandatory building codes or emission controls. This weak position came about as a direct result of very intense lobbying by some sectors of industry. I stress here that it was as a result of only some but, in particular, they were some of the high emission industries and also the coal industry. This has ensured that Australia is the worst per capita offender when we assess the emissions of greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember when first the concept of `greenhouse' was put not just before the Australian parliament but before the Australian people, prior to the whole issue becoming a part of the public debate, that there were a lot of people who were very sceptical and, indeed, people who denied the existence of any such phenomenon. But I think, if we surveyed the Australian public today, we would find that very few now question the fact that our climate is changing; very few would question the concept of greenhouse and the greenhouse effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the debate has now moved on from accepting that there is a problem and trying to figure out how bad it could be to what we should be doing about it. Indeed, every parliament and every parliamentarian in the world should take some responsibility for international moves to mitigate the effect of climate change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dangerous Interference with the Climate System: Implications of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</EMPHASIS> gives us critical information. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1455"> meeting of 2,500 climate experts and scientists world wide had some unprecedented conclusions which, hopefully, all of us must take with some seriousness. I will just list a couple, quoting from their paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the growth in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, interference with the climate system will grow in magnitude and the likelihood of adverse impacts from climate change that could be judged dangerous will become greater . . . the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate . . . in all cases the average rate of warming would probably be greater than any seen in the last 10,000 years . . . there will be likely reductions in biological diversity . . . entire forest types may disappear . . . some forests are likely to undergo irregular and large scale losses of living trees . . . some species could become extinct . . . there may be increased risk of hunger and famine in some locations, many of the worlds poorest people are most at risk of increased hunger . . . Climate Change is likely to have wide ranging and mostly adverse effect on human health, with significant loss of life . . . it can have a number of negative impacts on energy, industry, transportation infrastructure; human settlement; the property insurance industry; tourism and cultural systems and values.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, there is the sobering point that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . additionally there is a danger that entire unique cultures may be obliterated . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, what is important is that the report says&mdash;and this is why we who are here in the Senate should be discussing this today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . significant reductions in greenhouse gases are technically possible and can be economically feasible.</PARA>
<PARA>Note those words: it is possible, it is technically possible to make a difference, and it certainly is economically feasible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But unfortunately in Australia all this is faltering for lack of political will. There are just a few intransigent countries with relation to greenhouse, and Australia has the dubious honour of being the most intransigent of all OECD countries. Indeed, looking at what is happening in the Third World, we see many of the developing countries taking a far more responsible stand than we are. Just looking at what is happening in Colombia, I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International Environment Reporter</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Colombian minister of environment has proposed imposing a "green tax" on any rural land <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> owner who does not maintain a forest cover on a certain proportion of the land.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not suggesting that we would impose such a tax on our farmers, but wouldn't it be nice if they got additional incentives for either maintaining existing vegetation or replanting. Yet, one of the most significant parts of this government's environmental comments is that it is talking about tying these types of packages to the sale of Telstra, instead of proceeding to support our farmers and land&hyphen;holders who are increasing their plantings and their efforts in the area of revegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But perhaps the greatest problem for Australia now, as we move into the next round of international meetings, is that the United States looks like leaving us well behind. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 15 May:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">American State Department officials have privately warned the Howard Government that the US is moving rapidly to take a tougher, greener position on international efforts to curb emissions of greenhouse gases, the cause of global climate change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But while America's historic shift would dramatically improve the chances of effective global action to protect the world's climate, it would leave Australia's diplomatic strategy stranded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia would have lost support from its most powerful traditional ally and be left in the company of other fossil&hyphen;fuel&hyphen;rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which are seen internationally as hostile to tough greenhouse action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is particularly vulnerable to international pressure to change its stance because of its high greenhouse gas emissions per person and steady opposition to firm action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">America's shift has been driven by the latest evidence on the greenhouse effect, which predicts that build&hyphen;up in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases&mdash;carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide&mdash;from burning oil, coal and gas will cause a dangerous shift in the world's climate.</PARA>
<PARA>So we are becoming more and more isolated from countries that we would have considered to be our friends and our supporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for economic feasibility, I would argue that there is an enormous potential for us to develop alternate technologies&mdash;and solar technology is just one of those. Indeed, if this government wanted to take a lead, it now could be actively encouraging the use of solar <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1456"> technology here in Australia. There is wind energy, as yet another technology unfortunately that could have well been lost. A lot of our innovations have now been taken on by countries in Europe because previous governments failed to support Australian inventions and new technology. There are a range of measures being taken to reduce emissions. If Australia was to pioneer some of the technology that is gradually developing in this area, we could not only use it here but also, in particular, export that technology to Third World nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is imperative that the Senate debates this matter today, particularly in light of the answer of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) at question time which was basically a no&hyphen;change strategy. He again looked at the couple of very outspoken industries which are determined we do not improve but continue to pollute. They believe that Australia should maintain the status quo. Hopefully at the conference in Geneva we will see a change on Australia's part and at last we will support legally binding greenhouse pollution reduction targets. Australia will actually be setting emission targets and ensuring that they are set at such a level to avoid the dangerous impacts of climate change that I have mentioned today. In particular, any strategy developed for the provision of large scale transfer will make sure that we make the best of Australian technology and we export that to developing countries. Finally, Australia must put in place domestic policies consistent with our international stance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I will not table it. He said that it is the view of the government that climate change remains a critical global <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> challenge&mdash;which it clearly does&mdash;and that Australia remains committed to fulfilling its obligations under the framework convention. He said that we are contributing to limiting our emissions of greenhouse gases through the national greenhouse response strategy with industries' positive participation. He said that the greenhouse challenge program provides companies with the opportunity to show that they are taking practical steps to limit emissions, but that an effective long&hyphen;term response to climate change will need to be global, involving all countries. He made mention of the fact that, while developed countries have agreed to take the lead, by the year 2000 developing countries are expected to be emitting more than half of the world's CO2 emissions, and that they too will have to contribute in the longer term. The forthcoming Berlin mandate negotiation should keep the door open for this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, he said that the government will campaign for an approach that ensures that all countries share equitably the burden of addressing what is a truly global problem. The government will insist that Australia's economic and trade interests are safeguarded and that our specific national circumstances are taken into account when implementing the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically that was what I said in answer to a question today from Senator Lees. The issue of global warming and climate change is obviously one of concern to the whole community. The balance of scientific advice is in fact that human intervention is resulting for the first time in climate change and the total consequences of that are not fully understood. Furthermore, I made mention of the difficulty in remedying the situation, the fact that the CO2 emissions caught in the atmosphere are cumulative and therefore the wisdom of caution in this important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It follows logically that all nation states should be seeking to address the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and doing what can reasonably be done to reduce those emissions. An interesting aspect of this debate is that we are not addressing any detrimental consequence in immediate terms, and perhaps not even in the medium term, but when we look <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1457"> a century down the track the generations of that time may well suffer as a result of us not taking this issue sufficiently seriously at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the way that the Australian government is approaching this matter. We accept the Berlin mandate and we will continue to pursue the negotiations from that. We will pursue them at the conference of the parties to be held in Geneva in July, through to the following conference at which protocol is supposed to be concluded some time in the second half of next year. As we address exactly what developed countries should do, we also want to include the issue of developing countries. I know that is criticised by some who say that it is important that the developed world shows the lead. I accept that it is important that the developed world shows the lead, but it is also important to recognise that some of the large developing economies are in fact contributing disproportionately to the growing greenhouse problem. It is important that the developing world accepts that this is not a problem solely of the developed world and is prepared to be part of the solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we address what is the appropriate international regime for this, it is also important&mdash;and the only responsible position for an Australian government to take&mdash;to recognise that we should not do so in a way that disproportionately and detrimentally affects us. I know there are some who do not take that issue into account, but we, as an incoming government, do regard Australia's international competitiveness as vitally important and we recognise, more so than most, that our economy is dependent upon high carbon reducing products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are, as I said in question time today, the largest coal exporter in the world. We might not be the largest producer, but we are the largest coal exporter in the world. We are, at this stage, still very reliant upon high carbon fuels for energy production. In a part of the world that is becoming ever more competitive and with a need to address major economic problems, which have evidenced simply today in terms of the balance of payments figures that have been released, it is vitally important <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we do not, in a spirit of international leadership, pull the rug from under our own feet. I would ask those who, in altruistic spirit, feel that Australia should, in fact, show international leadership that they also remember Australians who are dependent upon a growing economy in this country and an internationally competitive growing economy for jobs, for social security and all the other benefits that wealth creation can provide for the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, I think that that is the point that the Australian Democrats all too often forget; certainly this is an issue, and certainly Australia has a part to play. Nevertheless, as we have a part to play we must also recognise that we have particular economic circumstances that should be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can do that, in my opinion, while still acting in a responsible way and the reference by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to these cooperative agreements with industry is just one of those initiatives. I am pleased that a number of major Australian companies will be signing on to the challenge program in the very near future; in fact their achievements to date have been very significant and Australian companies are, without compulsion, showing a lead and going out there and setting an example. It seems to be starting principally with the larger companies but no doubt is setting an example for smaller Australian companies. I think that is to be applauded and is something to be recognised in this whole debate. As the community become better educated as to this problem and the solutions, I think you will find a community response that is much more conscious of the need for us to act responsibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, in my very short time, I just want to remind the Australian Democrats that the worst thing that they could do in this debate is vote down the coalition's natural heritage trust that is going to commit a huge sum of money to revegetation&mdash;something that can positively contribute to a better outcome&mdash;and yet they vote that down and have the hypocrisy to come in here and bring a motion such as this. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the comments that have been made by both Senator Lees and Senator Hill that this obviously is one of the very important issues that we face in this country and also face in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to say in my contribution that I will be in fact defending the record of the previous Labor government which is questioned in this urgency motion that has been moved by Senator Lees today. I do not accept the allegation that has been made in this urgency motion that our record on this particular issue was characterised by a lack of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance, the Labor government, and certainly myself in a previous life as federal environment minister, always acknowledged that there is no greater environmental concern, no greater global environmental challenge, than the issue and threat of climate change. We recognised the impact that climate change resulting from the greenhouse effect would have on the environment in this country and of course on the global environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also well aware of the potentially significant impacts on the Australian economy and our approach and our actions on greenhouse always reflected those fundamental understandings, as did our strong and consistent participation in the international efforts to solve this particular problem. In the national greenhouse response strategy, Australia adopted an interim planning target which effectively acts as a yardstick against which the implementation of our greenhouse response can be assessed. It provided a focus for action in Australia and it established a context in which future planning could be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The former Labor government, in fact, did adopt a phased response to the greenhouse issue, and the first phase of that response was the national greenhouse response strategy. That was a strategy that was adopted by all state and territory governments under the leadership of the Commonwealth government in December 1992. Of course, that strategy did concentrate on the so&hyphen;called no regrets response measures&mdash;that is, omission reduc tion measures that have net benefits or at least have no net cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These initial measures included a number of insurance measures to reduce uncertainty about climate change impacts. It included studies and research for which the government provided quite a significant amount of funding. But we also, always, in relation to the greenhouse issue, accepted the principle that it was important to involve that wide range of interests in the community in the development of our greenhouse response strategy. In order to involve all the stakeholders, some of whom have quite disparate views on this particular issue, we established the national greenhouse advisory panel. The panel included the key stakeholder groups such as the National Farmers Federation, Greenpeace, the Business Council of Australia, the ACF, the Institute of Engineers, the Energy Supply Association of Australia, the Australian Gas Association, ACA&mdash;the Australian Consumers Association&mdash;and, of course, the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That panel did, I think, underpin our approach and we maintained a very strong consultative framework in relation to the greenhouse issue. We identified the need to concentrate our attention on energy production and distribution because of the very significant contributions to greenhouse gas emissions in this country from the energy sector. We placed an emphasis on an integrated least&hyphen;cost approach to energy planning and on the importance of energy pricing better reflecting economic, social and environmental costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promoted, very strongly, greater use of renewable energy resources. We identified the importance of minimum energy performance standards for appliances and equipment in the household and also in industrial and commercial sectors. We identified the importance of fuel efficiency, an improvement in new motor vehicles. I believe that the former government's approach was an integrated one and it was a responsible one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important aspect of our approach was to involve all levels of government. As I said, the national greenhouse response strategy was agreed by all state and territory governments and by the Australian Local <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1459"> Government Association. We took steps to precisely measure and assess what were the sources of greenhouse gas emissions in this country, and, of course, the impact of particular sectors on the production of emissions. We did this through Australia's greenhouse gas inventory, which I first released in September of 1994. There was a view right throughout the international community that Australia's efforts in relation to the measurement of our emissions was second to none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well recall a meeting I had with Dr Merkel, the German environment minister&mdash;one has to give credit to Germany as being one of the leaders in this field&mdash;when she said to me that she was very keen to be apprised of this science, which was at the cutting edge in the international experience, and of the work of our National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Committee. Certainly, when I was the environment minister, I made much of this work, and the approach of our Greenhouse Gas Inventory Committee, available to Dr Merkel and others who had an interest in the approach Australia was taking. We were very honest and very forthright in the international community about the challenges we faced with greenhouse in this country. I genuinely believe that that is going to hold us in very good stead in the long term in the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also very helpful to have the inventory because it was useful for us in terms of identifying the need for Australia to develop a set of additional response measures. The inventory identified that about half our total emissions came from the energy sector, making that the largest contribution to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. It also identified that Australia's emissions were projected to grow by 82 megatons between 1990 and the year 2000. Of those, 66 megatons were expected from a growth in emissions in the energy sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that inventory, based on the best science in the world, and using the best expertise in the world, provided the basis for the then government to review its response and to introduce further measures, which it did with the greenhouse 21C package that was announced in March of last year, prior to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> first conference of the parties on the framework convention of climate change. Combined with the previous measures in place, through the national greenhouse response strategy, that meant that the estimated growth in emissions between 1990 and the year 2000 would be around three per cent, much closer to our target of stabilisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inventory process which the Labor government put in place provides the basis for Australia to measure its progress towards national and international emission reduction goals. I think the government responded very appropriately to the first inventory report and I will be very interested, along with Senator Hill and many others, to read the second inventory report, which will give the new government a capacity to assess Australia's progress and consider what further measures might be necessary. I, along with so many others, await both the inventory and the response to the inventory with some interest. I point out the strong commitment the Labor government had to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. I think the wording of this urgency motion is rather unfortunate in that it does not give credit for the achievements that were made over recent years in relation to this very important issue in the public arena. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The greenhouse effect and climate change are, combined, one of the gravest threats facing humanity. Greenhouse may irrevocably change our atmospheric systems and weather patterns, creating a whole suite of knock&hyphen;on effects: rising sea levels; changes to landscape and land habitability; changes to food crops; an increased spread of disease, especially tropical pathogens that thrive in wet, hot climates; an increase in weather extremes such as floods, hurricanes and droughts; and mass extinctions. A rise in the average global temperature of 0.3 per cent per decade is predicted if current production trends for greenhouse gases&mdash;carbon dioxide, CFC, methane and nitrous oxide&mdash;continue to a two per cent mean increase by the year 2100.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would a greenhouse warmed world be like? Before we make a decision on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1460"> Australia's position on greenhouse measures at the COP&mdash;conference of parties&mdash;conference, let us do a bit of projection. In a world where average global temperature has risen by up to two per cent, the planetary resources we take for granted will be dramatically altered. Lakes will shrink or dry up, water supplies will be dramatically altered, streams and aquifers will disappear. The current crisis facing the Snowy River won't even compare with the massive scale of alteration to the world's water systems. Populations will have to move to where water is available&mdash;if it is available at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forest cover would be changed, or significantly reduced, even more than has already been effected by humans. At a migration rate, through the slow growth of new trees along forest edges where seeds fall, of 900 metres per year, most forest belts won't move fast enough to avoid being wiped out. If climate belts move faster than this, or migration is blocked by cities and other human barriers, entire forests of deciduous trees could die out and release carbon dioxide as they decompose. This large&hyphen;scale forest loss would be accompanied by a concomitant biodiversity extinction. Fish would die in warmer streams and pesticides would concentrate in the lower water level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we compare the last 10,000 years of human habitation of the planet since the agricultural revolution to a minute of real time, this havoc will have been wreaked by a single species, us, in only three seconds of that minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the midst of the alarming predictions I have just shared with you, and in opposition to most of the OECD's determined action to prevent those predictions, Australia has the highest level of greenhouse gas emissions per capita of the industrialised world. Australia's position on reducing these levels in domestic and international fora is inadequate in the extreme. The IPCC has stated that carbon dioxide cuts of 60 to 80 per cent are needed to stabilise global warming, yet we did not support legally binding targets for emissions at the ad hoc group on the Berlin mandate negotiations. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We alone in the member nations proposed a non&hyphen;legally binding outcome for other major initiatives. Australia was perceived to be not just a laughing stock but a disgrace. All other OECD countries have reduced their emissions by 12 to 17 per cent against the baseline standard; Japan by 25 per cent. We have increased ours by one per cent. The hypocrisy within this stance is obvious. Ready to be a vocal supporter of the protests of the Pacific Islands against French nuclear testing, we show a scathing indifference to the tragedy that faces those island nations under climate change. I use that term of phrase intentionally. Projected sea level rise could submerge some 80 per cent of the land of the Majuro Atoll in the Pacific, and many of these islands will be dramatically altered, if not rendered uninhabitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The urgency motion just moved in this place outlines a clear and decisive way in which this government can save the future for the next generation. This generation is very likely to be the last generation that can do it. We have a responsibility to act and to achieve credibility in proposing the necessary measures. In order to do that, Australia must have an equivalent domestic position in line with the following commitments: a legislative framework for climate policy, including domestic implementation of the framework convention on climate change; legislative and budgetary support for effective limitations on further land clearing; increased urban planning and budgetary measures that reflect a lessened dependence on the private car and a high emphasis on public transport; a commitment to increased fuel efficiency for motor vehicles; and revision of the national electricity market code to remove discrimination against energy efficiency and renewable energy. We need to clear our record up considerably. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on this issue because I find it a very important one. I am concerned about the ground swell of feeling being expressed by students and academics on the imminent slashing by the Liberal coalition of higher education funding in our Australian universities. Australian newspapers are awash with the concerns of students and vice&hyphen;chancellors since the infamous comments by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Senator Vanstone, at a briefing dinner recently. The tactless and inflammatory <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1462"> manner in which the minister has dealt with the issue of higher education, exemplified by her flippant comments at the briefing dinner with vice&hyphen;chancellors, is indicative of a minister that is intent on riding roughshod without understanding the full implications of what some vice&hyphen;chancellors envisage could result in the closure of some universities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is at a time when enrolments at universities are up by 40,000. This is a crucial period in higher education. We can do without cuts for the sake of cuts. It would be a travesty to think that young people setting out on career paths could now be frustrated and impeded because of an ideological bent. Where do the government's priorities lie when the goodwill that was developed between young people prior to the election is now cast aside? There is no doubt that many young people voted for the coalition because of the unequivocal statements that operational grants to universities would be maintained and additional funds would be pumped into research and postgraduate scholarships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has now welshed on those undertakings to young people by floating these proposed cuts. A 12 per cent cut across the board would relate to 50,000 fewer university places. The national academics forum has stated it believed that the coalition government would be its knight in shining armour but has now discovered that they are wolves in sheep's clothing. Academics may have been a little too naive and a little too trusting, but now the truth is coming home to all and sundry. Prior to the election, academic staff were concerned with salary increases. They are now concerned about their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of Tasmania, students are marching in the street. They have sat in the office of Senator Abetz and are calling for the resignation of the minister. This is occurring, of course, all over Australia. I recall reading in the local press in Tasmania that the minister will wear education cuts like a crown of thorns. What a spiky crown it will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been more irksome for the students has been the cavalier approach by the minister. Students have found the minister's approach to be offensive and demonstrating a lack of knowledge and commitment. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Lord Mayor of Hobart has weighed into the debate by describing proposed cuts as disastrous for the local Tasmanian economy. Mayor Kennedy said that poor retention rates of young people in Tasmania had caused considerable concern for several years and that any reduction in educational opportunities would exacerbate the problem. The Tasmanian council of state school parents and friends is quoted as saying that the federal government were pursuing the wrong agenda on education. The council called for an increase in funds and not a decrease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we forget in this whole issue is that the budget cuts will affect what some say is our most vital resource&mdash;our young, up&hyphen;and&hyphen;coming generation, those with the best and brightest minds. I concur with the views of the Tasmanian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> newspaper when the editor said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this magnificent resource&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the University of Tasmania&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">cannot be maintained, then we risk having our best ideas exported.</PARA>
<PARA>I concede that Tasmania will not get far if it seeks exemption from the proposed federal cuts on the basis of geographical grounds alone. In this day and age, for example, with information technology advances, many barriers have been removed. In my view, in areas of funding cuts to higher education we are talking about the possibility of losing further young Tasmanians to the Australian mainland simply because our only university will not continue to be attractive to them in particular disciplines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our young people leave the island and they do not return. We have many examples of young people leaving Tasmania and not returning. The one major attraction that keeps our top young achievers in this state must come down to the existence of the University of Tasmania and the high quality of education it has been able to provide in the past. The current level of education would be jeopardised and approximately 135 university staff would lose their jobs if a 10 per cent cut were imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1463"> We heard last week from my fellow Tasmanian, Senator Mackay. She gave an excel lent summary of various research programs and disciplines and of the highest esteem in which the university is held both nationally and internationally. I do not propose to dwell on what the senator said, except to add a few additional comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received a newsletter the other day from the Tasmanian Minerals Council and in it I read a very positive article about the inaugural south-east region Australian student mineral venture that was held in Tasmania. It was judged to be an outstanding success. Twenty-four students from years 10 to 11 from across Australia spent 13 days in an intensive introduction to the minerals industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summer school was conducted by the Key Centre for Ore Deposits and Exploration Studies at the university. It was so successful that the university has won the right to run a similar school next year for 44 students. What concerns me is that ventures such as this in which the university has had an involvement now could be jeopardised if the proposed cuts eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do fear that cuts of any magnitude to the University of Tasmania will mark the beginning of the end of quality education in medicine. I do have real fears that cuts would severely disadvantage the medical school, which has in the past only just survived. In my home region of the north-west coast of Tasmania I fear that the proposed cuts will damage the availability of, and increase costs for, distance education. My area has one of the lowest rates in Australia of people going into higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the previous government allocated the University of Tasmania 20 growth places for 1997 to help develop its north-west centre, which is located at Burnie. I have a real fear that those positions will be subject to review by the university if the proposed cuts are implemented.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania's future, which I must say is fairly bleak at the moment, will acutely feel a cut in funding of the university. If there is a future, it does lie in the smart, high-tech niche industries and companies that can develop our natural resources in a clever way to tap world markets. The University of Tasmania has provided in the past and can further provide the impetus to achieve what is really the only viable option for Tasmania's economic future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the University of Tasmania plays a pivotal role in the Tasmanian economy. Take away a large slab of government funding and you destroy in one hit the infrastructure that has taken years to develop. If the university experiences funding cuts, as has been touted, Tasmania will be a microcosm of what will occur across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we discover is a success story in our Australian universities that generates in the order of $1.7 billion a year in higher education exports. The success of our universities has come about over years of nurturing and understanding by the previous government. If cuts of around 10 per cent are imposed, we can expect a direct reduction in exports in the order of $150 million, let alone the multiplier effect of such cuts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This is the official summary of the Liberal Party and National Party's policy for higher education. I support it absolutely. There are some 16 points that are highlighted in this document. Five of them have direct, specific, positive funding commitments. Let me name them. Firstly, a coalition government will maintain levels of funding to universities in terms of operating grants. That means that there are no cuts to operating grants, not just for regional universities but for 36 universities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, a coalition government will increase funding for research infrastructure in universities by $90 million over the next three years as announced&mdash;$90 million; it is very specific; it is over three years. That is on the basis of the consultations we made over the last three years that the previous government made insufficient commitments for the research infrastructure of our universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, a coalition government will increase funding for the Australian Research Council's collaborative research grants by $30 million over three years as announced. That is highly specific. Fourthly, a coalition government will increase funding for postgraduate scholarships by $9.3 million over the next three years, so more students will have the opportunity to receive an Australian postgraduate award with stipend, as announced. That is highly specific. Fifthly, a coalition government will relax the Austudy assets test on farm and business assets in businesses in which the parent is substantially engaged. That has a funding tag to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other 11 dot points on the piece of paper I have incorporated are all positive. They are about quality, about excellence, about teaching, about research, about diversity, about choice, about access, about maintaining HECS, about maintaining Austudy, about maintaining Abstudy and about reviewing and strengthening the Australian Research Council, indeed, making it an independent body and expanding its role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1465"> There is a commitment to the Higher Education Council to establish it as an inde pendent authority. After years of complaining about the way the Labor Party had too many education advisers in their pocket, we want to have a legitimate independent Higher Education Council which is able to speak honestly and with integrity to the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention a number of developments that we have promised. These do not have particular price tags on them. They are fairly usual in policy statements from all sides of the debate in an election and I concede that they do not have precise dollar amounts attached to them. They are a genuine expression of intent. They involve such matters as supporting the further development of regional universities. It is a pleasure to follow Senator Denman in this debate. There are 18 speakers, but I know that Senator Denman and my colleagues from Tasmania have a very real commitment to the university in Tasmania and to the students from decentralised parts of the state who go to that university to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our commitment is to support the further development of regional universities. It is no surprise to me that members of the National Party have been to see the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) with the direct plea that regional universities see the outcome. It is no surprise to me that members, some of them freshly elected, from western Sydney go as a direct delegation to the minister and urge for their universities not to be let down by anything that would depart from the promises we have given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not alone. I want it to be firmly understood in this chamber and in Australia that government members do not sit on their hands when there is a furore&mdash;like the one we have seen over the last two or three weeks&mdash;in the Australian public. Every day there are headlines and further stories about what is going to happen to higher education. Government members see the same developments, have the same consultations and have the same care for outcomes in our higher education institutions. Let me refer more specifically to the detailed policy. I seek leave to table the policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The policy continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been evident in overcrowded lectures, unworkable tutorials and inadequate libraries. The financial squeeze also has detrimentally affected research infrastructure, research training and research capacity. Overall, this has put at risk the quality of both education and research.</PARA>
<PARA>Then comes our Liberal and National commitment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher education in Australia has been and remains overwhelmingly publicly funded. The Coalition accepts the responsibility that flows from this historical fact and while encouraging a broadening of the sector's financial base, will at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants . . . The Coalition will continue the practice of  funding  universities  on  a  rolling  triennium basis . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I could quote other parts of the document, but it is available for everyone to read. We talk about creative measures and reforms, about enhancing the autonomy of universities, about new developments and even about new revenue. The promises are best summarised by the executive summary that has been incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1466"> Let me refer to Labor's $8 billion black hole. This has been repeated by us every day since we discovered it after the election. It is not something which is to be disregarded; it is to be responsibly faced up to. I share the view with many in this chamber that, if better growth figures had been announced yesterday, the deficit would be a little easier to handle. Nevertheless, it has to be handled. The eco nomic ministers of this government have to significantly address the structure of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My argument is not that that should not be addressed. I am saying: address the deficit problem, giving priority to keeping the coalition's promises made during the election campaign. I do not believe that is an impossible task. I believe there is a majority in the government&mdash;at least on the back bench and I suspect in the ministry as well&mdash;who want that to happen. There needs to be more careful discussion prior to cabinet decisions on the August budget to put the two important responsibilities together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not breaking any confidences when I say I have spoken to a number of ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, my colleagues in South Australia and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill). It is natural that I speak to all of my colleagues, especially those who are involved in this matter and those who helped with and even announced this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, they say this to me&mdash;and I make this very clear in this debate: no decisions have been made. Do not give the game away. The 18 speakers in this debate should speak with the view that they can have an impact upon the government. Those students and staff who are writing to members of parliament should not give the game away. They should believe that their argument, their persuasion, can have an impact upon the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to an article that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last Friday, 24 May. It was written by Laura Tingle, one of the best journalists in Australia. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the election campaign, broadcaster John Laws asked Howard&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>she of course means John Howard&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If you had a choice between breaking election promises and running a Budget deficit, what would you choose?"</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard responded: "We would always give preference to keeping our promises." <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>I ascertained this week and last week that that is still on track, that that is still the position of this government, of the cabinet and of the Prime Minister. I urge my coalition colleagues to ensure that it remains on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two important responsibilities: a responsibility to get the economy right and a responsibility to fulfil our promises. Let me draw an analogy. Let us say you are a father or a mother devoted to your children and you promise your darling daughter for her birthday some red ribbons for her hair. Meanwhile, you take every kind of measure to make sure that the house is paid for, that food is on the table and that everyone has clothes. You are highly responsible as a parent in making sure the family is cared for but, out of a misplaced sense of priorities, you forget, overlook or do not place any real emphasis on the promise you gave your daughter to give her some red ribbons. I tell you now that that daughter will not see on her birthday the family's provision of housing and food and all the matters that are rightly considered for the economy of that family. She will know one thing: mum and dad broke their promise and she does not have her red ribbons. I make that point to every senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday this week contained an editorial headed `Policy first, cuts second'. This editorial made a comparison between the mandates the government has been given for the Telstra&hyphen;environment heritage matter and to fulfil its promises in education. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in a much broader and crucially important sense there is a core element they both share&mdash;unfortunately. This is the way in which government policy appears to be being driven solely by an obsession with delivering financial savings, not by wider policy concerns.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I stand with John Howard on this matter in the undertaking he gave during the election campaign about the priority of promises. I stand with the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  on policy first and cuts second.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even before this debate emerged in all of our universities this month, I had the honour of moving the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply motion in this chamber. On 1 May I said this in my speech:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1467">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second issue I refer to relates to the essential investment that must be made in education. I stress that there is ultimately no way to dilute the truth that the greater part of education provision must come from the public purse&mdash;from the allocation of taxpayers' money through government budgets. There is no ultimate escape from the budget foundation that education requires real dollars from real governments.</PARA>
<PARA>The first point from there is that when there is an expenditure review committee, when cuts are being contemplated, you cannot just go into a spending area of such importance as education and believe that you can take the money away and somehow it will just appear from some other means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are measures that can be taken&mdash;and I referred to that on 1 May when I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we may have efficiency reforms, avoidance of duplication, a contribution by students and parents through HECS, incentives for university research to win support from the private sector and so on, ultimately the coalition government and all governments must keep their promises for universities, schools and vocational education and training so that there will be no reductions in the real allocation of money from Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA>My first point is that taxpayers expect that taxes are being collected from them for essential social services; that taxpayers do not resent taxes being gained by a government of the day to be spent on education. I put it to you again. In parliament after parliament, polling indicates that education is in the top three issues. The public wants proper public provision for education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I then referred to our promises. If we have promised something, let us deliver it. In the third and final element of this section of my speech on 1 May I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's budgetary commitment to education is a fundamental investment in Australia's productive future. The challenge is to make sure that that investment is sure.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been fundamental to all 18 speakers in this debate that spending on research, teaching, higher education is an investment into Australia's future. It is an essential investment, and we must not dilute it, cut it short or short&hyphen;change it. I have put those three arguments more explicitly than perhaps I did on 1 May but they are there essentially in what I said as my final speech here in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate. In my speech on 1 May I said, `Thanks for the honour that you all give me to move the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply. It is the last time I can do it. I will be retiring from the Senate at the end of the next month.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stand by everything I said. I urge the government, for the three reasons that I set out on 1 May, to fulfil its promises, to make the investment and to live up to taxpayers' expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I address these remarks to every member of the government but especially to the six members of the Expenditure Review Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, John Howard, and including three financial ministers: the Treasurer, Peter Costello; the Minister for Finance, John Fahey; and the Assistant Treasurer, our colleague in this chamber, Senator Jim Short. John Anderson and Michael Wooldridge are also on the committee. These six members have the difficult political task&mdash;and I genuinely wish them well&mdash;of providing advice to cabinet with regard to the August budget. I put to them with as much fervour as I can: do not sell our promises short; do not sell policy short, just to solve the other responsibility; do not put all the eggs in one basket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the minutes that remain, I have a few remarks that I would like to make about our vice&hyphen;chancellors. Before I say this, I wish to declare a personal interest. It is not true that I am seeking to be appointed to a position as a vice-chancellor in the next month or so, but I happen to have among my friends many&mdash;maybe most&mdash;of the 36 vice&hyphen;chancellors currently serving in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators know that I was involved in education policy matters through the whole 18 years of my time here in the parliament, and I still believe every word that I have ever said here. I ask for higher education's understanding if, in opposition, we were not able to achieve as much as we had hoped. We are in government now, and I have the responsibility to speak the truth. I have the responsibility to urge my colleagues to weigh the policy issues that are involved in this matter, to take note of the furore out in the community, to take note of what has been said by every one of the 18 senators who have spoken in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1468"> debate, and not just dismiss it as if it were an ideological knee&hyphen;jerk reaction and all about the deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deficit must be solved but not without proper, responsible regard for the basis on which we won the election. I could refer again to my speech on 1 May. Maybe opposition members opposite were not convinced about this point. I mentioned that there were some lessons that I was not patronisingly giving to members opposite but, to put it on the record, to all of us. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One, do not mess up the economy; it loses votes. Two, do not break promises; it loses votes. Three, do not lie and do not condone lying; it loses votes. I say that very seriously.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I say it again today: don't break promises; it loses votes. In speaking with my colleagues, I am not just commending something because it is a virtue not to break your promise; I am saying: don't break your promise or you will lose votes. There is a political imperative, and I mean it. When the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts were deceitfully thrown out by the previous government, the Australian public heard that bell ringing and they threw out the government that did it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come to the vice&hyphen;chancellors. As I say, I have got a personal interest. Six months ago I was elected to the Council of the University of Adelaide. I am very happy to serve on that council. I am very happy to serve on its finance committee, its personnel matters committee, its faculty of arts and some other areas. I will not say in the Council of the University of Adelaide or to any of my friends among the vice&hyphen;chancellors anything that I am not going to be saying here or in public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there is a place for some appropriately confidential discussions, and I will not break confidential discussions. But I will not use this broad approach here and not say the same thing in any forum in which I have commitments. I want our universities to prosper. I want my universities in South Australia, the three of them, to prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the vice&hyphen;chancellors, I think it is only obvious to say it but no&hyphen;one has actually said this in the debate so far: I can understand the dismay of 36 vice&hyphen;chancellors <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when they hear hints of five to 12 per cent cuts to university budgets, given that promises were made only a few weeks ago, before the election, that there would be no such cuts. We can imagine their dismay. They are only human. They have responded to those hints in the way that any sensible Australian citizen would respond. Let us listen to them. They want their institutions to prosper and they want their advocacy to be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One vice&hyphen;chancellor has said to me, on the basis of there being such a failure to address the promises given before the election, when hinting at five to 12 per cent cuts, `I feel so much dismayed, so much let down, that I think to cooperate in defining where those cuts should be would be tantamount to subversion of my own university's outcomes and my council would hold me to account.' I think it is reasonable to give assurances to vice&hyphen;chancellors so that they know that what they say in cooperation will not be used against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be recognised that vice&hyphen;chancellors looked at the policies that were offered in the last election and made a legitimate decision, in my view, that the coalition's policies were better. Some of the vice&hyphen;chancellors have been so kind or generous to me as to share that confidence. I will not name their names.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can imagine the dismay, Senator Bell and Senator Stott Despoja, if you had said, `This is the better policy and I advocate that all of you support the coalition with regard to higher education because it will clearly be better for us.' There is enlightenment in that. There are promises in that. To then find there is a hint that this may be quite different means they will be dismayed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to refer to confidential meetings. It is appropriate that there be some confidential meetings, especially one to one or in small groups, with any minister at any time. But if a minister of this government or any other government is to give a statement to a whole industry, it is appropriate to take the model that the Prime Minister used last night for the mining industry. There was a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1469"> special list of a couple of hundred mining executives, and members of the press, ambassadors and members of parliament were present. The basic guidelines leading to the budget were announced by the minister with responsibility for mining and the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In confidential meetings, there is a danger that the persons hearing from a minister will be captured and will be breaking the confidence if they then discuss it with their own councils and their own universities. I believe there is an appropriateness for a semi&hyphen;public level of discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of things to say. My time is cut short; I had only half an hour to speak in this debate. I can only urge my colleagues in government to fulfil the promises that won us the last election.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I am converted. I think Senator Teague has done it. I think just about everybody in the chamber should see the light. The trouble is I do not really know whether Senator Teague was speaking for or against the motion. I think he demonstrated that there were some promises made by the coalition. I do not know what there was in his speech that guaranteed that those promises would be kept. He said something about a backbench revolt or backbench unity, but did not quite get to the stage of being able to report to us that he had convinced the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) that the promises should prevail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate I was disappointed that Senator Tierney, who has an interest in these areas, did not stay for Senator Teague's contribution. Senator Tierney has been involved with me and, to some extent, with Senator Carr on a number of inquiries by the Senate standing, references and legislation committees on employment, education and training. In the time that he and I have shared membership of that committee, we have addressed all five of the areas listed in Senator Carr's motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the committee has examined the first dot point mentioned, the international reputation of Australian education. As a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matter of fact, we had several inquiries covering that area and the value of education as an export industry. Any examination of any of the reports in that area eventually leads to the conclusion that Australia needs to invest money in that particular aspect of education because that is a good investment on which the Australian community obtains excellent returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the second dot point, the university research capacity and course options, I distinctly remember Senator Tierney's keenness to participate in that inquiry. The report and the evidence that we received was clear, that funding in this area could not withstand any sorts of cuts whatsoever and that, if anything, increased funding should be made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the quality of service for Australian students, I distinctly remember the inquiry into open learning in Australian universities, in which Senator Tierney was a keen participant. We were given evidence at those inquiries in particular about the shortage of funds for Australian university libraries and the effect that was having on the quality of service for Australian students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the fourth dot point, university teaching staff numbers and morale, I distinctly remember the higher education research funding inquiry where we were given evidence about how teaching and research staff were having pressure applied because of the teaching requirements, the large number of students they were obliged to be responsible for and how the poorly funded and poorly administered research funding arrangements meant that often university teachers were compromised in their ability to properly assess research projects by their teaching needs and the numbers involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the fourth dot point, the potential closure of faculties, suspension of building programs and reduction of student numbers that may result from funding cuts, I recall the recent history of Tasmania's university where some of the variety of options available for students has been reduced. We have had reductions in the variety of curriculum&mdash;for example, in the area of textiles, the fine arts faculty; the environment studies opportunities have been reduced; the classics department is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1470"> no more at the Tasmanian university; and the architecture faculty has been reduced to one campus, the northern campus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind senators that Tasmania is a split campus with some availability on the north&hyphen;west coast, the Launceston campus and the Hobart campus. Whenever one option is available at only one of the campuses, it should be remembered not only that Tasmania is a regional university but that the campus is split with so many kilometres separating it. So any cuts which mean that a subject or pursuit is offered in only one faculty bring great disadvantage to Tasmania as a whole. I am disappointed that Senator Tierney was not here to acknowledge that and to see the effect because he and other senators present were enthusiastic participants in inquiries which revealed all of these aspects of Senator Carr's motion. I would have hoped that that enthusiasm could have been carried through to this debate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the debate has been enthusiastically enjoined by its 18, apparently, potential speakers. I intended only to speak for five or six minutes but, as it seems there is an attempt to talk this out, I will make my points and I will make them strongly. For that reason, I will not need to curtail my speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Teague reminded us of the government's election promises by incorporating them in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The contribution from Senator Teague begs the question of why National Party senators have seen the need to directly approach their minister. It begs the question of why newly elected members and senators are going directly to the minister. If there was any faith in the fact that the promises would be kept and such funding cuts were not hinted at, then there would be no need for special representations rattling off to see the minister. We would not have the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee wanting a direct audience with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). We would not have the Australian vice&hyphen;chancellors leaving this building only a few minutes ago. As a matter of fact, just before I came down here, I burst into a meeting they were having with Senator Stott Despoja.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> If there was any faith in maintaining the promises, you would not have such an exten sive lobbying process. In fact, you would not have what Senator Teague described as a community furore and daily headlines railing against these cuts. Of course, if all these people had any faith in the government's election promises, there would be no need for this community furore, daily headlines and intensive lobbying. They would all say, `The government promised it and, therefore, we have no need to worry.' But that is not what happened. The minister hinted at some cuts. You have to ask whether all these people have got the wrong idea or whether the minister has mishandled her portfolio, as Senator Carr's motion proposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that if all these people have been led to the wrong conclusion, then it is a great example of gross mishandling. The impression in the community and through all those vehicles that Senator Teague has mentioned is direct and quite clear, that this hint, which was given without a precise number being attached to it&mdash;and the minister, through questions in this place, has been at pains to impress upon us that it might be five, 12 or anything else&mdash;has been quite explicit, quite strong and quite forcefully delivered. It certainly was not a hint that the government's election promises would be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had Senator Teague's appeal that careful discussion is needed before the August budget, the suggestion that many on the backbench agree with this and the claim that no decisions have been made. I think we would all be wise to observe that they were made from the backbench. Otherwise, we would have to ask our questions: is this really an elaborate ruse? Are we seeing a `bad&hyphen;cop good&hyphen;cop' scenario taking place within the one body? Is this an ambit claim? We would have to ask that question because, unless it is, it has all been a waste of time. There has been so much newsprint and airspace wasted that, unless there is some substance and some plan to all this, we would have to ask: how is this portfolio being managed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1471"> I did suggest that I would be short, but I will conclude with this as I believe it is important: I would not suggest for one moment that the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee has got it wrong, that the Austral ian Education Union has got it wrong or that all of the participants in the recently convened higher education round table&mdash;which my colleague Senator Stott Despoja imaginatively convened and fruitfully conducted&mdash;have got it wrong. That group of people, the HERT, included the National Tertiary Education Union, the National Union of Students and the other bodies I mentioned. Because I was not there, I am not able to give a full list, but I am sure that can be provided by Senator Stott Despoja. But I would say that group was comprehensive in its coverage of this particular portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To inform the Senate of the 11 points that that round table reached consensus on, I will read them out. They are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The HERT&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the higher education round table&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Agreed that public funding of higher education is in the public good.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Called on the Government to articulate their vision for the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Called on the Government to recognise the economic benefits as well as fundamental cultural, social and intellectual benefits to the country of higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Committed to oppose any decline in per student unit funding and serves notice that we will explore every legislative avenue possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Demanded that the government honour its promises and ensure that equity and access is maintained in our campuses, particularly regional campuses.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Noted the international reputation of Australia's Universities and the effects that funding cuts would have on this reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. Called upon the Government to recognise the need to inform the sector of proposed budgets changes: as the August Budget is an inadequate time period in which to implement the planning required for academic year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. Condemned the impact that funding cuts would have on staff and students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. Demanded that the Government meet its obligations as paymaster for Universities' general and academic staff and called on the Government to ensure that they are funded appropriately as part of a commitment to ensuring quality teaching and research.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. The Higher Education Round Table expressed its concern that student housing would be among the first casualties of funding cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>If that group of people reached consensus on those points, I think the government should be taking notice of them. That is not just a group of people who have a particular point of view. This round table was able to encompass the full higher education sector and, therefore, its consensus should have a weight which should concern the government&mdash;if not that its election promises were not made clear, then certainly that the minister has been unable to convey to the sector exactly what is going on.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party has a very proud record in relation to education. When we went into the 1993 election campaign, those of us who remember Fightback will recall that even in that dry economic statement the only area of government funding which was to be increased was&mdash;what was it? Education. When we were challenged before the last election as to where we would make savings to enable us to fund our election policies, the Department of Education, Employment and Training was quarantined&mdash;because that was our commitment to the area of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Australian Labor Party committed an absolute fraud on the Australian people. They left us with a legacy of $8 billion that we have to find.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Kerry Sibraa, thank you very much. People without any qualifications for the diplomatic corps in the professional area, though undoubtedly suited&mdash;I do not make any criticism of that&mdash;were being paid more than the highest professionals in the most important diplomatic missions around the world. Why? Because Labor thought that looking after their Labor mates was a lot more important than balancing the budget. Indeed, whilst we are talking about universities, I recall that at one stage the now Leader of the Opposition, the former minister for finance, introduced legislation, supported by the Democrats and Greens, to refund student unions moneys that they lost because students <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no longer wanted to be members. They took the money from the states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I got the figures out of the Parliamentary Library the other day. Some $14.5  million was spent on that. I simply say to the Labor Party, `Wouldn't that have been a lot better taken off the bottom line of the budget?' But no! The student union activists fund the Labor Party and support the Labor Party, so the Labor Party funds the student unions with taxpayers' money. Indeed the University of Tasmania would be delighted and would not even have to face any cuts if they could get that $14.5 million.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator ABETZ</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, Senator Calvert. But Labor's commitment is more to student unions than it is to the institutions of the universities. I do not need to give any more examples of the Labor Party's waste, be it on student unions, be it on diplomatic missions or be it on the republican issue&mdash;the list absolutely goes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The classic example of the mismanagement of Labor was in the Australian national railways. For how many months did they cover up the fact that they were running at a loss? Minister Sharp came into office, opened it up, had dreams and aspirations for the Australian national railways and thought he could do something with them, but he found they were running at a $160 million loss. So Minister Sharp, now no longer able to implement all of what he had wanted to do, finds his first task is to clean up the mess left to him by the former Labor administration. In every area of Labor administration we look we see the waste of money and the reason for the $8 billion black hole that we are faced with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Labor Party then have the audacity to come into this chamber and move a motion condemning the fact that we are looking at cuts. They have acknowledged that they are only proposed cuts. In fact, they are not even that. Everything is in the melting pot at the moment; we are looking at all options. It is a bit like the arsonist who is still at the scene of the crime: everything is going up in flames and he says to the fire brigade, `Don't, don't! <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1473"> You might cause some water damage.' In the meantime you would let the whole building burn down. We are responsible. We will put water on the fire. We will put the fire out. We will restore the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, unfortunately, just as firemen from time to time have to create some water damage for the ultimate good of putting out the fire, we as a Liberal government are charged with causing a bit of pain on the side for the greater good of putting the economy back in order&mdash;something that the Labor Party failed to do and had no concern about. All they were concerned about was getting into power. Former Senator Richardson always said, do `whatever it takes' to try and get back into power. They bankrupted this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gave me no joy this morning to be on a radio interview, broadcasting to Tasmania. I was discussing the matter with somebody from the academics union. Do you know what he said? He said, `I am not interested in whether or not there is an $8 billion black hole.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pretty fundamental issue. He could not dispute the fact that there was a black hole, so he just said, `I am not interested in it'. Well, if he is not interested in it, I could throw up my hands too, and with due respect to one of my colleagues who spoke before me, that is basically what he did. `Yes, there is this big hole but, oh, don't take it out of education.' We could throw up our hands and say, `Don't take it out of Aboriginal affairs, don't take it out of health, don't take it out of welfare, don't take it out of defence'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know, if we were to abide by that we would be taking it out of the future of our children and the next generation. That is the gross irresponsibility of those on the opposite side who are trying to talk to the Australian community and say that there is no real cause for concern about this $8 billion deficit. In fact, what is it? It is very hard to imagine, isn't it, but it is a huge, huge hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting listening to the Democrats' approach on this. Senator Stott Despoja in her first speech mentioned the importance of intergenerational responsibility as far as the environment is concerned, and I fully agree with that; no arguments. But if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you are going to have a consistent approach you also need intergenerational responsibility in relation to the economy and finances. There is no social justice in me and this generation of parliamentarians keeping on running up the bankcard and leaving it for the next generation to pay off. That is not the intergenerational responsibility that the Democrats were talking about on the environment, but for some reason they do not want to apply it to economic factors. The reality is that the economy is very important and from it flows everything else, because without a sound economy, without a sound budget, we will not be able to fund education for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still recall as a Liberal student being in Western Australia and that great Australian, Sir Charles Court, addressing us. He made a point, it must be 20 years ago or now, but it has stuck with me to this day. He said, `The reason that I place so great an emphasis on economic development for my state is so that I have got a sufficient business and tax base to fund the hospitals, the schools, the universities, the infrastructure, the arts&mdash;all those things that people would like to have funded from the public fund'. So that is why we as a government have set about the task of restoring the economy and getting the budget back into balance. Once we have achieved that there will then be a brighter future, not only for higher education but also for a whole lot of other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be fair to say that the university community is the most articulate within society, the most capable of lobbying, the most likely to have access to modern technology, access to editors of newspapers et cetera. Therefore, they have been making their point very loud and clear, but not once have I heard them say, `We agree that there needs to be a reigning&hyphen;in of the budget deficit'. As soon as they acknowledge that point, and they have to, the next point is: from what area? It is basically the nimby principle&mdash;not in my backyard, cut somebody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there are particular institutions in this country that deserve to be looked at individually, and I place the University of Tasmania in that category. I think that there are three outstanding reasons. Firstly, it is the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1474"> only university in my home state of Tasmania. Secondly, it is a regional university, and for a regional university to be able to survive it does need a degree of infrastructure. But if even my university needs to suffer a certain amount of cuts for the future benefit of all Australians and all Tasmanians, I will reluctantly go along with that because I have a vision for the future of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that the Labor Party and Democrats have been asking us to provide a vision for the future for higher education. I think that is very vital and I think that is a great challenge facing the minister, Senator Vanstone. But I challenge those people also to provide a plan for the future about the budget deficit. How are we going to deal with that for the future? How are my children going to be able to have an Australia which is not that much in debt that they will not be able to do what they want other than pay off the international bankcard that we have run up for them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is terminology in this motion which I find offensive. There is talk about the `turmoil engulfing Australia's universities'. Who is generating some of the turmoil? I suppose it depends on your definition of `turmoil'. A street demonstration, no problem with that; articulating, no problem with that. But when you confront the sort of nonsensical activism that my office confronted in recent times, and then you look behind it, you see the young people from the Australian Labor Party. I dealt with that in a previous speech. But when damage is done to buildings and tomatoes brought to the scene and thrown at the building, you have to ask the question: how does this assist the debate in any shape or form? It does not at all but it creates a climate of turmoil and that of course is the plan of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely, Senator Calvert, the old Telegraph. The next day there was not a single soul outside. The demonstration did not even last for a week. I issued a media release indicating how pathetic this campaign had been, how idle the threat was and how this student union leader was clearly not speaking on behalf of the students at the University of Tasmania. The next threat was, `We've changed tactics; we are going to inundate Senator Abetz's office with phone calls and faxes.' They issued a media release of that nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the journalists got the media release and thought, `You beauty. Let's see how it is working.' They rang my office, and within two rings the phone was answered.

The sort of turmoil that certain elements within the community are trying to generate is clearly for party political purposes and not for the purpose of assisting the universities in this very difficult time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spent 1&half; hours, along with a number of my Tasmanian colleagues, with the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania. We see the difficulties, and it gives us no joy. I say to the vast number of genuine students who have rung me to make a point&mdash;all of them, might I add, disassociating themselves from the student union&hyphen;inspired activity&mdash;`Can you imagine any politician going to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1475"> electorate and saying, "I am going to cut funding"?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the political beast is that you usually like to hand out the money&mdash;like the former Labor government, which got us into this mess, did. We are saying that rather than simply handing out largess, there is the necessity for responsibility. We are willing, even if it is for short-term political pain, to get the benefit and the recognition for taking the hard and tough decisions that are undoubtedly required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people within the small business community, the farmers and the shopkeepers, ask me, `Why is it that over the past decade our incomes have fallen so dramatically, yet those who live off the public sector have not really had to make the sorts of substantial cuts that we have had to endure?' I believe this government has led by example. Junior ministers have had pay cuts. Do you remember the National Media Liaison Service? How many millions of dollars did that cost? It was the propaganda machine of the ALP, funded by the taxpayers. It was abolished by us, saving money. It would have been politically astute for us simply to have kept it, to return the compliments to the ALP. But, no, we are committed to getting this country back on track. That means sometimes taking some hard and difficult decisions.</PARA>

In other words, Senator Teague, who made a remarkably honest speech for his contribution, actually pointed out that those growth figures quite clearly mean that the $8 billion dollar black hole&mdash;which was not there before&mdash;is very certainly gone for all time now.</PARA>

It is all right, Senator Patterson, I'll be gone when you make your remarks but I'll listen contentedly from down the road, or maybe I'll read it next week. As Mr Howard said&mdash;Senator Teague quoted him so nicely&mdash;when asked about whether he should deal with the budget or keep his promises, `Our preference is to keep our promises.' That is all you have to do. All the minister has to do now is to come out and say, `Right. I've got the message. It is not the right thing to do for us to be looking at cuts in education, creating chaos in our universities and uniting vice&hyphen;chancellors, staff and students as they have not been united or politicised in many years.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have actually had such a change, and why? Because this minister went out with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cavalier disregard for consequences and started the hares running herself. And the interesting question is this: what is the point of all this furore and chaos? Is it possible that the minister has just done this to distract people in some way, so that we are all going to be terribly busy rushing around having public campaigns, launching all sorts of programs, appeals, meetings and goodness knows what, but there will really not be any cuts at all? No&hyphen;one in their right mind could expect that the minister would make those remarks off the cuff, set all this chaos happening and then say, `Oh, well, we thought about it and there were not going to be any cuts anyhow. What we will do is just keep to our promise: no cuts.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be, indeed, that this minister has betrayed such a level of skill&mdash;heavy irony here&mdash;and such a level of incompetent management that she may be causing this amount of chaos just for the fun of it, but I do not believe so. I believe Senator Vanstone has a very clear game plan, and that is that she has to deal with the absolute embarrassment she finds herself in of having to find cuts in the face of an absolute promise that there would be none. That is her problem. That is one of the problems she really has got. Say what you like about why this has got to be the case, but Mr Howard said that, out of cutting to reduce the deficit and keeping promises, his preference would be for keeping the promises. Well, Mr Howard, act on your preference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are truthful about the budget deficit figures, you will know there is no black hole. You will know that, and that within a year or so all would come right. Those programs were well in train&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, no! You go and read those figures of the forward estimates for a year or two under the Labor government's last budget, and you will find that there is no need to be in this kind of panic. The reason the government is in this kind of panic is that it has to have a fall&hyphen;back position in case Telstra is not sold. Certainly, any money from Telstra's sale will not be forthcoming for this budget. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1479">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, importantly, you made promises&mdash;heroic, huge promises&mdash;and you got your fundings wrong. Even in the estimate of savings from extending the waiting period from six months to two years for newly arrived Australians to be eligible for benefits in this country, you got those figures wrong by nearly $300 million. They are your own costings now. You estimated $600 million plus, and the figure came in at around $250 million or $280 million, as I remember. Then you added a few extra bits and pieces in&mdash;not the promise of not changing anything except the six months to two years&mdash;and you have thrown in some more benefits that people will not be eligible for. All that has done is get the figure up to $350 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got your own near-$300 million hole on wild promises. `We'll buy our way across the election barrier'. Well, you are over there. You would be much better off, as Senator Teague said, telling the truth. You would be much better off in education if you put out the bushfire as quickly as you could and got down to doing the sorts of things in education that you should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again quote Senator Abetz's great contribution. `One of the things that we have got to have,' he said, `is a vision. A vision is important and that is a challenge for Minister Vanstone.' We have been saying all along that the minister does not have a vision, but I did not think Senator Abetz would say it for us, too. `One of the things the minister has to get is a vision'&mdash;spot on, Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has not got a vision; she has got a policy vacuum and into that vacuum she sails and says, `Cuts, cuts.' Boom! Can she give us a clue? In what direction, Minister? Would you like us to cut anything in particular? `No'&mdash;boom!&mdash;`Cut the lot'. It really is an extraordinary thing. There is no policy. There is no program. There is no clear outline. There is no discussion paper. There is no sense of where people might be led by the minister to see more efficient, different or alternate ways of doing education. There is none of that; just&mdash;boom!&mdash;cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the chaos is very properly sheeted home to the minister in this motion, in all the contributions from this side and, indeed, from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Teague. Do not get distracted by Senator Abetz's contribution. He is way off the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few points that I would like to highlight about why you should not proceed with these cuts. There is a very important reference on the front page of last Saturday's business section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. Unfortunately, I do not have the quote here. It was written by an American adviser, whose name I do not dare hazard a guess at. He is an adviser to the United States government. He was urging countries like Australia to seriously consider not rushing to make savage reductions in deficits or to cut public expenditure because mostly the cuts fell in the very areas that were needed to promote growth, development, recovery and expansion of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last thing you would want to be doing is cutting education. It is the very last place you should be cutting, because you would be stopping Australia's young&mdash;and now many older people with different qualifications, different talents and different capacities&mdash;from going into the marketplace and into the world and providing that wealth, that support, that development and all the sorts of things that are going to increase the productivity of the nation. It is quite daft to be cutting that area. It should be, as Senator Teague said, one area that has a very strong wall around it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz might want to say what he likes about the Labor government&mdash;and I do not think any government is exempt from criticism&mdash;but I remind him that the Labor government dramatically increased expenditure in education. It nearly doubled it over its time in office. It certainly saw the Commonwealth funded places double to over 454,000, I think, and there are 650,000 students now in tertiary education in this country. That is a huge increase on what it was when we came into office in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge Senator Abetz to look at what the Malcolm Fraser government did to education funding when it was in office between 1975 and 1983. We feel so passionately about cuts in the tertiary sector because we have fought and struggled to get that education system up and running. That is another dimension of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1480"> why it would be so bad to have the cuts proposed by Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is so easy and quick to stop the machinery of the tertiary sector and so difficult to set it moving again that you cannot dare to cut away these dollars without appreciating that it is not all `Oh, well, we'll crank it up next year': you will not. If you wind that machinery back overnight, it will take five years, if not longer, to get it even back to where it was before the cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even crazier though, the vice-chancellors tell me that, if the minister's cuts go ahead as proposed, there will be in the short term a dramatic increase in outlays. The idea of postulating cuts that are going to cost you more has to be one of the most remarkable proposals that this new government has come up with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also critical to note that, as well as winding back that machinery of tertiary sector education&mdash;knowing how long the lead time will be to get it going and knowing how important it is to the ongoing development and expansion of the economy, let alone the minds and hearts of the men and women who are in this country&mdash;cutting universities will have a savage effect on local and regional economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those regional economies need not be put down to the University of Western Sydney at Penrith, Kingston, the Northern Territory, Lismore or Tasmania; those regions can be put down to something as significant as a state. Let me read what the Minister for Education in South Australia, Dr Such&mdash;not a Labor minister, but a member of the Liberal government in South Australia&mdash;had to say in last Saturday's edition of the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The universities contribute $555 million to the South Australian economy and employ 6,500 people and are key contributors to the state's economic, intellectual, social and cultural life . . . Drastic cuts would have a severe impact on teaching and research programs and affect our pursuit of academic excellence, economic growth and development.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>And so it would. Dr Such has been one of the most passionate people appealing to his state colleague Minister Vanstone, saying, `Please <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> don't make these cuts.' In South Australia the economy is probably more sluggish than most other places across the country. For whatever reason&mdash;I have a lot of reasons why, but I will resist the temptation of mentioning them&mdash;it is still an area in which you would not want to do anything to create more risk or more hazard in that economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you took $20 million or $30 million out of the South Australian economy&mdash;which is what the cuts proposed would mean for South Australia&mdash;the impact would be dramatic. No, you do not just send three professors home from university. No, you do not just stop some x-thousand students being unable to get there. You also stop a whole lot of businesses bang in their tracks, because those dollars are not being spent in those businesses anymore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Housing will slacken. Mortgages will not be able to be paid. It has a very significant effect on the local economy. If you are not sure about that, look at what has happened to Canberra since the announcement of the Public Service cuts in this town. You all know that it is true. You must talk to Comcar drivers, as I do. Many of them run businesses in this town&mdash;not just building, buying and selling houses but secondary businesses. They will all tell you what has happened to the economy in Canberra&mdash;and that is not saying anything about housing prices. That can happen in South Australia, too. Dr Such knows it and he is desperate for it not to happen.</PARA>

I would like you to suggest, if Senator Campbell gets carried away again, that he should also direct his remarks through the chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important point about the impact of the tertiary sector on the regional economy is the very large and growing expenditure into research. One of the best things South Australia does, better than anywhere else in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1481"> Australia, is grow wine. It produces something like 60 per cent of Australia's wine. Of course, amongst that is the best of Australia's wine. The very best wines come from South Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator Crowley. I have to interject on that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can ring the world. Grange Hermitage, from South Australia, has just won the world prize for the very best wine. We produce absolutely brilliant wine. We produce at least 60 per cent of Australia's wine, maybe a bit more than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year the wine industry is thundering towards $500 million worth of exports. That industry has grown from almost zero exports a few years ago to this dramatic increase. That has been largely because of the enterprise in that industry, which has been supported and encouraged by export development program grants and all those sorts of things that the Labor government did on behalf of that wine industry. It is also assisted by the splendid research done through the University of Adelaide, at the Waite Institute, and through the wine and brandy institute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the bits and pieces of the equation that must be taken into account if we are talking about the impact of cuts in our tertiary sector. We need to talk about the impact of cutting back research dollars. There is not only an impact on the people who are doing the research&mdash;the loss of young researchers and the possible brain drain&mdash;but also the very immediate effect of the loss of that research on our industry, our productivity, our manufacturing and our exports. I mention the wine industry because it is such a very good example in South Australia; but there are any number of those examples across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing the Labor government did was to establish cooperative research centres. There are a number of them around the country. Again, these are the very best associations, or they are very good associations&mdash;perhaps there is always room for the better to be the best. These cooperative research centres are a splendid coming together of industry and tertiary sector university to promote research and to apply that research <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in Australia's manufacturing and scientific endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely sure the government supports those ventures and would not like to see anything cutting them back. But you cannot talk about benefits to the economy and try to make sure that the economy is in the very best situation and then take decisions that are immediately and dramatically, with a multiplier effect, going to cut back the economy of this country. It is for those reasons&mdash;let alone the fact that one of the very best investments we can make in the future generation is to make sure our children have the opportunity of a tertiary education, if that is what they choose, and to make sure that more and more of them have that opportunity, because of the increased number of places&mdash;that we should look at the so-called multiplier effect on development, investment, research, industry and export if we cut back in the areas of research and university investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to make clear the impact of cuts on two or three sectors that grew dramatically under a Labor government. I would hate to see any cutback in those sectors. Some 20 or so years ago, if you finished your schooling and left, that was about it for your education for the rest of your life. You had very little opportunity to get back into the education system. Over the last 13 years of Labor government there has been a very significant and intentional change so that people do have the opportunity for education, including tertiary education, over fairly much the whole of their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tertiary education for mature age students has been not only personally very satisfying for those people but also of tremendous contribution and importance to this community. I read in the paper yesterday or the day before that an Aboriginal man in South Australia has graduated as a doctor. I think he is in his 50s. He has had a life of any number of things, but he was not presented with the opportunity of an education when he was a much younger person. Under the Labor government's program there was much more flexibility for people in and out of education over the whole of their lives. That is one important area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1482">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another very big and very significant area of growth was the special programs for disadvantaged people, particularly people with a disability. There was much better access. For people from non-English speaking backgrounds there was the importance of assistance in English as a second language, certainly as it was the language of their studies in many cases. Also terribly important was the dramatic increase in the number of women who had the opportunity for the first time to get into tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still find it very poignant meeting families who say that a family member&mdash;an aunt, an uncle, a daughter or a niece&mdash;is the first in their family to have the opportunity of getting a tertiary education. It is poignant because they are the first. It is dramatically exciting because they are the first and because they will not be the last.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen hard&hyphen;won gains in education for our daughters as well as our sons. There are much better retention rates. The number of girls and boys completing year 12 has gone from 37 per cent to about 80 per cent. There has also been a very significant increase in the number of girls and women who are able to take up tertiary education&mdash;they now number over 50 per cent in our institutions. That is a significant increase compared with even the 1983 figure. I would hate to see any cuts in the tertiary sector, but I would also hate to see those gains lost. We know full well that the people who are always most likely to lose when there are cuts are those who are the poorest, those who are the most marginal, those who are the least able to argue their case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion deserves our strongest support. The minister's behaviour in relation to the tertiary sector deserves our strongest condemnation. Not only has there been chaos but reputations could well be in jeopardy. University research is certainly jeopardised. The quality of service for students is jeopardised. Teaching numbers and morale will be hit for six.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well and good for senators opposite&mdash;I preclude Senator Teague from this&mdash;to say that all those are just promises. This is a huge amount of chaos for something that may not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> happen. It clearly indicates that something will happen. It will quite clearly be damaging, difficult and destructive for our tertiary sector and, in every way you look at it, a negative for this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to contribute to this wide ranging debate in which Senator Crowley took the opportunity to talk about the South Australian wine industry. Congratulations on parts of your speech, Senator Crowley. In certain parts of it you showed great passion, which makes me think that opposition suits you well. You never showed the same passion and care for administration when you were on this side of the house and you were in charge of your own portfolio. As I say, being in opposition suits you well. It is where your passion is best brought out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not unexpectedly the speakers from the other side of the house have used this motion to simply sink the debate to its base level of politics and to launch an attack on ministers. When people from the education sector read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> they will no doubt see that very little real, constructive contribution has come from the other side. Those on the other side have continually denied the economic imperatives this government now faces and have thrown in platitudes about the worth of education, which of course we all agree with and support. It is unlikely that the mover of this motion and the many people who have spoken about it will get any thanks from vice&hyphen;chancellors for simply crowding the issue and taking base political opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know members of the Labor Party love to join a demonstration. If they see a banner, they will join it. Only yesterday they were in full support of the building workers' demonstration, let alone today's demonstrations, and supported their tax rorts. If they see a banner up a street, they will get right behind it. It is one of the Labor Party's great traditions and loves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are times when demonstrations are worth joining, but I cannot accept that the vice-chancellors and the demonstrators, the students, really believe they will get any comfort from or owe any sort of debt to members of the other side of the house for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1483"> their administration of the education portfolio. In every budget they brought down in their long 13 years in office funding per student fell. The evidence of that has been borne out by the fact that the student&hyphen;staff ratio some 13 year ago was around 10 students to one staffer. That ratio has climbed to 18 students to one staffer. So the ratio nearly doubled during the previous government's term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, without doubt the greatest losers in this area have been regional universities. That of course is my primary interest. There was no equity in funding for universities. The regional universities were the ones that lost out. For example, funding for students of city universities like Melbourne University has been higher than that for those attending regional universities such as Ballarat University. There never was any equity in the previous government's funding. The losers were always the regional universities. Ballarat University are still waiting for funding committed by the previous government for their establishment as a university. They are yet to receive that. Regional universities which were created during the previous government's term were never backed up with the funding necessary to carry out their duties at the level that is expected of a university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention the equality assurance mechanism&mdash;another scheme the previous government introduced. I cannot believe the vice&hyphen;chancellors think they can gain comfort from support from the previous government, now the opposition. They should cast their minds back to that scheme, whereby universities were ranked and placed in bands. They were ranked in bands of one to six. Of course, those ranked in the bottom bands&mdash;that is, those ranked five or six&mdash;were all regional universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The criteria were very shonky. All the regional universities ended up at the bottom of the ranking. The inequity of this criteria, which have since been abandoned, was shown in the case of Newcastle University. It has one of Australia's best medical schools and it has a high rating engineering school. Yet it was No. 5 in the rankings. So when it publicised itself overseas to try to attract students to its medical school, the first question asked <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was: where are you on the government's rankings? Newcastle University had to say, `We're down near the bottom.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the sort of disadvantage placed on regional universities. So the rich got richer and the poor got poorer in the education portfolio. As I said, that scheme has since been abandoned. I ask the vice&hyphen;chancellors to cast their minds back to when that scheme was established and how poor and wacky the criteria really were. They should not place themselves in the hands of the opposition when they make their approaches to this government, because the truth is that much of the heat in this debate has dissipated, has died down, even before the demonstrations started today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vice&hyphen;chancellors have sought a meeting with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That meeting will take place in the next week or so. The Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee now says it is ready to work cooperatively with the government. Perhaps on those two points they have cast their minds back to the record of the previous government and they know only too well that they should not side with the opposition or take any comfort from this motion by the opposition. They know the record only too well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to reassure the education sector&mdash;the vice&hyphen;chancellors, the staff and the students&mdash;I wish to paraphrase the words of the Prime Minister. I am sure he will reassure the vice&hyphen;chancellors when they meet with him in a week or two. The Prime Minister reconfirmed only last week that the coalition's policies will be upheld. He is patently aware that governments must return to upholding their commitments, if for no other reason than the great cynicism that the Australian public have towards politicians and parliaments which was set rock hard after the 1993 election when the Labor government broke their promises wholesale and increased taxes wholesale. The Prime Minister said that the forthcoming budget will show only too well our commitment to our belief in upholding the thrust of our policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that the coalition did signal some changes in education, if people care to read a little more closely&mdash;particularly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1484"> Senator Crowley&mdash;our policy document. Some changes were signalled and there will be some restructuring within the education department, such as the winding up of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. The enormous task of bringing down the budget in surplus is the No. 1 strategy of the government&mdash;due, of course, to the legacy left to us by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The education sector, along with all sectors, must meet new efficiency levels. I noticed only yesterday in the higher education section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper&mdash;a well&hyphen; respected and well&hyphen;read section of the newspaper&mdash;in their regular column `Your say' they posed a question to the sector: could your colleagues be more efficient in their work? I do not hold this up as the definitive poll of the education sector, but it is interesting and it is a guide towards efficiency. In reply to that question, 60 per cent answered yes. As I say, I do not hold that up as the most definitive poll of the education sector but obviously that is a fair indication that there are efficiencies to be made in that sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should not be lost on those involved in the education sector that we do have a policy, a primary commitment, a promise that we have made to the Australian people for fiscal responsibility, which does translate into a balanced budget. While I do not seek to get bogged down in the broader economic arguments, frankly, the vice&hyphen;chancellors should realise that that is the angst in the community at the moment. We want to sheet home the broader economic situation that we are faced with. I hope some time will be left for Senator Campbell to pick up on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vice&hyphen;chancellors should also realise that the reward for bringing the budget into surplus&mdash;unless no vice&hyphen;chancellor or student has a mortgage or a credit card&mdash;is downward pressure on interest rates. So our priority commitment to all Australians is for a balanced budget or a budget in surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the foundation stones for our higher education policy remain in place. Our policy shows that the coalition understands the work and are committed to the support of high&hyphen;quality universities for the intellectual, cultural, economic and social benefit of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation. For all those reasons, the truth probably is that both sides of the parliament believe in the priority commitment to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regardless of how we pull and tug on this issue, although it could be much better, Australia does have one of the best university infrastructures, if not in the world, at least within Asia. That is something we can be proud of. That has been built up over 50 years. As a National Party member, the area that is of most concern to me is student access to higher education. The coalition policy gives great assurances regarding student access. It is one of its three major goals. I place it as my No. 1 goal. Following on from access to education comes equality and choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the rural and regional population, the question of access is supported, firstly, by Austudy and, equally important, its regional universities. At the risk of stating the obvious, it is worthy to note that the rural community holds education for its children as the single most important issue. There was great evidence of this during the drought&mdash;and I do not doubt that in many parts of the eastern board of Australia the drought is still at its height. During the height of the drought some 18 months ago, farming families in all their troubles saw their priority as maintaining their children's education through access to Austudy, which, under the then rules, was being denied to so many drought stricken farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition believes that Austudy is one of the most important tools for accessing education. Yet we have been left with a system that has become complicated and is not meeting its original, worthy goals. This stems from the introduction by the previous government of the actual means test, which has led to an administrative nightmare. Unfortunately, this government is left with the actual means test that we did not design and that has caused a logjam of some 3,000 unprocessed applications for Austudy, and yet the academic year has already started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to regional universities, I am sure Senator Vanstone will not mind my mentioning that the National Party MPs have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1485"> stoutly presented a very worthy case for their funding. Probably more than city based universities, regional universities link closely with the community. While so many people have been claiming today&mdash;from the Democrats to the ALP&mdash;that they have been seeing vice&hyphen;chancellors and others in the education system, I can fortuitously and perhaps even coincidentally say that I have met representatives from the Bendigo district. I would like to take time out to wax lyrical about the Bendigo campus because it is a case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are university representatives on the board of Bendigo Art Gallery and the science museum, which shows the close links to the community. Moreover, the local council in conjunction with the university will be building a very high quality athletics track for both public and university use. The same university, Bendigo University, is undertaking a study on the impact of gaming machines on the local economy. Such are the many uses of regional universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bendigo University feeds other major centres, such as the Mildura and Shepparton area where courses are undertaken under the stewardship of the Bendigo University. In all, the Bendigo University campus directly and indirectly contributes some $100 million per annum to the local economy and, just as importantly, if not more importantly, it employs over 430 staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having stated the importance of the regional campuses, I say for the information of the opposition that no regional campus will be forced to close. To the contrary: this is nothing short of a scare campaign. Senator Vanstone has been very supportive and understanding in regard to the importance of regional universities. I quote verbatim from a press statement she issued on 22 May, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Senator Vanstone . . . today reaffirmed the Coalition's recognition of the importance of regional universities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone said speculation that regional universities were under threat was nothing more than an attempt by the Labor Party to create an atmosphere of panic in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Coalition recognises the important contribution regional Australia makes to the nation and understands the individual needs of people who live <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outside the metropolitan cities," Senator Vanstone said.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I am very confident that the opportunism of this particular motion will be seen for what it is out in the education sector: base, political opportunism and an attack against a good minister.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They still can't speak English as well as we can, can they? Another reason I am pleased to be following Senator McGauran in the important debate on this matter is that this is something on which the National Party and the Australian Labor Party can stand up together when we are supporting rural Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his contribution which has just concluded, Senator McGauran mentioned the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of yesterday's date, 29 May. He quoted some statistics from the education section of that publication. I am more pleased to quote the front page of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> where, again, evidence is shown of the Australian Labor Party and the National Party having together stood up to the government, stood up to its slash and burn approach to the budgetary cost cutting and saved the diesel fuel rebate scheme for the farming community of this great country. We will do the same thing and stand together on regional universities. Perhaps we might go a little further and talk about metropolitan universities as well. But that will not in any way denigrate our support for the great regional institutions that abound in the wonderful state of Western Australia, which include, as Senator Campbell <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1486"> would know, those branches of universities in places such as Broome and Bunbury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very sad that the Australian parliament should have to debate such a motion which, I remind the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">views, with grave concern, the turmoil engulfing Australian universities as a result of the Coalition Government's proposed budget cuts&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA>We know that today universities around this country are in a state of great turmoil, and not only universities. The whole of the education sector is in turmoil because they are under the grave threat of their budgets being slashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only universities and educational institutions. Today, I have had calls in my electorate office in Perth and here&mdash;although the people have not been able to contact me as readily over here as they have in Perth&mdash;on the skillshare program. Enormous concern, fear and worry has been put into the minds of the great people that run those institutions because of Costello's con&mdash;a fictitious and shameful campaign by the government to fulfil the Fightback agenda which was so dramatically rejected by the electorate in 1993. It is now back on the agenda but this time under the subterfuge known as Costello's con.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subject matter that we are debating which, unfortunately, Senator McGauran did stray quite substantially from, continues on. I have quoted part of it about the proposed budget cut. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the mishandling by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) of her portfolio;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) notes that the indiscriminate funding cuts will threaten: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Australia's international reputation and higher education export industry,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) university research capacity and course options,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) the quality of service for Australian students,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) university teaching staff numbers and morale; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) potential closure of facilities, suspension of building programs and reduction of student numbers; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) notes that the proposed funding cuts breach Coalition election promises and guarantees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Those election promises and guarantees were supposed to be written in blood. They were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> never going to be broken. The promises were going to be all&hyphen;important on things. If they are brought to fruition&mdash;and indeed some cuts are already taking place in different types of programs; I mentioned the training area of skillshare&mdash;it will rebound on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). In the very near future he will in turn find that he has alienated the community because they do not accept the right of politicians to make promises prior to elections, receive an overwhelming support for the programs they put to the people and then, in a matter of a few short months, reject and repudiate what they put to the people in order to encourage them to vote for them in the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great deal of debate has occurred in this place in the past few days through questions to the minister on her negotiations with the vice&hyphen;chancellors of our universities. A large number of questions have been addressed to her and very little information has been forthcoming from the minister on the current views of the vice&hyphen;chancellors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian media have to be given credit for the fact that they are publicising the other side of the coin, namely, the worries in the minds of the vice&hyphen;chancellors. Questions were asked of the minister who replied that some vice&hyphen;chancellors are supportive of them sharing the burden of the need for savings. But, when pressed on that, she will not identify any of those vice&hyphen;chancellors whom, she says, will bear what she describes as their share of the savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have some vice&hyphen;chancellors who certainly have not said that they will share the burden. The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Canberra, Mr Don Aitken, said last week on Canberra radio that he was appalled by the government's attitude. That was repeated yesterday by Michael Osborne from La Trobe university. Senator Campbell will be very pleased to hear that there is very little support coming from the vice&hyphen;chancellors back in our home state of Western Australia for the proposed cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had talks with one individual at the airport a couple of weeks ago. He has not given me permission to use his name, so I will not press it any further. But he certainly would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1487"> not have been one of the people I would have put in the category of meeting with Senator Vanstone and expressing support for the cuts. But one person who has put his concerns in writing to me is the Acting Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Western Australia, Professor Alan Robson. In a letter dated 23 May 1996, he wrote to me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to seek your support in the face of the severe funding cuts currently mooted for the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will be aware from recent media coverage, the federal government has foreshadowed massive budget cuts in order to reduce Commonwealth expenditure by $8 billion over the next two years. Cuts of between 5 and 12% have been rumoured for the higher education sector. If imposed, cuts of this magnitude would seriously compromise our ability to deliver a high quality education to the people of Western Australia and to attract full fee paying international students which represent a major source of export income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its pre&hyphen;election campaign the federal coalition promised that it would maintain universities' operating grants at their current levels and would increase funding in some specific research areas. If the coalition does not honour these promises, the higher education sector will be forced to make drastic reductions to the service it provides. The sector is unable to absorb any more funding cuts without a detrimental effect on the quality of tertiary education. Already since 1983 universities have absorbed cuts of approximately 10% per student, together with a 2% unfunded salary increase late in 1995. Further cuts will jeopardise the quality of educational opportunities available to young people in this State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University of Western Australia needs your support. I would be very grateful if you would join the University in this campaign and register your concerns, either verbally or in writing as appropriate, with the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alan Robson.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>As an individual political representative of Western Australia, I am very pleased to join with Mr Robson, the University of Western Australia and those other universities in my state in standing up to this federal government which is taking a slash and burn approach to destroy this country's higher education system. Further, I am happy to join with other university vice&hyphen;chancellors throughout Aus <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tralia who are willing to stand up to the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my opening comments, I am more than happy, again, to stand beside our National Party colleagues who are going to take the fight up, internally as well as externally, to the government of which they are a part. I appreciate the difficult positions they might find themselves in. But some of us who were in government previously got quite used to that&mdash;that is, being somewhat of an opposition party in government. It can be quite difficult from time to time, but I do commend members of the National Party for doing it. As I indicated earlier, they have had some success with the diesel fuel rebate scheme for the farming community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That fight has not yet been completed. There is still a very large sector of rural Australia which is quite dependent on the diesel fuel rebate scheme. That is the mining sector, which was quite highly praised here today by Senator Parer, the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliamentarians, like my colleague Senator Campbell, will be receiving the same representations on that scheme from his constituents, as well as mine, back in our home state. I am sure that he will not be letting them down, although he might have to contain his representations somewhat differently to the way I might be able to handle them. Nonetheless, I am pretty certain that all Western Australian parliamentarians will be able to stand together in the interests of Western Australia and, indeed, Australia as a whole and the people of our great country to ensure that we have a future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important with election campaigns that the policies put to the people by the winning political party are going to be honoured by it. It is equally important that the vanquished who are elected to parliament in opposition put a strident defence to the policies and platforms that were put to the people at election times. A good opposition will make for good government, although I think our best efforts will not be rewarded too greatly, judging by the performances of the ministers in this government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1488">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, I am sure that everybody on this side of the chamber and on the opposition side of the other place will do their very best to bring the fight up to the government. They will do their best to keep each of the individual ministers on their toes and to ensure that the ministers certainly do their very level best to honour the promises that were put to the people just three short months ago&mdash;that is, to ensure that those promises are kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fallacy of what colloquially is known of as the `black hole' was exposed yesterday&mdash;very dramatically exposed yesterday. It is unfortunate that the script writers for the ministers are still active and still using those very inaccurate figures that projected there might be a deficit of in the region of $8 billion. Growth figures that were released yesterday prove again just what a mistake it is to rely on one quarter's figures. I am not one of the people who do go out and claim that everything in the garden is now rosy because we did have a good set of figures yesterday, because the next set of figures might not be quite as good and, of course, will change things again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is what it is all about: that the projected deficit figure will change, it will continue to change and, because of that, there is no earthly reason now why our higher education system or, indeed, our welfare system or our training systems should be subjected to the slash and burn approach that has been projected by the current government. There is no earthly reason why that slash and burn approach should be allowed to continue. There is no reason why the people of this country&mdash;be they vice&hyphen;chancellors in our academic institutions right across Australia or the students or other workers within those institutions&mdash;should be caused to have the fears that they have currently in their mind because of what has been projected by minister and other ministers of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The turmoil that Australian universities are suffering today is an experience that should not be allowed to recur. The government and, indeed, the minister should stand up now, realise the mistakes they are making, the fears they are putting into the minds of the people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and perhaps now step back, return to their election promises and get on and give good government to this country. They have got good examples to follow. The examples were put there by the previous administrations, and it will not be too difficult for them to copy those examples.</PARA></SPEECH>

Ultimately, the Australian people will see the truth about this and they will see whether they need to believe Senator Crowley, who is using United States terminology to say that the budget will whirr back into balance because all of a sudden we have had a good set of numbers and the upturn in income tax receipts and tax receipts will see the $8 billion deficit just disappear overnight.</PARA>

<PARA>RAAF Nomad A18&hyphen;401 was on a local training flight from</PARA>
<PARA>Edinburgh Air Force Base near Adelaide on 12 March 1990 when it suffered a massive failure of the tailplane assembly. the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Glenn Donovan, was killed in the crash.

ASTA had arranged a loan agreement with the RAAF and used the plane under this loan agreement for some time. It is not clear how much of the cracking had propagated by the time that A18&hyphen;401 was transferred back to the RAAF at the end of the loan agreement. It is, however, clear that there were a number of discrepancies in the loan agreement. It required an evaluation at the time of the beginning of the loan agreement and at the end. None of those evaluations were carried out either by ASTA or by the RAAF. Monthly, I think it was&mdash;certainly regular&mdash;reports were required during the period of the loan. It seems that none of these reports were forthcoming either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ASTA largely used the aircraft as a test aircraft, with the stresses and strains that that placed upon the aircraft. It was also subjected to a lot of ground running&mdash;ground running being where the plane is kept stationary but the engines are run for a number of different research reasons. The number of hours of ground running was never completely clear, but it was probably in the order of 170 or 180 hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee took evidence about the stresses and strains that ground running places upon various aspects of the plane but, in particular, the tailplane. It seems very clear to the committee that the cause of the tailplane failure was directly resulting from that ground running.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the extent of that ground running or the use of the aircraft as a test aircraft was never made clear to the RAAF either during or after the loan agreement. The plane was clearly transferred with a cracked tailplane, which subsequently failed and caused the crash.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a long history of problems with the tailplane in the Nomad. ASTA had tried to control this with a number of developments, in particular modification N663 which was fitted to only eight aircraft at the time of the crash and also with 100&hyphen;hour interval inspection of the tailplane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ASTA also ignored inquiries from the CAA. The CAA, as a result of a report from a major aircraft operator, had put queries to the ASTA organisation. But there was never, apparently, any response to the CAA&mdash;there certainly is not in any written form&mdash;and the two requests from the CAA were essentially ignored by ASTA. So here we have an accident basically waiting to happen&mdash;a plane with a faulty tailplane assembly waiting, essentially, for the tail to fall off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was transferred back to the RAAF and the RAAF, which I think in contrast to ASTA were very cooperative with the inquiry, accepted partial corporate responsibility. They accepted there were systemic problems in the way they maintained the plane and handled the plane, in the way they handled the transfer of the plane, and they accept, I think, that the process was pretty defective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of the corporate responsibility, however, a number of individuals in the RAAF, as evidenced in the report, displayed evidence of negligence in terms of their duty. For example, when the RAAF took over the plane there was no acceptance report made. Nobody made a careful evaluation of the status of the plane. It looked okay, so they assumed it was okay. It is rather like kicking the tyres on a car that you buy from a used car yard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An S17 service was due on the plane prior to the crash. This service is a no&hyphen;tolerance service, which means it has to be done and the plane should have been grounded prior to it being done. But that service, of course, was not done and individuals within the RAAF&mdash;and the details are in the report&mdash;basically made unilateral decisions that the S17 service was not necessary and was not appropriate. They did not inform the pilot and the pilot therefore took off unknowingly with a plane which was overdue for a no&hyphen;tolerance service, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1492"> and which subsequently crashed as a result of the tailplane failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some doubt about whether the service would have actually picked up the fault in the tailplane. The truth of it is that the manuals used by the RAAF were so poorly written that it is not clear whether in fact an inspection of the tailplane assembly&mdash;the internal aspects of that&mdash;was in fact part of that servicing. On balance, the committee felt that it would have been necessary to inspect the tailplane parts and that the tailplane cracking would have been detected. But there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the servicing should have been done and that there would have been a significant chance of picking up the tailplane defects and in fact saving the life of Glenn Donovan, who was the pilot of the plane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bearing in mind that there were a number of negligent actions which took place in this time, one of the questions was: should charges have been laid? The conclusion the committee came to was that clearly charges should have been laid at the time. One of the problems was that there was such a long list of inquiries into the issue. There was a board of inquiry into the crash, there were another couple of internal RAAF inquiries, there was an ombudsman's report and then subsequently this final report from a Senate committee. The question of whether charges should be laid was considered by a number of those. The conclusion of the RAAF was that charges should not have been laid against individuals. The conclusion the committee came to was that this was a wrong decision, that indeed charges should have been laid under the Defence Force Discipline Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee felt, however, it was not possible, as was suggested by the pilot's brother, Phil Donovan, that charges should have been laid for manslaughter, the problem being that the manslaughter charges, of course, would have no time limit on them but under the Defence Force Discipline Act there is a statute of limitations of three years. The main recommendation we made in fact was that this three&hyphen;year statute of limitations is clearly not long enough in a situation where there are a number of inquiries going on.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day management of discipline in the defence forces, three years may well be enough, but our recommendation is that the period should be extended to five years to allow for circumstances like this. We are not implying that a number of inquiries were instituted so that the statute of limitations should be exceeded, but certainly it would be possible in theory for the defence forces to use that action as a delaying prospect to prevent any charges being laid. There was always the possibility that charges were not laid against fairly junior members in the RAAF because in fact the culpability should have been held by more senior members who were protected by the lack of information available to the committee. The Defence Force view is that the Defence Force Discipline Act should be left with a three&hyphen;year statute of limitations, but we strongly feel that that change is inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sadness about this is that a very fine young pilot, Glenn Donovan, is now dead as a result of a litany of errors, misjudgments and negligence on the part of ASTA, on the part of the RAAF and on the part of the CAA. Nothing can bring Glenn back, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my own personal sympathy to his family. I know I speak for the rest of the committee in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think words of commendation are needed for Glenn's brother Phil, who really was the reason why so many inquiries actually were conducted. I know that Phil is unhappy that charges have not been laid against certain individuals and he feels that the committee has not really increased the knowledge of the situation to the extent which he would like. I can understand his views on that. I think there is extra information which has come out as a result of this inquiry and we have pointed the finger at one or two of the issues here. I would like to take this opportunity to commend him on his enthusiasm and his diligence on behalf of his brother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Paul Barsdell and the staff of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, who during this inquiry, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1493"> and indeed in other inquiries as well, have shown enormous diligence and devotion to their task and have completed it with a great deal of success. They deserve our commendation.</PARA>

<PARA>The report of the Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste was tabled out of session on 29 April. It is timely that this report was tabled on the 10th anniversary of the then Soviet government's admission of the Chernobyl disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia does not have a nuclear power industry and the amount of radioactive waste created in Australia is only a minute fraction of what is produced in some other countries. Therefore, fortunately, it is not possible for Australia to experience a Chernobyl&hyphen;type accident. Nevertheless, the disastrous consequences of Chernobyl are a salutary reminder of the need for adequate regulation of radioactive materials. Radioactive materials used in industry and medicine, some of which save lives, do provide benefits. However, they also have potential health risks if the radioactive waste is not managed safely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radioactive waste cannot be destroyed. Radioactivity occurs naturally over periods that may take millions of years.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was concerned at the lack of up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date information on Australia's radioactive holdings. A national inventory of radioactive waste has not been prepared since 1986. The committee was told that radioactive waste is stored in approximately 100 places around Australia, but it seems that the exact figure is quite uncertain. The committee has therefore <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recommended that an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date inventory be compiled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some conservation groups argue that the way to eliminate radioactive waste is to eliminate the use of radioactive materials altogether. This is not realistic because of the important uses of radioactive materials. Nevertheless, that does not diminish the importance of minimising the creation of radioactive waste and safely managing the waste that has been created. We can achieve both. Our report stresses this need to minimise the creation of radioactive waste. I notice that the Senate is due to get on to the adjournment debate, Madam Deputy President.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has a Liberal government and has had one for some time. I guess a lot of Tasmanians who voted to elect Mr Warwick Smith to Bass and those others who voted conservative in the state of Tasmania would have taken a great deal of note of the Tasmanian package that the now Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, launched on 7 February. I would just like to remind government senators of it, and I hope the government in general takes note of what this package says. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania has a unique place in the Commonwealth. The Federal Government has a special responsibility to achieve equality for Tasmanians in developing opportunities for their state. The Coalition accepts this responsibility and in Government will implement the initiatives detailed in the Tasmanian Package.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The Tasmanian package amounted to $67.15 million over three years. It made mention of a number of things, and there are two that I would like to draw attention to. One of those related to the issue of Commonwealth facilities in Tasmania. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition Government will examine high profile capital works projects for Commonwealth departments and agencies already in the pipeline that could be located in Tasmania to redress the fact <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the State has often been overlooked for relocation or establishment of federal agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context the Coalition will review the Labor Government's decision to close HMAS Huon in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA>Having said that, we know that we have been confronted by cuts in Tasmania as a result of the proposed cutbacks in the budget and in response to this so&hyphen;claimed $8 billion hole, which seems to be disappearing at a rate of knots, almost like the fog on a good morning here in Canberra with a very strong wind blowing. We have had to confront the closure of the Family Court in Launceston and the closure of the tax office, and, most recently, we have had a major cutback in employment programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only employment we can find that has been generated in Tasmania over the last three years has been as a result of Working Nation programs. We think that we can attribute almost 7,000 jobs to that. In Bass alone, which is where my office is based, I have sought information from all of the training and employment placement providers who have been acting on behalf of Working Nation programs&mdash;particularly the skillshare, jobskills, new work opportunities, jobtrain, joblink and jobclub programs. When you tally up the number of people who have gone through those programs in the last 12 months, the number is nearly 2,000. Also, the direct employment of the people implementing those programs is quite substantial. Regardless of what we have been told by the minister&mdash;and even though we have been told that some $30 million is being brought forward&mdash;we know that a number of jobs will go. I think that is, quite frankly, a total misunderstanding of what the program is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other fact is that the Commonwealth Labor government committed some $14&half; million to the AMC, the Australian Maritime College, for the Australian Maritime Engineering Cooperative Research Centre. They were told when the coalition came into government that that funding would be up for review. They have already commenced work but can proceed no further to obtain contracts for that work for when and if this thing is ever completed. To this day they still have not received an answer as to whether or not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1495"> that funding will be forthcoming. This is in a state, and in an electorate&mdash;Bass&mdash;which has a very depressed economy. It simply is not good enough that a government cannot respond to the needs of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other important aspect of this Tasmanian package was the $49&half; million over three years for the implementation of what was called, I think, the Bass Strait passenger equalisation scheme. I want to refer to a few press clippings to indicate how some commentators in my state believe things are going in Tasmania. I refer to an article on 21 May which was in response to a plea from the mayor of the Tasman Peninsula&mdash;which was where the Port Arthur tragedy occurred&mdash;and the Tasmanian Premier to Mr Howard, as Prime Minister. That plea was a request to bring forward some of the funding that would be available under this particular election promise. A spokesman for Mr Howard evidently indicated that Mr Howard was sympathetic to bringing forward this subsidy and using it to assist with the very difficult situation that Tasmania&mdash;but, more importantly, the Tasman Peninsula&mdash;found itself in as a result of the Port Arthur tragedy, and also using it to assist in the general economic condition of the state. An article headed `Tourism Fear' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> on 25 May stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The crisis in Tasmania's tourism business is deepening because potential visitors are stalling their trips until the promised Bass Strait passenger subsidy starts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the state facing one of its toughest tourism winters, it is believed the wait for the Federal Government subsidy could be holding back a tide of visitors.</PARA>
<PARA>Further down in that article, a spokesman for the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, said that the subsidy was not likely to start until September. There are a host of those types of articles in the local papers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very disappointing. The Tasmanian people must be totally disappointed in the actions of their federal government representatives. Not one of them has come out and made a public statement with regard to any of these election promises, any of the funding programs. I must say, however, that Mr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Warwick Smith, the member for Bass, did say that if the coalition won the election then we would have a Family Court judge based in Launceston. I got an answer back today from Mr Williams, the Attorney-General, to a question I asked a week or so ago and he says that it is a matter for the Federal Court. He also implied in his answer to my question that Mr Smith did not say those things. I will dig out Mr Smith's public statement and send it to Mr Williams so that he will be aware of exactly what Mr Warwick Smith, the now federal member for Bass, said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I want to go back to this subsidy and the time it was launched. I found it very interesting. Part of the document says how it will work. There will be a rebate that is payable for fares paid for the driver and the vehicle where the fare exceeds $150. It also says that the first $150 is paid by the driver. I thought I had better do some sums here and just ascertain exactly what that means. Under the current fare structure on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS>, a TT&hyphen;Line vessel which operates across Bass Strait, the only way you could actually get a $150 rebate would be if you used the top two cabins&mdash;that is, the suite and/or the deluxe cabin. There is no way that you could get a $150 rebate on a one&hyphen;way fare under the other three fare structures. Yet the dollar figure&mdash;$49&half; million over three years&mdash;is based on every vehicle that crosses Bass Strait getting a $150 rebate on a one&hyphen;way fare. I contacted Mr Sharp's office today and asked if they could explain to me how it worked. They said that they could not but that they would get someone from the department to ring me and explain it. I hope they do, because $49&half; million over three years&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

But there was certainly no attempt by people sympathetic to me to stack out any branches. I would like to think that there are people sympathetic to me in most branches already.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had responsibility before the last election for the Sutherland area of Sydney. Before question time yesterday I was speaking about the opposition of the people in the south-west of the state to the proposal by the government to have an airport at Holsworthy. I was referring to the fact that Mr Tickner, who was the member for Hughes before the last election, Sutherland council and others in that area had put to me arguments against that proposal for the airport. I would like to continue to emphasise in the Senate the points that they made. The studies have been done. Holsworthy has been rejected as a suitable site since the 1970s. The only reason to do another EIS is as a sop to the coalition's big business constituency, and that is either the existing airport organisations or the new consortium.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they all gave evidence in the sense that they are hesitant about the second Badgerys Creek airport&mdash;that is really the bottom line. Of course, the consortium itself has not been sighted. I do not know who they are or what they are up to. It is a mystery at the moment because we had no indication before the election of the devious deal that has been done by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer's pre-election promise to the people of Sydney that Badgerys Creek will go ahead is put on hold now by this government. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1498"> Is this just an excuse for further delays of Badgerys Creek? That is the worry, because that is a threat to all the people in the inner city of Sydney who at the moment have the problem of noise arising from Mascot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An EIS is not necessary. We know Holsworthy is not suitable. While the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek will be 15 kilometres from the nearest houses, the Holsworthy site is within three kilometres of some of Sydney's fastest growing suburbs, including Wattle Grove, which is only a stone's throw from the site. In the last 10 years 300,000 people have moved into the suburbs near the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area already has Australia's only nuclear reactor, which I have referred to earlier, and the largest garbage tip in the Southern Hemisphere. The site has significant cultural value; it contains a number of Aboriginal sites. A recent unpublished survey by the Australian museum of the Holsworthy site shows that the land supports examples of sandstone vegetation and rarer Cumberland Plain vegetation. Living in this environment are endangered frogs and reptiles, koalas and quolls. I know that Senator Brownhill is concerned about those sorts of things. In fact this is one of the few remaining healthy koala colonies in the Sydney region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Holsworthy site is part of a catchment area for the Georges River. The western site of the airport will sit almost on the bank of the river. The erosion and siltation due to the construction process will be more than the river can bear, not to mention the effect of increased aircraft and car pollution in the area. The Georges River supports a number of sensitive mangrove bird and fish breeding grounds. The residents of south&hyphen;western Sydney have objected to the airport on environmental grounds and because it will affect the quality of life, as I have already mentioned, of 430,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a more pragmatic perspective, how would an airport at Holsworthy cope with the massive floods which historically affect the Liverpool&hyphen;Holsworthy area? How will the flood plains be affected by the massive earthworks required by the airport and associated infrastructure? There are high costs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> associated with clearing up unexploded ordnances in the military site. There are topographical problems. The land is very uneven, with deep ravines. This is the madness that this government is proposing in the geographic area that is proposed for Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Waste cannot be used to fill the ravines because of settlement problems. One hundred and forty million cubic tonnes of earth landfill would have to be found to level the site. Sutherland council told the Senate aircraft noise committee that they doubted whether there was enough landfill anywhere in Sydney to fill the ravines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The southern part of Holsworthy was rejected as a possible site in the 1980s because of the constraints already mentioned. The northern part of the site was advocated by the Pickrell group, which I have referred to earlier, but that part is too close to the residential areas. In contrast, the MANS study in the 1970s pointed to Badgerys Creek as a suitable site for a second Sydney airport. The same report rejected Holsworthy, as I have said already. Although there is some local opposition to an airport at Badgerys Creek, the proposal has a great deal of local support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Liverpool council, a very large council in Sydney, and other local bodies in the area have welcomed Badgerys Creek and indeed have planned infrastructure on the assumption that the airport would go ahead. In contrast, Liverpool and Bankstown councils have vowed to fight the Holsworthy proposal. It is not insignificant that the Liberal Party has dodged the by&hyphen;election in the Bankstown area. They know the people of Bankstown know they will be affected and are angry about this government's betrayal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has already spent $800,000 on the Badgerys Creek site. No-one will be living within 15 kilometres of the Badgerys Creek airport site. That contrasts the thousands who currently live within 15 kilometres of Kingsford Smith airport. Suburbs such as Sutherland, Engadine, Waterfall, Menai, Woronora, Lucas Heights, Milperra, Panania, Revesby, Padstow, Picnic Point, Fairfield, Granville, Hammondville, Chipping Norton, Moorebank, Guildford, Chester Hill, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1499"> Parramatta and Lidcombe will be affected. The proposed east&hyphen;west runway points directly at Minto and Macquarie Fields. Planes will fly over both Westmead and Auburn hospitals and the long-established retirement village of Hammondville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for getting away from it all by going bushwalking or camping in the Royal National Park. This national park is one of the oldest in the world, but to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and this government it is just another flight path. Minister Sharp is calling Holsworthy `an insurance policy'. That is the ultimate insult. Meanwhile, there is no insurance and no security for the thousands of people who would be affected by this proposal. Their lives are on hold. They cannot sell their homes. They could not move out of the path of destruction even if they wanted to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Sharp has added fuel to the fire by emphasising Holsworthy's supposed advantages as a site. One of those advantages is that the site is big enough to accommodate future expansion&mdash;whatever that means. It is cold comfort for the people of south&hyphen;western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must comment on the member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, who is a Liberal member of parliament. She says that, when she was a candidate, she did not know about the possible Holsworthy airport site. Robert Tickner certainly did. He spoke out. The Sutherland council spoke out. I know she does not live in the electorate, but that is not the real problem. The real problem is that she is not believable because she has no excuse for not defending the people of her electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to completely move away from the Holsworthy airport issue, but I do want to speak about another injustice. Michelle Cornwell was a deputy clerk of the Queensland parliament. She is a conservative, non-radical person devoted to the enhancement of parliamentary democracy, but this is too much for the National&hyphen;Liberal Party government of Queensland. She has been sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michelle Cornwell organised a number of seminars to assist the Queensland parliament set up a committee system, including an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> estimates committee process, in which I and other senators participated on several occasions. This was done under a Labor government as part of the development of the checks and balances needed for executive government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the barbarians are back in Queensland. The sons and daughters of Bjelke-Petersen are now turning back the clock, and Michelle Cornwell&mdash;who many senators will recall worked in the Senate as a senior officer with impeccable, professional impartiality&mdash;has been crudely sacked. I support her work in the development of a code of conduct for members of parliament. I feel shock and horror if the review caused her sacking. A review of the pecuniary interests of members of parliament might have been the catalyst for her elimination. Whatever the reasons, it is a scandal. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.50 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I am very indebted to my colleague Senator Childs for tonight making some comments about the proposed Holsworthy airport. I am not sure whether this is the first time in the Senate's history that it has had two adjournment speeches on the same topic, but I also intend to make some comments in regard to what is a disastrous proposal for the people living in the Sutherland shire and in and around the Holsworthy area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In yesterday's matters of public interest debate I made a speech with respect to this issue. I detailed the fact that, during the hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney, Senator Parer, the chairman of that committee and also at that time the shadow minister for transport, never once raised the proposal to construct an airport or to consider an airport at the Holsworthy site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some evidence was presented by a group known as the North Shore Action Group, which was represented by a Mr Pickrell. Tonight my colleague Senator Childs also referred to Mr Pickrell's evidence. That group put to the committee the possible option of having an airport at Holsworthy. Indeed, Mr <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1500"> Pickrell identified in his evidence to the committee all the reasons why we would never want to put an airport at Holsworthy and then proceeded to try to argue that we might be able to overcome some of the issues, such as by moving mountains to put airports where those mountains once were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, like every other member of the committee, was surprised that this was even raised during the committee's inquiries. I understand that the proposal for an airport at Holsworthy had been dismissed many years ago. Indeed, in the early 1980s there was an examination of possible sites for a second airport in Sydney, and Holsworthy was ranked ninth out of 10 possibilities in a study conducted by Kinhill and Stearn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was surprised, and I think most people were surprised. I think Senator Parer was surprised at the time. Senator Parer never asked any questions and neither did Senator Woods, who was a member of that committee. They never made any comment at all when this evidence was given. Indeed, I can recall&mdash;and I have checked the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that on that day Senator Parer was most anxious to conclude the hearing as it was getting rather late in the day when the submission was put up. I certainly gained the impression that coalition members of the committee were totally uninterested in this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, I raised the issue in the committee's deliberations when the Sutherland Council gave evidence, because I questioned them very closely about this proposal. Again, neither Senator Parer nor any other coalition senator asked any questions or commented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a huge <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of over 1,300 pages, there is no other situation where the proposal for an airport at Holsworthy was put before the committee as a realistic proposition. I raise that because, in answer to a question earlier this week, Senator Parer gave the impression to the Senate that this had been raised on a number of occasions. Last Tuesday he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that another airport is required in the Sydney region. That is the reason why Mr Sharp has done this. Any implications of secret agreements are absolute rubbish. Certainly, a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposal was made: it was not unique; they were not the only ones who made it. I have forgotten how many people actually put that proposal to our committee, but it was quite a number, as Senator Forshaw will know.</PARA>
<PARA>`How many' he asked of me, and I interjected, `Two.' Senator Parer continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two. Did you check them out, Senator Forshaw? We asked the question, naturally, in the committee&mdash;this is all on the record&mdash;why Holsworthy was not the final choice.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to outline the reasons. Senator Parer's memory on that occasion was a bit hazy. But it is very clear on the record that the proposal with regard to Holsworthy was not something that was advocated by a lot of witnesses to the committee. It was raised by one group, the North Shore Action Group. As I said, at no stage were they questioned, nor was any comment made during the proceedings by any of the coalition senators&mdash;particularly Senator Parer, as chairman of that committee&mdash;regarding this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, in the majority report of the committee, comprising coalition senators Parer, Woods and Sandy Macdonald, together with Senator Bourne from the Democrats, there was really only one relevant mention of Holsworthy, and that is at page 324 of the committee's report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to doubts about the suitability of Badgery's Creek, Airservices Australia advised the Committee that these two issues were addressed in the 1985 EIS.</PARA>
<PARA>They were issues in respect of fog and winds. The majority report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Others proposed sites in various forms which they considered more suitable. These included Holsworthy, Richmond, Goulburn and a Sydney seadrome floating approximately 5 kilometres east of the North Head of Botany Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that a number of these locations were examined and rejected in 1984. The Committee is satisfied that Badgery's Creek is an appropriate site for a second Sydney airport. Embarking on another lengthy process of site evaluation will only postpone a now quite urgent decision.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise those last two sentences: the committee was satisfied that Badgerys Creek was an appropriate site and, further, that embarking on another lengthy process of site evaluation would only postpone a now quite <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1501"> urgent decision. Those were the comments of the majority of members of the committee. Of course, the members who put forward a minority report&mdash;Senator Neal, Senator Childs and I&mdash;naturally agreed with that part of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of what has now become public knowledge regarding the secret proposal made to the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, Senator Parer and others, that statement in that majority report was made even though the coalition was clearly considering putting Holsworthy back on the agenda. But they had to keep it a secret because of the electoral and political consequences if it had been made public before or during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very familiar with the area of the Hughes electorate. I happen to live in it. I have made that known quite clearly to members of the Senate and the committee at the time. I know the outrage that would have been generated if such a proposal had been made public. That outrage is now being generated by the community in the Hughes electorate. Local issues were important in the Hughes electorate in terms of this campaign, particularly issues regarding road access and services. My colleague Senator Childs has referred to some of the characteristics of this electorate&mdash;the Lucas Heights reactor, the military range, the army base, the unexploded ordnances, the Heathcote and Royal national parks, the environmental and Aboriginal heritage sites, and the Woronora Dam and catchment area, which provides water for up to half a million people in the Sutherland Shire and surrounding areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that if this proposal had been on the table during that election campaign, there would have been absolute community outrage. I have no doubt that Danna Vale, the Liberal candidate for Hughes, would not now be the member for that seat, because Robert Tickner was on the record with respect to this proposal. But nothing ever came forth from the candidate for the Liberal Party, from Mr Howard or from Senator Parer&mdash;people who were aware of this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I point out also that Mr Howard, the then Leader of the Opposition, gave evidence to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Senate committee himself. He did so as the member for Bennelong and also in his capacity as the Leader of the Opposition. He was most concerned about the effect on his own electorate of the aircraft noise issue. But he never once told the committee about this secret meeting, this secret agenda for an airport at Holsworthy. Indeed, in his evidence, he restated his commitment to Sydney West airport. He said there was a short&hyphen;term solution, which was reopening the east&hyphen;west runway, and a long&hyphen;term solution to build a second airport, and his party was committed to the building of that airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was on the record in the committee as supporting that situation&mdash;never once men</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No similar errors have been detected on the 1996 calendar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) 23,000 copies were produced in 1995 at a cost of $148,000 and 23,000 copies of the 1996 Calendar were produced at an estimated cost of $158,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Approximately 7,200 copies of each of the 1995 and 1996 Calendars were distributed to the Bureau's volunteer rainfall observers and cooperative observers around Australia, in recognition of their contribution to the national climate data base and in order to assist in their appreciation of the significance of their efforts in support of the public  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1503"> weather and warning services network. A further 3,000 copies each of the 1995 Calendar and 2,150 of the 1996 Calendars were distributed on a complimentary (in several cases exchanged) basis to overseas National Meteorological Services, Australian Heads of Missions overseas, Federal and State Environment Ministers, Parliamentary colleagues of the Minister (1995 only) and to agencies that the Bureau of Meteorology works closely with (e.g. State Emergency Services, Fire Authorities etc.) in the delivery of forecast and warning services to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Approximately 12,800 copies of the 1995 Calendar and 13,500 copies of the 1996 Calendar were made available for sale through the Public Relations Unit of the Bureau's Head Office in Melbourne and through its Regional and Field Offices in each State and the NT. These copies are offered to the public for $12 over the counter without cylinder, $13 over the counter with cylinder, or $15 if postage within Australia is required. Copies are sold to Bureau staff for $10 and a limited number (200) are sold to the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (AMOS), which makes an `in kind' contribution to production of the Calendar, for $6 each.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The primary purpose of the Calendar is to promote greater understanding of the science of meteorology and to improve the effectiveness of community understanding and application of meteorological information and services. The price of the Calendar is set at a level which enables the Bureau to recover the costs of production and distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The setting of the price of the Calendar is based on careful pre&hyphen;estimates of the costs of staff time, printing and distribution. Some allowance is made for damaged stock and the return of unsold stock. In the past two years, damaged stock has been small and most of the available stock sold, resulting in a small profit. For the 1995 Calendar the profit was $7,599 and for the 1996 Calendar a profit of around $9,500 is estimated.</PARA>
