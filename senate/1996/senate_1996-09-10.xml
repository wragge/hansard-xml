<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor knew before the election that its target of 5 per cent unemployment by the year 2000 was unachievable; it had been told that. I know that's absolutely certain that they knew.</PARA>
<PARA>In saying this, Minister, why did you ignore the advice from your department, which you were given after the election, that its projections for unemployment were consistent with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an average annual growth rate of 2.2% for total employment [which] is considered to be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down to 5 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice, Senator Bolkus, that you did not assert in your question that I am wrong in alleging that. If you want to allege that I am wrong, I am happy for you to do so and I am happy to check the matter out. It is certainly my understanding that the Labor Party went <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consistently through the election saying things that it knew were not true&mdash;certainly with respect to whether the budget was in order. That is what your government did. It went from election meeting to election meeting saying that the budget was in the black and everything was okay, but that simply was not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received a range of advice from my department and from other people as to what the projections might be for employment and unemployment. As you would probably understand, Senator Bolkus, each of those estimations made by either the department or other people are based on certain assumptions. If the assumptions change, the outcomes change. I would have thought that was perfectly obvious</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Is the minister aware of a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart Mercury</EMPHASIS>  which says that Senator Lyn Allison claimed that, once Telstra was partly privatised, country people would have to pay much more for telephone services? Is the minister further aware of the opposition party's conclusion in the report of the Senate committee inquiring into the Telstra bill that the partial privatisation of Telstra would be responsible for extensive job losses in Telstra? How accurate are these concerns, and did the weight of evidence in the inquiry support these propositions?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3109" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I did see the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart Mercury</EMPHASIS>  where Senator Allison was quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Country areas will be completely abandoned after privatisation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>and that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the move to user-pays would be devastating to rural areas, with the cost of connecting a phone to rise dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA>We then got a series of figures in a table, which presumably were designed to frighten the pants off anyone who did not understand the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts of the matter are this. Irrespective of privatisation, there is already legislation in place&mdash;which will not alter if and when the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill goes through&mdash;that imposes and maintains the universal service obligations. That ensures that, to the extent that services to rural and remote areas are uneconomic, the cost is borne by all of the carriers. In other words, they contribute to a universal service levy, and they will pay pro rata on their revenue&mdash;currently, it is on market share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no misunderstanding. Those arrangements will continue to apply irrespective of privatisation&mdash;just as they do in America, which has always had privately owned carriers. Indeed, at the conference of APEC telecommunications ministers last week, one of the three major agenda items was how they could extend the concept of universal service obligations. In other words, every country&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I explained to them how we are a world leader. They were very interested in getting a briefing from me. The only thing that disappointed them was that they were absolutely amazed that the Labor Party was opposed to privatisation. They said that, when they talked to people from the opposition, they were told, `Never mind, it is political. We understand the logic, but it is political,' and they were very disappointed. That is the first thing to be said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the question related to the extent to which partial privatisation could be responsible for extensive job losses. I see that Martin Ferguson was saying the same sort of thing in a press release today. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3110"> important thing to remember is that between 1991 and 1995 Telstra underwent 25,000 job reductions. It did that without any industrial disputation and against the background of an acknowledgment by the union sector that these were technology driven changes. In giving evidence to the committee, Ian McLean, Branch Secretary of the CEPU, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think there will be a difference in the number of jobs, but they will not&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CARR" NAMEID="AW5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a moment, sport. If Senator Carr will just listen, Mr McLean said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think there will be a difference in the number of jobs, but they will not be working for Telstra; they will be working for Skilled Engineering or some other contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>Colin Cooper, Divisional President of the CEPU, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have agreed in some areas that there can be staff reductions. We have been through all these processes with new technology.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tierney asked Mr McLean:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These job losses are primarily driven by technology?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McLean said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The major driver is technology . . . the union recognises that.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tierney said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What you are telling us is that the basic driving force that has been reducing the work force over the last few years is technology driven.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cooper said yes. Mr Allan Horsley, the Managing Director of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the industry is desperately short of people.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .. if, as a result of any process, this or just management changes in Telstra result in fewer employees, those employees will pick up work, without a doubt, outside.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not overstating the case to say that demand is enormous.</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman of the Service Providers Action Network said precisely the same thing&mdash;that there is an acute shortage of staff in the telecommunications industry today. He went on to say that all others in the industry were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having trouble getting good people. In other words, there will not be a reduction in total employment in the industry; indeed, there will be a boom as a result of a more efficient Telstra, a more dynamic industry and a more competitive environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far as Labor's proposals are concerned in relation to the budget, they would force the government to run deficits into the next century. The proposals put forward last week by the Leader of the Opposition are nothing more than cold calculated vandalism by an irrelevant opposition to destroy the integrity of this budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's rampant bankcard spending spree was bad enough. Then they tried to hide the bill. Now they are trying to add another $18 billion over the next four years to that bankcard bill which, on their leaving office, was no less than $100 billion. That is not a bill that the coalition government wanted to have to pay. Labor's bill should never have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been run up in the first place. Unlike Labor, this government is doing the hard yards and is going to pay this bill in full. We did not cause the problem&mdash;Labor caused the problem&mdash;but we have accepted the responsibility to fix it. Whilst we accept the responsibility to fix it, Labor seems determined to prevent us from doing that by frustrating and sabotaging it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of Labor's proposals would be to increase interest rates above what they otherwise would be. We know that Australians want and need lower interest rates. Lower interest rates are good for home buyers and they are good for small business. They also mean more investment, more growth and more jobs and hope for the unemployed&mdash;the thousands upon thousands of people ignored so terribly by Labor in government. So the opposition's sabotage does threaten Australia with higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the budget, home fixed loan rates have fallen. For example, the Commonwealth Bank has cut its three&hyphen;year fixed loan rate from 9.5 to 8.7 per cent and other banks have followed suit. This budget is a very fair budget and it is a very responsible budget. It is an honest budget.

The minister is reported as saying that groups such as superannuants should not be allowed to raid the public purse. Is it not true that the group who will lose most from this change in policy will be those people receiving a disability support pension? Will the minister confirm that in the next financial year the government will, by virtue of this change, save over $40 million from disability support pensioners? Is this not a false economy as the government will eventually be required to pay these people higher levels of age pension?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Woodley for his question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have said that in this, as in other areas, as a matter of principle, people who have assets should be expected to make use of them before they call on the taxpayer for support. Most Australians do not believe that to be unfair. If somebody is over 55 and has been out of the work force for nine months, then we should look to including their superannuation entitlements in the means test, as has happened with the age pensioners. That has been the case with anybody over 65. As Daryl Dixon has pointed out, there has been essentially an anomaly for some time. Financial advisers have been telling people what to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be able to say to young Australians that into their hands we have put a land of opportunity, a land where they can get appropriate training, a land where they can expect to get a job&mdash;not any job but a good job; a real job&mdash;and a land where they can make a career choice on what they want to be, not simply on the basis of where they think they can get a job. That is the reason that we are committed to getting the budget back into the black.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those on the opposite side&mdash;the big spenders over there&mdash;thought that they could just spend, spend, spend, put it all on the bankcard, because they are not the people who would have to pay the debt. They wanted to saddle young Australians with a massive debt. They wanted to rob young Australians of the future opportunities that they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last five years of Labor government were characterised by a dependency on debt and deficit. General government debt increased from $17 billion in 1990 to $96 billion in 1995&hyphen;96. The previous government's short&hyphen;term spending spree was a very cruel hoax played out on young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there had not been an adjustment&mdash;if we do not get the adjustments we need in this budget&mdash;general government debt would have increased to $120 billion by the year 2000, an increase of over 600 per cent in just on 10 years. Senators opposite do not like to hear this, because they understand that it is the future generations of young Australians who will be landed with this debt&mdash;not the people over there but future generations of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, yes, it is true that into their hands we do put a land of great opportunity. But, sadly, the former government put on their shoulders a very heavy burden&mdash;a burden of enormous government debt, a burden of fiscal irresponsibility and a burden of high unemployment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year's budget requires 7.5 per cent of all outlays to meet the debt that was accumulated by Labor. In dollar terms, that is $10 billion&mdash;$10 billion going to pay interest that could have gone into other things. This government is prepared to make the tough decisions to ensure that our young Australians have a very positive future to look forward to. We will not walk away from the responsibility and we will not rack up debt like the previous government did.

But they do think it is fair enough that the 15 per cent of Australians who have had that chance, and continue to have it, make a higher contribution. Fortunately, that percentage is changing. As you probably do know, 25 per cent of school leavers now get an opportunity to go into higher education. But let me remind you, Senator West, that they are the lucky ones. They get a degree&mdash;an internationally portable document recognising their skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, as you may understand, kids who do not get that chance and opportunity, the remaining 75 per cent, do not get an internationally portable document recognising their skills. They do not end up with half the unemployment rate that others end up with. They are not the upper, middle and high income earners of tomorrow, as university students are. It is not unreasonable to ask university students when they start earning&mdash;not before&mdash;to pay back more quickly; to start paying back when they earn $20,700; to pay back a movie ticket a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know that 25 per cent of young Australians go and look for a job? They pay taxes and contribute towards the higher education system. Another 25 go into industry and get industry training or go to TAFE, but none of them end up with the same opportunities that people who get the benefit of going through higher education do. So my view about people from higher education who want to say, `No. We don't want to pay any more. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Make the others pay,' is that this is the very ugly face of self-interest.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister for Social Security relates to sole parents. The overwhelming consensus of research into sole parent families shows that throughout the 13 years of the Labor government, poverty among sole parent families actually increased, even taking welfare pay <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3119"> ments into account. The UNICEF report released earlier this year found that a massive 56 per cent of children from single parent families headed by women were living below the poverty line. Other reports have confirmed this. Minister, even though Labor created this problem for sole parents, what is this government doing about it?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3119" SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important question which,  it is quite interesting to note, has received little or no attention from the opposition. They have been going around Australia madly trying to frighten one group after another. They have not started yet on lone parents, and for that I am at least a little grateful&mdash;that some of the poorest families in Australia are being protected from their scare tactics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that we went to the election with a hefty problem to deal with. We gave commitments to those who are the most poor and needy in our community. We have kept our promises. We have kept the promises, particularly to the lone parents. We have said that the existing qualification for the sole parent pension would be maintained. We have kept that promise. We promised to maintain the real value of pensions and, of course, that is of critical importance to the sole parents. The pension benchmark is being kept at 25 per cent of average total male weekly earnings. The pension rate is going to be maintained and indexed twice yearly. Once again, that is important to lone pensioners who have to know what the certainty is of their income in the future. The current income and assets test thresholds will be indexed yearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall, Madam President, that we promised also to do something significant for all families, particularly those who have one income and who are raising young children, through the family tax initiative. We delivered on that in this budget. The family tax initiative recognises the high cost of raising children and the high incidence of poverty amongst lone parent families. It is going to significantly reduce the financial pressures faced by those families in raising children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you an example. A lone parent with two children, one of them under five, will be $900 a year, or $34.64 a fortnight, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> better off as a result of the family tax initiative. That will be paid in a fortnightly cash amount along with their existing family payments. Contrast that with Labor's assistance to sole parents in the last budget. That was $4 a fortnight. I think they are still waiting for the last bit of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised to maintain a very important program that lone parents get a great deal of benefit from, that is, the JET program&mdash;the jobs, education and training program&mdash;and we have kept that promise. We have also retained the education entry payment for pensioners because that happens to be a very  valuable initiative for sole parent pensioners. We have maintained that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard somebody interjecting about child care programs. I have noticed that the advocates from the opposition are solely for yuppies in the high income areas. They are not prepared to acknowledge that we have protected low income families and that our measures will be particularly important in areas of high social disadvantage. They will be important to families where there are children with special needs, they will be important to families who live in rural and remote areas and they will be important to those community centres currently on public funding and which are going to get extra income over the next couple of years or so to restructure their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have maintained the operational subsidy for the family day care scheme, which is very much welcomed by all parents. Lone parents make particular use of it because it is, effectively, provision of care by a neighbour and somebody they know and trust. In many areas, lone parents have a lot to be pleased about in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have visited the Council for the Single Mother and her Child and they were very worried because of this scare campaign that was being run before the budget. They are now pleased to know that we have kept our promises to them. We have looked after those families who are in the greatest difficulty in Australia. What we need to do now, and what we are working on through our budget measures generally, is to see that more work is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3120"> available for those who can and want to work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made a decision in the lead-up to this budget that there ought to be a better balance in relation to that proportion paid by the users of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Harradine for his question. It reflects his ongoing concern about refugees and people in circumstances of humanitarian need. So far as the particular case that he has raised is concerned, I am advised that in relation to the situation of Ms Xhang and her one&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter there have been a number of what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3121"> have been described as very emotive claims of sexual abuse&mdash;I am not saying you are making that claim, Senator Harradine&mdash;regarding her situation but those claims have, in turn, been refuted by Ms Xhang herself. Ms Marion Le, who is Ms Xhang's migration agent, claims in her press release dated 29 August that Ms Xhang has been subjected to abuse while in the care of the department at its detention centres in Western Australia and at Villawood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that Ms Xhang recently met with a departmental officer and, in the presence of Ms Le, Ms Xhang denied the allegations of abuse. Indeed, on the contrary, Ms Xhang stated that she had had no problems with the staff or officers at the detention centres in Western Australia or at Villawood. Ms Le also claims that Ms Xhang's treatment has been `disgraceful and would not be tolerated for an animal'. In fact, Ms Xhang's accommodation arrangements and care have, I am advised, been very carefully considered by the department to take account of her particular circumstances. She has received constant and ongoing medical attention, including access to a range of specialist nurses who have provided, at times, 24&hyphen;hour care, and also social welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the point made in Ms Le's press release, it appears that some of those claims are not correct. I understand she has now pursued the various review processes available to her, but I will get you a fuller report on that and come back to you as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More generally, in relation to claims of sexual abuse that have been made from time to time in similar circumstances, I am advised no claims of sexual abuse have been substantiated. Any incidents of physical abuse are dealt with by management or are reported to the police. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs takes its duty of care to detainees very seriously, especially in the case of unaccompanied women and minors. All detainees have access to centre management, and nursing and welfare staff at all times. Interpreters are always available and all unaccompanied minors are given special attention and care. Where possible, alternative <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accommodation and care is sought for them in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of adults and within the constraints of a detention environment, the department does not interfere in matters involving choice of life preferences, unless those choices contravene Australian law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), to a question without notice asked by Senator Woodley today, relating to the eligibility of people over 55 years old to receive social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the answer given to me this afternoon by Senator Newman. The information she gave was useful but there were a number of questions which I think were far more pertinent, which she did not answer. I believe that, in giving the answer, particularly in relationship to a couple of questions that I asked yesterday, the answer I received today must have some doubt cast over it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the questions that I asked was: would the minister confirm that, in the next financial year, the government will save over $40 million from disability support pensioners? I really have difficulty reconciling the answer that Senator Newman gave that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reason the government is pursuing this issue is that those who are seeking advice of financial advisers are then able to rearrange their affairs to unjustly get themselves a pension. I have the information that, in terms of disability support pensioners, this is not the situation. In fact, many of these will be caught perhaps unintentionally by the government's action and will suffer greatly from this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the other problem in this whole issue that the government needs to address is the problem of the disincentive that this will be for people to put money away for their retirement. It seems to me that the government is trying to have it two ways. It is trying to protect, as it says, the public purse but, in fact, what it will do is make worse the problem we have at the moment of trying to enable people to fund their own retirement. The government can have it one way or it can have it the other, but it cannot have it both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason that I have problems with Senator Newman's answer is that yesterday she said she did not know whether or not 600,000 people were suffering as a result of the measure I referred to yesterday. In fact, those were the figures given in the budget papers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the other issue I raised about pensioners who were unable to access the five per cent pension deeming accounts with banks, I checked with all the major banks and discovered that the National Bank and Westpac do limit the offer of five per cent interest to age pensioners. The Commonwealth Bank and the Bank of Queensland are a little more expansive, and it is only the ANZ which offers five per cent to all low income accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the real problem that people are having with the government's actions in this regard is that, whether intentionally or not, the government is penalising people who have very little ability to cope with the extra burden which the government is placing upon them through its actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator NEWMAN</EMPHASIS> (Tasmania&mdash;Minister for Social Security and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3124"> (3.16 p.m.)&mdash;Senator Woodley addressed two questions rather than the one he asked me today. I have arranged for a very detailed answer to the question he asked me yesterday. He will find when he receives it that, with regard to the assessment he made about the number of banks providing low level accounts with deeming arrangements, the number is greater than he thought. It is correct that there are some financial institutions which are not providing them to people in receipt of allowances. In fact, that is their rule; it is not the rule of the government. The government expects them to provide it to pensioners and those in receipt of allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the question of superannuation and disability support pensioners, which he referred to in his question today, I think it is important to quickly go over some of the things I mentioned in my answer. Superannuation assets are to be treated just like any other financial investment for those who are over 55 but below age pension age. Once people turn 55 and retire, they can access their superannuation in most cases and we can protect those who cannot access their superannuation. People will only be affected once they have been in receipt of a benefit for at least nine months. There will be little effect on those with small amounts of super. If you are a pensioner couple with your own home, $78,000 in super and no other financial assets, your pension will not be affected. A single disability support pensioner could have up to $45,000 in total financial investments, including super, and still not be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my answer, Jenny Macklin, on Friday, 30 August, put out a press release suggesting that the average amount held in a super account is $38,000. Therefore, most people will not be affected. For those with larger superannuation assets who are affected, the income they generate from their superannuation will more than compensate for the loss of allowance and pension, because their super capital will continue to grow. That is something which has not been well understood. They are not being required to waste away their capital. They are expected to make use of what income is available to them before they take on the totality of a pension <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or an allowance. Therefore, just like any other asset in the assets test, they have to look at what they are potentially in receipt of and then their entitlement is determined on that basis. But that does not mean they are eating into their capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a shame, but I understand the complexity of this issue. It may well be that that has been Senator Woodley's problem. I have got one other example here: for a pensioner couple with $56,000 in superannuation, a house valued at $200,000, other assets of $50,000, and $20,000 in the bank producing interest, there is no reduction in pension.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not wicked, Senator; it is a fact that what you have determined in this budget will lead to a reduction in benefits for older unemployed Australians. That is a fact. Of course, prior to this budget super assets held by people over the age of 55 who lost their jobs or who could not work because of sickness or disability were exempt from the income and assets test on social security payments. This encouraged those people to preserve their super&mdash;usually, of course, super in small amounts. They could preserve their super until they reached pension age. That was the situation. They got the most out of their superannuation and maximised their income once they reached retiring age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation proposed by this government is that super assets are no longer exempt. That saves this mean minded, mean spirited, cruel government $225 million. This means that 54,500 people, mainly people on mature age allowance, will have their payments reduced, and that 12,900 people, mainly on disability <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3125"> support pension, will have their payments cancelled. That is what this budget measure means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Counting superannuation assets under the income assets test means that you will have to work out how you survive on a much lower payment or draw on your super early. If you are forced to draw on your income stream from your superannuation at that age, you will have to sign a statutory declaration stating that you are retired even if you genuinely would like to engage in some form of employment at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite obvious, even to the economic illiterates on the other side of this chamber, that this sort of short-sighted policy of spend your superannuation now does obviously diminish national savings. So this is a cruel and very mean minded measure from this government. We have a situation where there is a very significant reduction in benefits for older Australians. It really underscores the meanness of Mr Howard's and Mr Costello's budget. It really underscores the mean mindedness of the Liberal Party. The measure jeopardises the superannuation of those whose jobs are at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Senate that the callousness of the Howard&hyphen;Costello budget, the mean minded callousness of this budget, is demonstrated by this budget measure alone. You stand condemned for what you have perpetrated on older Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

Let me just try to get into the thick skulls of the people on the other side of the chamber the fact that you cannot keep spending and spending and spending. One day the chickens come home to roost. I went out to talk to a group of young primary school students learning about parliament and one of them said, `Why did you get into parliament?'

We were left, not a budget deficit, but a country that was in a situation where the world was our oyster.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we passing onto the next generation? We are passing on a living standard which is worse than the one we inherited.

The people on the other side want to borrow, borrow, borrow from overseas to spend on things we cannot afford. In this budget we have tried to make the savings across the board and as fair as possible. The Australian public has realised that we all have to tighten our belts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to one of the issues that has been raised today about superannuation, financial advisers have told us, and have told me, that they advise people that they can put their superannuation into a rollover fund that they cannot get to and then go onto unemployment benefits or some form of mature age allowance. I do not think that is fair and cricket, especially when it is a large amount of money. Senator Newman pointed out that there are a large number of people who will not be affected by this.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many, not all&mdash;and, I must admit, there are many people who have become unemployed at an older age&mdash;who have chosen to retire early are in fact double dipping. I do not believe that is fair. We have tried to ensure that this budget is as fair as possible. The Labor Party is running around with furphies indicating that people will have to draw down all their superannuation, that they will be left with nothing, and that is absolutely wrong. They are going out and frightening older people, or people over 55, by saying that that is the case. That is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman has explained very clearly what will happen. If a person has been on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3126"> income support for over nine months, of course this will take effect. Upon reaching age 55, the Superannuation Act says it will form part of their financial investments for the means test purpose after September 1997. If they are a married couple and own their own home, and if their only other income is from financial investments, they would need to have more than $78,000 invested to be affected under the income test. They would also need more than $176,000 in assets, other than their home, to be affected under the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that many people out in the community would say, `I think that is reasonable. If they have that level of assets, maybe they should be contributing in some way to their own support and not be calling on the taxpayer.' If you go across the country and look at all the demands that are being placed on taxpayers' funds, we have to agree that we have to take a fair share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have tried to protect those on low incomes and to actually look at those who have in fact had a tax benefit through the superannuation scheme. It is a fair system. To have the Labor people on the other side saying that people will have to deplete all their superannuation is a nonsense. It is a furphy. It is misleading the Australian public and scaring older people, which I find despicable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do they do? They try to pick on very small bits and pieces in the budget, misrepresent them to the electorate, set up a straw man to knock it down.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3127">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sure, it inflicts some substantial cuts. Why does it have to inflict those substantial cuts? Because of the overspending of the previous government. We were left with a legacy that has to be cleaned up and the Australian people understand that. They accept that we were left with a mess and that we have taken on the responsibility of cleaning up that mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that reason that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Evans, admitted in one of those rare insights he gives into himself that he was suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome. The reason is that he is trying to scare people about the budget and he is failing; they are not listening to him. And why aren't they listening to him? Because they did not listen to him and his party before the last federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And why don't the people of Australia listen to the Australian Labor Party? I don't have to quote myself. I can quote Gary Gray, the federal secretary, who came down with a report, ably assisted by Senator Sue Mackay. What did they say about the Labor Party? `When we promised something, the people of Australia would not believe us. We had broken so many promises that basically we were on the nose and, no matter what we said, the people of Australia would not believe us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, instead of changing their attitude to policy and government actions, they are continuing the same old line. `We will misrepresent, we will say that black is white, we will try anything to regain government.' They have not learnt the simple lesson: the people of Australia want some integrity back in the political debate. It is not good enough simply to say, `We will accept all the good things in a budget, but we will try to block some of those harsher things.' The people of Australia have seen the broad picture. They realise that we were left with a mess and that it needs to be fixed up. We have committed ourselves to cleaning up that mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to suggest to Senator Woodley and others who want to go nitpicking within the budget that they remember what was in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial, with the heading `Senate must not fiddle this Budget.' This <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pretty strong statement coming from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  believes the government strategy is essential to sound economic management and that undermining or delaying it would be against the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the Labor Party are having problems gaining some relevancy within the Australian body politic today. By nitpicking at our excellent budget, a budget which has been so overwhelmingly received, they will ensure that they remain in opposition. It is somewhat ironic that I should be speaking against the Labor Party in this brief debate because, quite frankly, the more they and the Democrats, and anybody else who cares to join them, nitpick on this budget, it will ensure that those people who do so will remain in opposition and we will remain the government. The bottom line is: this budget has been an excellent budget well received by the Australian people.

<PARA>The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) indicated that she felt that the changes to education would produce a better system of higher education in this country. The reality is that what she has been saying outside this place is that those who complain about these changes are the `ugly face of self-interest'. She defined the students who were protesting as `little brutes squealing like stuck pigs'. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3128">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of all this is that the minister is introducing a new system of distribution for higher education which allocates university places according to wealth rather than merit. That is the impact of the changes that this government is proposing to force through this Senate. That is the impact of their changes which have seen in excess of $500 million taken away from student assistance. In terms of Austudy and in terms of changes to the HECS scheme we have seen money coming out to the tune of $241 million. In terms of the operating grants to universities, quite massive changes are occurring in those universities, which sees a fundamental shift in the way in which education is allocated in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Massive equity problems are being introduced by this government as a consequence of their action. What we are seeing, in effect, is a new regime being placed on this country in terms of higher education which would see wealthy students effectively being able to purchase their tertiary qualifications. What that does for equity and the long-term economic position of this country, where we see the `rich and thick' being able to secure their place at university on the basis of their wealth rather than their ability, to my mind is truly appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing a whole range of measures being taken, allegedly on the basis of equity, whereby the minister says that she will reduce the number of places available for students in this country on the basis of government funding and will replace them by allowing people with money to buy an education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What those changes have meant in the case of Victoria is some 4,090 fewer places in my state alone in this budget. They will be made up under this proposal to allow for people to maintain their place in a university by buying a place. That is the effect of the changes that she is seeking to introduce to this parliament&mdash;to allow Australians undertaking award courses to buy a place at a university.

<PARA>It is urgent that Australia should condemn the United States' offensive against Iraq on 4 and 5 September on the basis of its unilateral action of violence without the support of the UN or even regional allies. Through its unilateral action, the United States has shown contempt for the United Nations, failing to get United Nations or even regional support for its action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the weekend, the United States tried and failed to get a Security Council resolution to support their actions in Iraq.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a degree of regret that the opposition introduces this MPI today. We raise it because the future for the unemployed in Australia is bleak under this government; not just for the unemployed and for young people, for whom there is the prospect of very few jobs and the prospect of fewer places in tertiary institutions, but also for families, for whom this government prescribes a contractionary budget, a budget which will ensure that growth next year and the outgoing years is less than the growth in the economy over recent years. As a consequence, there will be fewer job opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also raise this matter today because of the government's cavalier insensitivity to the unemployed. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who sheds crocodile tears over the unemployed whilst he presides over a budget which reduces the growth rate in our economy. We have a Prime Minister who, whilst feigning concern, declines to set targets for unemployment in this country either for this year or for outgoing years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He leads the government; but it is led also by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who has not mentioned unemployment as a concern whilst he has been Treasurer. Not only that, he has actually tried to write unemployment out of the political agenda by writing it out politically from the Reserve Bank's charter. We also have a minister who shows no understanding, no sensitivity and no concern about unemployment or any aspect of her portfolio. She has no idea about economics, no idea about training and no idea about education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But she is responsible for these three critical areas&mdash;areas that provide life opportunities for so many hundreds of thousands of Australians. She is in charge of education, training, schools and work, but she has showed absolutely no application to the fundamental issues in these areas. She claimed in question time today that she is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fixing it. She is fixing it by having fewer university places, less funding for universities, fewer resources for schools and fewer jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a person to whom this government entrusts the life opportunities of Australia's future generations. She arrogantly dismisses any criticism or any commentary from whatever quarter it might come&mdash;high academic quarters or commentators in the media. They are all treated with the same disrespect, disregard and arrogance by this Marie Antoinette of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere better have we seen this government's disregard for the unemployed than in an interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS> with Senator Vanstone some few weeks ago. When you are looking at unemployment, when you are looking at jobs, you would like to know when the unemployment rate is going to come down. Catherine Job asked what sort of time frame was being looked at, and said, `So we are looking at months, a year, three years, a whole term before your policies do what you say they will do and start pulling unemployment down?' What does Amanda Vanstone say? She says, `Well, I don't really think there is much benefit for anybody, especially for the unemployed.' Is she nominating one month, two months, six months, 12 months or 18 months? How wrong can she be? If you are unemployed, you want to know when your job prospects are going to increase. But, for Amanda Vanstone, she does not care. There is not much benefit for anybody.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone to anyone, in fact. Calling her by her Christian name is probably one of the kindest things that has been done to her in recent months. When the unemployment rate goes down is one thing; how much it goes down is another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Catherine Job also asked her about targets. What was the response from Senator Vanstone in terms of targets? She said, `What targets do is shift your focus onto some notional target that you have invented or developed to satisfy the media's need to have a target.' Well, it is not that. Targets are also important for those who are concerned about unemployment. They are important to young <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3140"> people leaving school and to families who may be hitting the unemployment ranks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She does not care about when the unemployment rate is going to go down or about how much it will go down by. When asked, `Is it going to get better, Senator, before it gets worse?', she said, `That is another futile question, with the greatest of respect.' It goes on. This is a minister who shows absolute disregard for the issues and disregard for the people involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the reasons why we have raised this matter of public importance today. Another one is that, despite presiding over a budget that will increase unemployment, despite bringing forward estimates that will mean much higher unemployment than would have occurred in our economy, this minister's response, this government's response, is to not cater for unemployment, to not try to accommodate it, to not try to train or re&hyphen;skill the people involved, but to massively cut back on critical programs and to massively cut back on the structures&mdash;the CES or otherwise&mdash;that are so critical for people seeking employment. This is a government with no new ideas but with old prejudices, and that is what has driven their agenda in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A commitment in this area has to be of two basic characteristics, and that was a commitment that was shown by the previous federal government. Our concern for the jobless was, and continues to be, a genuine commitment. There needs to be the commitment, and we allocated significant energy and resources to the problem. And we did get results: over 700,000 new jobs in three years, which was something that the coalition said that we could never do, and real improvements in the rate of long&hyphen;term unemployment&mdash;a cut by some 35 per cent over three years of Working Nation. In fact, unemployment over that three&hyphen;year period of Working Nation went down from 11.7 per cent to 8.1 per cent&mdash;well towards achieving our target of five per cent by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two fundamentals in tackling unemployment. You have to have a goal and you have to have a genuine commitment, and this government has neither. Why not? Because the government is not concerned. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of secondary importance to them. It is of secondary importance to the extent that Peter Costello wanted to write it out of the Reserve Bank charter. The unemployed in this budget are being treated in the same way as the Aboriginal people, the elderly, migrants and all others who have been targeted by a malicious budget of this sort. Unemployment is of no real concern to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one central and disturbing reason for the government not setting targets and not showing a degree of concern. As was evidenced quite clearly in question time today, Senator Vanstone has indicated that some of the distortions that she has been putting out in the media in recent days have been not well based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big, fundamental situation was that Senator Vanstone has tried to portray unemployment as being about 8.5 per cent or thereabouts under the previous government's policies and strategies. But it was quite clear from the question and the answer today that she had been advised, on taking office, that unemployment was to go down to five per cent during the course of the next few years up to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone herself has also acknowledged that unemployment is more likely to rise than decrease. What sort of government is it which comes in with a commitment to reduce unemployment but, within just weeks of taking office, sheds that very fundamental and poor promise? Are the unemployed not of a core concern to you, Senator Vanstone? Are the unemployed not of a core concern to the government? It is quite clear that they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 21 August this year on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Triple J</EMPHASIS>, this minister was asked whether she was concerned that the government's new job programs would work better than the ones that they replaced. She said that, really, she was not concerned about that. She was concerned about getting competition. We have a minister who is presiding over a raft of cutbacks in necessary support mechanisms for the unemployed but also in necessary mechanisms to re&hyphen;skill and re&hyphen;train the unemployed to work in new job environments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in its approach in this area of cutbacks, has shown not just a degree of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3141"> social vandalism but also a degree of serial slashing. Gone are the jobskills programs, the landcare environment action plans, new work opportunities, job training, special intervention programs, accredited training for youth, skillshare and jobclubs. They are all gone, and regardless of whether organisations such as Access Economics give advice to the government to the effect that these programs are cost effective, these programs are working and these programs are producing necessary results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in its approach&mdash;as I say, serial slashing in this area&mdash;has seen fit to do away with the programs because they have a conservative approach to unemployment. First of all, it is not a major concern&mdash;not a core concern. Secondly, it is going to have to happen if we are going to get other aspects like inflation right. And, thirdly, the government has no role in supporting those who may be the victims of their policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Maggie Thatcher put it right when a couple of years ago&mdash;talking about her approach, the conservative approach, the Thatcher-Reagan approach to the victims of their economic policies&mdash;she said, `Our job is to glory in inequality. The poor will always be with us.' That is the sort of disregard this minister is showing to this particular sector. The minister has no real understanding of the economic issues. That is matched by no real commitment in terms of training and employment programs and matched by no real sensitivity to those who are the victims, and will be the victims, of her disregard and neglect in this area. No wonder she is increasingly being called the Marie Antoinette of this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am somewhat amazed that Senator Bolkus would have the sheer front to bring on a matter such as this, particularly when I look and see the previous government's record on unemployment. We must understand that the people opposite were in government for some 13 years. I think Senator Bolkus was there for all of those years. For a good many of them he was a minister and, therefore, bears some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> considerable responsibility for the position we now find ourselves in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of the day came into office on 2 March when the policies of people opposite were roundly rejected as not being effective. It is important to recognise the record of the previous government, now opposition. In 1990-91 we had an unemployment rate of 8.3 per cent. Then there is the consequence of their policies. In the following financial year, it went up to 10.3 per cent and then it went up to 11. Then it came down to 10.5 per cent and then down to 8.9 and then down to 8.5, which is basically where we are at this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So people opposite are complaining about us turning away from the unemployed when their record shows that at the commencement of this decade unemployment was around 8.3 per cent. In most of the years that they were in government subsequent to that, they pushed the unemployment rate up by their ineffectiveness and have only managed in the last two financial years to bring it down to what it now is. To somehow expect that in six months the damage done by 13 years of fiscal irresponsibility could be undone is, of course, sheer lunacy. But what Senator Bolkus complains of is our preparedness to tackle this problem, to tackle it in a different way from that which Labor would have done. The old `Spend, spend, spend. Shove it on the Bankcard. Don't worry. Let the younger generation pay for it later' is not the approach we take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is at the moment some further weakening in the labour market, and that further weakening started about 12 months before the coalition was elected. The trend employment&mdash;not the seasonally adjusted month&hyphen;to&hyphen;month business that jumps up and down all over the place&mdash;began to falter in April 1995. Employment grew by 4.6 per cent in the 12 months up to April 1995, but it only grew by 1.2 per cent in the 12 months after April 1995. That, of course, demonstrates the point I am making&mdash;that a further softening in the labour market was clearly evident in the previous 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a general framework for fixing these problems: balancing the budget, taking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3142"> the pressure off interest rates and, therefore, encouraging business investment. We have industrial relations reform, reforming unfair dismissal laws. We are also making the labour market more flexible. We have micro-economic reform and are reducing business costs, making exports more internationally competitive, taking the pressure off the current account deficit to allow the economy to grow&mdash;all of these things are things Labor was not prepared to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have said is that we are going to&mdash;in addition to the things I have mentioned, putting the budget back into the black and the other matters that I raised, such as industrial relations reform&mdash;very substantially reform the delivery of services to unemployed Australians because, quite simply, Working Nation was not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know the previous government in the last financial year spent, I think, $860 million on the three least effective brokered programs? They were programs that had effectiveness rates of 22 per cent up into the low 30s per cent; that is, they were about 70 per cent ineffective. They spent $860 million of hard earned taxpayers' money. This is not money that all comes from the so-called rich. It comes from very low income earners. Every dollar of theirs that we spend has to be spent carefully and effectively. We decided that that was not happening under the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before we get carried away with the deceit being perpetrated by arguments raised on the other side, let's just look at some of the facts. The facts are that we have planned to spend in the next four years more on labour market programs&mdash;</PARA>

Despite the rhetoric that we have heard in the chamber&mdash;including a lovely speech that Senator Vanstone gave in question time today about how it was hoped that young people would have an optimistic future in this country&mdash;we have seen very little vision or articulation of a strategy by this government to address unemployment and the various social and other economic problems that are associated with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Last week came an interesting, I thought, announcement or concession by the minister. She acknowledged that her government's policies would not necessarily improve the chances of employment in this country. She actually said that long-term employment levels could in fact rise and that it was theoretically possible that unemployment would be up to 8.5 per cent by the end of this decade. What a terrible truth for this government to have to admit. Does that not prove <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3144"> that even their own analyses and their own budget measures and proposals will continue to fail and will hit hardest at unemployed people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in this budget major cutbacks to areas that actually generate and support employment opportunities in this country. We have seen cuts to research and development. We have seen cuts to DIFF. We have seen a whole litany of election promises broken, whether it was the scrapping of DIFF or the export and research intensive industries scheme.

Once these people reach poverty and desperation levels, what does the government do? They introduce a `dob in a dole bludger' hotline. They introduce new measures for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3145"> victimising and penalising the people who are out there solidly looking for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman will go down in history as the woman who has given `Dear Diary' a bad name, thanks to her introduction of the job seeker diary. Again, this is a measure designed to recoup money from those people who are already hardest hit. What evidence has been provided that the employer contact unit&mdash;dubbed the `dob in a dole bludger' unit&mdash;or the job seeker diary will provide new employment opportunities? None. We put a question to the minister and she was unable to provide any statistics to show that the pilot hotline that was introduced in Tasmania had resulted in anyone having their benefits cancelled because they were allegedly defrauding the system. What it does do, apart from add to the administrative and bureaucratic elements of the department, is further penalise young and unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed earlier in this debate that Senator Vanstone said she was taking the best bits out of the Working Nation program. For a long time Democrats have expressed concerns about the unfunded nature of the former government's Working Nation program. We know how important targeted and appropriately funded labour market programs are. Unfortunately, the former government did not appropriately fund those labour market programs, just as the government is now seeking to slash them terribly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One question I do have is about the new enterprise initiative scheme which, by the government's own justification or measures of what is a good scheme, is a highly successful one. Slashing the new enterprise initiative scheme by 17 per cent makes no sense. Why would you cut a program committed to creating real jobs which has consistently produced positive outcomes of close to 82 per cent? I think that means that 82 per cent of people have found unsubsidised employment after they have been through the new enterprise incentive scheme. Why is Senator Vanstone advocating that the worst parts of Working Nation should go when, in actual fact, they are taking both the best and the worst bits out? The abolition of the CES is extraordinary. Their replacement with one&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stop shops and some kind of tendered labour market or placement program is an extraordinary social and economic experiment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be a very disappointed man if I have not made very serious inroads into the level of youth unemployment in this country because I would like to see our performance in that area as being the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3146"> mark of what we have been able to do as a Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Six months down the track we are able to see what they can and will do as a government, that is, to cut, slash and burn any of the programs that had any benefits to the average and ordinary people living in this country. We now have a very uncaring and callous government, a government that is weak on employment issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about records. I think it is very important to do so in relation to unemployment. Let us think back to December 1982. I know there are a couple of senators in this chamber at present who will be scratching their heads because they were probably still at school in 1982&mdash;unlike you and I, Mr Acting Deputy President; we were out in the labour force. The employment rate then was 11.2 per cent, and it remained so until March 1983. And who was in government in 1982? The coalition. They left that legacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By December 1995, 13 years later, unemployment was at 8.1 per cent. The Hawke and Keating Labor governments had encouraged the community of this country to create an extra two million jobs. Two million more Australians had jobs created for them in those 13 years than had occurred under the previous government. We had an aim to continue this work, to reduce unemployment to a level of five per cent by the end of the century. We were prepared to work on the program. We were prepared to set targets, to be concerned and to care for our fellow Australian human beings who were less fortunate than us in not being able to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we get from the government? They will not even set a target as to what level they aim to have unemployment reach. We have heard them predict that unemployment will rise. What is that going to do to people? It is certainly not going to give them any dignity. It will not give them a reasonable standard of living. It will not do anything for the community structure of this very important community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister talked about getting the general framework right. There was talk about labour market reforms. All that those labour market reforms offered to youth was to cut <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> youth wages, to say to youth that it was okay to live on $70 a week. That is the sort of thing they were about; they were about making it more flexible. All of those are euphemisms for higher unemployment, for less take&hyphen;home wages, for worse employment conditions. That is what this government is offering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, they are washing their hands of the responsibility. They are setting up a broad framework so that somebody else can do it. They are letting somebody else solve the problem. They are going to abolish CES offices. We are going to have PEPE. It sounds like a Latin American combo. It does not sound like an organisation or a group that will actually deliver community services to those who are unemployed with any degree of care or compassion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of programs have been abolished. It was interesting that the minister chose to speak about only three. She chose to ignore the Access Economics report about unemployment programs and job creation programs. I wonder why&mdash;because they found that they worked. What do these programs do? They provide people with real jobs, they provide people with real training and they provide community services. Most of these programs involve people actually contributing something back to the community, not just being off the streets, doing constructive work and having jobs. It involves the actual building of services and facilities for communities, so that there was a very major value not just to the individuals who had been unemployed but to the community as well.

If you would only let that strategy through, as has been approved by the people of Australia right until this very date, as the polls show, we will be able to get on our way and produce a policy that does make inroads into the unemployment rate in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had the privilege of being in government for 13 years. You allowed the unemployment rate at every turn to ratchet up&mdash;almost in collusion with the debt that you ratcheted up over those 13 years&mdash;until it reached that peak point in about 1991 when one million Australians were unemployed. You left office with what you considered an improvement, an unemployment rate of 8.5 per cent, or around about the 800,000 mark, and youth unemployment was at a record rate of 28 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that those official figures can be doubled because of the underemployment rate and those who have given up looking for employment. So you can probably double those figures at the time you left office. If that is our record after 13 years in government, I will gladly pack my bags and give the job to another. Your response, as it was once put so succinctly, was to repackage, re&hyphen;badge, refund, rework and re&hyphen;market all the programs, to absolutely no effect at all. You even reworked the statistics and the definition of long-term unemployment just to get an ever <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so slight marginal improvement. That is a cruel hoax on the real unemployed in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To show that you have not learnt your lesson after 13 years in government, you will be nominating Mr George Campbell for the position of New South Wales senator to replace that very compassionate senator, Senator Childs, in 1997. George Campbell is a former unionist who will be taking his seat in this parliament next year. He is the man Paul Keating, the former Prime Minister, accused of having over 100,000 Australian unemployed around his neck. He is the man you have just preselected for the position of New South Wales senator. The only advice I can give you is that, if George Campbell, when he becomes a senator, ever has the chance to speak on unemployment in this chamber, you should make it a non-broadcast time. We are on broadcast time today&mdash;just keep that in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja, in her ever fluent manner, mentioned that this government has overlooked the human cost of unemployment. Quite frankly, it was not until Senator Tierney, who is to follow me in this particular debate and who was the chairman of the Senator Employment, Education and Training References Committee, handed down an excellent report into long-term unemployment in October 1995 that the human face was driven home to the previous government&mdash;the sort of social and economic cost that was being borne by the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend the opposition go back and read Senator Tierney's fine report, handed down in October 1995. That is when the social costs were really put together for the previous government. That is when he put down on paper in a report the high social cost of unemployment&mdash;the lack and loss of individual esteem, the cost to family unity, the cost to family welfare and the cost even to neighbourhoods and their services. Absolute poverty is usually driven by unemployment and that is the legacy the former government left us where the gap between the rich and poor was widened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The single most important desire for Australians&mdash;and this is known by all&mdash;is to have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3148"> the ability and the chance to get a job. It is for obvious economic and social reasons that the effects of employment have a cascading effect, especially on self-esteem. With all the ex-unionists across the chamber there, in particular Senator Murphy, you would have thought that he and the others would have had something to say when the most important jobs were falling over when they were in government, jobs such as in the timber and mining industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise my Senate leader, Senator Boswell, in the chamber. He knows better than anyone that most absurd, humiliating and ridiculous program that was implemented in Ravenshoe. They just about shut down the whole town in Ravenshoe on the altar of the Green movement. They shut down good working class jobs. They basically shut down the whole town of Ravenshoe. What was their alternative? It was to introduce an absurd training program to turn these timber workers into waiters and porters of the tourist industry. That was an absurd attempt where politics overplayed the human face of unemployment. You hung those old Labor workers and unionists out to dry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our government's approach is program driven for results. If only you allow our budget through, if only you allow the industrial relations bill and our privatisation program through, we will be able to make inroads into unemployment. We will be judged by it.</PARA></SPEECH>

As it is one of my interests, I looked for what the budget had to offer the unemployed in terms of employment programs and assistance. It took me until, I think, the second last page to find the one or two lines that were devoted in this budget speech to the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Despite all their rhetoric while in opposition, when you actually look at the budget&mdash;the first chance to judge what the coalition has to offer about unemployment and assist ing people into jobs and out of the poverty traps and other problems associated with unemployment&mdash;you find a couple of lines that are couched within the general economic overview of the budget papers and the budget speech. The budget papers reveal that it is possible that unemployment would rise and it states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment should grow by around 2 per cent in the year to June 1997 and the unemployment rate should decline, albeit only slowly.</PARA>
<PARA>So the budget papers and the minister admit that it is quite possible that unemployment will rise. You would think that, if you have a major social problem, clearly the government should have a strategy for addressing the problem. So I looked for that strategy. There was nothing there. There is no strategy for dealing with what the budget papers and the government admit&mdash;that is, the possibility of an already significant unemployment problem rising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have adopted the policy that it is easier to take money out of social security recipients, those on unemployment benefits and the programs that support them, than to attack the interests of  some of the more vocal and well&hyphen;organised lobby groups. The unemployed have very few voices in this community. The social security recipients have very few voices in this community. They are the easy targets. They are the soft targets. This budget is about attacking those soft targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at what the strategy is in terms of the government's protestations about tackling unemployment, you get nothing other than the normal mumbo jumbo about the trickle down effect, market forces, et cetera, taking care of the serious unemployment problems that we have. All this in the context of taking $4 billion out of the economy this year and $7.5 billion out of the economy next year. On their own growth projections, unemployment will not fall. It is generally agreed that four per cent growth is required to help reduce the unemployment rate. They are committed to growth rates of between 3&frac14; per cent and 3&half; per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you read the fine print and analyse the budget, you will find that the government has given up on the unemployed. There is no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3149"> strategy to deal with the unemployment question. There are no programs to assist the long-term unemployed&mdash;those most in need of assistance&mdash;because those programs have been slashed. What we get are arguments about the market, the trickle done effects of economic growth and the Liberals' real jobs rhetoric. That is the stuff that really insults me, because it is an outrageous attack on the programs and the people who have been working with the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation was about trying to bring on those people who get left behind in an economic recovery and who have been unemployed for a long time. The minister has attacked those people and the programs that supported them by saying, `Those sorts of programs had only a 30 per cent success rate, so we had to abandon them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That fails to address all of the analyses of the problems of the long-term unemployed and the fact that they need special assistance because they will not get picked up in an economic recovery. The long&hyphen;term unemployed need special programs that help restore their self-esteem, get them job ready and assist them back into a position where they can compete for real jobs. If you abandon those programs, as this government has done, then those people are abandoned. They will not be able to compete. They will not get real jobs, and they will not be able to get out of the cycle of poverty and despair that they are in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has said, `The unemployed are just going to have to be the victims of the budget. We needed to save $1.8 billion in this area, so they are going to have to pay the price.' These people have been abandoned and left to their own devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, worse than that, the government has actually put in place new barriers to those unemployed people. They have put in this `capacity to benefit' test. Basically, they are going to assess whether or not they think you can benefit from the remaining assistance for the long-term unemployed. If you do not satisfy the assessment that you are able to benefit, then you are on your own. You are still going to have to meet more stringent activity tests, but the government is going to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make a decision about whether or not you are worthy of assistance at all. My figures show that, of the 160,000 long-term unemployed in Western Australia, there are funds to assist only about 72,000 of them.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's abrogation of its responsibilities to the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>I reckon that is a pretty good description of 13 years of Labor government&mdash;not the Liberal government. Look at the unemployment rate you left this country with. After each recession, it ratcheted up to another level. Since 1983 the record of the previous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3150"> Labor government was rising levels of overall unemployment, rising levels of youth unemployment and rising levels of long-term unemployment. That is the bottom line. That is the thing you have to judge the previous Labor government on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Labor government actually achieve at the end of the day? With all that money, with all those programs and with all those targets, what did they do at the end of the day? What they did was leave a larger pool of unemployment. The greatest tragedy of all is that in that pool was youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1986, we had 25 per cent youth unemployment. What was it when the Labor government went out of power? Youth unemployment finished at 29 per cent&mdash;an absolute national disgrace. Long-term unemployment increased to a third of all people unemployed and, in regional Australia, the unemployment rate for some youth was rising as high as 50 per cent. That is the legacy of the last Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, the government came up with this brilliant new system for fixing this, and it was called Working Nation. What a joke! What an insult to the unemployed people in Australia to call that program Working Nation. It should have been called `Not Working Nation'. The program that was set up to make people job ready created a lot of red tape and it did not link training to real jobs. So, like many other Labor programs, it failed. All it did was churn the job queue. It left a very large pool of hidden unemployed by redefining people out of the employment system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take into account the hidden unemployed in this country&mdash;the people who are getting only a few hours work but would like to work full time&mdash;the unemployment figure of 8&half; per cent could more or less be doubled. There are figures around that show that, when this Labor government left power, the unemployment rate was closer to 18 per cent. Then, of course, we had the people who had given up totally on getting a job and were not seeking work at all. If you want to look at the real unemployment rate as a legacy of the previous government, 20 per cent is much closer to the mark.</PARA>

In 1995-96 they were going to spend $850 million on it. That sounded terrific, too. But, of course, they spent most of that money on three of the worst performing programs of the lot, and one of them was new work opportunities. For every job that was created and actually lasted some time, the government spent $100,000. What a terrible waste of public money. What a terrible thing to do to these people. They were churned through what were largely useless programs that were not producing jobs at the end of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach of this government is to get the economic settings right so that we do get real jobs created in our economy. This is done by balancing the budget. We have made huge strides in this budget to bring that about. The confidence that is coming back into the economy because of that is already obvious. The most obvious sign is the lowering of interest rates. That puts real money back into people's pockets and actually creates spending, which actually goes on to create jobs. Lower interest rates also release business investment, which then goes on to create further real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private sector is the engine room of growth. You could solve unemployment in this economy very easily if every small business in the country puts on one more person. There are 900,000 small businesses in Australia, and that is about our level of unemployment. If they would each put on one more we would solve the problem. How do you get them to put on one more? You give them greater incentives through the economy. We are doing that through such things as balancing the budget, getting interest rates down and getting rid of rules that the Labor government brought in, like the so-called unfair dismissal laws that stop small businesses employing people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we have to get that great engine room of growth&mdash;small business&mdash;working by proper micro-economic reform, through reforming telecommunications, through reforming the ports and actually lowering <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3151"> costs to business. This Liberal government is doing that. We are putting those programs in place. That will actually create the real jobs that this economy needs and get away from this facade that was put up by the last Labor government where they were really just pretending to solve the problem, not really creating real jobs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to speak in support of Senator Bolkus's proposition regarding this government's abrogation of responsibility to the unemployed in this country. Last month I was privileged to be officiating at a graduation of the ACT's first construction industry jobtrain course for the long-term unemployed. It was run by the Construction Industry Training and Employment Association and it was funded by DEETYA. The trainees were aged from 22 to 38, some having been unemployed for a period longer than two years. They are the people that this government has abandoned. They are the ones that this government has given up on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program was a major step in getting these people back into the work force. The jobtrain program is aimed at the future building and construction workers here in the ACT. Four of those trainees from that program already have a job and three of them are getting a job next week. Is that what I see as people being churned through, Senator Tierney? I notice he has now left the chamber. Is that the useless program that he is describing, where we have seen a transition with these people going through a program and getting a job at the end of it? Seven employers have been prepared to give these people jobs. We are talking about real jobs in the private sector in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program has now been abandoned. It has been abolished by this government and those opportunities will no longer exist. Unfortunately, at the time of conducting this presentation to the graduates of this jobtrain program, I alluded to the fact that I was fearful that this government would unfund and abandon this program. We have seen that occur through this budget. To me that is not a relaxed and comfortable approach. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certainly not relaxed and comfortable for the many workers who may have benefited from that program. They will now not have the opportunity to even give it a go and get a look in at getting a job in building and construction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard and this budget have absolutely ripped the guts out of this program. By his actions he is denying the opportunity for people to get off the dole and back into the work force. The message that this government is sending is that they do not care. This is after an election campaign where we saw `jobs, jobs, jobs' written all over the coalition's election slogans, banners and so forth. Do you think we can have too many jobs in sight in Canberra? Not only has this private sector program that was creating real jobs in in small business gone, but we have seen the cuts impact hugely upon our local community here. We have seen it impact to the point where thousands upon thousands of people are losing their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The labour market programs that I have been describing, like the one that CITEA was running, keep unemployed people employable. When the jobs become available these programs make sure that the people are there to fit into them. No-one can deny that 80 per cent of long-term unemployed people who have been employed came through a program funded through Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Senator Vanstone, labour market programs like this one are a waste of money. Let me see Senator Vanstone say to these seven people who have benefited from this program and are now in paid employment&mdash;either through an apprenticeship or a traineeship in scaffolding, concreting or steel fixing&mdash;that that exercise was a waste of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has not even bothered to set targets. A number of my colleagues have alluded to the fact that they are pretty big on setting economic targets but pretty small and, in fact, non-existent on setting employment targets. This afternoon we have heard a number of government senators talk a lot about what Labor did and did not do in government. The fact that their focus has been on what has happened before epitomises their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3152"> whole approach. They are a government that is living in the past. They are not concerned about giving Australians a future. The abandonment of jobtrain as a classic and tangible example of what they are all about shows that they do not care about the unemployed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an enormous privilege and honour for me to be standing here in this Senate as the first Australian Greens senator to join my colleague, Dee Margetts from the Western Australian Greens, and to follow in the footsteps of Christabel Chamarette and Jo Vallentine, who have pioneered the entry of Green politics into this, the national parliament. It is an extraordinary period in human history which doubles the privilege of being able to represent the people of Australia and, indeed, to be a voice helping guide this parliament towards a more effective Australia in a world which is facing great social and environmental problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need do no more than quote the great contemporary British thinker and philosopher, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Jonathon Porritt, who, using `green' in the widest sense of the word, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future will either be green or not at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This truth lies at the heart of humankind's most pressing challenge: to learn to live in harmony with the Earth on a genuinely sustainable basis.</PARA>
<PARA>That causes me to ask: what is that relationship with the Earth or, indeed, with the universe?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are, some six billion people, on this finite, fragile living planet. We do not understand as a generally accepted wisdom why. We do not know where we have come from and, indeed, we cannot clearly chart the future ahead, but this much we do know: we are an amazing organism which is able to think and reflect on the universe and its awesome and infinite wonder. We are, indeed, the universe; a means by which the universe is able to reflect upon itself and to alter itself. We do not know whether this has ever happened before or will ever happen again but, if we stand back and look objectively at what we are, it is a precious and awesome thing which deserves to be cradled very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And yet, by that experimentation and that ability to change this planet, we have moved now into an awesomely challenging time when it is in our hands either to proceed towards the millennium which our forebears have only dreamed about, or to proceed down the road of materialism which currently has this world by the throat, pressing on the accelerator as we go towards what any person who is thinking clearly can see is an inevitable unsustainability with the planet, with our fellow species and with ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some millions of years ago Lucy, the small&hyphen;brained Australopithecus, was one of about 125,000 of the congregation of what are generally accepted as our earliest humanoid ancestors on this planet. By some 2,000 years ago the population had grown to 125 million. By the 1880s that population&mdash;including Rome becoming the first city aggregate of one billion people on this planet&mdash;had moved through to number one billion people. Within the space of little more than a century that number has grown to six billion and, if we take the most hopeful indications, the projections are that it will proceed to somewhere <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3153"> between eight and 14 billion people crushed together on a planet which is undergoing&mdash;as far as this human community is concerned&mdash;immense and accelerating change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If looked at objectively again, it is a frightening prospect because we have to agree&mdash;before we come to grips with the moves that are necessary for us to collectively rein in our excesses and get ourselves back to sustainability&mdash;that we are not in control. We only have to look at that population pressure and what it means to this planet to know that. We only have to look at the growing gap between the haves and the have&hyphen;nots within the human community to recognise that we are failing to achieve the moves to sustainability which we owe the future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of concern to me that on this planet there are now some hundreds of billionaires at the same time as there are 1.3 billion people living at a level of less than $1 income per day. These people are marginalised and living in marginalised areas on the planet with increasing frustration as they recognise through modern communications that those billionaires exist and that we in the rich, wealthy and lucky northern countries of the world have, compared with them, gross consumption and profligacy in the way in which we use this planet's finite resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only have to recognise that there are already on this planet some 25 million environmental refugees compared with 22 million refugees through other causes to know that it is the environment that is, if you like, in control, rather than we human beings. Anybody who reads natural history will know that, if you flout the environment's carrying capacity, you ultimately are headed yourself towards extinction as a species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That number of 25 million environmental refugees, by the way, is predicted to double by the year 2010, and if you look at the 1.3 billion people living in marginalised circumstances on this planet, their fortunes seem very bleak indeed. If, for example, the temperature rises, as predicted, by half a degree centigrade by the year 2025 when India will have 1.3 billion people, we can expect that the wheat crop, for one, will have been reduced by 10 per cent on current levels. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There is no hope of accommodating the 300 million extra marginalised people that will be on the Indian subcontinent at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to face this reality: either we, as a nation, are going to be outgoing and giving to the rest of the planet; either we are going to find the means for sustainable relationships for people living in much harder conditions than ours, and export it; or we are going to be the recipients of at least part of the enormous mass migrations which are going to occur for many reasons, but not least the environmental catastrophes which will overtake humanity in the coming century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has only to look again at the reality that if we do not rein in the greenhouse gas phenomenon one billion people on this planet will be displaced if the oceans rise by a metre at the end of the next century. This for a planet on which the wealthy ones who fly between here and London put, on average per passenger, five tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only today we heard in this parliament that other great British thinker Dr Norman Myers informing us that, in terms of the value of the carbon sink in this age of enormous inherent problems, if we do not bring our warming gases under control, each hectare of forest being logged on this planet is of a value between $1,000 and $4,500 for its ability to contain carbon alone&mdash;something never written into the equation, so far as I am aware, in the debate over the value of Australia's forests, one which has been raging in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To summarise what I have just been saying, maybe we ought to have taken more notice, we ought to have heard more in our press about the 1992 petition to the people of this planet from some 1,575 scientists, including 100 Nobel prize laureates. They warned that if we do not change this material charge, this consumption of the planet, within 40 years life for many species, perhaps including our own, is likely to be unsustainable, that we are on a collision course with the planetary environment itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had that warning that the planet is going to collapse under the weight of human activities been a warning of a stock exchange collapse <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3154"> in this day and age of economic fundamentalism, it would have grabbed the front pages of the media around the planet. As it was, it missed most Australian newspapers. It made page 9 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart Mercury</EMPHASIS>, as I remember, and one of the mainland metropolitan dailies. Less space was given to that extraordinarily telling warning from a global scientific think-tank than to the `Peanuts' cartoon of the same day around this country. It is very sobering indeed to think that, after some millions of years of divergence from our feathered friends in the bird world as far as evolution is concerned, we are studying so hard to emulate the ostrich as we move to the end of this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the rapid change of human circumstances, the industrial revolution following the agricultural revolution, then the technological and post&hyphen;technological age of information which we are now in, we see a changing format in the political divide around the world. First, if we look at the industrial revolution, it was the Whigs and Tories. That debate was found wanting and was replaced for most of this century by a discussion between those who favoured the socialist theory and those who favoured the capitalist theory of the centralised market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now learning that, indeed, it is not just we human beings alone who determine what is going to be human well-being but in fact we must take the planet into our considerations as well. So we have this new and emerging dichotomy which has put new faces into this parliament, which will put many more into it in the future and which must challenge the existing economic rationalism of major party politics right around the planet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This can perhaps be summed up by the extraordinary warning of social chaos in Robert Kaplan's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Atlantic Monthly</EMPHASIS>, the United States' news magazine and comment magazine, of February 1994. Quoting other sources, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for too long we've been prisoners of `social&hyphen;social' theory, which assumes that there are only social causes for social and political changes, rather than natural causes, too.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This social&hyphen;social mentality emerged with the Industrial Revolution, which separates us from nature. But nature is coming back with a ven <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> geance, tied to population growth. It will have incredible security implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Think of a stretch limo in the potholed streets of New York City, where homeless beggars live. Inside the limo are the air&hyphen;conditioned post-industrial regions of North America, Europe, the emerging Pacific Rim&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which of course includes Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and a few other isolated places, with their trade summitry and computer&hyphen;information highways. Outside is the rest of mankind, going in a completely different direction.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a debate that is going to rage, I think, as we go into the next century. It is a debate about taking back into consideration the idea that we are not people apart, that we were cradled by the wild planet, that our bodies and minds are a creation of the wild planet, not the concrete and plastic conurbations in which more and more of the human citizenry of this planet live in artificial circumstances as we move to the end of this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, the rise of the Greens. It began with the world's first Greens party, the United Tasmania Group, which grew out of the battle to save Lake Pedder in Tasmania and which had its first get together, an overflow meeting in the town hall of Hobart, in March 1972. At that period through spontaneous combustion, if you like&mdash;because this human mentality around the planet tends to reach a similar conclusion, given enough time, through the sheer dint of commonsense&mdash;other Greens parties were formed in other nations and by the early 1980s there were Greens parties in most parts of Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the pleasure just last year of having a cup of tea with the mayor of Dublin, the first Green mayor of Dublin, John Gormley, although he is not the first mayor of a European city&mdash;that honour goes to Rome. There are four elected mayors of Brazilian cities. In Europe the Greens share the balance of power and have a number of ministries, including, I understand, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Finland. There are numerous Greens in other Scandinavian parliaments. Some analysts say that the Greens may well win the balance of power in Germany&mdash;one of the world's biggest economic entities&mdash;in next year's elections. They do hold the balance of power in three of the landa, the states, in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3155"> Germany. There are 17 Greens parties in Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just last month I had the privilege of meeting with the Taiwanese Greens&mdash;the newest Greens party in our neck of the woods. They are extraordinary people whose first act last year was to sail a boat out into the impact zone of the provocative and belligerent Chinese rocket test which was meant to scare the Taiwanese into voting a certain way in their presidential elections. If ever you see people in a place that needs the Greens it is Taiwan where 22 million people in a burgeoning economy are squeezed into an island less than half the size of Tasmania, where 14 dams are on the slate, where the fourth nuclear power station has just been voted down in the parliament, where gangsters run the rubbish dispersal system and thousands of citizens are out in the suburbs trying to stop landfills being dug up in their particular area under threat of arrest and imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, besides our colleagues in Western Australia as I have just mentioned, there are 10 Greens in Australian parliaments&mdash;one in the upper house of Western Australia, one in the upper house of New South Wales and two Greens in the ACT Legislative Assembly. Four Greens in the Tasmanian parliament, led by the indomitable Christine Milne, hold the balance of power with a Liberal government in place which, by the way, in recent months, because of that Greens presence, has kept some very important promises, including sheltering education from budget cuts, increasing the number of teachers by 135 and giving a greater allocation to the free enterprise small business incubators, the local enterprise initiatives, in the state&mdash;an initiative of the Greens in 1989, which has created nearly 1,000 jobs and which deserves the tiny amount of public funding which sees those jobs created in the state which has the country's worst unemployment situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came into the Greens because of Lake Pedder. I also went to Tasmania to look for the Tasmanian tiger. I was a young doctor and I had the opportunity of three months locum in Launceston in 1972. Sad to say, last <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Saturday was the 60th anniversary of the extinction of the Tasmanian tiger. The last one was brought out of the Florentine Valley, which is now almost flattened from end to end by logging. It was one of six brought out of the Florentine Valley in the 1930s. There has been, since 1936, no tangible evidence&mdash;no droppings, no hairs, no photographs, no footprints&mdash;that will confirm the existence of the Tasmanian tiger much as we might keep our fingers crossed for its return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was then fortunate enough to float down the Franklin River and be involved with that remarkable organisation&mdash;a great Australian organisation&mdash;the Wilderness Society, and many other conservation organisations, including the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, in the battle for the Franklin. Let me say this: one of the world's most remarkable, beautiful, inspiring places was saved there because millions of Australians cared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, Strahan&mdash;the centre of that battle&mdash;is the only west coast town in Tasmania which has a consistent growth pattern in terms of jobs and economic investment predicated on the protection of that area and its world heritage nomination. Moreover, we failed to get a dam which would have added $1 billion to the Tasmanian debt and would have seen our power prices even higher as a disincentive to industry and certainly would have worsened the 10 to 11 per cent of unemployment that Tasmania experiences at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From there we have moved on to the forest campaigns which rage at the moment. Let me just say this: I will tomorrow have the pleasure of supporting the legislation to be introduced by Meg Lees&mdash;and I will jointly host&mdash;on woodchipping, something that we Australians have yet to come to grips with. How can we hold our heads high on this planet when the forests are disappearing at the greatest rate in history and with them occurs the extinction of some 50 of our fellow species a day, when we in this country are not even containing the loss of our forests but expanding it&mdash;an expansion which currently includes the licensing of the clear-felling, fire bombing and then poisoning of ancient rainforests and tall <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3156"> eucalypts in Tasmania with their amazing myriad of life forms, which have never experienced the ugly impact, this cancerous impact, on forests which comes from the charge of blinkered materialism that is out of control and at the very least giving no credence to the cry of future generations that they too will want such wonder and variety as part of their lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 20 years ago I, as that young doctor in Launceston, made it public that I am homosexual. Now 20 years down the line much has changed but I, naturally, have not. Nor has the Tasmanian Legislative Council. This antediluvian chamber, which I guess is the most powerful upper house in the Western world, has no women at all within its chamber. This brings great shame on my home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most recently, the Legislative Council in debates tried to turn back some of the important components of national gun law legislation, with a blinkered thinking. I can sum this up by the contribution of one of the honourable members there who, just weeks after the Port Arthur tragedy, said, `Why do we need this legislation?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my time in the Tasmanian House of Assembly, where I spent 10 years, I was able to be part of many Green innovations. One of those was the `death with dignity' legislation. It was blocked in the Legislative Council in 1991 without debate&mdash;one person made a contribution&mdash;and was unanimously turned down, despite an 80 per cent support from the Tasmanian people, according to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> opinion poll. It is somewhat deja vu to find myself in this parliament where this chamber may soon have legislation to overturn the Northern Territory's pioneering legislation on euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is legislation which I wholeheartedly support as humane, as one giving people the right to dignity in death as they approach an unavoidable end to what has very often been a long and loving life. The alternative prospect is great indignity, which they do not want. It is a matter of right, a person's option, that is at the core of debate on that legislation. I would hope that during the life of this Senate somebody will introduce legislation to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this parliament to emulate that Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it has already been prepared, I will also be introducing legislation to overturn section 329A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which allows a perfectly valid vote&mdash;but lands you in gaol, as it did Albert Langer, if you dare to advocate it. I will also, on behalf of the Australian Greens, push for proportional representation in our house of government. Most European parliaments have it. Under recent referenda, the ACT took it on board. So did the New Zealand people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It simply means this: on the day after an election, everybody wakes up to find that somebody she or he voted for is in the parliament to represent them. Compare that with the current, stultified, single&hyphen;member, Westminster option that we have in place here in Australia: on the morning after the election, half the electorate wakes up to find that their vote was in vain, that somebody they not only did not support but also resent is the only person from their electorate in the parliament to represent them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a long way to go with democracy. Fundamental to the obvious improvements we can make is proportional representation. I would favour the Hare&hyphen;Clarke system being exported from Tasmania, across the Bass Strait&mdash;a gift to the people of Australia to give them better representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also hope that we will be able to rectify section 44 of the constitution through legislation for a referendum, as the section prevents hundreds of thousands of Australians from a basic democratic right; that is, to stand for parliament. I refer to public servants who, unless they resign their jobs, appear to be threatened by section 44 and will lose their place in the parliament if they dare to stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also, on behalf of the Greens, be moving for the Indigenous people of this country, the original occupiers and owners, to be recognised in our constitution. Indeed, I will be moving to support the concept of a bill of rights and responsibilities for Australia, for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming out of a High Court ruling of only last week, it seems that there is an urgent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3157"> need for freedom of information legislation to be extended from the public arena to the private arena. What an absurdity&mdash;I say this as a doctor in the past&mdash;that people do not have ready access to their own medical files held by their own doctors. What an absurdity that we cannot go to a corporation or a private instrumentality, a shop, if you like&mdash;or a private school, for that matter&mdash;and find out what files relate to ourselves as individual citizens and what is in those files. That is something that could very easily be rectified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I would also be moving for a restoration of the levels of foreign aid from Australia. Indeed, I would be moving for their increase&mdash;to complement my opening remarks to this chamber&mdash;so that Australia can lift its head a little higher and accept a little better its responsibility to the rest of this very challenged world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have only to look at the estimation by Dr Norman Myers&mdash;that the recent cuts in the Australian aid budget will result in 500,000 Third World couples denied family planning advice, 900,000 unwanted births and 60,000 abortions&mdash;to see that this country has gone in the wrong direction. It needs to turn around and go back. It certainly needs to do better than the equivalent of 0.3 of one per cent of gross national product being allocated to the people elsewhere in this world who deserve nothing more or less than a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In foreign outreach, I support the peoples of Indonesia aspiring to democracy. We have been far too wimpish and quiet, at government levels certainly, as far as that is concerned. I support the people in Burma and Tibet. I welcome the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to meeting the Dalai Lama, one remarkable human being, when he comes to our country later this month. I will quote from the Dalai Lama, who has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exploration of outer space takes place at the same time as the Earth's own oceans, seas, and fresh water areas grow increasingly polluted.

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.49 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to notice given earlier today, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1995 No. 393 and made under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973</EMPHASIS> , be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion is intended to disallow a provision, a regulation which will have the effect of seriously disadvantaging those people with a dependent spouse who may have budgeted over a considerable time on the basis of the previous regulations. In effect, these regulations are retrospective. There are no transitional provisions to take account of those circumstances that I have just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, take retrenched workers. You can have a situation with retrenched workers where the worker has a dependent spouse and two or three children. The worker has budgeted for the family and is doing the right thing trying to get further education so that he or she can get a job. That worker could be up to $50 a fortnight worse off as a result of these regulations. That is why I am attempting to disallow these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to go into it because I think you all know the circumstances and it will be only wasting the time of the Senate. But there has been correspondence over a period of time between me and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the minister. I can go through that if the Senate wants but most of the Senate will be very familiar as to that sort of correspondence and as to the issues that are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to a couple of things that might be of interest to the Senate. The history of this goes back some time. It goes back to December last year when the Austudy regulations came in. It goes back to where I received a letter from Mr Piers Allbrook from Hobart, who is one of my constituents. I was rather concerned about the situation, as was described by him. Of course, he is only one constituent, but there will be many others in a similar situation. I will read that letter to the Senate. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ref. Student &amp; Youth Assistance Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3159"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you to bring to your attention some changes to the Spouse/Parenting allowances may be brought before you in the next sitting of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will have a profound negative effect upon my, and a number of other, families income. In the dying stages of the Keating government a bill was introduced to abolish the spouse allowance for AUSTUDY recipients. This amendment did not receive the assent of the Senate and therefore is still legally, though not in practice, available to eligible applicants. It was claimed that it would be replaced by the Parenting allowance administered by the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is, unfortunately, not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major variation is that Parenting Allowance under the DSS is only available to parents with children under the age of 16. The AUSTUDY Dependent Spouse Allowance is also available to recipients of AUSTUDY with a dependent child who is aged 16&hyphen;21 and who qualifies for AUSTUDY or VCES as a dependent student (ie. on the basis of the income of the student parent). There are also numerous other changes relating to the way in which income is assessed. The most pertinent of these is that AUSTUDY calculates income on the basis of taxable income, the DSS does not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my particular case&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I might just interpose here by saying that I am very grateful to have received this letter. There are people, our constituents, who write us letters and draw things to our attention which might otherwise not come to our attention. Here is the point I want to make so as to give you a practical example&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was made redundant and, to retrain, I enrolled at the University of Tasmania at the start of 1995. I had calculated that with AUSTUDY and the AUSTUDY Dependent Spouse allowance our family of two children could survive. My youngest child will turn 16 on 4th. August 1996 and from that time DSS Parenting Allowance will not be available to my wife. Should the AUSTUDY Dependent Spouse Allowance be maintained or the conditions governing DSS Parenting Allowance be extended to apply to dependent child who is aged 16&hyphen;21 and who qualifies for AUSTUDY or VCES as a dependent student, our family will remain as a viable economic unit until I finish my degree.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since I have entered a commitment to expend my resources and commit the welfare of four persons on the expectation of a similar constancy of commitment by the Government of Australia I would appeal to you to amend this bill to incorporate provision for the spouses of people in my position; at least until the end of our commitment to our education. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is to be noted that should I not be retraining myself and be in receipt of `Job Search' my wife, now aged 45, and never having had the opportunity for paid employment, would be entitled to a spouse allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>I responded to that particular letter. I will not go into that, but I did. I just want to refer to some of the things that I did say. I mentioned these matters in the Senate. I apologise to the chamber for being a little unprepared for this, but this matter has come on rather more suddenly than I thought it would. There is a considerable amount of material which I hope to have sorted out by the time this debate finishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making is that, if this is not disallowed, we will have had the situation whereby persons will have made a decision in all good faith, based on the fact that they would be entitled to a dependent spouse allowance. Because of that situation and because it was by regulation deleted, we have a situation where these people have been seriously disadvantaged by what is, in effect, I believe, retrospective regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I will leave it there. I hope that in my summing up I will be able to do a little bit of a better job, because this has come forward rather suddenly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.59 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be supporting Senator Harradine's motion on Austudy regulations today. We do so because upon reflection this regulation is, in our view, not an appropriate means at this time. As I understand the situation, the parliament rose last year, having failed to consider measures contained in legislation that would have had the effect of changing arrangements, whereby the Student and Youth Assistance Act would mean that Abstudy and Austudy would be changed and a new scheme called parenting allowance would be introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, strangely enough, three days later the department produces regulations to the effect of securing those changes without the agreement of the parliament. While that is an issue that one may raise in terms of legality&mdash;there is no doubt that that is a legal act&mdash;it is a question of whether or not it is proper act in seeking to secure changes such as these.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3160">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I too have come across cases whereby married students with dependent children who were relying upon allowances paid under Austudy and Abstudy found that, unilaterally, those changes occurred as a result of these regulations as of 1 January this year. That might not seem much to a lot of people but the net effect of that, according to the correspondence that I have, is that there may well be a loss of benefits of some $65.35 per fortnight. For people who are on very low incomes, that is a large amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I understand that in correspondence from Mary Lovett to students it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abolition of AUSTUDY Dependent Spouse Allowance (DSA) from 1 January was part of a package of measures to rationalise largely identical spouse benefits and payments with a similar purpose and to reduce financial dependency between partners by providing financial entitlements directly to the spouse rather than to the student as the notional breadwinner. Spouses now need to apply to the Department of Social Security for assistance in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA>You can see how those sorts of regulations will be interpreted under this government, where you will see up to 180,000 persons removed from the social security benefits list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that there is a need to have another look at this. As I understand it, it was said that there were supposed to be identical spouse benefits. When you actually examine the detail, it suggests that the loss of $65.35 per fortnight is not identical. It is quite clear from examination of the detail that the moneys payable under this new allowance, and under the way these regulations have been interpreted, is a loss of benefits to people normally entitled to benefits. I could go into some detail on those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, what occurred under the living allowance was equal to the dependent spouse allowance unless one took the option of a $7,000 Commonwealth Bank supplementary loan, which would reduce the living allowance by $3,500 I am informed. Without that supplementary option, both the living allowance and the dependent spouse allowance for 1996 would have been some $7,351 respectively. Under these changes, the amount payable for the parenting allowance by DSS is $280 per fortnight which is equal to a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lesser amount than that paid for under the old dependent spouse allowance which it replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is not just a question of being $280 less, because if you look into this further you actually see that some old allowances were incorporated within that one allowance and they have now been removed. I am advised by the correspondence that I understand was sent to the minister&mdash;and the minister would be aware&mdash;that you get a situation where married students already used to receive the $62.80 as parenting allowance and the only difference between the $62.80 and the maximum possible amount of $280.20, which should be seen to replace Austudy's previous dependent spouse allowance, is an increase in the parenting allowance of some $217.40 per fortnight. For a calender year, this equals $5,652.40 which you will notice is $1,698.96 or some $65.35 per fortnight short of the Austudy dependent spouse allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a mature age student with school children, that means a loss of some considerable amount of money. I believe that students who have entered courses on the basis of allowances and on the basis of a benefit being payable to those persons ought to be able to complete those courses with those benefits intact. If they are eligible at one point and they remain eligible under that criterion, you should not have a circumstance where the rules are changed half way through a course. That is essentially what is occurring here. Therefore we have, as Senator Harradine has indicated, a clear case of the retrospective application of these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Departmental officers are explaining to students who complain about this that there is a streamlining of certain duplications between the various departments that operate&mdash;that is, the departments of DEETYA and Social Security&mdash;which, I am told, has resulted in inevitable reductions for some. The whole purpose of this scheme was to provide an identical basis for allowances which is not occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3161">  It seems that people who are living on tight budgets, and who have been living on tight budgets for some time while they were studying, cannot afford to lose $65 per fort night. Senator Harradine has indicated the cases that he is aware of and I have put cases that I am aware of as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department has acknowledged that these are disallowable instruments. What I find odd is that they sought to provide these changes in this manner and that legislation was not introduced into this parliament when the government returned to this parliament with its legislative list. I find it a little odd why they have relied on regulation of these circumstances, and it seems to me that there needs to be further explanation on those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The cases that we have before us suggest to me that there is an opportunity here for the Senate to correct the actions that the department has taken at a time when the parliament itself had failed to pass a bill which contemplated the abolition of the dependent spouse allowance. It is an appropriate occasion for the parliament to actually uphold this disallowance motion, and I suggest the government reconsider its position in that light.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I too rise to commit our support to the disallowance motion that has been moved by Senator Harradine. We have expressed, on occasions in this place, our concerns about the abolition of the DSA&mdash;the dependent spouse allowance. I also understand that there are procedural questions that need to be addressed, and I think Senator Carr has outlined some of those. Certainly, the measure that has been put forward by Senator Harradine&mdash;the transitional arrangement that he has proposed&mdash;is quite acceptable to us and will ensure that students, especially those currently studying under the previous arrangements, will not have the financial rug pulled from under them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledge that some students have been hit or slugged with about $1,700 less income as a result of the abolition of the DSA and that is of considerable concern to us. That has been reflected in a number of letters and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> faxes that have come into my office and Democrat offices over the past few months from students and parents alike. In fact, Mr Cornelius wrote to me earlier this year stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For mature aged students with school going children the sudden loss of $65.35 per fortnight is considerable.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that this chamber not only notes how sad it is that Austudy arrangements, or income support, for students in this country are so inadequate, but also looks further at the poverty cycle which we threaten to trap students and, in particular, student&hyphen;parents in as a result of changes such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is worth noting that Austudy at its current level, at the independent rate, is about 68 per cent of the poverty line, and that is the top amount of Austudy that you can receive. I think the average student on Austudy receives around 38 per cent of the poverty line benefits. Clearly it is a system that has been in need of reform for a long time. I am glad that the ALP opposition now see fit to support the disallowance and I acknowledge the continued support of the Greens for Senator Harradine's motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put on record that the loss of $65.35 per week for student&hyphen;parents is considerable. It is an outrage. It has not been matched with the proposed parenting allowance concessions that were promised. There are procedural questions that should be addressed&mdash;whether or not we legislate by press release in this country. Certainly, as I have said earlier, the transitional arrangement proposed by Senator Harradine is acceptable to the Democrats and we support his motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I just make the point, if I may, Senator Harradine, that the Democrats had the opportunity some time ago to move a disallowance motion and they have not been a part of it. In fact, they have cashed in on your efforts in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me turn to the speech made by Senator Carr because I think there are couple of things there that, most importantly, need to be clarified. What needs to be clarified, of course, is his, I think, very demeaning and insulting attack on the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs&mdash;as if somehow there is bureaucrat down in Times Square who simply decides that a regulation will be put forward, that somehow this regulation is all the fault of the bureaucrats and had nothing to do with members opposite. Well, the regulation that I have in front of me was signed by Ross Free and taken off to Executive Council by somebody and approved by Bill Hayden, the then Governor&hyphen;General, on 12 December 1995. That is the first point that needs to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To present these regulations, as the Labor Party would like to present them, as being the fault of some bureaucrat&mdash;as though a bureaucrat with malice has sought to go behind the Parliament's back and make a regulation&mdash;is, in fact, a disgraceful speech to make. It is disgraceful to suggest that regulations put forward by your own party, that you approved of, that you must have gone along with in some caucus debate somewhere, that your own ministers put forward as part of a package&mdash;I understand the former government announced as part of the family's package in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget that it would abolish DSA&mdash;are the fault of some bureaucrat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see Senator Carr shaking his head as though he was not part of the 1995&hyphen;96 budget package. But we all know that on the other side they caucus very well. For someone to get up, basically, as a consequence of smear <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> political opportunism, and try to blame bureaucrats is disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Carr had got up and said `Our government thought this was a good idea but, for a variety of reasons, we have now reconsidered', if he had not gratuitously got stuck into the bureaucrats, I would have some respect for this position&mdash;not much, but some. But since he chose to do this by basically saying that this was something that the bureaucrats strangely did a few days after Parliament got up, I think is a very sad reflection on Senator Carr and his views of the bureaucrats in Canberra. I certainly do not think those views are held by all the Labor Party. Perhaps, Senator Carr, if you had had the opportunity to be a minister, you would not have those views of the bureaucrats either. Certainly the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, a Labor minister who introduced these regulations, would not have had those views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the former government's reasoning for adopting this position. Perhaps, before I do that, I will make another point very clear&mdash;I know Senator Harradine understands the point and I think Senator Stott Despoja probably does, and the Greens, I am sure do. I see you flinch, Senator. I did not mean to say `I think you do' in a way that was meant to be taken by you as disparaging. I just simply do not know, with your limited time here, whether you did appreciate this point. The point is this: that the dependent spouse allowance was not being sought to be disposed of by regulation as a backdoor method of cheating Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was not what the previous minister was trying to do. It is certainly what Senator Carr disgracefully tried to blame the bureaucrats for trying to do when they were operating under instruction from one of his ministers&mdash;one of his ministers who the Labor Party supported, obviously. This was a 1995&hyphen;96 Labor budget measure.</PARA>

It was sought by the previous minister to be disposed of by regulation, which is the appropriate way to do it. Let me make it unequivocally clear that neither the bureaucrats nor the previous minister were seeking to go behind anybody's back. If Labor wants to walk away, which they clearly do, from a budget commitment they made in the previous budget for some political opportunism now, let them do that, but let them not blame the bureaucrats and let them not suggest that their own minister was somehow trying to deceive parliament; that parliament had had an opportunity to do this and it had not completed that opportunity; that the bill had not passed and therefore parliament had not approved this measure. Everybody who was here at the time would have understood that this allowance was created by regulation and therefore should be got rid of by regulation, if you want to make that policy decision. That needs to be made abundantly clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation did not make the grade, no doubt because of the previous government's incapacity to manage its agenda, and that is a difficult task. Nonetheless, the bill did not make the grade. Let me canvass, to be sure that people understand after Senator Carr's disgracefully misleading speech, what was in that bill. That bill did not seek to remove the dependent spouse allowance. What it sought to do was remove a mere reference to it. The allowance was not created by that legislation and therefore did not need to be removed by that legislation. That legislation had a mere passing reference in it to that allowance. It was that passing reference, to tidy up legislation, that was being sought to be removed at the last session. So it did not make any difference whether that bill was passed or not, at least with respect to the dependent spouse allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that the reference in that legislation did was tidy the legislation up, to save it referring to something that would no longer have existed. I hope that has made the position abundantly clear&mdash;that this allowance was not created by legislation, it did not need to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> removed by legislation. It was in fact a regulatory measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation as it stood was that the student on Austudy would get about $270, the dependent spouse would get $270 and, because of the way that a social security regulation was worded, would also be able to get a basic parenting allowance of about $65. The previous government indicated it was never its intention that a dependent spouse would be able to get both of those payments. What it sought to do was to clean the matter up and ensure that that could not be done. If these regulations are not passed, we will revert to the situation where the dependent spouse can get the dependent spouse allowance and part of the parenting allowance, which it was never the previous government's intention they would have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have one disagreement with Senator Harradine's proposition that he chose to make; that is, I do not see this as a retrospective regulation. It affects people who have already embarked upon a particular course but it does not go back and take money from people who already had it. It does not take away something they already had. It simply says you would not have it in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand your position, you are saying that you think once someone had embarked upon a particular course of study, they are entitled to assume that the payments would remain the same for the period of that study and that if you change a regulation during that period, you are retrospectively affecting them. I am simply putting the case to you that I have a different view, if you are affecting their payments in the future, but if you are wanting to affect payments in the past, I would regard that as retrospective. That is the only point on which I disagree with you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see the writing on the wall for these regulations. We agreed with the government at the time, now the opposition. We find ourselves standing alone with respect to this. I respect the view that Senator Harradine offers. He has always had that view. As for Senator Carr and his disgraceful attack on the bureaucracy, to pretend that somehow this was some backdoor move they were seeking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3164"> to introduce, when it was a move by a Labor minister who knew full well that this may happen, was nothing short of disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not look forward to the day when the coalition is out of government and Labor is back in government, but if that ever happens in my time here, I certainly wish you well, Senator Carr. I wish you a ministry so that the bureaucrats who you have defamed today have the opportunity to serve you well.</PARA></SPEECH>

I do not believe it is appropriate that we should continue without raising some of the relevant issues in the bill and, yes, we will also debate the amendments as they come up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have great concerns about the timing of this bill and the stage at which it is being brought on, and I have expressed those concerns to the government. I have great concerns about the fact that we are dealing with a bill whose timing is designed to interfere with an election, as the nominations for that election close tomorrow.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is particularly appropriate that we should be dealing with a bill that will affect tomorrow's election, as there was no indication until this morning that there were to be these changes. The community in general did not know about the changes, and the people who had nominated for the election were under the impression that this bill would not be passed in this chamber. But here we are expecting to debate a bill very quickly, without even a second reading debate, on a bill dealing with changes to an election, nominations for which close tomorrow. People have nominated in the belief that it will be a certain sort of election, but it will not be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if we manage to launder the bill so it will not specifically be challengeable and blown apart after this&mdash;and I do not know whether this chamber can do that&mdash;the whole basis of the election is for a certain number of councils with certain sized regions, and that is what people nominated for. Some people would have made their decisions based on the size of the regions, on the number of councils and on who else they thought might or might not be running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether or not there are legal challenges to the way this election is proceeding, how can the Senate run its business in this way? I think it is disgraceful that we should not have a second reading debate when we are talking about this kind of incident. We will be changing&mdash;</PARA>

So people who have nominated for this election were under the impression, whether or not this bill has gone through in another form, that these rules would not apply to this election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having mentioned why I am making a speech in the second reading debate, I will make some substantive comments. As we all know, this bill brings a sense of deja vu to us because we are putting the bill through a second time. The bill was introduced in another place in order to give the government a potential double dissolution trigger.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3166">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996, as did the earlier bill, seeks to make a range of changes to ATSIC. The most significant changes include: a reduction in the size of regional councils; continuing the practice of the chairperson of ATSIC being appointed by the minister; improved accountability arrangements for regional councils; and the provision to appoint an administrator to manage the operations of ATSIC under certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) objected to the earlier bill because of the lack of consultation. The bill was to be forced through before the ATSIC elections, which greatly influenced those elections. Some of the changes, particularly those two regarding representation and the reduced numbers of regional councillors, require more time for consultation and do not necessarily represent the views of indigenous communities, even if the ATSIC board supports them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that former Senator Chamarette was very concerned during the native title committee hearings. It was apparent during the proceedings of that committee that these policy changes had been made in the form of cabinet decisions which were then imposed. The minister was then left with a very difficult position of having to justify those policy changes before he had even become totally familiar with his own portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government should not again make the common mistake of making policy changes without taking the views of marginalised or disenfranchised indigenous communities into consideration. We do have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation in this place. Therefore, we have no excuse for not having the most wide-ranging consultation before policy changes of such magnitude are contemplated by this parliament. Whatever decisions were made this morning, how many people outside this place were involved in that decision making?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now deal with the Greens' objections to some of the measures in this bill. The first is the continuation of the minister's role in choosing the chairperson of ATSIC. This was to have been a power which lapsed with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1993 elections. It was continued then, as honourable senators would know, largely because of representations made to Senator Kernot. The Greens (WA) opposed the extension then, and we most certainly oppose this further extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad indictment of the conduct of relations between government and the indigenous people of this country that ATSIC is not trusted to choose its own chairperson. This measure should be opposed by every honourable senator who upholds the policy of self-determination in whatever form that person might choose to define such a concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to schedules relating to numbers of regional councils are problematic. Certainly, we have received numerous submissions from regional councils and regional councillors who do not agree with reducing the numbers of regional councillors. Many argue that reducing the number of councillors will also reduce the effectiveness of the representation they are able to offer and reduce the effectiveness of regional council decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statistical tables used in this bill also fail to take into consideration the geographical factors involved. For example, there might be what looks to be a very favourable ratio of councillors to members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in certain areas, such as in the remote areas of Western Australia. However, they are largely mythological in their benefit because of the enormous amount of ground that has to be covered for those people to get together, without much funding to do so. In some cases it is utterly impossible. As far as we are concerned, we cannot support those kinds of statistics and arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed changes subsumed in the general rhetoric of accountability have also been coming from the government. In another context, we have seen the confusion, not to say chaos, which the government has managed to bring about in the indigenous community by its so-called accountability measures. I have repeatedly said that bureaucratic accountability is not the problem; it is about accountability in the communities to the people in terms of service delivery. If you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3167"> want to concern yourself about that, you should go back to the communities and ask them about that. We cannot change from the top without going back to those people and saying, `If you have problems with the structure of ATSIC, what are they? How can we go about dealing with those so that we can provide those services that we know you need?' Everybody in this chamber at some stage has made some comment about services to remote and regional Aboriginal communities and, indeed, to urban Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adding layer upon layer of bureaucratic accountability measures does not necessarily increase the overall accountability and effectiveness of service delivery to Aboriginal communities. One of the answers may be to improve training so that Aboriginal people are made aware of the bureaucratic hoops they have to jump through instead of adding more hoops and an expensive super auditor costing $700,000. That $700,000 could be far better spent on ATSIC programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose we should not be surprised if we find draconian measures under the accountability banner heading. Accountability has come to mean only one thing in the lexicon of government: it means axing programs and appointments where a breach of some funding schedule is never hinted at. Where, by the way, is the accountability of those state and local government bodies which, in fact, should be required to give services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities? Where have we heard the argument from this government about their accountability?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the horrific budget changes have occurred under the mantra of accountability&mdash;$400 million in cuts to ATSIC, which the Senate may not be able to prevent from happening. The accountability diatribe is an excuse to take away Aboriginal people's livelihoods and attack the basis of ATSIC, which is self-management and self&hyphen;determination, through taking away people's resources for a range of crucial activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We passionately oppose the cuts to ATSIC programs in areas such as training, economic development, legal, cultural, arts, youth and recreational services, as well as death in custody programs. I have just spent a week in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the north, visiting Darwin, Jabiru, Alice Springs and Uluru. I had meetings with women's council representatives. They have asked me to give a message to the Senate. They want you to know that health has not been quarantined as a result of these budget cuts and slashes. The reason it has not been quarantined&mdash;they give an example from their own work&mdash;is that there seems to be very little understanding of what actually happens in Aboriginal communities. For instance, the women's councils have taken on the role that governments will not or cannot provide&mdash;that is, to look after their aged, look after their disabled population, look after children, look after nutrition  and look after those people who are not dealt with in any way by any services which should be provided by state, local or Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do they do? They organise committees, they have meetings about four times a year and a big meeting every year and they make the decisions about what is necessary for their communities to basically survive. When old people somehow or other find themselves in an old peoples home&mdash;it is considered by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be somewhat of a shame to be cut off from your family&mdash;they are the ones who visit them and talk to them. They are the ones who take appropriate food to them. When people are disabled because of diet, alcohol problems, petrol sniffing or a range of other issues which are prevalent in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, there are women in that community who work a network to look after them when nobody else will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These women have asked me to say that health has not been quarantined. These programs are being cut without any understanding in order to consider what is supposedly a problem with ATSIC. Yes, there are problems with ATSIC but, instead of dealing with problems, you are cutting off the ability of communities to work out some means of solving their problems. We are also mindful that some Aboriginal communities have already suffered pre&hyphen;budget cuts from their ATSIC grants of up to 30 per cent. This has hit remote and isolated communities the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3168"> hardest and some communities may have great difficulty in continuing to provide adequate food, housing, clothing and basic social services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also aware that CDEP&mdash;the community development employment program&mdash;has not been quarantined from cuts as was originally announced. The capital component of this program will be cut and this is the main reason for Aboriginal support and usage of the program: that is, that they have some control over what is going to happen in their community. It is not just somebody's make&hyphen;work scheme or work for the dole which, of course, is discriminatory. It is working because there is some control within the communities and the communities are making their decisions. It was giving something tangible back to the community, but it has just been taken away. To work for the dole is not incentive in itself to participate in the program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He certainly will see me. It really is a sad indictment on Telstra. There were four people that got together with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3169"> their particular problems&mdash;two from Queensland and two from Victoria&mdash;and they formed what was loosely termed the Casualties of Telecom. Telecom promised them a fast track, non-legalistic arbitration. Telecom have spent $5.2 million in answering the claims of these four particular members. Then there was the $54,691.61 Australian Federal Police investigation. That was in March 1995. I would not know how much has been spent since then, but it is a considerable amount of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pointed out to Senator Alston&mdash;I know he shares these concerns; he has expressed those concerns to me&mdash;that there have been, as this report indicates, two settlements made. But the settlements have hardly covered the costs of the people that were supposed to be reimbursed, the COT cases. In one particular case, Mrs Garms has spent between $300,000 and $350,000 to supply technical advice to assist her claim and she has received something like $300,000 back. In another case, there has been a huge amount of money expended and the payments have hardly covered the expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that when the claimants were promised a fast, non-legalistic arbitration process that is what it meant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not another subsidy. The purpose of this provision is to provide interim hardship business assistance to forest industry businesses which had incurred additional costs and financial hardship as a direct result of the previous government's decisions early in 1995 not to release certain coupes for woodchip exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be recalled that on 25 September 1995 the previous government agreed to provide up to $300,000 in ex gratia payments to forest industry businesses under the scheme to be administered by the department of primary industry. The agreement by the previous government to change the eligibility criteria in December 1995&mdash;something which, I might add, I fully supported&mdash;is producing more generous assessment outcomes, which have resulted in the $300,000 allocation being exceeded by $638,000. That is how much the previous government was going to short&hyphen;change those people within the forest industry who were so hardly done by by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this particular advance will allow an extra $19,690 as a final payment to three Tasmanian logging businesses who have met the eligibility criteria of the scheme. These three logging businesses were among a total of nine that received advance payments in mid-December 1995. Really, what it is doing is putting to rest part of the legacy of the mismanagement of the forest industry by the previous government, which I am very pleased to say has been corrected by this government with its new approach. That approach has breathed new life into the forest <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3170"> industry and, as Senator Murphy, coming from Tasmania, would know, has included an initiative by the Tasmanian country sawmillers that represent the small operators in the forest industry to develop a new investment plant and new jobs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That report&mdash;as I say, it is a wonder it has not been tabled yet&mdash;indicates that the actual fiscal assistance or subsidies to Australian resource extraction industries barring mining, and not actually mentioning pastoralism specifically, works out at $5.6 billion per year. I would say this is a conservative estimate. It was a government report. The environmental subsidies&mdash;that is, the damage to the environment, water resources and other environmental subsidies which the community in the future ends up paying&mdash;were estimated to be in excess of $8&half; billion. I would say that is also conservative in some respects and, as I said, it did not include mining, apart from energy. I am grateful to Senator Abetz for pointing out this particular report. Yes, I will have a look at it and read it later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The taxpayers of Australia, despite what is said about level playing fields, do pay a whopping amount of money every year to subsidise resource extraction in Australia and often it is said that we have no other choice: we have to have slash and burn budgets. I would say that governments in Australia are paying something like $5.6 billion a year in subsidies to resource extraction, including <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3171"> timber extraction, removing forests and turning them into glossy paper in Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those industries require subsidy then people ought to know about that and then we should make better decisions so that we do not come out and make nonsense statements like, `We have to slash and burn basic social infrastructure because there is no other choice.' There are choices. They are being made all the time. The choices are that resource extraction industries are much more important to give welfare to than people who are actually using it effectively to maintain the basic social infrastructure of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is plenty of information which says that the level of investment in resource extraction is actually creating less employment per unit of investment. It is jobless growth that is created by such types of increased investment. Basically, the real growth that is occurring may be occurring in totally different sectors which do not seem to get the same level of support that the resource extraction industries get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employment has gone down in many areas including, and perhaps specifically, timber industries or those industries which turn old-growth forests into little chips and send them overseas to make glossy paper. Therefore, we ought to look carefully&mdash;and I and Senator Brown will look very carefully&mdash;at this report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding for the Broad Arrow Cafe is very important, and the tragedy was very significant for Tasmania. But the other aspect of this report, as Senator Abetz has said, relates to forestry. It was the Labor government that took the steps to ensure that compensation rather than a subsidy was paid to people who, through no fault of their own, were displaced from opportunities for work as a result of decisions taken to conserve very important aspects of some of Tasmania's forests. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3172"> Senator Abetz seemed to like to stray to the government's initiatives in respect of forestry. When we see your initiatives in the form of a document with regulations relating to forestry, it will be very interesting to see how you deal with applicants for woodchip licences, in particular how you go about granting those licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talk about the initiatives of the Tasmanian country sawmillers. Let me tell you that the Tasmanian country sawmillers were beaten by major companies like North Broken Hill into accepting a proposition where they would not put in an application for an export woodchip licence, as were the Tasmanian farmers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought it important to draw the Senate's attention to government report No. 4, tabled today, which deals with determinations under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. It is worth noting that in light of recent changes we will see cuts to operating grants and other expenditure on higher education institutions in this country&mdash;we will see something like a $623 million cut over the next three years&mdash;so many of the worthwhile projects that are funded under these determinations will not be funded in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the booklet showing some of the reasons for determinations. They include: <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> higher education staff development fund; program grants for financial assistance to higher education institutions for operating grants generally, but specifically in relation to teaching, funding and research projects, as well as ensuring that the Australian National University and the University of Canberra are reimbursed for money paid to Comcare. A whole range of charges and programs will be undermined as a result of cuts to operating grants over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this chamber today, I noticed that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), in making reference to higher education cuts, claimed that they were `nicks' to the system. But I think that when you look at it in the context of these determinations, you will see that we have taken a razor&hyphen;gang approach to the funding of higher education in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, in this report there are no determinations that I have been able to see under section 25(a) that reimburse university student organisations which may lose funds as a result of state interference. I mean by that, of course, the misnomer `voluntary student unionism', which some conservative state governments seem to find quite a good thing. It involves interfering with student unions and their day-to-day organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for the Senate to put on record that we see the Higher Education Funding Act as playing a role in ensuring that those institutions that have their day-to-day activities interfered with by a state government, because it wants to emasculate those vital services that student unions provide, are compensated directly by the Commonwealth government. This is to ensure that their facilities and representative functions are not hampered or hindered by the interference of a state government&mdash;whether it is the Victorian government or the Western Australian government, or any other state government that has decided to interfere in the activities and actions of student organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that that is a matter that we will debate at some stage in greater depth. It is worth noting that the determinations as contained in this document today reveal that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3173"> student organisations have not been compensated. This measure is not going to be a flagrant waste of taxpayers' money, as some Liberals would have us believe. I also note the increased dependency on overseas students to make up the shortfall in operating grants and other associated expenditure and costs for universities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, Senator Woodley. We will lock them out by increasing fees and charges and by other psychological and financial disincentives to enter higher education. On that note, I think we should acknowledge that the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act and its various determinations ensure that we have moderately accessible and moderately publicly funded higher education institutions in this country. Some of the measures that we have seen introduced lately will impact upon that, so it may be a very different document that we will be dealing with next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting that the only target equity group that has not increased its participation rate in higher education over the past few years is those people that Senator Vanstone referred to today in the chamber, that is, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Unfortunately, Senator Vanstone has not come up with the best way of addressing or facilitating that particular problem. In fact, she seeks to compound it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She will increase those obstacles, those barriers and those fees and charges so that people from poorer backgrounds cannot enter higher education, and the 15 per cent that she referred to today in question time will remain an elite and minor 15 per cent. In fact, the other 75 per cent will not be able to access higher education. I hope we do not see a vastly reduced determinations report next year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased indeed to see this matter before the Senate. Australia of course is already a party to the SOLAS convention, that is, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. The 1988 protocol to which this document relates is, among other things, designed to harmonise the requirements of the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the related load line conventions, both of which are designed to protect shipping and of course, importantly, the people that sail on those ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I have risen to comment briefly on this paper is that I want to commend the continuing work of the officers of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in advancing the role that Australia is playing, and has played, in bringing again and again to the attention of the international maritime organisation the growing concern in Australia and around the world at the entirely unsatisfactory nature, still, of international shipping. The reason that I do want to comment briefly on this is that, sadly, as recent statistical evidence has shown, this problem appears to be getting worse, not better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been known for some time now that there is a major problem in world shipping with large bulk carriers in terms of their unseaworthiness. Disturbingly, large numbers of these ships sink without trace at sea, often with the loss of life of all on board. The conditions on board some of these ships are disgraceful in terms of the living conditions of the crew, the payments to crew, the officers on board ships and the intimidation by the companies that operate the ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, this is a matter in which we are all indirectly involved. As an island continent we rely utterly on our shipping services. Only three or four per cent of the cargoes carried <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3174"> in and out of Australia are carried in Australian shipping. Well over 90 per cent are carried by international shipping, and AMSA has the responsibility, on behalf of the government, to examine this shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent evidence before a Senate committee, I was disturbed to hear&mdash;as a former shipping minister I have a close interest in this&mdash;evidence from AMSA that the number of ship detentions and defects that have been noted on board ships that are trading with Australia and bringing the freight that we use to Australia is growing. These detentions in fact have significantly increased in recent times. It is conventions such as the one that we are discussing now that provide for the condition of equipment and so on on board these ships that are absolutely vital to the safety of the crew on board.</PARA>

A large number of people on this side of the chamber are very pleased that there was no vote on that. Had there been a vote, it might have been embarrassing.

My heart&hyphen;warming congratulations go to you, and I look forward to working with you for the life of this Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to take the opportunity to congratulate Senator Bob Brown on his first speech in this place this afternoon. I only want to make mention of one aspect of what Senator Brown mentioned when he talked about a `green' mayor in Dublin. It was only a few years ago, actually before my birth, that nobody in Ireland at all, never mind Dublin, could even wear the colour green. It was against the law. Since that time, there have been a lot of `greenies' in Ireland. They were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mainly republicans. Some of them were quite reprobate. There were some around. I thank Senator Brown and congratulate him on his first speech in this place. I am sure there will be many more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak of two other matters in the chamber tonight, but neither of them is quite as jocular as the ones I have just mentioned. My attention was drawn to a photograph in an article on page 8 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper today. It was a photograph of a person carrying a banner saying `No more asbestos', and the headline of the story is `Groups vow pollution action'. It features a photograph of the Mirrabooka Action Group spokesman, Hugh Cahill, outside the Atlas tip in Mirrabooka in Western Australia, which is just around the corner from my electorate office&mdash;the electorate office with the broken windows. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Hugh Cahill said his particular concern&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is about the tip that his group is protesting about&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was with asbestos contamination and pollution of the water table by toxic materials leaching from rubbish at the Atlas landfill site in Mirrabooka.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bellevue Action Group, the Jandakot Water Mound Coalition, the Felspar Road Action Group and the Minim Cove Protection Group all joined forces and issued a press statement saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Foss was performing his duties as Environment Minister with "appalling disregard for the wishes, concerns and well being of the majority of Western Australians".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Our respective groups have strived unsuccessfully to have the Minister address serious contamination and pollution issues," they said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Instead of ensuring these matters receive urgent and appropriate action, the Minister has seen fit to ignore them, to procrastinate or to place commercial interests above those of public health and welfare."</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Foss, the minister, refused to comment. I do not know what can be read into the fact that he refuses to comment. When people refuse to comment, senators come into this chamber at a later stage and offer reasons on behalf of those people as to why they refused to comment. I suppose that is an invitation for my other Western Australian Senate col <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3175"> leagues to come in here tomorrow night and follow this matter through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Cahill continued with his comments, and the paper reports that two weeks ago there was a public meeting of 150 residents, who complained about the Atlas site directly to Premier Richard Court and to Mr Foss. Mr Cahill says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Something needs to be done." . . . "We built homes near this site in the belief that it would revert to a public park and open space soon after 2000."</PARA>
<PARA>Instead of that, the tip continued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My attention was drawn to that article because it was my intention tonight to speak about a very dear friend of mine who died, unfortunately, as a result of asbestosis. He died of mesothelioma in July of this year. Brian Fraser&mdash;who was described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manufacturing Worker</EMPHASIS> newspaper as a `working class warrior'&mdash;was only 52 years of age when he died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brian and I shared a number of things in common. Both of us were born in 1944. We were both migrants to this country. He actually came from Belfast, where he worked in the shipyards and where he served his time as a boilermaker. He finished his shift and sometimes described himself as a `snowman', such was the pollution that came off the asbestos that was used in the shipbuilding in that place. That pollution did its deed with him, and his life was prematurely ended in July. I have only just found out about his actual death, as I was overseas at the time that he did die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met Brian in late February of this year during the election campaign. He was quite fit, well, hale and hearty. Perhaps, like me, he was a little bit overweight, but I think that is something to do with our age. We shared some memories of the old times. As I said, we had a lot of things in common: both of us were migrants to this country; both of us were members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, the AMWU, or the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, as it is called now; and both of us served at the time as education officers for our respective states. In that union we were trailblazers in the field in the area of trade union education, not only within the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> AMWU but within the trade union movement in Australia. He and I used to take great pride in the fact that, of the six education officers that the union chose to employ, they had to go to Ireland to get at least two of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same year that I came into this place, Brian went on to become the national organiser with the AMWU and was later to become the national president of the organisation. I met him in February. He was then reasonably fit for a 51-year-old&mdash;in good health, generally speaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After I found out he had been diagnosed as having mesothelioma, I spoke to him in June where I could, even over the telephone, discern that he had some difficulty in breathing. He told me of the great shock it was to him to have been diagnosed in that manner with that illness because he himself, having been active in the occupational health and safety field within the union, knew that it was a terminal disease, that he was going to meet his end. He prepared himself and prepared his family for that. I just greatly regret the fact that I was not there at his funeral to share the sorrow of his wife, Eleanor, and daughters Michelle, Karen and Deborah. I want to conclude by quoting from that same newspaper article. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A message from ACTU Secretary Bill Kelty at Brian's funeral described him as "a big man, fiercely loyal to his union and its members. He was big in all senses of the word, large in spirit, voice and tenacity."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kelty said Fraser was "a warrior for the workers and the working class&mdash;prepared to stand up for their rights, protect their interests and promote their welfare."</PARA>
<PARA>The AMWU has gone on to name a week&mdash;Asbestos and Chemical Eradication Week&mdash;in memory of Brian Fraser. I hope that we are successful in that and that no more human beings of the calibre of Brian Fraser are taken from this life by that dreadful disease and that dreadful contamination that we suffer.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.29 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the adjournment debate tonight to condemn the government for what I believe is a most mean&hyphen;spirited action in removing funding for a very small but very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3176"> significant program to assist South Sea Islanders&mdash;the Australian-South Sea Islander community development project. I need to tell the Senate that two National Party members, one a former member and one a present member, were instrumental in harassing the Labor Party when it was in government to make sure that this program was put in place. I guess tonight they hang their heads in despair, having come into government to discover that their government has abolished a program which they were instrumental in having initiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Those two members are the former member for Dawson, Mr Braithwaite, and the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter. I give them credit because it was a longstanding and consistent representation and campaign that they conducted on behalf of South Sea Islanders. I guess it is only Queenslanders who would understand the history and who would have the kind of commitment which kept Mr Braithwaite and Mr Katter at the Labor government to make sure that the program was put in place. I wonder what they would say tonight. They are not here, but I thought it might be useful, in a moment or two, to read from the speeches that they made in the other place in urging this program on the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Before I do that I want to turn to a very patronising letter from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to the South Sea Islanders explaining to them that their program would no longer be funded. It begins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your participation in the consultations on the Australian South Sea Islander Community Development Project which were conducted by the Office of Multicultural Affairs (OMA) and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I attach for your information a copy of the report on the consultations.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report has been considered by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Phillip Ruddock MP, who has decided that the Commonwealth will not continue to provide funding for the second and third years of the Community Development project. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Let me underline that. The project was funded for one year by the former government, and they had promised to fund it for three years. The mean spirited action of this current government has meant that this program is cut off in the middle of its progress. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will note the report emphasises that priority areas for improved service provision are in the fields of education, housing, health, legal and employment services. Key Government responsibility for the provision of services in these areas is mainly that of state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a joke and is simply a way of passing the buck. I think the Senate needs to understand the history of this project and how it came about. To do that, I turn to the speeches of Mr Ray Braithwaite and Mr Katter made in the other place in 1993 and this will give the Senate some idea of the importance that they placed on getting this particular program funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I read first of all from the speech of Mr Braithwaite. He moved:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House acts urgently to respond to the recommendations in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The </EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Call for recognition</EMPHASIS>  to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)an end to the discrimination against the descendants of South Sea Islanders;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)acceptance of programs to provide these persons with equal opportunities in building, health, education and legal representation;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)the retention of their culture, arts and heritage; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)that descendants of South Sea Islanders remain proud Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Braithwaite goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on the situation of Australians who are South Sea Islanders was handed down on 15 December 1992, which was some nine months ago. My motion calls for this House&mdash;and, through it, this government&mdash;to act urgently to respond to the six recommendations that are listed in that report. Perhaps, in contrast to a history of 125 years or longer of discrimination against these people, a nine-month delay may not appear too long to some people. But it is too long; and I would hope that this House, all political parties, and the government would act without delay to end this discrimination against South Sea Islanders and their descendants. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3177"> </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Braithwaite achieved that goal and got the Labor government to fund a very small but important program. Now we find that Mr Braithwaite's high hopes have been dashed by the action of the current government in cancelling that program mid&hyphen;term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me read a little from a more colourful speech, as you can imagine, from Mr Katter. He spoke about the history of the South Sea Islanders in Queensland. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To hide this dreadful trade in human lives behind the often misunderstood term of blackbirding belies some of the terrible stories that are today well documented. Those stories include those such as the horror that occurred on the brig <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Carl</EMPHASIS>  on the night of 17 September 1871 when the part owner and captain of the vessel, one Dr James Patrick Murray of Melbourne, and his crew shot some 80 natives that they had kidnapped from the Buka Passage in the northern Solomons when they tried to break out. These men, some only wounded, were thrown overboard to drown or be taken alive by sharks. The estimable Dr Murray got off scot&hyphen;free when he turned queen's evidence. Even though the state government of Queensland tried to legislate against the forceful removal of Pacific Island natives, only one charge of slave trading was ever laid in the sad history of blackbirding&mdash;and that case failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I want to add my plea to that of former member Ray Braithwaite and current member Mr Katter and make a plea to this government to restore that funding. I need to ask where is the current member for Dawson, De&hyphen;Anne Kelly. I wonder if she would also support this plea. There has not been much heard from her about this issue. I urge the government to reconsider what I believe is a mean spirited and penny&hyphen; pinching action, and to restore the funding to this very important but really, in money terms, very small program.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.43 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, congratulations on your appointment. My contribution to tonight's adjournment debate deals specifically with cuts to the ABC. I want to begin by reading three quotes from coalition policy documents:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC must be an independent, truly national, publicly funded broadcaster devoted to excellence <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and objectivity and offering a clear alternative to the commercial broadcasting sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will encourage and support the ongoing expansion of ABC Radio, including the extension of the highly successful Triple J network into regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>These are fine and noble sentiments, are they not? In an exchange between Jim Middleton and Senator Alston on March 2, Middleton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ABC and the commitment to maintain funding in real terms over the term of the coming Parliament. Does that stand?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston's reply to that was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Absolutely.</PARA>
<PARA>Middleton went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if you discover on Monday the budget's bottom line is much worse that the government's been saying?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston replied to that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh yes. I think John Howard's made it very plain that we want to maintain&mdash;honour&mdash;all our commitments and the ABC is a very important part of that.</PARA>
<PARA>These were all pre&hyphen;election promises from the coalition. Less than six months later we saw Senator Alston, now minister for the ABC, fearlessly take back all those promises by announcing a $55 million cut to the ABC's 1997&hyphen;98 budget and the establishment of the Mansfield review into the management functions of the ABC, against all of their pre&hyphen;election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More and more I fear we are moving into the twilight zone with this government. Ten per cent or $55 million sounds eerily like one of their 1993 Fightback policies&mdash;surprise, surprise! Fightback contained a 10 per cent or $50 million cut to the ABC. The budget has since seen a cutting of $209 million over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a betrayal of voters' trust, Fightback policies have been resurfacing at every turn. Whether it is differential HECS, cuts to the public sector or cuts to labour market programs, it all comes straight from the 1993 Fightback policies. The government seems to be caught in a time warp. On 3 March this year, Senator Alston did not wake up to find himself transported back to 1993. It is now 1996. Australians rejected those Fightback policies and, as a result, the coalition was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3178"> forced to reinvent itself with a new package of policies and a new set of promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in 1993, those policies were rejected in the context of what I am talking about. Australians believe in the ABC and support the ABC. It is not surprising that rallies calling to save the ABC attract tens of thousands of people. The ABC feeds the spirit of Australians. It is an essential part of our culture and to cut that funding is, in a sense, to have some of our dignity stripped away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC has been instrumental in developing and sustaining our cultural identity for decades that extend beyond my lifetime. I believe the ABC is one of Australia's most important cultural institutions. It is not only a trendsetter but also a trail blazer. It is only through the predominance of quality ABC Australian drama that the commercial stations have taken the course of making quality commercial Australian drama now available around the world. Science programs like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards 2000</EMPHASIS> were ABC originals. They were so good that they got cut in this government's budget. Consumer programs and Australian made comedies started on the ABC. We have opera and concert simulcasts. Triple J unearths Australian music in regional areas, giving young bands a fair go and an opportunity to extend themselves. That would never have happened on commercial radio; now it will not happen on Triple J.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who but the ABC reports on the height of the Darling River and cattle and sheep prices? It keeps regional Australia connected with their urban counterparts, with their businesses and with their environment. The ABC sets the standards and the rest follow. Without a well&hyphen;funded national broadcaster, the quality of Australian production will fall, leaving all broadcasting in Australia in an unhealthy situation. In 1993 when the coalition first raised the prospect of cutting 10 per cent off the ABC's budget, ABC management was claiming that it would see the sacking of at least 1,500 people, a reduction in Australian content, closure of state&hyphen;based production, cuts to transmission hours, cessation of specialist programs like the rural, religious, science and arts programs and the abolition of some regional services to Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like every other part of the public service, the ABC has been undergoing efficiency and productivity restructuring. About 80 per cent of the ABC's budget is spent on buying and making radio and television programs. So a cut of $209 million over four years will affect programming as well as personnel. But the government has not just cut the ABC's budget; it has established yet another inquiry into its role and functions to redefine and reposition the ABC for the 21st century.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the real intention of the government? Is it motivated by economic indicators or blatant ideology? Will John Howard go down in history as the man who killed off Big Ted, put <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">UnEarthed</EMPHASIS> six foot under, put the Bananas in the dole queue with the dole diary for a partner and applied the gag to some of the ABC's political commentary and current affairs reporting?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mansfield review is the government's attempt to dictate changes to ABC management and programming. What is at stake? Where is the independence? We cannot allow this review to marginalise the ABC, providing only specialised programs for a small section of the community. That would be its death knell. We want quality and excellence in production, not just B&hyphen;grade re&hyphen;runs from our public broadcaster. The efforts of commercial broadcasting to educate, inform and even entertain will always be contingent upon their reliance on sponsorship and advertising. Surveys have shown that 80 per cent of Australians tune in to the ABC at some time. Of course, it is not the only radio and TV that we watch, but independent broadcasting is all about providing choice to all Australians. And it is that choice that we need to defend.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) The Government remains committed to building a second major airport for Sydney to a full international standard. Badgerys Creek remains the Government's preferred site. However, it believes that an alternative should be considered in case Badgerys Creek proves unacceptable. The Government has therefore included Holsworthy in the environment assessment process for a second airport site. The suitability of Holsworthy for an airport development is dependent on the outcome of that process and subsequent decisions by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 26 July 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Has a commitment been made at any stage for a full public scoping process to be incorporated in the environmental assessment procedure for the Jabiluka project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Is public scoping a regular part of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process in the United States of America and is it incorporated in EIA procedures in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Has Friends of the Earth (FOE) written to the Minister calling for public participation in the scoping process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Is it a fact, that according to section 4.1 of the administrative procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, an environment impact statement (EIS) is supposed to: (a) analyse the need for the proposed action; and (b) indicate the consequences of not taking the proposed action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Have the spirit and intent of the administrative procedures to the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act been met over the years in respect of EISs for uranium projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Did the FOE comment in a letter to the Minister that the spirit of EIA procedures has been largely ignored over the years and that this applies, in particular, to those sections of the Act which relate to what is to be contained in an EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) What is the Minister's response to the complaint from FOE that evaluation of whether a given project should or should not proceed, especially important in the case of controversial projects such as uranium mines, has been notably absent from both draft and final EISs for uranium projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Is it the case, as FOE claims in its letter, that p4.1 of the 1979 formal EIS for Jabiluka under the heading `alternatives considered' deals with different mining options but fails altogether to deal with the `no project' alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) If the `no project' alternative has been fully dealt with in a manner the Minister considers satisfactory, where has this been carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) Will the `no project' option be properly evaluated in the forthcoming Jabiluka EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) Will crucial cost/benefit information, including economic evaluation and feasibility studies, be released for public comment so that a proper cost/benefit analysis may be carried out.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Scoping is the process of determining the range of issues to be addressed in an environmental <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3198"> impact assessment and identifying the significant issues related to a proposed action. I have publicly stated that there will be a high level of public participation in the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the proposed Jabiluka uranium mine, ensuring that the process is both open and transparent. As part of this process the draft guidelines for the Jabiluka EIS were released for public comment between 29 June and 29 July this year. The input provided will help refine the guidelines in terms of the range of significant issues and the depth of treatment necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes, public scoping is used in environmental impact assessment in the United States of America. In Western Australia public scoping is used to the extent that draft guidelines for environmental review and management program reports (equivalent to Commonwealth EISs) are issued for public comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes, `. . . .. to the extent appropriate in the circumstances of the case'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) A number of EISs for proposed uranium mines were prepared in the late 1970s and early 1980s. There are differing views as to whether the EISs met the spirit and intent of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) I have noted the points made by Friends of the Earth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The 1979 EIS for the proposed Jabiluka uranium mine did not include an explicit examination of the consequences of not proceeding with the mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) See (8) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) The draft EIS guidelines for the current Jabiluka proposal require an examination and discussion of `not proceeding with the proposed development'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) The draft EIS guidelines require an examination of the need for and justification of the proposal, including an analysis of the expected regional, Territory and national benefits and costs. The draft EIS will be released for public comment. I am not aware of what additional documentation prepared by or for Energy Resources of Australia for its own purposes may be made available to the public. Any studies or material used in the development of the EIS must be clearly identified and properly referenced.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, the draft guidelines for the Jabiluka EIS were released for public comment between 29 June and 29 July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The draft EIS for the Jabiluka proposal has not been released, and I assume Senator Margetts is referring to the draft guidelines for the EIS. Opposition to a proposal does not prevent the initiation of examination of its potential environmental impacts under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) A number of discussions on the environmental impact assessment process for the Jabiluka proposal were held with interested parties, including representatives of the Northern Land Council, prior to my decision on 28 June 1996 to require an EIS and subsequent release of the draft guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The draft EIS guidelines require the EIS to examine any prudent and feasible alternative, including not proceeding with the proposed development.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government has announced its intention to provide a total of $48m over three years for the negotiation of Regional Forest Agreements in all export woodchip areas (including Western Australia) by mid-1998. The exact break-up of this alloca <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tion between regions will be finalised following discussions with State Governments on a range of issues, including the level of scientific assessment required to undertake a Comprehensive Regional Assessment in each region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Discussions are currently under way with the Western Australian Government on a range of projects to be undertaken as part of the Comprehensive Regional Assessment process. The projects are in the first stages of development although the initial part of one project on vegetation mapping has been funded to a level of $80,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The project proposals are being jointly developed by the Commonwealth and Western Australia and must be approved by the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement Steering Committee comprised of Commonwealth and Western Australian officials. Each project which is to be funded must be consistent with the Scoping Agreement signed by the Prime Minister and Premier. That Agreement states that "both Governments agree that the budget and cost sharing arrangements for all assessments required for the Regional Forest Agreement will be mutually agreed with an objective of matching contributions in funding or in kind."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The $48m announced for Regional Forest Agreements in the 1996-97 Budget is for comprehensive regional assessments. This is all the money which has been allocated or earmarked for the completion of the process in priority forest areas, with the exception of $1.206m which was separately allocated to maintain the Forests Taskforce in the Prime Minister's Department until the end of the 1996-97 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This funding is in addition to the $53.9 million 1995-96 Budget decision for the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (over four years) and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (for 1995-96 only) to commence Comprehensive Regional Assessments in five high priority regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) At its meeting on 23 July 1996, the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement Steering Committee decided that membership of the Committee be confined to Commonwealth and State Government officials. Key stakeholders will be provided an opportunity to be members of a Stakeholder Reference Group which would meet regularly with the Steering Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Government is committed to ensuring that the Comprehensive Regional Assessment and Regional Forest Agreement process is transparent and open to participation and input from stakehold <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3200"> ers. However, the necessary arrangements to achieve this have to be negotiated with each State Government. In the case of Western Australia, it was agreed that a Stakeholder Reference Group was the most appropriate mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other mechanisms which will be pursued for public involvement, in particular by stakeholders, in the Comprehensive Regional Assessment/Regional Forest Agreement process can be classified in four distinct ways&mdash;first, input to the information gathering stage; second, through workshops, seminars and public meetings which explore the methodologies proposed for each Comprehensive Regional Assessment; third, in the development of options; and fourth, through written submissions on the draft Regional Forest Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information gathering stage includes all relevant biophysical, social, cultural and economic issues and provides an opportunity for the information base to be modified, clarified or corrected through a range of public consultation opportunities and through written submissions. To assist in the task of presenting and consulting on the wide ranging matters to be dealt with in the Regional Forest Agreement, discussion papers will be made available for comment and a newsletter will be published.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consultation process will be both wide-ranging and participatory through carefully focused issue-specific consultation for those matters requiring special attention. Workshops with stakeholders and community groups will be organised as a means of seeking input to the information gathering stage of the Comprehensive Regional Assessment process as well as during the development of options. Public consultation forums and workshops will be held in appropriate locations and venues across the south-west of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) has made arrangements for the production of maps showing the Deferred Forest Areas in the south-west forest region of Western Australia. Copies of this map are available on request and can be obtained from CALM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) I have no knowledge of this matter. Questions relating to this issue should be directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) Applications will be considered by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon John Anderson MP, in accordance with relevant regulations.</PARA>
