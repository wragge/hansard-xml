<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Evans for that contribution to this very important debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. I always think, if you are going to make a second reading speech, make it brief. But I am afraid I will not hold myself to that principle in my own contribution, Madam President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to open my remarks by saying that this bill really is the proof in the pudding of the attitude of the Howard government on the issue of migrants and migration. I think now we know why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his government really have been so wishy&hyphen;washy in their contributions to the debate on these issues over the last few months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill exposes the Howard government. The coalition could not take a strong stand on tolerance and a non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy when they knew that this bill was about to be debated in the Senate. The Howard government's public position is completely undermined by what they are actually <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposing to do under this disgraceful piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me be absolutely clear on this. Under this proposal, people newly arrived in Australia, people who are here because they want to be here and because we want them to be here, will not enjoy the benefits of the social security safety net which is available to other Australians. Despite all the evidence which tells us that the first two years after migrating to Australia are so critical to successful settlement, the government is withdrawing the social security safety net for these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two&hyphen;year waiting period will apply even to special benefit, which of course is the payment of last resort. Let me emphasise that it is the safety net which is being taken away. The majority of newly arrived residents bring resources with them or find work or are supported by their families. It is only when these alternatives fail them that they turn to the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, the government proposes through this bill to apply a two&hyphen;year waiting period for partner allowance and mature age allowance. It will apply to widows allowance and carers pension. It will apply to disability wage supplement and maternity allowance. It will apply to mobility allowance, the Commonwealth seniors card and the health care card. These are all payments which, until now, have been paid with no waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Family payment will only be paid at the minimum rate of $22.70 per child per fortnight when previously higher rates of family payment have been available to low income families with children in Australia. Many of these people are taxpayers, people who have come here to make their home and who are earning an income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have reason to believe that it is not going to stop here. The budget announced that the two&hyphen;year waiting period would apply to Austudy. The budget announced that effectively the two&hyphen;year waiting period will apply to what is left of the labour market programs. On the original list of legislation that was going to be dealt with in this session of parliament, we had a bill which would have applied the two&hyphen;year waiting period to the child&hyphen;care cash rebate&mdash;money to partly reim burse working people who pay taxes for the costs of their child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people we welcome as new Australians need to draw on the support of their families and friends, their communities and their government at this critical time. Now, their government is telling them that they are effectively on their own, that the government washes its hands of its responsibilities to provide assistance to these people when it is so desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government is creating an Australia with two classes of people. One class, arriving in Australia more than two years ago, is allowed to enjoy the benefits of our community commitment and obligation to protect those who are in need, the manifestation of our commitment to protect those who are most vulnerable. They can enjoy access to health services, to education, to social security payments&mdash;effectively the building blocks of our social safety net. These people might be low income workers with children, who can get the extra help that they need, when they need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this bill the government is creating second&hyphen;class Australians&mdash;people during the first two years after their arrival in Australia who, even though they may be in an identical situation to their neighbours&mdash;live in the same street, send their kids to the same school, work for the same company&mdash;do not have the security of the same safety net. They may be low income workers with children but too bad, the Howard government is not going to help them in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be useful in this second reading debate to remind the Senate how this fiasco has been played out between February this year and now. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, when he was Leader of the Opposition, set out a number of key principles prior to the last election. Included in his approach towards the area of immigration was a commitment to principles of multiculturalism and non&hyphen;discriminatory practices and outcomes. In his speech to ACOSS he committed himself to an approach which would protect those who were least well off and most vulnerable in our society. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5964">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the main reasons why Australia continues to be such an attractive proposition for prospective migrants is that, over an extended period of time, we have built an enviable reputation as a tolerant and compassionate society. Notwithstanding this fact, it remains a reality that many Australians from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds have considerable difficulty grasping the opportunities and accessing the services that are often taken for granted by those in the wider community. . . We have a duty to ensure that newly arrived migrants are able to acquire the language and vocational skills needed to participate fully in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>On 16 February, Mr Howard gave his personal pledge to those who were concerned about the imposition of a two&hyphen;year waiting period for newly arrived residents. In a doorstop interview, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I make it clear. . . Take the migrant waiting periods. . . it doesn't apply to refugees, it doesn't apply in humanitarian circumstances. . . It, of course, doesn't apply to family allowance and other benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>But after the election we discovered that the Prime Minister had written to Senator Vanstone on 13 May, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in regard to the Government's introduction of a two year waiting period before migrants can access a range of social security and other payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will recall, Cabinet decided on March 27 1996. . . that this two year waiting period would be extended to a range of payments beyond those proposed in Senator Newman's original submission. In particular, cabinet decided that you should review and report back on the eligibility criteria for labour market programs and access to AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The list of additional social security payments to which the waiting period will apply has now been finalised. I therefore wish also to finalise the status of labour market programs and AUSTUDY. Accordingly, I would be grateful if you would provide immediately for Cabinet's consideration a submission on changes to extend the waiting period to these programs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister also wrote to Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security. In that letter, the Prime Minister&mdash;very well&hyphen;mannered&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 30 April 1996 regarding the additional payments to be included on the two year waiting period list for migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree to your proposal that the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card and Disadvantaged Persons <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Scheme Health Care Cards be included on the waiting period list.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I support your proposal to include special benefit on the waiting period list, with an exemption for the safety net arrangements. I also support the draft revised guidelines for special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to child disability allowance, double orphan pension, disability wage supplement and mobility allowance, I propose that the waiting period will apply, unless the migrant becomes eligible after his or her arrival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding your concerns about Childcare Assistance and Childcare Cash Rebate, and your desire to consult with the Minister for Health and Family Services, I propose that the two year waiting period apply to these payments. In addition to the payments considered above, I propose that the Maximum Family Payment (formerly Additional Family Payment), Maternity Allowance and Multiple Birth Allowance be included on the waiting period list.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Even after these letters, the Prime Minister said in the House of Representatives on 22 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I just make it perfectly clear to the Leader of the Opposition . . . You introduced a six-month period. All we have done is to extend your six months to two years.</PARA>
<PARA>We accept that there is on this issue an authority from the election to extend what is currently a six-month waiting period for newstart, sickness, parenting and youth training allowance to a two-year waiting period. But it is for these changes alone. As Senator Bolkus indicated a little earlier in this second reading debate, the opposition will be moving substantial amendments to this bill in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that all they are doing is extending a principle that was introduced by the former Labor government. So I think it is important, given that claim, to look at some of the history. In 1993, the then government did introduce a six-month waiting period for new arrivals in this country to ensure that those new arrivals and their sponsors did meet some of the incidental costs of their initial settlement. The six-month period was selected as a balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had to meet our responsibilities as an Australian community to welcome and accept those who were here to become our new citizens&mdash;to provide for them a range of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5965"> universal benefits through the health system, through educational opportunities and through welfare benefits. We had to provide for them a network of access and equity opportunities and training in skills that are necessary for them to be able to take advantage of their new residency in this country in, for example, language training. We put on one side our responsibility for these universal approaches and we put on the other side the responsibility for those who sponsor new arrivals to meet the costs that are incidental to that new settlement. Six months, we believe, was an appropriate balancing point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, with the introduction of this bill, our `enviable reputation as a tolerant and compassionate society' is under threat&mdash;not only from this legislation but also from other legislation which will follow it. It is legislation which will, for example, cut rent assistance for single people sharing accommodation by a third, deny unemployment payments to people for up to six months and make it much more difficult to qualify for a disability support pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for the Howard government's commitment to protect the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in our community. What is absolutely clear from this legislation is that this government is trying to withdraw the safety net for newly arrived residents who find themselves, unexpectedly, poor, needy or vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the government stands exposed on its duplicity on this particular issue and stands condemned for the breaches of commitments that it made before the election&mdash;the commitments, of course, that were not honoured by the newly elected coalition government. I commend to the Senate the amendments that will be moved by Senator Bolkus in the committee stage of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank senators for their contributions in this debate. It has been an important and far-reaching one. It is unfortunate that some of the Labor speakers have chosen to make comments that I think have gone wide of the mark of the intent of the legislation. They have introduced <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into this debate unnecessary comments that have sought to elevate and exacerbate the issues of the current debate on racist and racial issues in the community&mdash;both at this time and, in particular, with regard to this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 gives effect to the government's election commitment to introduce a two-year waiting period for newly arrived residents. It continues to grant all eligible refugee and humanitarian migrants access to welfare benefits immediately on their arrival in Australia&mdash;contrary to the view of some members and what they have been saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides access to welfare benefits for other migrants, which will be available after two years. It grants full access to the family allowance&mdash;now called the minimum family payment&mdash;and Medicare for all migrants immediately on arrival. It provides a safety net for those migrants whose circumstances change significantly upon arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy will apply to prospective migrants only. It will not apply retrospectively or to migrants who arrived in Australia before 1 April 1996. This represents the election commitment announced in February by the now Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;no more, no less. The government took this policy to the election, and it has a mandate to introduce it. This commitment reinforces the government's position that new migrants should not be expected to rely on taxpayers as soon as they arrive in Australia and that sponsors of new migrants will honour their obligations to provide the support they promised when migrants applied for their visas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has moved a range of amendments as a result of the report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I would commend many of the comments made yesterday by Senator Ellison, Senator Abetz, Senator Cooney and Senator McKiernan from that committee. The committee took evidence from a wide variety of community groups and representatives. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5966"> government has listened to those concerns and has moved amendments that give effect to all the legislative recommendations of the majority report. It picks up a number of consistent recommendations also from the minority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment means that no waiting period will be applied to child disability allowance or double orphan pension. Special need relatives&mdash;that is, those who migrate to provide care for Australian residents&mdash;will not have to wait for access to a carer pension. Australian citizens' children born overseas will not have to wait for above minimum rate family payments. Innocent illegals will not serve the waiting period for any payments, and interdependency migrants&mdash;these are subclass 826&mdash;will not have to serve a waiting period when they are granted permanent residence. The original bill also includes this exemption for those granted temporary spouse visas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, unlike the Australian Labor Party, has listened. The Labor Party is being selective in what it wants to hear and then raise in this place. Senator Bolkus's comments yesterday very much went to that particular point, almost seeking to raise and to make a new agenda. The committee majority has reported that the bill does not apply retrospectively. The committee majority also concluded that this bill does not offend the Racial Discrimination Act nor does it breach international agreements, contrary to the comments of some of the speakers yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party call for a review prior to the implementation of this policy. The former Labor government had no such review prior to introducing the 26-week waiting period, nor did they take this policy to the electorate. They announced it in a budget speech and implemented it some four months later. The Democrats have raised the issue of refugees and humanitarian migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed that Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Woodley obviously have not read the detail of the majority report. This bill does not limit in any way this group's access to social security payments. In fact, the government is extending the exemption to take in their family members who migrate to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia even if this is some time later. This new exemption, which does not apply under the 26-week waiting period, will assist the family reunion of the most disadvantaged migrants&mdash;that is, refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Calls for a tax exemption for new migrants who do not access social security is not relevant. This measure is introduced to ensure that sponsors and assurers of new migrants meet their commitments. This measure will bring the Australian social security system closer into line with social security arrangements in other countries which require an employment and contribution history before people access entitlements. New migrants can still access a vast array of government services, including Medicare, education and infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the speakers have said that new migrants will be left without any assistance for two years. This is not true. Special benefit&mdash;the safety net&mdash;will always be available to those new migrants who need assistance because their circumstances have changed since their arrival in Australia. We have made it clear that this safety net would be maintained; however, we have also said that new migrants and/or their sponsors would be required to meet their own obligations first. Medicare and the minimum rate family payment will also continue to be available to new residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McKiernan raised the issue of the level of savings from this bill as compared with the estimates during the election campaign. The savings we present with this bill are based on actual social security data&mdash;something we did not have access to whilst in opposition. The savings are conservative Department of Finance estimates, which are agreed by Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Australian Labor Party in proposing that it is prepared to support a two-year waiting period for those payments that already have a 26-week waiting period fails to acknowledge a number of issues. Widow allowance currently has a 26-week residence requirement&mdash;in effect, a 26-week waiting period. The social security system is now one based on individual entitlement: each person qualifies in their own right for payment and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5967"> not on the basis of their spouse's entitlements. This change was begun by the previous government and we are continuing that policy direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parenting allowance has a 26-week waiting period but partner allowance does not&mdash;again, inconsistent with individual entitlement. Not applying a waiting period to special benefit, albeit with exemptions for people who have a change of circumstances, will allow people to effectively bypass the waiting period and allow migrants and their sponsors to continue to avoid their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is interesting that a number of speakers yesterday were very sympathetic and empathetic&mdash;indicative of the natural sympathy and empathy that we all have for people in new circumstances fitting in with a new community. I was personally very surprised by Senator Woodley's comments. He obviously repeated his sermon from the day before. He drew allowance and took us back to the days of Abraham. I do not want to exchange the social security arrangements of Australia for those of some 3,000 years ago. I do not think they would be appropriate, and I think Senator Woodley missed the mark very seriously in those areas with regard to what is community support and community obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is good policy. It certainly will pick up a number of very important issues. This bill puts in place a government election commitment. The government has also put forward a range of amendments. We have listened to community concerns, we have responded and we have taken note of the report of the Senate committee, but we have not moved so far away as to send the message that new migrants and their sponsors can forget their commitments and ignore their responsibilities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee is considering the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Residents Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. The government amendments to this bill have been circulated in the form of requests. It appears, however, that only two of the amendments, Nos 6 and 14, would have the effect of increasing expenditure. It appears that the amendments have been framed as requests because the government drafters follow the notions that amendments which modify reductions in expenditure but do not add to expenditure should be requests, and that where some amendments in a group should be requests they should all be put as requests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5968">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These notions, however, have not been followed by the Senate in the past. The question of the interpretation of the relevant constitutional provision, in section 53 of the constitution, was recently reported on by the Procedure Committee. Under the recommendations by the committee, only amendments Nos 6 and 14 would be requests. It should be noted that this is also in accordance with the recommendations of the House of Representatives committee which considered the application of section 53. Amendments Nos 6 and 14 will therefore be treated as requests, and the remainder as amendments.</PARA>

<PARA>The Australian Democrats voiced our opposition and concern about the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill yesterday in the speeches made Senator Woodley and me. We have just expressed our opposition to this bill in the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly support the words of Senator Faulkner earlier today in this debate when he said that the motivations behind this bill should be exposed. We maintain that we should not merely expose the content of this bill but also seek to oppose it. That is what the Australian Democrats' amendments before the chamber today provide the opportunity to do&mdash;certainly for the opposition and other parties in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first two amendments, which in some respects are consequential on amendments Nos 3 to 21 being passed, simply address the Australian Democrats' opposition to this bill in total and cut to the heart of this bill and our concerns. Amendments Nos 3 to 21 regard the specific pensions, entitlements or social security benefits to which the extension of the waiting period is to be applied. Again, they seek to oppose the extension of the waiting period from six months to two years. Included in those amendments, I understand that there are certain government amendments in light of the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. There <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5969"> are some amendments to be moved by the government today which will take up some of the concerns that were previously raised in the Australian Democrats' amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to briefly refer to some of the entitlements that will be affected by this legislation and the extension of the waiting period. They include the carers pension. Amendment No. 4 of the Australian Democrats deals with this. It is important for people to remember that the carers pension exists to ensure an adequate level of income for a person who provides full&hyphen;time personal care to a severely disabled person. This type of assurance of support is already catered for in the migration regulations. I ask the committee to consider this, because who is it that primarily is responsible for taking care of such people? I would argue that the majority of carers in our society are women. This extension of the waiting period is a thinly veiled attack on carers, particularly on migrant women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 6 of the Australian Democrats relates to the disability wage supplement. This provides a supplement to those people with a disability working under the supported wages system administered by the Department of Health and Family Services. Again, who are the primary carers of such severely disabled people in our society? Women. So again I consider the attack on the disability wage supplement an attack on women, particularly migrant women, in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I know Senator Woodley is particularly concerned about the widow allowance, which is addressed in Democrat amendment No. 5. The widow allowance is designed to allow an adequate level of income for women who have been widowed, separated or divorced after turning 50 years of age and who have no recent work force experience. Again this is an attack on migrant women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Amendment No. 10 deals with the sickness allowance. The sickness allowance is provided to people who are employed and who have lost income due to a temporary incapacity caused by sickness or injury. Because of the relative position of financial inequality, it is women who are more likely to require such allowances as their income usually is prohibi tive of purchasing private insurance. Again this is an attack on women, particularly migrant women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Democrat amendment No. 11 deals with the special benefit. The special benefit provides assistance to people in severe financial need due to circumstances that are outside their control and for whom no other allowances are payable and no other support is available. Clearly, this is a benefit of last resort. As the Lavarch committee report illustrated, it is women who are most clearly disadvantaged following divorce proceedings. Therefore, an attack on the special benefit is again another thinly veiled attack on migrant women in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment No. 12 deals with the partner allowance. The partner allowance provides for partners of income support recipients who face barriers to finding employment because of their limited participation in the work force. Whom is this largely going to impact upon? Again migrant women. For that reason we oppose the extension of the waiting period to the partner allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 13 deals with the maternity allowance. Amendment No. 14 deals with the parenting allowance, which provides financial assistance to families where a partner cares for children at home. Again it is largely women who are in that position. Obviously, the maternity allowance affects women and, in this case, migrant women in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an amendment dealing with the mobility allowance. We oppose the extension of the waiting period to the mobility allowance. The mobility allowance provides assistance to people with disabilities in employment, vocational training or voluntary work who are unable to use public transport without substantial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other rafts of measures are affected by this bill, such as the youth training allowance and newstart. As I understand it, the government amendments will pick up the child disability allowance and the double orphan pension&mdash;something we do support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate the Democrats' concerns. We see this legislation as mean spirited. We see it as penny pinching and as a way of revenue <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5970"> raising from migrants in this country. I think it clearly sends our community and those people overseas who are going to join us the wrong message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, when we hold this piece of legislation up to the light of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, it is dubious legally. It is a questionable piece of legislation. Yesterday the Democrats put on record our concerns about the continued stratification in our society&mdash;the idea that we should be treating citizens and permanent residents so differently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are legal concerns, ethical concerns and racial concerns that the Australian Democrats have with this bill. Again I concur with the sentiments of Senator Faulkner earlier today where he said, `This is an attempt to withdraw the safety net from the poor, the needy and the vulnerable'&mdash;those were his words. He argued that we should expose the duplicity in the government's case.</PARA>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said yesterday, the opposition has very deep problems with the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. These problems arise from the fact that this legislation does not in any way pay adequate respect to the traditional role that settlement programs have played in Australia's migration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday, when President Clinton and other world leaders recognise that we have been a successful migration country not only do they look at the numbers that we take&mdash;in fact, there was no reference last week by President Clinton to the fact that we have taken some 5.3 million migrants in some 50 years since the war in a planned migration program&mdash;but they also look at the way those migrants settle into the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Settlement programs are critical. We have maintained that settlement programs provide not only an investment in those who migrate here but also an investment for the cohesive nature of our society. We find it is important that we do have programs such as the ones we are discussing today&mdash;labour market programs, English language programs as well as the settlement programs that are provided directly to migrants through community groups and broader based organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these programs are the investment that the Australian public puts into migration, an investment which provides a springboard for migrants when they come here. The migration experience is not easy. It is very difficult. We have been successful because we have been able to ensure that migrants do not fall through the floor and become an underclass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a very high mobility rate no matter what the migrant group that comes to Australia is and no matter whom the migrant's family is. Mobility is something which is a very deep characteristic of the way that migrants have settled into Australian society&mdash;mobility in terms of where they live, mobility in terms of where they study and mobility in terms of where they are employed. That is why, no matter where you go throughout the Australian landscape, you will find the rich diversity of migration reflected in the shops, in the religious institutions and in just about every suburb in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Settlement programs in the social justice agenda are critical. It is for that reason that the previous government for 13 years consistently built on that agenda. For instance, it spent more money on language programs over the last few years and more money on settlement programs. It recognised the need and the services provided by migrant resource centres, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5971"> aid workers and the like and the need for labour market programs to address the particular problems that migrants face when they are trying to get into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also struck a balance, and that balance is reflected in our opposition to these amendments moved by the Australian Democrats today. The balance was between on the one hand making that investment, ensuring that investment could provide a safety net for migrants, and on the other hand ensuring that those who do migrate and those who sponsor new arrivals do meet some of the incidental costs of that new settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we struck the six&hyphen;month period. We struck it as a balancing point, but we struck it only in respect of some and not the whole raft of programs. When people compare our position with the current position, they will find that we were selective about the programs that we apply the six&hyphen;month waiting period to, and our waiting period had nowhere near the impact that the government's amendments to the legislation are having to the programs. We thought six months was an appropriate period. A period of two years will ensure an undermining of the cohesiveness of this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday, it is not migration programs that cause ghettos. It is the economic programs, it is the lack or provision of social service programs and social justice programs which have an impact on whether people are mobile in the new community in which they settle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We oppose the amendments of the Democrats because they do try to wind back that balancing point of six months. We also oppose them because we feel that the government has some authority in respect of extending that six&hyphen;month waiting period but only in those areas in which they made it clear before the election that they would so move. The government made it clear that they would extend our six&hyphen;month period to two years only in those areas where that six&hyphen;month period applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No degree of dissembling by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or by the relevant ministers&mdash;I do not include Senator Tambling here because he has not had carriage of this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the past&mdash;whether it is Senator Newman or Senator Vanstone or any other minister, will interpret the words and the commitment before the election to mean the inclusion of the wide raft of amendments that the government is seeking to implement now. We will allow the government's pre&hyphen;election commitment to take effect here. We will not allow it to be extended to the raft of programs that the Australian public was not warned about, nor will we allow it to extend the period to two years in those programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, Senator Stott Despoja, we share very much your concerns with this legislation, but we feel that the balance we struck before the election can be maintained. It is a balance that was working because of a specific government commitment before the election to ensure that there were allowances for the hard cases. We were consistent in our application of special benefit provisions before the election and this government has sought to apply separate benchmarks for special benefits since the election. Before the election we were also very keen to ensure that there was sufficient top&hyphen;up in those programs that were critical to ensuring either enhanced access to language skills or labour market programs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor opposition says that it struck the balance with the six&hyphen;month waiting period but immediately catches itself in the impossible position of arguing against extending that to two years, 10 years or 20 years, or maybe a lifetime coming further down the line if we extend the illogicality which says that people who are legitimate migrants to Australia and have been through the trial of assessment before they get here should be second&hyphen;class citizens once they arrive for however long the period is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor may say it is six months. The coalition says, `Let's make it two years.' The fact is that the major parties are institutionalising discrimination against newly arrived Australians at the very time they will most need assistance and at the very time the social security network is most important to ensure that they find their legs, that they have the best opportunity possible of integrating into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5972"> the Australian society, that they have the best opportunity possible to find work and fulfilment, to get income, to be able to settle in to this new country and to become the productive citizens that they want to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Well,' says Labor, `let's put a six&hyphen;month'&mdash;and they have managed to do this&mdash;`waiting period on the people from the minute they step ashore.' `Oh,' say the Liberal and National parties, `we will now make it two years.' Where do you put an end to this drift to discrimination in this country of an unfair go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that this law being put to the chamber today breaks international covenants on civil rights. It breaks a series of international covenants which say that all citizens should be treated equally and all citizens should have an equal access to social security in whatever country they might be. But here we have Australia saying, through this government legislation, `Not quite. We are going to discriminate against you from the minute you get here. We are going to make it tough on you for the coming two years.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Stott Despoja pointed out, if you happen to become a widow during those two years, extra tough luck, you do not have access to the benefits, meagre as they might be, to help you get by while you settle to that loss and find some means of income. You will have to find it somewhere else. Do not look to the Australian government as all other Australian citizens in that position can do. Because you are new in this country, you don't get a fair go. That is what this legislation says. It is an unfair go if you happen to be a newly arrived Australian. Sure, we welcome you, but we are not going to give you a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ethically wrong that the chamber should pass this legislation. That is why the Greens support the Democrat amendments, not only because they stop this rot going further&mdash;they stop the added discrimination that is inherent in this government legislation now before the chamber&mdash;but because the Democrat amendments along with Green sentiment try to roll back the injustice that was built into this line of government direction when the Labor Party in government two <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years ago said a six&hyphen;month penalty should be applied to newcomers to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the committee that, at any given time, 8,000 to 10,000 people in Australia will suffer the denial of potential benefits which other ordinary Australians have available to them if the amendments which we support are knocked back, as it seems they will be, by a Senate majority. I join the Democrats in saying to the Labor Party, the party of social justice: think again about this; you made the mistake in government. Do not compound it by turning down the opportunity to endorse these amendments now. It is simply an appeal for a fair go for people newly arrived in this country to take up their new role in life, their new opportunities in life and their new avenues to fulfilment as Australians&mdash;no more and no less than the rest of us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good, I just wanted to clarify that. It is with regret that I have to accuse Senator Bolkus of a misuse of language today. To talk about the Labor Party's work two years ago in imposing a six&hyphen;month waiting period on migrants as `balance' has to be a misuse of language. It is a strange description for an appalling decision by the previous government. It is a decision which opened the door so that the present govern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5973"> ment could drive a truck through the open door over the lives of migrants. Let us not be mistaken: the door was opened by the Labor Party in the first instance and this government simply pushed it open a bit further. To Senator Tambling I would just like to say that I could not listen to your sermon. I was trying to watch it on the television but somebody phoned me. I was trying to get them off the phone. I will, of course, read it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  because I am sure it is enlightening and something I need to take account of.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The point I want to make is simply to do with the widow allowance issue. It really took a lot of effort on the part of Australian widows to get a liberalisation of that allowance in a campaign which has gone on for two or three years. Let me pay tribute to those Australian widows who were able finally to force out of the Labor Party and the present government before the election a promise to move a minimum amendment to that allowance to free it up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have the appalling proposition, having finally forced a liberalisation of that allowance which in fact will save the government money, where this government is making sure that migrant widows will not be able to access that payment. I cannot understand how a government could be so discriminatory and selective in the assistance they give to people from other countries who are widows. It seems to me that this of all the measures is probably the worst. Again, I remind the chamber of the exposition I gave yesterday that this is part of the long history of the Judaeo&hyphen;Christian ethic&mdash;not only strangers but widows are mentioned time and time again. Here we have this appalling proposition from this government. I just hope that the chamber will support the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I keep hearing about this sermon of Senator Tambling's. I do hope he has it on video and will circulate it to the chamber so we can all get the benefit of the wisdom he is supposed to espouse some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> where. I do not even know where it occurred, but we keep hearing about it. It has obviously made a marked impression on Senator Woodley. That is not, however, my reason for rising in this debate. I am prompted to do so by Senator Woodley's comments on the Labor Party's then government initiative in bringing in the six&hyphen;month waiting period for certain groups of migrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my second reading contribution yesterday, there was not wholehearted or unanimous support within the Labor Party for this particular measure. Some quite vigorous debate occurred both within the caucus itself and within the caucus committees, but at the end of the day the numbers were there to bring about the initiative. Of course, some of us with some embarrassment supported the initiative of the changes in the legislation on the floor of the chamber when it came to the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the rules within my party. They are the rules to which I commit myself. They are the rules I obey. I am not saying that I particularly like them, but no doubt before the end of my parliamentary career I will be forced to vote and carry through on votes in similar embarrassing situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the six&hyphen;month waiting period initiative was criticised at the time, and some would say rightfully so, and was subject to a degree of continuing criticism, there was always&mdash;and this is extremely important&mdash;a safety net in place for those who for whatever reason ran into difficulties. That was the eligibility for special benefits&mdash;there was that provision&mdash;and we ensured through the vigorous debates that I have mentioned that the eligibility was maintained. So, for example, if people who initially were ineligible to receive jobsearch allowance through no fault of their own fell into financial difficulties and were not able to maintain themselves, there was then the eligibility to apply to the Department of Social Security for special benefits where they were given a one-off consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially, when the government brought in this bill, there was going to be no eligibility for special benefits for two years, not for the six&hyphen;month period that was previously in place. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5974"> I think that is a very important aspect of the bill. I note the comments the majority of the parliamentary committee made on the matter. I note that there are some government initiatives on this matter, but it does need to be clarified. Hopefully, that will be clarified before the vote on these particular provisions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have covered in my earlier notes and earlier comments the substance of most of these amendments but, given that Senator Bolkus indicated that these amendments were duplicated in the opposition's amendments, I think it is appropriate for us to separate those and deal with them now. In doing so, we essentially oppose the extension of the waiting period&mdash;that is, to two years&mdash;for a number of measures including the carers pension, widow allowance, disability wage supplement, mature age allowance, special benefits, partner allowance, maternity allowance, child disability allowance, double orphan pension, which I think may also be dealt with by the government, as well as the family and health insurance payments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, Senator Stott Despoja is right. Her amendments cover the principle of preventing a two&hyphen;year waiting period applying to payments where no waiting period currently exists. They also pick up a few of the government amendments that the opposition is supporting&mdash;that is, amendment Nos 21, 22 and 23.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I should indicate that the government will oppose the amendments to this social security legislation as proposed by Senator Stott Despoja on the basis that the government has been given an election mandate to introduce its election commitment relating to newly arrived residents' waiting periods. This is not to say that the government has not listened to those, for example, who appeared before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which examined the bill, and the majority of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be moving amendments to adopt all of the recommendations of the majority report. One of the government amendments will exempt for the period special need relatives who have come to Australia to deal with the issue of care that was raised by Senator Stott Despoja earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that the government has instituted a national carer action plan, and I draw that in a broader sense to the attention <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5975"> of senators.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An interesting point was made then by Senator Tambling&mdash;access to Medicare will be retained. I noticed that the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council, in its evidence to the committee, took precisely this point. Senator Cooney also mentioned it in his distinguished dissent to the report of the majority of the committee. He strongly argued that those who were equally subjected to taxation should be equally entitled to the benefits it pays for. That is a very interesting point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Tambling, just mentioned that the newly arrived migrants will be eligible for Medicare. All I would say is that it would seem a bit rich to impose a Medicare levy and give nothing in return. You are going to make them pay the Medicare levy in their taxes, aren't you? You are now saying, `Yes, we'll give them the entitlement to Medicare.' Bully for you. That's excellent! As I said, it would be rather odd if you imposed a taxation levy on them, as you do, and gave them nothing in return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should it matter whether we call the tax a Medicare levy or an income tax? If they are paying an income tax, what benefits do they get from it? Some of that income tax is for the purpose of providing certain social security benefits. It seems to me that, if the government is to deny to certain classes of people eligibility for public income support, it has to start rethinking the taxation treatment of private income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to my question to the parliamentary secretary. If the newly arrived migrants are now going to be ineligible for certain social security benefits&mdash;including those relating to unemployment and so on&mdash;who is going to provide the income for them to weather the storm? If the government is expecting their sponsors or their relatives to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support them, are they going to amend the taxation laws to give recognition to that contribution?

<PARA>I have separated amendment No. 14 because it relates to the parenting allowance. In light of Senator Harradine's question of the government earlier as to whether or not they were prepared to exempt the parenting allowance from the two&hyphen;year waiting period, and given that the government has not responded to that question, I did mention that this is the purpose of Australian Democrat amendment No. 14.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is highly appropriate that the parenting allowance be exempted from the extended waiting period of two years. I mentioned earlier that not only is this a discriminatory measure but also it is one that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will harshly affect migrant women. For that reason, the Australian Democrats feel that it should be exempted from the government's extension of the waiting period.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this will be of interest to all members of the committee because it deals with the question of the parenting allowance. The parenting allowance will not be payable to newly arrived migrants under this proposal for a period of two years. But what is the parenting allowance? It is simply the old spouse rebate. It is a tax measure. The government is proposing to double tax newly arrived migrants, migrants who will be employed side by side with people who have been in Australia for many years. They will get the parenting allowance; in other words, they will continue to receive the full with&hyphen;child tax rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through you, Mr Chairman, I ask Senator Tambling&mdash;or the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) who I see is in the chamber&mdash;whether newly arrived migrants who are employed will be entitled to claim the full with&hyphen;child spouse rebate under the income tax system? If the government pursues this measure&mdash;that is to say, to withdraw entitlement to the parenting allowance&mdash;is it intended to restore equity between workers to allow those workers to claim the full with&hyphen;child spouse rebate?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parenting allowance is currently subject to the 26&hyphen;week newly arrived residents waiting period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was an appalling answer to a question relating to taxation. Deal with this seriously! I will not go to the wall on it but I will certainly vote for Senator Stott Despoja's amendment. The Labor Party should consider this because it is a question of equity as between workers. You will have one worker side by side with another. One <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5978"> worker is a newly arrived migrant and the other one has been here for 10, 15 years&mdash;maybe was born here. The latter will be entitled to the equivalent of a tax rebate for the full with&hyphen;child spouse rebate paid through the parenting allowance. The former, being the newly arrived migrant, will have his wages discriminated against because that migrant will not be entitled to receive what in effect is a tax transfer, and that is the parenting allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: will the government amend the income tax act so as to restore for the newly arrived migrant the right to claim the full with&hyphen;child spouse rebate?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pertinent arguments have been raised in this debate. Unfortunately for the government, there is no compelling reason attracting us to their argument. Senator Harradine raises the question of equity. In this instance where we are talking about the history of this allowance, emanating from the spousal rebate, there will be inconsistency in application between one worker and another. So it is something for all of us to be concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That inconsistency applies in so many of these instances, which is another factor that we need to take into account. But we are talking of something as fundamental as the parenting allowance. We are also acknowledging, as Senator Harradine rightly put, that there will be deep discrimination in the application of this allowance if some parents, as opposed to others, have to wait two years for it. At this stage, I would like to see whether the government can come up with a better reason for us to support this than the reason they have given so far.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we are waiting for the response, the deep discriminatory nature of this bill has been discovered. Senator Harradine, quite properly, is trying to recover at least some equality for those people who get a job and who pay taxes on their arrival in this country so that they are not penalised by not getting the parenting allowance available to the person working next to them who has been in the country longer or all their lives. This measure is about discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier we talked about a whole range of measures applying to people, for example, who do not have a job&mdash;they do not have access to the social security net. Widows will not have access to the social security net, and on it goes. It flies against the ethos of a fair go in this country. Labor started it with a six&hyphen;month waiting period and now, the coalition is ballooning that out to a two&hyphen;year waiting period. But for those people in work in this country who are following this debate, they will know how it would feel if, in exactly the same circumstances, they were taxed the same as the person next to them getting the parenting allowance. The government is saying, `We will give money to one lot of people, quite properly but not to another. Why? Because you happen to be new in this country. Just when you want to establish and get going and you are really eager about it, we will put a penalty in your way.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tambling referred to the need to use taxpayers' money wisely. What about the tax paid by the people who arrive in this country and who are employed? The government will take the money off them, the same as it would with anybody else, but it will not give them the benefit it gives anybody else. This is deeply discriminatory. It continues the theme of this legislation which breaches <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5979"> international conventions to which Australia is a signatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the point at hand here now is for those people who come to the country and have a job and are paying taxes. Why should they be treated differently from people next to them in the workplace? Senator Harradine has, of course, logic on his side, ethics on his side and a fair go on his side in drawing this to the attention of the chamber. An explanation by the government is due here. It does not deserve to get this measure past this committee and through the chamber any more than, in my books, it deserves to get the bill as a whole through the committee or through the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the ALP opposition for their support. I do understand and acknowledge their original rationale for separating this and other amendments from the amendments that they earlier supported; that is, they were prepared to prevent the extension of a two-year waiting period to those benefits that previously had not attracted any waiting period. I am glad they are also swayed by the logic which, I think, dictates <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that, if you are going to oppose a two-year waiting period for benefits such as the maternity allowance and other allowances, you should oppose the extension of that waiting period to an allowance such as the parenting allowance. So we appreciate the support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is one other point that needs to be made. It is along the same lines as Senator Harradine's earlier comments in this debate regarding the Medicare levy and access to Medicare benefits for newly arrived migrants. I think it is important that we get on record that yes, Senator Tambling, these people do know the rules when they apply and when they arrive. But they contribute in a number of ways. They contribute through migration programs; they contribute through hefty fees, through assurances of support, and through direct and indirect taxation. I do not think we should lose that argument from this debate&mdash;that these people do make an economic contribution and other contributions to this country. Therefore, they are entitled to the benefits that we are discussing here today.</PARA>

I would have had great difficulty finding that if it were not for the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, who took some time to find it and brought it forward and showed me. I was wondering whether the explanations as set out in these documents put out by the government could be better adjusted so that we more simple folk on the back bench could follow what goes on.

Is it the government's intention in using the word `serving' to get across to newly arrived migrants that they are under a punishment regime? Another word could have been chosen. We fairly simple folk on the back bench might have used the word `within', so it would read `the person was within a newly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5984"> arrived resident's waiting period immediately. . . '.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, who I think has done great work in here this morning, would understand that the use of that word seems to give to this legislation the flavour of putting these people to punishment. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is the department's intention and the government's intention in using that word to get across to migrants that they are going to be punished during the first two years that they are here. If that is not the intention, why did they use that word instead of a word such as `within'?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>We have moved this amendment to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 because we are concerned that nothing in this legislation says that the waiting period will not apply to either a refugee or humanitarian migrant, their family members, Australian citizens or their family members. There is concern that this legislation will have a discriminatory impact against Australian citizens or&mdash;as will be reflected in our next amendment in respect of the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;between Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That concern was picked up by the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Zita Antonios, in evidence to the committee. She was not the only person who raised this particular concern before the committee. She expressed her concerns as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as the Race Discrimination Commissioner I say that the perception could easily be that the proposed bill is inconsistent with the standards and the spirit that is embodied in the Racial Discrimination Act. I do not say that that is intentional; I think it is an unintentional consequence of Australia's agreements with countries like New Zealand and, in a limited circumstance, the United Kingdom. That is the key point I wish to stress . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Together with that concern about discrimination on the basis of race, we are particularly concerned that no Australian citizen or their family will be affected by this legislation in a discriminatory way. For instance, we do not want families of Australian citizens to be denied any access to benefits which they would have been receiving before this legislation. That is why we have the subclauses in 2A to protect the rights of Australian citizens or their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also particularly concerned that this legislation may have a harsh impact on refugees or humanitarian entrants to Australia. We have once again in this area had a proud record in terms of the numbers of people in humanitarian circumstances which we have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taken into Australia. Some half a million Australian citizens have come in as refugees and humanitarian entrants over the last 40 to 50 years. They have come in from all parts of the world. They have come in suffering from all sorts of duress and repression, physical or mental. The government needs to ensure that we respond to them and their needs when they come into our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should once again acknowledge that where we have provided resources and benefits here&mdash;and both sides of parliament have done so consistently over the years&mdash;those resources have had a very positive impact on the people that they have been applied to and people who have been the beneficiaries of them. As a consequence, you find many people in our society, who have come here as refugees or humanitarian entrants, who are making a very positive contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I keep on referring to the situation of the Vietnamese community&mdash;a community which is sometimes criticised in our popular media but which, despite some high levels of job seeking and dependence on social security benefits, has achieved enormously both in the workplace and in educational institutions. This community has been with us only for 20 years as a migrant group. There were a small number of Vietnamese Australians before the end of the Indochina war. In 20 years, people who have come here substantially as refugees and humanitarian entrants have made a very strong contribution. Their retention rates at schools are some 10 per cent above the rest of Australia. Their detention rate in prisons is below the rest of Australia. Their participation&mdash;particularly by women&mdash;in the workplace is higher than the Australian norm. They are one group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cambodians are another group. The Cambodians who had to suffer the repression and oppression of Pol Pot are enormously mobile in our society. They do rely on that assistance we give them in the first instance to give them a springboard in establishing their new lives. I could go across the world. People coming in from the Middle East or the former Yugoslavia, from East Timor, from Sri Lanka and the like have made an enormously good fist of their lives here and they have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5986"> relied on access to social benefits to get them a bit of a start&hyphen;off. The government and the Australian public get paid back from day one just about, because all these people have to go out shopping, they do need food, they do need whitegoods and so on. In purchasing those, they immediately pay back into government coffers through the whole raft of indirect taxes that they have to meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look, for instance, at their employment rate. Some 75 per cent of them are in the work force within 18 months to two years of their arriving here. They are the people who could otherwise be disadvantaged if we do not protect them through a provision like this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept from the government that there is some concern that the amendment as it now stands may need a bit of an addition to ensure it has the impact that we from this side of parliament desire it to have. For that reason I have moved amendment No. 1 in its amended form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate at this stage that we anticipate an amendment from Senator Harradine to our amendment here, and the opposition is keen and willing to accept that amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the opposition's amendment No. 1, and also amendment No. 2, to which Senator Bolkus also referred. Senator Tambling suggested in earlier comments that in yesterday's debate the Australian Democrats discussed the issue of humanitarian and refugee cases and, in some way, clouded the issue as to what this bill was about.

<PARA>I am sure that this is only a technical matter. The government, the opposition, the Australian Democrats, the Greens or anybody around the place here would not want to have a difficulty arise if this amendment were not put forward. The general principle behind the legislation is that newly arrived migrants should not be eligible for welfare benefits for their first two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the opposition, the government and the Democrats intend the waiting period not to apply to Australian citizens or their families. I am sure that is the intention of everybody around the chamber otherwise we would have the absurd result of Australians or their children returning home after being <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5987"> posted overseas being affected by the legislation. If they were Australian citizens they would not be affected by the legislation. However, if they were not Australian citizens theoretically they would be. There are nearly a million voters on the electoral roll who are British subjects who migrated here and, as electors, they should be treated no worse than other voters. They are not Australian citizens and could come within the scope of this two&hyphen;year waiting period if they have been away for four years and have not got a return visa&mdash;and some of them would not even bother getting a return visa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My technical amendment is designed to ensure that the two&hyphen;year waiting period is served only once, so if permanent residents leave Australia and come back they serve the two&hyphen;year waiting period only once during their lives. It should not be a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads and preventing their taking up overseas postings for Australian companies, missionary societies and the like. In other words, those people who are already permanent residents should not have the provisions of this legislation affecting them. After this legislation goes through, those coming to Australia should be required to serve only one waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit the technical amendment to the chamber and hope the government will take it on. I am sure the government does not intend the sort of effect I have explained. I am sure the government's legislation is not intended to affect existing permanent residents in Australia who just happen not to be Australian citizens. I take the opportunity to again refer to the usefulness of the committee system. Certainly I have found that system to be very useful. These matters are normally aired, although this matter was not. I congratulate Senator Ellison and all his committee for what they have done on this and a number of other references. I do hope the government will see the sense in accepting what I believe to be a technical amendment.</PARA>

<PARA>As I said in response to Senator Stott Despoja, I made most of the points I need to make in respect of this legislation when discussing amendment No. 1 but I will just make a few more. The first is that I add to the voice of Ms Zita Antonios&mdash;and that of Dr Mary Crock&mdash;who before a Senate committee last week with respect to other legislation made the point that the waiting period legislation and some of the migration regulations do have the impact of acting in a discriminatory manner. She referred to the unequal impact of legislation like this and the fact that through its unequal impact it would potentially have a capacity to be discriminatory. That is the point we really need to take into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we need to ensure that the legislation does not discriminate between different groups of people living within Australia. Senator Harradine's amendment to the previous clause goes some way towards that. He quite rightly picked up the situation particularly of people of British background who have been here for quite some time and can vote but have not become Australian citizens. Thirdly, the legislation is important because it sends the right message in terms of the way we want legislation to pass through this parliament. We do not want an unintended consequence to act in a racially discriminate way. I am sure the government will say that this legislation is not racially discriminate. I would say back to them: if that is the case, this amendment should be of no concern to you. </PARA>

In fact, my colleagues and I have championed the RDA in this place and I will not re&hyphen;read the relevant sections again today in the chamber. But we would like to reiterate that section 10 of that act makes it very clear that the characteristics that constitute racial discrimination include national or ethnic origin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to remind this chamber that the legislation we have been dealing with, the migration regulations we dealt with two weeks ago and the upcoming Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) seek to distinguish between permanent residents and citizens in this country. In so doing, I believe, it discriminates in a way that is inconsistent with the objectives of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will support this provision. I hope the government will take advantage of this opportunity, as I said earlier. This is a litmus test for the government in some ways to put its legislation where its mouth is, if you like, acknowledge the importance of the RDA and insert a provision into the bill that clearly stipulates that nothing in this legislation is to be taken as being inconsistent either expressly or impliedly with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. I urge the government to support this amendment.

<PARA>In moving these amendments, I indicate that I will not be proceeding with amendment No. 21, which relates to the parenting allowance. These three amendments refer to payments which currently have a six&hyphen;month waiting period. Our amendments in this instance remove retrospectivity. The new provisions proposed by the government ensure that the two&hyphen;year waiting period can date back to 1 April 1996. These amendments that I am moving now replace all references to 1 April 1996 with references to commencement on royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe the people who have come here to Australia, in many instances in dire circumstances, should be denied access to benefits by the retrospective impact of this legislation. We were also concerned that, even before this legislation reached this stage, in fact even before it was introduced into the Senate, some arms of the government were applying it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a lot of evidence as a committee from organisations across Australia, from Perth to Brisbane, that people had been sent away by DSS officers on the basis of the impact of this legislation before the legislation had even been implemented, before it had even been introduced into the Senate. This hastiness to take away people's benefits is something that we find excessively obscene. This hastiness of implementation by a press statement is something that, in a sense, we find particularly obscene.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned that the legislation here will be applied as from the date of royal assent as opposed to its having application from 1 April. Even if this legislation went through unamended on this particular point, you would have a situation where people would have been denied access from 1 April to 1 November because of the six&hyphen;month waiting period but could very easily have been getting payments over the last few weeks, payments which would be taken away from them because of the retrospective application of this particular section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the problems that the government has brought on its own head. The fact is that for four weeks now people could have been obtaining benefits rightfully waited for under the previous legislation but, because of the impact of this particular clause, if it goes through unamended, those benefits they have been receiving under existing law would be taken away because of the retrospective application of this particular provision. We see our amendment as being important in respect of the newstart allowance, the sickness allowance and the youth training allowance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes concerns about the retrospective provisions in the Bill and evidence that these may result in hardship for some newly arrived residents. In the Committee's view these provisions were clearly enunciated during the election campaign and information on proposed changes to the policy have been widely circulated by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The Committee notes that the provisions in the Bill relating to special benefits are prospective. Therefore new residents who arrive after 1 April 1996 and before the Royal Assent of the Bill will be eligible for special benefits under current arrangements. In the Committee's view, these  provisions provide an appropriate transition and will allay concerns about this aspect of the Bill.</PARA>

<PARA>I indicate that I will not be moving opposition amendment No. 20, an amendment which emanates from the parenting allowance provisions. This bill has quite a number of nasties in it&mdash;you wonder how they thought of some of them&mdash;and this provision is at the top of the list.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, there is probably conflict between these government proposals and the previous amendment picked up by the Senate, particularly that part of the amendment that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5992"> Senator Harradine moved, to exempt from the waiting period those who have been Australian permanent residents for two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about by this particular provision is ensuring that a partner coming into Australia, regardless of how long their partner living in Australia has been here, has to be subject to a two-year waiting period. It is part of the potential discrimination that could flow from this legislation, discrimination affecting the rights of those who are Australian citizens and the rights of those who are, and have been for some time, permanent residents. For those reasons we move these amendments. In doing so, we indicate that we are really concerned about what sort of cauldron some of these proposals have actually come from.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is worth while putting on the record now that the committee has before it a much more humane bill than the one that was brought into the parliament earlier in the year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is only one other question that I wish to raise at this particular stage. We are somewhat bemused on this side of the parliament that this legislation has gone through this morning.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask Senator Tambling: how is it that you have responsibility for this legislation this morning?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is quite an amazing circumstance because this is legislation which the government heralded as being critical. It is one that they kicked the political can for all it was worth in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Press</EMPHASIS> and tabloid press, trying to argue that people were bludging off the Australian public.

Can you explain what course of action this government is taking to address the problem of indigenous deaths in custody and high incarceration rates?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Coonan for the question. Yesterday's report was extremely distressing and I understand <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fully the anguish and frustration expressed by Social Justice Commissioner Mick Dodson. Since becoming a minister eight months ago I have been constantly asking the same questions: where has the $400 million gone, why has that level of expenditure failed to even make a dent in this terrible problem and why are there still so many indigenous people dying in custody?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no escaping the fact that the expenditure of that money has failed to achieve any improvement in the area of indigenous deaths in custody. This government gave a pre&hyphen;election promise to address the level of Aboriginal deaths in custody and incarceration rates and we have taken several concrete steps already to honour that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regarded this problem as a matter of urgency, but we also recognise that consultation with and involvement of indigenous people is essential. I have previously announced plans to hold a major summit on deaths in custody and incarceration rates and that process, which I might add has strong support from ATSIC, the Social Justice Commissioner, Mr Dodson, and the Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committee, is well under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For over two months, a steering committee involving my office, ATSIC, Attorney&hyphen;General's, PM&amp;C and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission has been working on this issue. The national Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committee is conducting a consultation process, involving indigenous communities and organisations, in the lead&hyphen;up to the summit. Eight indigenous consultation sessions have been scheduled between 11 November and 18 December in all states and meetings have already occurred in Adelaide and Alice Springs. These sessions involve concerned indigenous organisations and the state police and corrective services departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extensive process of consultation with indigenous communities will be followed by a national summit of indigenous representatives on 17 and 18 February to set the direction of the ministerial summit six weeks later. As part of the process, the Prime Minister <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5998"> wrote on 7 November to all premiers and chief ministers seeking their support. In conjunction with the Attorney-General, I have written to all state ministers for Aboriginal affairs, attorneys&hyphen;general and police ministers along similar lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commonwealth, state and territory ministers with responsibilities for indigenous affairs, law and justice, policing and corrective services, and juvenile justice have been invited to attend the summit. The areas identified for discussion in consultation with Aboriginal justice advisory committees are, firstly, juvenile justice and, secondly, diversionary strategies, policing and prisons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intended outcome of the summit is that there will be a renewed commitment to reduce both indigenous deaths in custody and incarceration rates. I can inform the Senate that already I have been able to gain agreement from all states and territories to this process and a commitment to treat the summit as a priority area. That was agreed at last Friday's ministerial meeting in Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is committed to achieving outcomes. We do not want another talkfest; nor do we want to simply throw more money at the problem when clearly that approach has, tragically, failed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last three years the means test has been removed from rollover funds and superannuation assets. It has produced a rort which financial advisers have been happy to drive horses and carts through, but it has also discriminated as between older Australians. We are fixing that, and I think we are doing so in a very fair way and a reasonable way.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for the question. Today's report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> , quoting some of Australia's leading economists, is yet another indictment of Labor's 13 years in office. The research reveals that, after 13 years of Labor:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's middle&hyphen;income earners are increasingly insecure, blighted by falling incomes and longer working hours and anxiety about job security.</PARA>
<PARA>The research shows that middle Australia has been hard hit by falling real wages and the thinning of jobs&mdash;Labor's legacy. In particular, what has Labor done in relation to middle income families? Young middle income families are the first generation since World War II whose living standards have not risen during a period of economic recovery. Employment in the middle income earning range for male full&hyphen;time workers fell significantly under Labor. Household incomes below $44,000 fell in real terms. The proportion of people falling to the bottom of the income earnings ladder almost doubled over a 15&hyphen;year <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6000"> period, while the number who moved to the top has doubled.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That reminds me of what I have said before in the Senate. Middle income earners saw their real household incomes fall by nearly $58 per week in Labor's first 10 years of office, Senator Cook. Home loan repayments were 19 per cent of median family income in 1983. Under Labor, they rose to a massive 27 per cent. I also remind honourable senators that it was Labor that gave us nearly one million unemployed, the highest rates of unemployment since the 1930s. Labor left 27 per cent of young Australians out of work when it was thrown out of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the legacy of Labor, the party that claims to be the party of social justice. This report today reaffirms what all Australian voters knew when they went to the polls in March. That is why Labor was so unceremoniously thrown out of office.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is, as I said yesterday, that there is a great deal of misinformation about the changes to the provider numbers. There are a great deal of opportunities for young doctors to be employed on a salary basis without the need for provider numbers.

There are something like 400 positions around Australia in the public hospitals where salaried doctors are badly needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the proposals of the Australian government requiring young graduates to have additional training before they become general practitioners with a right to have a provider number are not unfair. They are reasonable. As I said yesterday, we want a quality of care for our patients which can be evidenced by sufficient training. I remember that Jenny Macklin, for instance, had a national health strategy for the previous government in which improving the training of our doctors was given a very high priority.</PARA>

Minister, does the federal government stand by the principle that medical treatment arising out of injuries or illnesses sustained in war should not entail an additional financial cost to veterans? Minister, is it a fact that in supporting this principle a $2.70 per week increase in veterans' pensions was introduced to offset the $2.70 cost of pharmaceutical prescriptions and that prescriptions in excess of 52 per year were provided free?

Let me say from the outset that the government is committed to fulfilling its commitments under the climate convention and to participating constructively in the ongoing negotiations under the Berlin mandate. Australia will, however, insist that any outcome of greenhouse negotiations is fair in terms of impact and safeguarding Australia's economic and trade interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we agreed to the uniform targets currently being proposed in the international negotiations, our economy and every Australian would suffer a significantly greater loss than any other developed country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has estimated that doing so and maintaining the emissions at the 1990 level would in present value terms have a cumulative effect upon our economy equivalent to a loss of some six per cent of our 1996 gross national expenditure. A cost of this magnitude would be equivalent to a loss in the savings of every Australian of $1,900 in 1996 dollars or a reduction in the savings of a family of four of about $7,600.</PARA>

Because of the nature of our economy, Australia's losses would be very much greater than most other developed countries. The Australian economy is heavily dependent on fossil fuels both for electricity generation and for export revenue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European Union, some of whose members have been critical of our approach, would suffer much less than a one per cent loss, compared with Australia's six per cent, under stabilisation at 1990 levels. The loss in the United States&mdash;strong supporters of uniform targets&mdash;would be just over one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that Australia's contribution to greenhouse gas is 1.4 per cent globally. By comparison, I understand the US contribution is in excess of 25 per cent. These differences in the cost to different countries reflect the different structures of their economies and differences in trading patterns and trading partners. Clearly, the more severe uniform target proposals&mdash;such as reducing emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2010, which some countries have proposed&mdash;would involve even greater losses to Australia. Accordingly, the government will continue to actively campaign for all countries to bear their fair share of the effort in addressing climate change.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have a response here from the minister for health, because Senator Neal's questions are so very predictable. Perhaps she is not aware of the fact that cost shifting by the states and territories has been a longstanding problem for Australia's health system which was not addressed by the previous government; that is, the shifting of the practice of managing patient care so that costs that should be borne in the hospital system, which are the states' responsibility, are shifted to the Commonwealth through the Medicare system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cost shifting activities are estimated to be of the order of $300 million a year&mdash;effectively taking from the Commonwealth, through the Medicare benefits and pharmaceutical benefits schemes, $300 million every year on top of the nearly $5 billion the Commonwealth pays the states towards providing public hospital services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, Labor governments have attempted to implicate individual doctors and hold them responsible for participation in cost shifting schemes by states and territories. Dr Wooldridge has taken a more constructive approach and has asked for doctors' help to get better information and data collections to support dealings with the states and territories in relation to cost shifting activities. Suggestions by the AMA that doctors who do not provide information on cost shifting to the government will be fined are clearly false. That is not the intention of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is tackling the problem of cost shifting where the problem really lies; that is, with the states and territories. We are holding health ministers to the promises they made at the June 1995 meeting in Alice Springs by annually recovering growth in cost shifting since that time. This amounts to around $75 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1996-97 budget, the government announced that adjustments totalling $75 million would be made, and a provisional distribution based on per capita shares was included in the budget estimates. Dr Wooldridge recently approved the distribution of the $75 million in 1996-97, based on a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> combination of states' relative cost shifting in 1995-96 and states' per capita expenditure under the diagnostic imaging and radiology parts of the Medicare benefits schedule in 1995-96, relative to a national average under the diagnostic imaging and radiology parts of the MBS. Where there is more scope for cost shifting, per capita expenditure in New South Wales was 24 per cent higher than the average of all other states. The cost shifting adjustments represent only two per cent of the $1.5 billion of hospital funding grants which will be paid to New South Wales in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even after this adjustment, HFG payments to New South Wales in 1996-97 are still one per cent higher than they were in 1995-96.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The minister stated in her higher education statement that $72 million would be applied to indigenous higher education. This is significantly more than the previous government's commitment. Specifically, the government committed itself to spending $6.5 million on a number of indigenous higher education centres in areas such as public health, law, education, employment, language, environmental management, and housing and community design. Could the minister please inform the Senate of the progress of this initiative, particularly the benefits of these centres to indigenous Australians?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6010" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ellison for that question. He has had a longstanding interest in the welfare of indigenous Australians, and recognises&mdash;as I think all senators do&mdash;that the degree of disadvantage faced by indigenous Australians is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to me, to the government and, I would hope, to all senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The gap between indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous education participation and attainment is still significant. The year 12 retention rate, for example, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students is only 31 per cent compared with 73 per cent for non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. We do know that indigenous Australians who have had the benefit of tertiary qualifications enjoy similar employment prospects to other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, in this year's budget, as Senator Ellison says, the government did announce $72 million over the next three years to improve access by indigenous Australians to higher education, and that represents a significant increase over the former government's proposals. This additional funding will support improved outcomes in the university sector and includes funding for new indigenous higher education centres at several universities. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was with great pleasure that I announced on the weekend funding of $8.8 million over three years for the establishment of five indigenous higher education centres to pursue important matters for indigenous Australians. I am pleased, and I hope all senators are, that this is an increase of $2.3 million on the amount that was actually announced in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centres will be for high level teaching and research in vital areas such as indigenous health, curriculum and research development, and natural and cultural resource management. The centres will improve indigenous Australians' access to higher education and boost their educational outcomes. They will be located at the Curtin University of Technology, the University of Newcastle, the Northern Territory University, the University of South Australia and the University of Western Australia, and will be funded with between $1.7 million and $2 million over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submissions were assessed by an expert panel which was headed by an independent chair, Dr Bill Jonas, Director of the National Museum. These centres will provide a focus for indigenous research and will directly contribute expertise and knowledge in their respective disciplines to benefit indigenous communities. They will encourage the incorporation of indigenous Australian perspectives into courses and teaching and help the general community understand indigenous knowledge and learning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous people will play an important part in managing these centres. Up to three indigenous teaching and research fellowships will be awarded to each of the centres to encourage the development of indigenous scholarships in key areas of research. The competitive selection process has already led to increased cooperation between universities, and has stimulated some creative thinking about the development of indigenous higher education. The successful proposals include formal sharing arrangements with other institutions so the whole indigenous community will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, in conclusion, Senator Ellison is right in highlighting this issue. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6011"> government did commit to spending more money, and I am pleased to identify to the Senate that we have spent $2.3 million more than we actually thought we would be able to in the budget.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the Minister confirm that the investigation found that a person or persons unknown in the Department of the Chief Minister in the Northern Territory provided the material to a Brisbane based firm, Feedback Services, which provided data related services to the Liberal Party of Australia, who then passed this material back to the Country Liberal Party in the territory for use by Mr Dondas?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the Australian Federal Police have no jurisdiction to pursue what happened to the material once it was provided to the Northern Territory authorities, will the federal government release the AFP report and support calls for an independent inquiry into the misuse of Australian Electoral Commission data in the Northern Territory by the Northern Territory authorities?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney&hyphen;General has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that, in March 1996, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) referred an allegation of unauthorised access to electoral information to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for investiga <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tion.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am further advised that the Northern Territory Police are undertaking inquiries into related matters and it is therefore inappropriate for me to comment further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the approach taken by successive Ministers responsible for the Australian Federal Police, I will not release an AFP investigation report.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are you aware of claims by the Australian Medical Association that the federal health ministers' proposal to restrict new doctors' access to Medical provider numbers will lead to a reduction in the number of women doctors? Has your attention been drawn to claims by the AMA Women in Medicine Committee that Dr Wooldridge's proposal, which will further increase the inflexibility of postgraduate training schemes and limit practice options, will discriminate against women doctors and medical students? Minister, are you aware that medical graduates who are unable to access an accredited training position will no longer be able to secure a provider number and practise medicine part&hyphen;time?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to ask a supplementary question. Would you concede that these arrangements will reduce the level of choice for women wishing to arrange their lives, flexibly secure in the knowledge that one day they can return to full&hyphen;time or part&hyphen;time practice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Newman</EMPHASIS>  has provided the following answer:  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6012"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not have any evidence to suggest that women will be disadvantaged by the measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it were true that women were disadvantaged by the requirement to undertake training before entering general practice then we would expect to see female non&hyphen;specialists over represented in the other medical practitioner (OMPs). In fact, both the OMP and GP categories of non specialist have very similar proportions of women. In 1994/95:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">30.9% of non specialists were female;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">30.64% of general practitioners</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">31.55% of OMPs</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Source: Medicare data</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proportion of women entering medical schools has increased dramatically in recent years. As a consequence, the representation of women in the medical workforce has been improving significantly. In 1993&hyphen;94 29% of all GPs were women. That figure for 1995&hyphen;96 is 32%. However, in the under 35 year age group, women represent 54% of all GPs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supporting the position of properly trained GPs will therefore support women who have chosen general practice as their vocation and make it attractive for women to continue choosing general practice by reducing the competition from less well qualified doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For women doctors who choose not to become GPs, there will be a range of alternative options as there are now. These include public hospital positions, other post graduate training in specialty fields, salaried positions in hospitals, community health centres, government, the non&hyphen;Government sector, private enterprise and academia. The majority of these employers offer part&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee (AMWAC) is also pursuing the issue of increased flexibility and part time work in relation to hospital career positions so that this type of work is better suited to the needs of women doctors. One recommendation the Working Party is that the Committee of the Presidents of Medical Colleges should undertake a major review of College arrangements to facilitate female specialist training and practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) Training Program, for example, has options to accommodate both part time and suspended training. A part time trainee in the RACGP Training Program could easily take a longer period eg 8 years to complete the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Issues around fairness and gender equity in post graduate training are of concern but are not directly related to this measure. The Minister has indicated that he will vigorously pursue these issues with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> medical colleges should it be demonstrated that a problem really does exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that medical graduates who are unable to access an accredited training position will no longer be able to secure a provider number and practise medicine part&hyphen;time, or full time, without appropriate training. The importance of post graduate training has been stated again and again by the Australian Medical Association, the professional Colleges, Jenny Macklin's National Health Strategy, the Rural Doctors Association, the Deans of the Medical Schools, even the Australian Medical Students Association. Medical schools produce undifferentiated graduates, that is young doctors with basic training, but not the expertise needed to practice without further specialised training or supervision in a field. This policy will ensure that all newly registered doctors complete specific training in their field before entering private practice.</PARA></QUESTION></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Says its past, Senator Macdonald. The simple fact is that clinging to energy intensive, carbon emitting, capital intensive industry is not in Australia's best long&hyphen;term interests. It is not where the jobs of the future will come from and that is where Senator Parer and this government are wrong. A proper greenhouse strategy aiming for results rather than just the appearance of doing something for Australian business would create jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surest way for a household to raise its savings&mdash;and this is what Senator Parer concentrated on, the so&hyphen;called impact on family and national savings&mdash;is for the members of that household to be in employment. The surest way to raise our national savings is for this government to cut unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When will this government acknowledge that environment industries are the industries of the future and that those countries who a decade ago introduced the highest environmental standards are now reaping the benefit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6015"> of the largest market share of this rapidly expanding world environmental industry? But this government is stuck in its 1950s view of Australia as part quarry and part sheep station. If we keep that up, then the decline of this nation and the decline in our living standards is ensured. We are not being smart, we are being defensive about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is totally unacceptable of Senator Parer to quote ABARE figures at us in the Senate, because their model is skewed. It is just like the Industry Commission&mdash;we have seen it here over the six years that I have been here. Their model is skewed to play up their sponsors in the resource sector, to play up their contribution to the economy and ignore everybody else. They exaggerate the costs of greenhouse strategy and they downplay the benefits. They do not even put environmental benefits in the model; they say, `These are unmeasurable externalities.' I could quote you back some of the work done by the World Resources Institute in the United States, the European Economic Community or the Australia Institute in Canberra which shows quite clearly that on this issue ABARE has it wrong&mdash;they are wrong!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do not deny that adjustment costs will be involved in a proper greenhouse response strategy. But a proper strategy would plan to minimise these costs and it would do this in part by creating new opportunities. I believe that at the end of the day the benefits would outweigh the costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of jobs, we have to go back to challenging this constant assertion that greenhouse will cost Australian jobs. I remind the minister that a 1994 House of Representatives committee identified the potential employment growth within the domestic pollution control industry as at least 20,000 by the year 2000. The same report said that if we could capture just two per cent of the world pollution control market by the year 2000, it could generate 150,000 Australian jobs and $8 billion worth of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has the argument the wrong way round. By taking the bit between our teeth, we could become a more visible, serious world leader. We could create more, not fewer jobs in Australia just by being a bit <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> smart.

As I have said in this place a number of times now, the government does recognise the responsibility to be part of the global solution to the greenhouse gas issue and for Australia to pull its share of the weight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Senator Parer was saying let's just calm down and be realistic. The first element of realism is that we are actually only contributing a very small proportion of the world's greenhouse gases. He said 1.4 per cent. The second point of realism&mdash;and I have not heard it disputed by too many, Senator Kernot&mdash;is that costs of abatement, particularly if you go down the path that I think you are advocating and that Senator Faulkner when he was minister advocated and that is the form of a carbon tax, will hurt Australian industry more than practically any other country. In fact, most accept it will hurt us more than all other developed nations. That is why we have said that as we play our part, we believe it should be pursuant to a formula that is fair and achievable. If it is going to hurt us more, if it is going to put existing jobs in jeopardy&mdash;so much talking about hopes of jobs for the future, Senator&mdash;when already three&hyphen;quarters of a million Australians are unemployed, then you would expect us to act cautiously. That is why we have advocated the principle of differentiation that can recognise different economic profiles&mdash;not to avoid responsibility but to share responsibility in a way which is fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot, I think you would recognise that, as we seek to build this economy, it is important to work to our comparative advantages. One of those comparative advantages is in relation to the processing of minerals.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will mention that. It is a very energy demanding task. It is more environmentally friendly for those minerals to be processed in Australia rather than to be processed offshore in the developing world, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6016"> which will actually result in a worse greenhouse outcome but improve our greenhouse record. So what you are really suggesting is that, in order for us to improve our figures, we export industry in which we have comparative advantages and, by exporting that industry, export Australian jobs. We are not prepared to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can go on and look at the other areas in which we have comparative advantage. In our rural sector we have a comparative advantage but, again, it is high in the emissions of some greenhouse gases. You can close down the Australian rural production, particularly animal production, if you wish. It will improve our greenhouse figures, but it will not improve the economic welfare of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not an either/or situation. What Senator Kernot seems to be saying is that you have to abandon existing jobs and abandon existing opportunities in the hope of gaining new generation jobs. I am saying that you can do both. You are right, Senator Kernot, in saying that the environment industry&mdash;which is estimated to be about $US500 billion a year already&mdash;is growing. We want to encourage and support Australian industry into those opportunities. That is why I led a small environment industry delegation to the recent ministerial meeting that took place in Indonesia, where the Australian environment industry is starting to recognise opportunities and to seize those opportunities with the development of production of Australian jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue to encourage and support that, but it is not either/or. They are jobs we need, but they are jobs we need as well. We need the jobs that come out of industries where we have a comparative advantage such as our mineral industry. We need the jobs that come out of our advantage of being one of the great producers of good quality coal and, also, we need the jobs that come out of our still very important rural sector, Senator Kernot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are seeking to do is good for Australia. It can be a win-win situation. We contribute fairly to the greenhouse problem as well as support and save Australian jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we have seen several examples of environmental irresponsibility&mdash;not just environmental irresponsibility but social irresponsibility and economic irresponsibility. Senator Parer concentrated in his response&mdash;and I am also taking note of Senator Hill's answer today in relation to the environment&mdash;on what it will cost us to take action on greenhouse gas emissions. He did not actually mention what it will cost us to bury our heads in the sand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is it costing us now? What is it costing us to experience the damage of climatic change? What will it cost in terms of species? What will it cost the industry? What will it cost the local economy? What will it cost in the future when we put off making decisions on the basis that somehow or other we can have no discount rate and assume the future can look after itself?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the cost of ongoing petroleum dependency in our community? What is the cost of not being smart now to plan for reducing our level of petroleum dependency in the way we design our cities? We need smart thinking. We need to be thinking about the way we design houses, thinking about standards in cars and thinking about standards in the way we design our transport systems. We need to be thinking about whether we have some kind of overall plan, if we do, in relation to transport, be it rail or shipping. Does this sound familiar in respect of the last few days? We need to have some sorts of goals, and that does not seem to be the case here. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6017">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that, whatever big corporations want, that is what they get&mdash;no matter what the real cost is. The irony is that there are more jobs via energy conservation and efficiency, and the irony is that energy conservation and efficiency costs one-tenth of what it costs to provide for new energy production. It is not in the interests of the current fossil fuel industry to push that, and it seems that it is not in the interests of the government to look at what the real issues are&mdash;even economic issues&mdash;in terms of turning around the thinking to smart thinking, not outdated thinking, for the future and planning ahead for life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a massive example of environmental irresponsibility that we heard today. We know that Senator Parer has already made public statements about the fact that he was going to move to streamline environmental processes. The announcement was leaked, perhaps through Senator Hill, but we know who is actually involved with this decision making in the role of the government. We have Senator Hill suggesting that we should trust the states in relation to environmental standards. We have Senator Hill not giving any answer in relation to what happens under his proposed regime or the government's proposed regime or perhaps Senator Parer's proposed regime when states are not under the categories of national significance, environmental significance or economic significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What happens to states which are not meeting agreed international or national standards? From what I have heard today&mdash;nothing. What happens when the desires of corporations to make more profit become far more important than any local considerations? I have no idea from what Senator Hill was saying if there are any plans to have any proper assessment process of what is even economically nationally significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is some assumption that whatever a proponent says will be the widespread benefits of a proposal is the truth. If they say there will be thousands of jobs and $X billion worth of export benefits, there is some assumption that there is no need for anybody to check that. All we have to do is squash down environmental standards and make sure that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the project goes ahead whatever the community cost, whatever the environmental cost, whatever the social cost and, quite frankly, whatever the real economic cost. If a project is marginal&mdash;if it is only just making a profit for the community in dollar terms&mdash;and if the community ends up paying a greater amount in the long run, then you would have to say the project is not viable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people, who have spoken for five minutes about environmental responsibility, have the classic opportunity to do it. And what are they going to do? They are going to look after the interests of a multinational company which they seem to think, from what I understand them to be saying, is of more interest than the environment&mdash;a multinational company that in the past has not been terribly efficient, has not been terribly good to Australian consumers and has not been terribly efficient in the cost of producing and getting on with proper telecommunications. Where is the environmental responsibility? Of course, they do not want to hear about that. All we hear from the Greens and the Democrats is whinge, whinge, whinge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Yesterday I had the opportunity and the pleasure of being with the Antarctic Division of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories in Hobart. I was very pleased to be able to see just a fraction of the very good work those people are doing. I was pleased to learn of the tremendous work that the Antarctic Division is doing in measuring the ozone layer&mdash;and the difficulties that the world is experiencing in that regard&mdash;and in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6018"> looking at the questions of greenhouse gas. In fact, the Australian Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, through the Antarctic Division, is making a major worldwide contribution to our understanding of the depletion of the ozone layer and the impacts of greenhouse gas. I would have thought that the Democrats and the Greens should have been congratulating Australia at every opportunity instead of knocking us all the time on the great, world&hyphen;leading work we are doing in this field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I know that the Greens and the Democrats are the high tax parties. They have always wanted to tax ordinary Australians. Does Senator Kernot still want to charge $1 a litre for petrol and put up the taxes of ordinary Australians on the petrol they use? The carbon tax issue keeps coming up. I am not sure that I listened intently enough to Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy, when he was answering, but I understood him to say that the Democrats' proposal would add $7,000 to the costs of every Australian family. This is what we have come to expect from the Democrats&mdash;just adding to the taxes paid by ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill has emphasised, and I want to repeat it, that Australia's contribution to greenhouse gases is 1.4 per cent of the global total. So we are a pretty small player. Any percentage is too much, and of course this government will continue to work towards reductions of that. But, as Senator Hill said, the Democrats and the Greens are proposing that we export out of Australia the environmentally sensitive minerals processing we have now and put it into developing countries which do not have the standards we have, which will quickly pick up any shortfall of Australian export material in the minerals field and which will do it in a much less environmentally sensible and sustainable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Not only would the Greens and the Democrats have us pushing these mineral processings into less environmentally sensitive areas but they also want to export Australian jobs. Mr Deputy President, as you and honourable senators would know, this government is determined to make sure that there is proper employment for everyone, that we do  that in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the most environmentally sensitive way and that we continue the good work that the Antarctic Division&mdash;in fact, all parts of the Australian science community&mdash;is doing towards something tangible about the greenhouse impact on the ozone layer.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA>The essential aspect of the answer by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, was that there is no intention of reducing public sector remuneration, which includes superannuation. The question related to a statement in a letter written to Commonwealth public servants by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when Leader of the Opposition. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I give you my rock&hyphen;solid guarantee that the Coalition will not cut and destroy public sector superannuation schemes or the entitlements of existing and prospective Commonwealth Government employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our policy on public sector superannuation is clear and unequivocal and was set out in our superannuation and public administration policies released last week.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.

I would categorise the response as political speak.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by Louise Dodson headed `Bureaucracy to get a corporate look with CEOs at the top'. The journalist wrote:</PARA>

<PARA>I think there is a conflict between what the Prime Minister said and the implications of what Mr Reith is saying in relation to the reform of public sector salaries. Public Service pay and conditions, according to Louise Dodson, are to be deregulated. The package of conditions, Senator Kemp says, includes superannuation. So do we take from that that Senator Kemp is not giving the assurance&mdash;he is saying that it is going to be deregulated? Why could he not simply endorse the comments made by Mr Howard?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons for urgency: All of the measures commence during the 1996&hyphen;97 year or earlier. Introduction and passage in the 1996 Spring sittings of Parliament is crucial to allay uncertainty in the community over the measures and to protect the revenue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In the few minutes that I have to comment on the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation, I firstly point out that the matter referred to the committee deals with the issue of the Liberal government's proposed deeming on the superannuation assets of persons who turn 55 and the offsetting of the deemed income on their superannuation against unemployment benefits, disability or sickness benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will hit hard at some 67,000 Australians in the short term. It will hit a great many more Australians in the longer term, but I will come to that shortly. This measure is to take effect from 20 September next year. It will hurt unemployed, sick and disabled Australians quite dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who will be hurt by this measure include a rail worker from Port Pirie in South Australia. He has just turned 55 and has a relatively small amount of superannuation of just over $100,000. He has been made redundant and has no chance of finding another job. He believed that he would be able to put aside his superannuation to the age of 60 and, at least to some extent, live on the earnings <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of that superannuation. He now finds he has to unravel his retirement plans because his superannuation is deemed to earn income at the age of 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned that this will hit hard at the retirement plans of some 67,000 Australians. The committee believes that potentially it will hurt hundreds of thousands of Australians over the next 10 to 15 years. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the superannuation guarantee which came in some four years ago and the general advent and spreading of superannuation to all Australian workers mean that those Australians reaching the age of 55 in the next 10 to 15 years will have significantly more superannuation. This is illustrated by the fact that in 1983 the average balance in superannuation was only $13,000. Today it is $40,000. Within 10 years we are likely to see the average balance in superannuation accounts for nine out of 10 Australians reach $100,000. This measures affects any person with more than $45,000 in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason for the increasing number&mdash;probably 360,000&mdash;of Australians eventually being affected by this measure is the ageing population. There are approximately 1.2 million Australians aged between 45 and 50 and almost one million Australians between the age of 50 and 55. When they reach the age of 55, they will be deemed to be earning on their superannuation. If they are unemployed&mdash;and apparently one in five Australians at the age of 55 is unemployed&mdash;they will have to draw down part or all of their superannuation in order to offset the loss, in part or whole, of their unemployment or disability pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is truly a measure that hits very hard at elderly Australians, particularly Australians who have turned 55, and particularly Australians who went to considerable trouble during their lives to put aside some money for superannuation for their retirement income. When they are unemployed, when they hit 55, they are hit for six if they are unemployed, sick or disabled. This is truly a disastrous measure for ageing Australians at a time of great uncertainty in their life, when they are attempting to find other employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6028">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's excuse for this measure is that it is there to catch millionaires. The evidence from the department before the committee is that only 93 per cent of the people who will be caught by this measure have less than $200,000 in superannuation. Nine out of 10 people have less than $200,000 in superannuation. They are not millionaires. They are electricians, bank clerks, former rail workers and shopkeepers. We even had the tragic case of a woman whose husband is on a disability pension because he has cancer of the brain. They have to draw on their superannuation over the next two years otherwise they have no income. This is truly a dreadful measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, there are a number of other undesirable aspects of this legislation. Many of the 67,000 people who have put aside money for superannuation have entered into long-term retirement commitments. They have purchased annuities or pensions. They now have to unravel their arrangements in many cases. They will be subject to additional fees and charges. There is a contradictory test. If you want to access your superannuation benefits, you have to apply to the trustee and state that you are, in effect, unemployed in order to access the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a significant impact on the budget. The government will save money in the short term but it will cost it money in the long term when those people have drawn down on their superannuation and when they turn 65, they will receive a higher part or full pension. We asked the government for costing or modelling on this issue. None could be provided. Also, the measure will have a significant impact on national saving. Again, we asked the government for modelling on the impact on national saving. None has been carried out.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are happy to endorse the majority report of the Select Committee on Superannuation on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996. We agree with the report that the government proposal to add superannuation into the assets test for social security benefits for beneficiaries aged over 55 was poorly thought out and would reduce retirement savings. This measure, announced in the August budget, was estimated to save $92 million in 1997-98, falling to $67 million in the following year by cutting benefits to over 67,000 people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee majority report found that the policy cuts right across retirement incomes policy, with very little thought to the short-term or long-term consequences. It is a bad piece of policy to count superannuation within the assets test used to reduce social security when often the person could not access their superannuation even if they wanted to. Furthermore, it is false to say that the government will save up to $92 million a year when the savings are earned by reducing the person's retirement savings, thereby increasing their reliance on the age pension in retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will be prepared to support the inclusion of large superannuation accounts&mdash;for instance, those over $250,000 in the assets test&mdash;but only in relation to funds accumulated prospectively. The measures should not be retrospective in our view. We would insist that the government also ensure that superannuation regulations allow access to the funds if they are needed without taxation, ISC or fund exit fee penalties. This would prevent those with very large superannuation funds from abusing the social security system while those with limited resources could keep their superannuation for their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6029"> retirement. But it was not acceptable that these people, having saved for their retirement, should have the rules changed in midstream and have to raid their retirement savings to fund periods of disability or unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats also endorse the call by the majority for more detailed research into the rorting to prevent people double-dipping on DSS pensions when they were effectively retired. I commend this report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) gives effect to the June Premiers Conference outcomes to no longer exempt from sales tax motor vehicles purchased by state governments and local governments. It has been estimated that the sales tax on cars would cost state governments around $300 million a year and local governments approximately $50 million a year. The reasons for the change were to raise revenue and to put state government and local government bodies in the same position with regard to the sales tax and prevent deterioration in the revenue base due to the increasing use of cars as part of government salary packages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will not be opposing this bill, which is a compromise. It is a compromise to try to dig the government out of the appalling mess that it created for itself when shortly after the election, to the combined anger&mdash;I might add, significant anger&mdash;of state and local governments around Australia, it ratted fairly spectacularly on a number of pre-election commitments that had been given in the run-up to the 2 March election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> During that period, we had not caught up with this new piece of political speak of core and non-core promises. We did not hear about all that until after the election. This certainly was an unequivocal breach of clear commitments that had been given prior to the elec tion. You do not have to rely on me for authority on that; you simply have to look at the chorus of protest from the political colleagues of this government around Australia after it happened. Dean Brown, the Premier of South Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that's simply an underhand means of trying to grab funding from the States and I stress the Federal Government has taken soft options they, for the last 10&hyphen;12 years, have cut monies to the States but expanded their own income and expenditure very considerably,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad, Minister, from your reaction&mdash;your interjection of `Tch, tch'&mdash;that you think it is such a big joke. I am sure the Premier of South Australia will be interested to hear that this newly appointed minister in the Senate thinks it is a matter of no account whatsoever that those commitments given by his colleagues prior to the election were torn apart immediately afterwards. Premier Brown did in fact accurately state that you have broken a number of significant election promises with this measure. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they have not maintained the general grants to the States as we have an agreement to do, and as they promised they would.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in fact the case. As we know right across Australia, in all states and territories, there was a significant reduction in the level of federal government support which this coalition in the campaign promised they would maintain. The Premier of South Australia went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It smacks of a Government in Canberra that is very arrogant indeed and has dealt a very severe blow to Commonwealth/State relations.</PARA>
<PARA>I could go on to quote the leaders of a number of other governments around Australia and, indeed, the reaction by local government across Australia who saw very mistakenly that they perhaps had some allies in this new coalition government because of all the commitments, hand over heart, that were made prior to 2 March about the new birth of recognition of local government. They, along <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6030"> with the state governments, soon found out how misplaced was their trust on that score.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quotations would occupy the entire time I have available for this debate, so I will simply conclude with what the Victorian Treasurer had to say about his colleagues on the same issue. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's a very black day for the new Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) here, Honest John. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The central appeal to the people of Australia was that he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could be trusted, that he would keep his promise and he would honour his commitments and here he's broken no less than five commitments. Two election promises. No tax increases. This is a tax increase. He will maintain State funding. As you've rightly pointed out this morning, it in fact takes another $600 million off the States in addition to the amount he's claiming as the offset.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say in respect of the Treasurer (Mr Costello):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the $619 million of grants. They are the second instalment of a three year agreement which was finalised at last year's Premiers' Conference. So Mr Costello is essentially repudiating the agreement made only 12 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA>I know that all honourable senators will recall these statements. It is not all that common in this country to be this violently attacked by your own political colleagues, particularly for a newly elected government. The Victorian conservatives are very close in political terms to this government, but the Victorian Treasurer went on to say again in respect of the government's commitments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that is a flagrant repudiation of, not only his election commitments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about the Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These burdens flow through to State taxpayers and they'll have to fund these burdens, and Mr Costello is taxing them by stealth in flagrant breach of his election commitment, upon which he was elected with an overwhelming mandate by the people.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the final quotation which represents just how far this government's conservative colleagues in Victoria went was the last part <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this interview with the Victorian Treasurer&mdash;and, remember, he is a tory Treasurer&mdash;when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a very bad start by the new Howard Government, that they're repudiating fundamental election commitments, they're doing more damage to State taxpayers than even Keating did.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is from an ultra&hyphen;conservative Victorian Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the background to this piece of legislation that we are seeing off in the Senate this afternoon. It is, as I have said, a compromise bill to help the Treasurer save face after having been done over comprehensively by his own Liberal colleagues at the Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a press statement on 19 February 1996, the current Treasurer promised the states and territories a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue. This was going to be revenue neutral. He also, I might say, guaranteed the then current level of services to the states. These are the broken commitments that the Premier of South Australia and the Treasurer of Victoria were referring to in the quotes I have just delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of that, the government broke a major promise not to increase taxes. If it had not been for the Liberal premiers, who publicly monstered these changes, the increased tax burdens on the states, territories and local government would have been even greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from being revenue neutral, this bill ensures that it will be revenue negative for the states. What has happened to the promise of a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue? What has happened to it is that it has sunk without trace, like so many other Howard government promises. As it is, the government has forced over $1&half; billion in cuts onto the states, on top of the callous and absolutely indiscriminate cuts contained in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cutting this level of funding from the states is just one substantial step in the government's efforts&mdash;and they are across-the-board now, and I think they are actually starting to at last alarm the electorate&mdash;to rid itself of all responsibility in areas such as health and education. It is a backdoor method for the government to implement its fiscal consolidation strategy by cutting funds to the states and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6031"> forcing states to increase their own state taxes and charges to pay for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Costello tax has now been imposed in a number of states. In Victoria I think they were even considering giving it the name of the DOG tax. It is simply consistent, as I have said, with a whole range of other measures that this government is progressively introducing to rid itself of responsibility in these important national areas by devolving them to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own particular area of interest is regional Australia. I have been in public life now for 20 years, and I have not in 20 years seen a statement emanating from Canberra in respect of regional Australia such as the one that was issued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, when he announced the complete abolition of the department of regional affairs. He, as I understand it, has retained his current title simply as an effort to save money on the stationery. As we all know, the Commonwealth government's active involvement in regional Australia has finished, and we have no less of an authority than Mr Sharp to go to for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that press statement from Mr Sharp, the like of which I have never seen before&mdash;I know politicians are fond of saying, `This is the worst or the most terrible blow that has ever been struck,' or `This is the greatest lie ever told,' or so on; but, in this case, I would defy anybody to find a press statement issued from any minister in Canberra equal to it&mdash;Mr Sharp said this about the government's responsibility for regional Australia. In closing down the department, he said that there was no rationale or constitutional basis for the involvement of the Commonwealth government in regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just in case you thought that was a mighty slip of the word processor, in the following paragraph he went on to say&mdash;consistent with this piece of legislation&mdash;that regional development was the responsibility of the states and local government. The Commonwealth government, in one fell swoop after the election, simply washed its hands of regional Australia. That sent a chill down the spines of everybody living outside Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, I can assure you.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government were as good of their word, of course. They closed down all the REDO programs that had given so much benefit to regional centres. In fact, if you look at some of the interviews given by the mayors of those rural and regional communities, you will see that those programs were the only impetus that some of those communities had had for some significant time. This government closed down every single one of those commitments&mdash;except for the ones that were so far down the track they simply could not cut off the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the closure of the Commonwealth's involvement in dental care services. I might add, for those interested in the history of this, that that was a commitment by the former Commonwealth government to fill an obvious gap that simply was not being filled by state governments. The impact on those people on low incomes&mdash;the people whom this government constantly professes to care about&mdash;will be very significant. The waiting lists&mdash;again, according to the Victorian government&mdash;for people who require this kind of dental care but cannot afford it will now blow out to something like seven or eight years, making the question of whether they finally get dental care a fairly academic one indeed, I would have thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of this bill passing through the Senate&mdash;as foretold by the Victorian Treasurer, not by me&mdash;will be that the effects will be borne by the taxpayers of Australia, in flagrant breach of the election commitment given by the coalition that there would be no increases in taxes.

<STATE> (Queensland&mdash;</STATE>
<ROLE>Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.22 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats agree that the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 represents a little face&hyphen;saver for the Treasurer, Peter Costello. We also agree that it was a disastrous performance on his part at the Premiers Conference, his first Premiers Conference, although some would subscribe to the theory that there was a Howard-Costello good cop, bad cop routine operating&mdash;something we have seen since then as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few issues, though, on which Premiers Jeff Kennett, Bob Carr and Rob Borbidge can agree. One of them was the unified sense of outrage that they felt&mdash;I think it was completely justifiable outrage&mdash;at Treasurer Costello's attempt to slap a $600 million sales tax bill on the states. I think Treasurer Costello thought it was very clever. In the end, he may have thought he was very clever because a deal was struck. The states volunteered to give $2 billion in grants over three years in preference to this continuing $600 million hole in their budgets. That was the threat: a continuing hole in their budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The face&hyphen;saver for the Treasurer was this compromise initiative on sales tax on cars. This bill will eliminate the sales tax exemption on government motor vehicles which are used wholly or partly for private use as part of a negotiated remuneration package. We all vividly remember Treasurer Costello, hand on heart, saying, `I won't stand by and watch the tax system riddled and rorted.' And who was riddling and rorting it? Goodness me, he thought it was the state and local governments who were riddling and rorting the tax system. Of course it was a great performance. He never lets the facts get in the way of a good story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He failed to distinguish between those motor vehicles which are used as part of a remuneration package and used in part for private use and those in permanent legitimate use, like those used by council work gangs, those used by welfare officers to visit homes and prisons and those used by building <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inspectors. The vehicles in these examples are used in pursuit of legitimate work. But not so according to the Treasurer, no, they are all riddling and rorting the system. Just as the Wright family seems to have gone into research and development with fictitious case studies, I suspect that the government might think that the Wrights are employed as fictitious senior public servants out there allegedly making a killing on the used&hyphen;car market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should draw attention to the way Treasurer Costello singles out those whom he wants to pursue for alleged riddling and rorting. He says, `Let's pursue these people who own these motor vehicles. But we will just turn a blind eye to business friends engaging in much worse tax evasion,' like the outrageous tax concession which many of his friends enjoy on infrastructure borrowing on urban roads, like the tax avoidance that many of his friends and associates enjoy through family companies or closely held private companies or like the token tax which is paid on interest and dividends paid overseas. It was not worth singling these out for action, was it? No. We just single out the states and local governments and we let the rest, these larger and much clearer cases of tax evasion, off scot&hyphen;free. That is very poor policy and it is also extremely hypocritical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as we are acknowledging today, given those choices, the states have agreed to this compromise as part of the conference settlement. It could be argued that the states closed far too early and agreed to an appalling deal, especially when you add to this discussion what the states have suffered in terms of cost shifting as a result of the budget&mdash;they are to absorb all the responsibilities and get none of the revenue&mdash;and especially if you factor into the discussion the fact that federal government grants to the states have already fallen in real terms for most of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Grants fell from 17.8 per cent of Commonwealth outlays in 1984-85 to 12.6 per cent in 1994-95. Most of the fiscal tightening of the 1980s&mdash;the tightening which Paul Keating used to pay off his deficits and talk about his budget surpluses&mdash;actually happened at the state level. If you go into a Victorian school <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6033"> at the moment, if you go into a Queensland hospital or a New South Wales police station, you will see the results of that fiscal tightening and the emerging results of the effect of this government's first budget. You will see chronic underfunding, chronic underservicing and a chronic decline in standards. That is the cumulative effect of fiscal tightening through the 1980s, the Premiers Conference and the government's 1996 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government promised that states would not have their revenue cut. They have broken that promise, as previous speakers have said. This bill that we are being asked to pass today is part of a package of measures that put into place the breaking of that promise&mdash;the promise that Treasurer Costello and Prime Minister Howard made that taxes will not rise. It seems that you can conveniently make a distinction that if you pass on the effects of a tax then that does not count for your own actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will support the ALP's amendment to the second reading motion. I hope the majority of the Senate does. We are supporting the bill, but in my remarks I just want to make it absolutely clear that we think this is a broken promise and a flawed approach. We think it is inconsistent and harmful when you realise that the costs are being passed on via state and local governments. That is the result of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am only going to speak briefly on the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1). The ALP have moved their second reading amendment, and that is largely what I wish to speak to. We do have a responsibility to look at the changing role between federal, state and local governments. There are a number of reasons for this changing role. Some have to do with the increase in government business enterprises and the impact that that has on revenues of state and local governments. They relate to competition policy as well and some of the outcomes of competition policy, but I will say more about that when we come later to the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These kinds of issues are dealt with very poorly when they are dealt with in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shoddy fashion. When the state government of Western Australia started looking at the role of government as a result of the royal commission, there was a great deal of interest. The community really appreciated being asked to contribute. I think it is well overdue that we did this for the whole of Australia and started looking at the relative roles of state, federal and local governments. We should not leave this to some constitutional convention. We need to start looking at ways in which the community can be involved in speaking to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, it has not done a lot of good, because of all the community input and very wide-ranging reports. Very little of that has been acknowledged by the state government. However, it is time that we started looking at these issues in the federal parliament instead of having a series of slapdash arrangements in terms of Commonwealth-state powers. We have had today the argument about the environment and relative powers. We need to start looking at the structure of state, federal and local governments and make sure that the community has a part in that discussion and not leave it to some limited constitutional convention. We need to start talking about these very important issues before very narrow interests altogether ruin the working relationships among state, federal and local governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be supporting the ALP's amendment. This is obviously one area where before the election we did not see that this would happen. It is something the government ought to be taking greater responsibility for. They said very little about this being detrimental and having a great impact on the community. It was finally thrust on everybody after the elections took place. I do not think it is proper process. It is very unfortunate that it has happened in this way. I will be supporting the ALP's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> condemns the Government's cuts to public hospitals implicit in this Bill (around $450 million) and explicit in the 1996 Budget ($312 million)".</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure senators&mdash;and those people listening in the gallery and those people listening to the public broadcast&mdash;would be aware of an unequivocal guarantee that there would be no increase in existing taxes and no new taxes. That was very clear in the government's election manifesto, and that has been breached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure Senator Kemp will have a range of excuses as to why that absolute undertaking by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was breached. It has been breached in a number of areas. It has been breached in the sense that there has been additional pressure through reduction in services to state governments. This has, in turn, forced them to increase a variety of state taxes and charges to provide the additional revenue in order to meet the various cuts to states grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a range of other breaches as well. I do not want to talk about superannuation in this particular area, but we are all aware of this massive new tax that has been introduced. We are all aware of the massive breach of undertaking that that represents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can look at the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1996 in respect of states grants. One of the very disturbing aspects of reductions in grants to state governments is that this will impact heavily on the quality of government services delivered by the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues highlighted is public hospitals, and I only have to reflect on the enormous pressure and upheaval in public hospitals in my own state of Tasmania. It is a very major concern to the Tasmanian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community. It requires a massive reorganisation of hospitals in Tasmania and a major reduction in services, both quality and quantity. This is causing very significant upheaval, uncertainty and concern to the Tasmanian community. It is not just in Tasmania, but it is the example that I am most aware of because I represent that state. The quality of our roads, our legal system and a great many other essential public services is determined by the general purpose funding provided by the Commonwealth to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an observer of the Premiers Conference can attest, the issue of the general purpose payments is a very vital one and critical for major service providing at that level of government. The coalition know this. Again, I recall their election manifesto where they were championing states rights and championing cooperative federalism&mdash;cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth. Of course, this is all fine rhetoric, but it turned out to be fine, empty rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that the Liberal-National Party undertook to provide a fixed percentage of revenue to facilitate better planning and give certainty to states and territories. Where is the fixed percentage of revenue? We have a bit of a fracas&mdash;and fracas would be understating it&mdash;between the states and the Commonwealth about taxation and who has particular proportions of tax revenue and whether there should be a new GST, a new tax, which Premier Kennett, in particular, is very keen on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition promised that it would guarantee current services and be revenue neutral. Again, that was a very specific promise that was indeed reaffirmed by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, some 10 days after the election. He made it very clear at his first press conference&mdash;this one was not in the United States; this one was in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think I made it clear during the election campaign that our purpose was not to cut general assistance grants to the states.</PARA>
<PARA>The question was interpolated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So specific purpose payments will be cut?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well we'll be looking at specific purpose payments yes but it is not our intention to make the states take the pain in relation to general assistance. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6037"> </PARA>
<PARA>Then we saw that spectacular June Premiers Conference and the breach of faith at that Premiers Conference. That was, without question, one of the worst Premiers Conferences in recent years. It really was high farce. You had the Liberal premiers and a National Party premier&mdash;in the case of Queensland&mdash;outdoing themselves to publicly berate and condemn the Liberal-National Party federal government and, in particular, the Treasurer, Mr Costello. It really was an unmitigated disaster. I think that stands in contrast to the relationship that existed between Labor, when it was in government, and the states and the deal that Labor guaranteed for three years of a real per capita guarantee over a three-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are a great many other matters that could be mentioned in this debate about the Premiers Conference and its subsequent outcome and the appalling record of breach of faith, breach of promise and breach of undertakings by the new Liberal&hyphen;National Party government and, particularly, the Treasurer, Mr Costello. But we are mindful of the necessity to facilitate the time, given the time of year, and the necessity to deal with the government's budget program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, it is not just hospitals or roads. There are a range of other areas where this will hurt. I am reminded of railways. The proposed outcome with respect to Tasmania will be quite disastrous. I suspect we will end up with one rail track, some 25 kilometres long, running in Tasmania. There are other areas: legal aid, housing, education and environment funding. It is a long list of broken commitments&mdash;and I think what has occurred to the states of Australia is a great tragedy. I certainly hope that at the next election people who are concerned about the delivery of quality services by state governments do take notice of the very heavy pressure that the states have been put under as a direct consequence of the variety of cuts that have occurred to state budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I should mention the Commonwealth dental program. We actually had a discussion about this yesterday. It would be appropriate, Senator Kemp, if you, as Assistant Treasurer, could indicate what <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will happen to the $70 million windfall from the agreement with the Victorian government with respect to the settlement of the dispute between Esso&hyphen;BHP and the Victorian government. As I indicated yesterday, the funding of the Commonwealth dental program would be the ideal place for that $70 million windfall to be directed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those few comments, and bearing in mind the time for the debate, I would certainly urge the Senate to adopt the second reading amendment that we have circulated in the chamber. I believe that it is an appropriate amendment to pass. It does, as I have indicated, note the government's mishandling of the Premiers Conference; I do not think anyone could describe it as anything other than a mishandling. It notes the particularly serious impact on reduction of state services, the higher state taxes, the breaches of faith and the breaches of promises made at the election, and it highlights one area of most concern to the community&mdash;that is, public hospitals.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Queensland&mdash;</STATE>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.58 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is really a continuation of debate we have just had on the previous bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996, because it, too, deals with the outcome&mdash;the compromise&mdash;of the Premiers Conference held earlier this year. The outcome of that conference, outlined most interestingly in the explanatory memorandum, is an example of the classic doublespeak which George Orwell was fond of and which I think this government is now using and raising to an art form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third paragraph of the explanatory memorandum shows how generous the Commonwealth was, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the 1996 Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth undertook to maintain the level of financial assistance grants to the States and Territories in real per capita terms in 1996-97 and to extend the real per capita guarantee until 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in line with the government's pre-election commitment. Also, it was in line with the strong view that the states had carried more than their fair share of fiscal tightening <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6038"> during the 1980s&mdash;a point we raised in the previous debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the previous debate I also pointed to the fact that financial assistance grants to the states fell from 17.6 per cent of Commonwealth outlays in 1984-85 to 12.9 per cent this year. So we have fiscal tightening and we have this example. We also have the 1993 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National savings</EMPHASIS> report by Dr Vince FitzGerald reporting that the states had absorbed most of the pain of reducing the federal deficit in the 1980s and, importantly, saying that there was little scope for further cuts at state level without reducing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was not sufficient to impress Treasurer Costello. As the 1996 budget demonstrates on page after page, Treasurer Costello and this government rate appeasing the financial markets and cutting the deficit&mdash;their kind of self&hyphen;imposed virility test&mdash;more highly than ensuring that Australians have access to a quality level of public services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where the double speak from the Premiers Conference comes from. Having `kept its election promise' on per capita grants, the Commonwealth can backtrack and does backtrack. The crunch comes in paragraph 7 under the ubiquitous title of `States fiscal contribution', where it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Premier's Conference agreed that the States and Territories would make payments of $619 million to the Commonwealth in 1996/7. A State's share of the fiscal contribution can be paid by way of deductions from general revenue assistance, direct payments to the Commonwealth or a reduction in funding in a specific purpose grant.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the genuine outrage of the states at Treasurer Costello's behaviour at the Premiers Conference and despite the states becoming a little sick of 12 years of being the constant bunny carrying most of the deficit reduction for Canberra, they agreed to make a `fiscal contribution'. Perhaps `agreed' might be too strong a word. `Coerced' might be a better word to describe it. Nevertheless, Treasurer Costello walked away with $619 million in his back pocket from the states plus their agreement for a further $50 million in removed sales tax exemptions on government cars. Over three years, the fiscal contributions will clock up to $1.55 billion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the fury we heard, especially from Victorian Treasurer Stockdale, about how the Commonwealth had broken four election promises and commitments was put aside because coalition buddies must stick together on these matters. It will not be state Treasurers and it will not be the states who are making this fiscal contribution; it will the citizens of the states. The costs will be passed on to the citizens of the states. In Queensland, New South Wales and other states this fiscal contribution has been mostly by higher taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasurer Costello probably thinks this is a really smart outcome. Why? Because he gets other people to break his no new taxes pledge for him. He does not have to do it; others can do it. He stays Mr Clean on this one. As a result of this bill, there will be cuts to services in all states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This topic was going to be canvassed at the COAG meeting which has now been postponed. Despite the fact that the Treasurers and Premiers were quiet on budget night, there was growing concern about the handing over of powers and the handing over of responsibilities with no resultant increase in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Premiers thought the Premiers Conference was a bit of a mauling, I wonder what they really thought about the routing that was the 1996 budget. On top of the $1.55 billion worth of cuts in general purpose grants and the $200 million over four years in additional sales tax, the government clocked up a further $2.5 billion worth of cuts to specific purpose payments over the next four years. The result is that the states now face a $4 billion hole in their budgets over the next four years. This is money Treasurer Costello said they would be paid. That is $4 billion worth of broken promises. They were not just promises to the Australian people but promises that were made to Treasurer Costello's own Liberal colleagues at the state Premier level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why have they not taken Treasurer Costello to task for shamelessly and recklessly breaching these very important election promises? Why have they been so happy to delay the debate until after the Western Australian election? It is all too convenient.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6039">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not lose sight of the fact that these cuts in specific purpose payments were wide ranging and very severe. They included $305 million worth of cuts to public schools. It was cleverly hidden, but it is a cut all the same. Senator Allison will talk about this fiddling in the debate on the next bill. The cuts include cuts of $399 million to the successful Commonwealth Dental Service which is used by very low income earners. I regret that we were unable to have that reviewed in the appropriations debate last week. There are cuts to public hospitals of $313 million over four years. It is a cut in real terms despite lengthening waiting lists. There were cuts to public housing funding of $344 million, legal aid funding of $104 million, urban and regional development of $415 million, vocational education and training of $63.4 million and the home and community care scheme of $88 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How could you be so proud of a budget which lays the knife so deeply and so widely into so many state programs and essential services used by struggling Australian families? I predict that the $4 billion worth of cuts to essential state services over four years are like a time bomb ticking under Mr Costello's budget. The reality is that the states have a very limited capacity to absorb these cuts because of the narrowness of their regressive tax base, the fact that they have already been cut substantially in the past and they are stretched to breaking point. Public hospitals and public schools have a non&hyphen;existent capacity to absorb further cuts of this nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be the quality of service that will suffer. It will be the families with their children in public schools, who rely on the public hospital system for their family health, the families who cannot afford to go to an expensive private sector dentist or a lawyer, those who rely on Legal Aid, those who cannot afford their own home and so will not benefit from interest rate cuts, those who are left languishing on public housing waiting lists. These are the people who will make the `fiscal contribution'&mdash;the double speak of the explanatory memorandum. These are the people who will pay for these cuts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be the elderly facing increased user charges on home and community care services and on pharmaceutical benefits, or who are worried about cuts in policing of their neighbourhood. It will be regional Australians seeing successful regional development initiatives cancelled or highway 1 upgrades cancelled, or Landcare committees run out of money, or hundreds of jobs disappearing in the Australian National Railways privatisation. These are the ones making the great fiscal contribution. It will not be those families&mdash;mostly Liberal voting families&mdash;who can afford private health insurance and private schools, who can engage private security, who own their own home&mdash;or more than one. They will not be complaining, because they will not be those making the fiscal contribution. This bill, with its insidious fiscal contribution, demonstrates the urgent need for reform of state and federal arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To their credit, the states, having copped the fiscal contribution, and the $2.5 billion in specific purpose payment cuts, have refused point blank to accept the handover of federal programs without matching funding guarantees. Too clever by half, that one. In fact, given the lack of value being attached to what were previously described as rock solid guarantees by Treasurer Costello and Prime Minister Howard, I would urge the states to hold out for something even more than a second-hand guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been surprised in recent months to find myself in agreement&mdash;at least on the same side of the debate&mdash;with Premier Kennett on issues like euthanasia, the need for tax reform dialogue, the handover of Victorian industrial relations powers&mdash;things like that. It is a bit of a surprise, sometimes. On the matter of the need for dialogue&mdash;on the urgent need for a radical overhaul&mdash;on the state and federal imbalance when it comes to taxation, I have to say I agree with Premier Kennett. I do not say, like the Prime Minister says, that he should take a holiday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think I would agree with Premier Kennett on the outcome of the dialogue or on what should come out of an overhaul, because I believe that taxation should remain a federal responsibility. But I do acknowledge that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6040"> states need certainty in the funding base for the provision of the essential services that they provide. The double speak of this particular Premiers Conference shows just how useless their long sought guarantee of real per capita grants maintenance was. It was ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overhaul of federal and state responsibilities should look not just at funding but also at who is providing the service. The Democrats have long been of the view that the states should hand over to the Commonwealth full responsibility for running the public hospital system, for example, given that the Commonwealth is already picking up most of the tab through Medicare and other grants, and given that decent health standards are largely a national issue anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other areas, the Commonwealth should seek to remove duplication of functions, perhaps retiring from some areas where excessive federal bureaucracies have developed, double guessing the states. But the flip side of that reform must be a guarantee that the residents of the states attain services to a nationally agreed standard of quality. If Canberra is to loosen the purse strings, to grant access to a fixed share of funding, then Canberra must have a say in the setting of national standards for health, education, the environment, economic assistance and so on. This quality and difference in quality should not depend on the whim of the state premier or the state minister or the geography of where you live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states should be free to deliver the service in the most efficient way they see fit, so long as the service quality standards are met. In such a formulation of federalism, there are benefits for a federal government, a federal bureaucracy, a federal parliament, for the states and, most importantly, for the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The double speak of this 1996 Premiers Conference&mdash;of calling something `fiscal contribution' when you are being bashed over the head and are having this money taken away from you, when you are coerced with `take this threat or this threat'&mdash;would disappear. It ought to disappear. Hidden spending cuts, flick passing budgetary problems&mdash;we need to sort these things out. These things <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need to be something of past behaviour, not continuing and future behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>I foreshadow that I will move the second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name. I know that it was circulated before the Labor Party's amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is the states house, and part of a senator's job is to raise matters of importance to the states and to defend their status within a federated Commonwealth. Today I wish to make some remarks about the national competition policy in that context, to reveal the extent to which states have been compromised in parts of the competition agreements they have signed. By lifting the veil on some of the workings of competition policy, I hope to make more people aware of what is happening and to stimulate debate about these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national competition policy legislation was passed in June 1995. All the states have now passed complementary legislation to ensure a national phased&hyphen;in approach to competition policy. The first deadline, June 1996, has passed, requiring all jurisdictions to compile a legislative review timetable. The overarching body, the National Competition Council, has already produced its first report, as has the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which administers the Trade Practices Act and the state and territory application acts. Provided all goes well, the nation has been told that the benefits of $23 billion will flow through the economy and the states will be eligible, in return for their cooperation with the new competition regime, for progressive tranches totalling $900 million by 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate to take stock of competition reform at this stage and assess how it is unfolding. The legislation was unique in that it tried to impose a common framework of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6041"> operating principles on almost every sector of the economy. Its impact is comprehensive and pervasive, yet its effects are felt quite differently, depending on the market structure of a sector. This is why the Hilmer paradox can occur where reforms meant to increase competition may actually decrease competition. I have gone into this in detail before and refer those interested to my earlier speeches, including my National Press Club address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the wide range of reforms involved, I wish to confine my remarks to the legislative review section of the Hilmer reforms. Not enough time has been devoted to the ramifications of Hilmer on the fortunes of small business. State governments play a significant role as they begin their review process looking for anti&hyphen;competitive effects of laws and regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland legislative review timetable identified restrictions on competition in 183 acts and 135 sets of regulations, orders, standards, codes and by&hyphen;laws. Several of these where state jurisdictions have similar laws will be looked at by a national body. The federal government's own legislative review schedule lists 98 separate reviews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A methodology is developed so that the review bodies can determine whether the net effects of laws giving rise to an anti&hyphen;competitive effect are in the public interest. Governments, theoretically at least, then choose whether to act on the advice of the review bodies. Obviously, there is room for wide and subjective interpretation of what constitutes the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the different market natures in our economy, some so&hyphen;called anti&hyphen;competitive effects are actually in the public interest. This is where governments step in and legislate specifically for exemptions to the competition rule. It is important to stress that the Hilmer framework allows for this. It provides for situations where exemptions may be necessary. Such flexibility is necessary if we are to have a sophisticated implementation of a very complex set of competition principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a mature approach to point to exemptions as though the whole Hilmer framework will collapse as a result&mdash;it will not. It is not a mature approach to accuse a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government if it makes an exemption of not being committed to competition policy reform. For example, the New South Wales government has used subsection 51(1) of the competition code to exempt the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games Amendment Act 1996. The New South Wales government has decided that it is in the public interest to exempt this act from the competition principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look for a minute at the loci of power in the administration of competition policy. In the first instance, tremendous power is given to unelected people in the bodies tasked with reviewing these hundreds of pieces of legislation. It is these people who decide what the public good is and how to measure it. On top of this spectrum of review bodies are the state and federal competition policy units, usually from Treasury departments, coordinating the review process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Climbing the apex further, there are the federal bodies: the National Competition Council, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Competition Tribunal. They are all very powerful. At the top of the tree is the federal Treasurer, who has some unique powers, which I will go into later. So national competition policy has involved the establishment of a vast, complex and interlocking bureaucratic structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way the process works is that, come review time, the business or interest groups affected&mdash;for example, taxidrivers or travel agents&mdash;have to front the review panel. They have already been deemed guilty of anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour and must establish a net public benefit to get out of gaol. This has obviously provided a huge opportunity for lawyers and lobbyists in the private and public sector. A recent report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major new market now being targeted by legal firms around Australia is advising local governments on how to avoid breaches of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA>In order to obtain a coherent and national approach to competition policy, the states signed competition code and principle agreements with the Commonwealth government. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6042"> In doing so they effectively gave the Commonwealth ultimate power in the legislative review process. They surrendered the fate of hundreds of thousands of small businesses to the federal government, which acts on the advice of the ACCC and the NCC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, they all agreed that the Commonwealth, through the NCC, could assess each state's progress towards competition reform. If states were not performing, then the promised financial tranches, the rewards, would not be forthcoming. These are due to start in 1997&hyphen;1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the ACCC, a federal body, was given the power to grant temporary authorisation for anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour, irrespective of whether it occurs within state or federal jurisdictions. Thirdly, the states agreed that, where they made exceptions, they would legislate explicitly for them, referring to section 51 of the Trade Practices Act, as the New South Wales government did for the Olympic Organising Committee Amendment Act mentioned earlier. These three features of the competition regime show that the states have allowed long established business practices to fall within a jurisdiction they have not previously been subject to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many times I have been told by former government senior bureaucrats that the Commonwealth would not interfere with the states' decisions on granting exceptions. Indeed, a federal government would have to carefully weigh up the political costs of any proposed interference. Nevertheless, the states have signed away the ultimate decision making power on these issues to the Commonwealth, whether it uses that power or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the unique power of the federal Treasurer referred to earlier. It works like this: clause 2 of the conduct code agreement specifies the procedures for exceptions for the competition law and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where legislation or a provision in legislation, is enacted or made in reliance upon section 51 of the competition law, the party responsible for the legislation will send written notice of legislation to the commission within 30 days of the legislation being enacted or made. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The National Competition Council's annual report explains:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth minister has the discretion to override the exception within four months of notification by tabling regulations in the Commonwealth parliament under section 51(1C) (f) of the TPA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the minister tables the regulations after four months, the minister may only override the exception upon tabling a report by the council.</PARA>
<PARA>This means that if a state government were to legislate, for example, to exempt taxi drivers from some deregulation in the public interest, the Treasurer may accept the NCC's advice to disallow the state government's exception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the earlier example of the Sydney Olympics, the Treasurer has been given the power to move to veto the exception granted by the New South Wales government. When the states signed those competition agreements, they signed over the power to the Treasurer and the federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NCC has already expressed its dissatisfaction with the new ACT trading hours regime and forced the ACT to agree to a further review in two years time. The Queensland government, which has recently made a decision on trading hours also, will still have to have that decision reviewed under the competition principles. The National Competition Council may interfere as it has done in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland, we have been witness to the extraordinary campaign by large retailers to get their way on trading hours. Is this a sign of things to come, where economic power and expensive advertising campaigns will be waged on various Hilmer issues? We have a situation where an unelected federal body has significant influence&mdash;even a hold&mdash;over a previously sovereign right of states to set trading hours. If the Commonwealth were to override a state exception, it is possible that the issue of compensation may arise if a business arrangement initially approved under state laws were stopped in its tracks by Commonwealth regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To summarise, each state government is overseeing the review of hundreds of pieces of legislation which they have already identified as containing potentially anti&hyphen;competitive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6043"> restrictions. Where the state governments legislate for exceptions under subsection 51(1), they are also subject effectively to the veto of the Commonwealth parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states have handed over the ultimate sanction to the Commonwealth. The fate of taxi drivers in Sydney, chiropractors in Perth, liquor outlets in Brisbane, pharmacists in Dubbo, architects in Melbourne, and so on, rests with the federal Treasurer or&mdash;if the authorisation route is taken&mdash;with the unelected ACCC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth pointing out that many industries may view the ACCC authorisation process as a last resort, preferring instead to obtain exceptions from state governments. Either way, the states have made Canberra the ultimate locus of power. Even if the Treasurer were never to use his power, its presence can act as a powerful deterrent to ensure states govern state matters according to the wishes of the NCC, the ACCC and the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not just talking about the more topical exceptions such as wheat and sugar export marketing or newsagents and pharmacies. The states will have to use the exception process for many obvious reasons: to keep the handling and storage of explosives regulated; to keep environmental controls on development and industry; to restrict gaming machines to specified outlets; to prevent SP bookmaking and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder also whether religious and charitable organisations are aware that they can no longer take their special treatment under several laws for granted. An example is retirement villages dealing in second&hyphen;hand goods and hawker laws. Big business and industries such as sugar and wheat may be able to afford multimillion dollar review processes, but what about everyone else, including the St Vincent de Paul Society and Lifeline?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local government is concerned that rates will have to be raised to meet higher taxation demands from corporatising their services. Concerns have also been raised in recent times by doctors, hospitals and universities about the impact of the Hilmer reforms. The states will be sending container loads of documents down to the ACCC and the NCC to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> verified and examined, or seeking authorisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think many people have yet realised how pervasive the new competition regime is, nor how technically powerful the federal government has become in determining the fate of so many micro businesses. It maybe that this power will be tested in the courts. After all, the Commonwealth does not have the constitutional power to legislate in the non&hyphen;incorporated areas of business. Yet the states have apparently willingly given up these powers. We can look forward to more legal wrangling, I am sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make one further point in relation to the exemption process. State exemptions made by regulation and not through a primary act are non-renewable and only effective for two years. Thereafter, authorisation must be sought from the ACCC with appeal rights to the competition tribunal, unless the state passes primary legislation, still subject to the Commonwealth's overriding powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lest I be misunderstood, let me make it plain that I have no troubles with the objectives of the national competition policy. Of course we need more competition, efficiency and productivity. There are likely to be significant benefits but the unintended side effects of such a massive undertaking need to be recognised and debated. Many industries, state and local governments are still on the learning curve when it comes to the Hilmer reforms. It is a very difficult job to put the whole process in perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have reached the stage now where it is pertinent to throw three questions into the public arena. Did the states realise that they were handing over such significant and far-reaching powers to the Commonwealth? Is the competition regime constitutionally valid? Are the Australian people happy  for the Commonwealth to have the powers to veto state decisions on everything from taxi drivers to trading hours?</PARA></SPEECH>

I enter this discussion in order to congratulate Senator Boswell for raising these issues in such a thoughtful and precise way. I agree with him and with the general philosophy and policy that there should be national competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems that was pointed out by Senator Boswell and about which a number of us have been aware is the intrusive character of the ACCC into areas which were previously the preserve of the states. That will affect a whole number of people, including trade unions, the example being shop trading hours. That has been the prerogative of the elected state parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why have we over the years had such debates and discussions, in our case in the Tasmanian House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, over this very issue? I certainly believe in the principle of subsidiarity&mdash;that this political power should reside with the smallest group capable of efficiently performing the functions which the powers require so that those over whom the power is exercised should have more direct say over those who make the decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of examples. One that comes to mind is exercising the mind of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards. There was an organisation, which I think ceased from the end of November, called the Advertising Standards Council. The Advertising Standards Council was doing an excellent job. It was supported by the responsible members of the industry. A problem has arisen whereby, according to the ACCC, its actions are non-competitive. Why are they non-competitive? Because they are saying to certain advertisers that they should not exceed these particular codes of decency when it comes to advertising. Frankly, as a result of that, we are going to see more and more salacious advertising because some bureaucrat in the ACCC thought that this would tend to interfere with competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to delay this particular debate. I know that people are a bit edgy. All I want to say is that I do congratulate Senator Boswell for raising these matters of major public importance that go to the heart of our democracy in this country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill implements the agreed outcome for the 1996 Premiers Conference held in June this year. The bill provides for the payment of general revenue assistance to the states and territories of $16.3 billion in 1996-97 and thus represents a very significant portion of total funds available to states. States and territories can allocate the funds provided by the Commonwealth under this bill according to their own budgetary priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been the case in recent years, the Commonwealth undertook to maintain financial assistance grants to the states in real per capita terms and to extend the guarantee until 1998-99. The bill also provides special revenue assistance of $481 million in the form of $428 million in Medicare guaranteed payments in New South Wales and Victoria and $10 million in special financial assistance to the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the bill provides the framework for government to provide competition payments as was agreed at the April 1995 Council of Australian Governments meeting. These payments are subject to the states' complying with the conditions set out in the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the bill provides for the states and territories to make fiscal contributions by way of reductions from general revenue assistance, which were agreed at this year's Premiers Conference in recognition of the $10 billion budget deficit inherited by the Commonwealth government. In 1996-97, state fiscal contributions will amount to $619 million. These payments represent an important element of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government's fiscal consolidation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does not require the states to make fiscal contributions, but simply permits a mechanism to make the payments by way of reductions from general revenue assistance. Some states have indicated preference for this method of payment. The Commonwealth has aimed to provide states and territories with maximum flexibility concerning the method of payment of the fiscal contribution. Other possible payment methods are direct payment to the Commonwealth or reduction in funding provided under specific purpose grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the bill provides certainty of funding for the states and territories, a framework implementing the competition payments, which were a feature of the national competition policy agreement, and flexibility for the payment of states' fiscal contribution. The opposition and the Democrats have proposed a second reading amendment, so I do not know whether they have been able to reach a consolidated amendment. I can see no sign from the chamber that they have. We will be opposing those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The odd thing here is that the measures set out in this bill were agreed by state premiers at the Premiers Conference. Given that the states themselves agreed to the measures set out in the bill, the government cannot see how it could possibly do otherwise than oppose these proposed amendments. As I said, we have noted the contributions made by members of the Senate. We do not agree with many of the comments which have been made. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has some major concerns with the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill and, to reflect those concerns, will be moving amendments at a later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is important as it forms the basis of this government's funding in both primary and secondary education. As such, it is very significant legislation in that it provides $14 billion in direct Commonwealth funding for schooling over the next four years. But the bill does not just deal with a great amount of money; it also makes some fundamental changes to the basis on which the Commonwealth funds government and non&hyphen;government schools. One of our aims in this debate will be to rectify the deficiencies that these changes will create. Our amendments will go towards rectifying some of those deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking here of an area which has had major advances over the last decade, an area which has developed in such a way that there is greater equity, participation and access to the school system. We recognise that despite that, there is still some way to go, and that was recognised by both sides before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are concerned that these decisions have been taken in the dark without sufficient participation and involvement not just by young Australians of school age but also by their parents, teachers, state governments and non&hyphen;government organisations. None of these sectors have had adequate participation in a review process. The government is coming in with a set agenda, built out of prejudice and ideology, with no regard to what has happened in the past and moving without adequate review.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only area of review covered by this legislation was the McKinnon review, which basically recommended that the government go the other way and not this way. But we have a government that is blind and oblivious to the recommendations of that review, blind and oblivious to the experience in Australia over the last 13 years or so, but that is pursuing its own ideological agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously there are some aspects of this legislation with which we agree. The continuing involvement of the national government in direct school funding clearly comes into that category. However, we see other proposals as highly damaging, particularly to the government school sector, and more objectionable because that undermining of the government school sector will grow in effect over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over recent months we have seen two characteristics: a high level of incompetence by relevant ministers; and a ballooning of outrageous claims by the government on its aims and achievements in this area. Given some of the most outrageous claims by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) on funding for schools since this bill first appeared, this debate for us in the opposition provides a useful opportunity to examine those claims in the light of the facts. I intend to do that extensively so that those who have an interest in this area, especially those involved in the schooling sector, can clearly understand that this legislation is an unambiguous negative, particularly for government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the background to the legislation. The Commonwealth does provide funding for schools both directly through legislation like this and its predecessors and indirectly through financial assistance grants to the states of which about 24 per cent is spent by the states on government schools and some two per cent on non&hyphen;government schools. During the 13 years of the previous Labor government, direct Commonwealth expenditure on schooling rose by some 58 per cent in real terms. Education was a high priority for Labor and of course not just school education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government would have us believe that it also plans to significantly increase resources <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6050"> for schools at a time of budget restraint in other portfolio areas. No&hyphen;one could disagree that that is a virtuous aim but the trouble for all those involved in education is that it is just not true. Answers to questions posed in Senate estimates committee hearings clearly show that the net impact of this government's decisions on direct school funding is $128 million over four years from 1996&hyphen;97 to 1999&hyphen;2000. It is an actual fall for government schools of some $87.5 million. By way of overall impact, $128 million is a far cry from the claims made by the minister of $1&half; billion, $2.3 billion additional, four per cent real growth and so on&mdash;you can all take your pick. It is a bit like playing bingo, it varies from occasion to occasion and it varies with the intensity of the heat applied to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard all of these varying claims from the government in relation to this bill. They cannot all be true, and the fact is that none of them is true. Where do they come from? They come from the fervid imagination of the schools minister, and they come from convoluted calculations to disguise the real impact of this bill on the education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, the $1.5 billion claim is arrived at by adding direct Commonwealth school funding with a notional amount of the financial assistance grants, FAGs, based on the proportion of these which states and territories generally spend on schools. The relevant figures are shown in the submission by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee in its consideration of the bill. By subtracting the 1996 total of direct and indirect grants for government and non-government schools from the same total for the year 2000, a figure of $1.424 billion&mdash;an apparent increase in Commonwealth funding for schools&mdash;appears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There are a couple of things wrong with that figure. The government can try to fool people in the broader debate; they can try to fool people through their communications in the media, but they cannot fool those involved in the education sector. They cannot fool the parents. They cannot fool the teaching profes sion as well. They cannot, for instance, fool those from the Australian Council of State School Organisations, who wrote to us today in urgent correspondence, asking us all to vote against this bill in its present form and to vote for amendments which will markedly change the thrust of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, $1.424 billion&mdash;an apparent increase&mdash;is all achieved by smoke and mirrors. The trouble with these figures is that, in the first instance, the DEETYA table provides for indexation and other increases for enrolment and population growth. They are not real because they do not allow for comparison in real terms, in constant terms. Just as importantly, they are inflated in another way. They take no account at all for the $1.5 billion in cuts made to financial assistance grants to the states last June, with the government trying to argue an extraordinary position that schools&mdash;which account for one-quarter of FAGs expenditure&mdash;will somehow now be quarantined from that enormous cut made by the federal government to FAGs over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly you have not fooled the state officials. You have not fooled your state colleagues, Senator Kemp. Those who appeared before the Senate committee and looked at this bill indicated quite clearly that they believe the effects of your cuts in FAGs would be well and truly felt in school education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As if that were not enough, these financial assistance grants figures are also inflated in another way. The deception continues. The deceivers, we know full well, are on the other side of the parliament. Those who have been deceived are the kids and the parents and the teachers across the country. From 1997-98, those FAGs figures will also include another $400 million annually by way of road funding, which previously had been separately identified. So the FAGs pool becomes even smaller. You can see then that these figures are significantly distorted, and they tell absolutely nothing of the real picture of the impact of this government's decisions on school funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for the $1.5 billion claim which, in true sense, should have been $1.424 billion. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6051"> The government's rhetoric then became even wilder and more adventurous and more aggressive when it went up to some $2.3 billion in so-called additional expenditure on government schools. This is from a minister who is running around the country, blowing out these figures at whim and achieving some degree of publicity for it. How does he go from $1.424 billion&mdash;a false figure&mdash;to $1.5 billion to $2.3 billion? To do that, the government added up the additional funding for schools, including the mythical FAGs and supplementation dollars. It will not be all that long before we see how much money actually goes through to the school system and the government will be exposed for the distortions&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;and the deceit that has been perpetrated on the public. Thanks, Senator Carr. You included the mythical FAGs and supplementation dollars for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. This double, triple and quadruple counting produced a grand total of $2.29 billion. As I say, you may fool some, but you are not fooling the state government departments who have come to the Senate committee and given evidence before it. You have not fooled the public. You have not fooled the teachers and the parents, nor will you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures are just one part of the story. The deceit perpetrated through the blossoming figures is just one part of the story. What this government is also trying to hide is the agenda which deliberately shifts national responsibility from the federal government and basically dismembers it. It is an agenda which pushes so much resource from government schools to non-government schools. There has not been proper scrutiny; there has not been proper consultation; and there has not been proper review, because this government wants to shield from public scrutiny its failure to meet national responsibilities by its planned removal of the requirements, for instance, for non-government schools seeking to access federal funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants to move from national requirements to a situation where governments and people rely on states and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> territories to set out the rules for the national government to provide funds on a national basis. It does not pretend that such provisions will be on anything like a standard basis across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you are going from a national standards system of providing funding for non-government schools to a state&hyphen;by&hyphen;state system relying on state based requirements, guidelines or maybe just a press statement at best. There is no review or assessment of the current system to highlight any problems other than the McKinnon review, which basically recommended that the government go in a different direction to that in which this government is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the states and the territories have in place, at best, a patchy and in many ways inadequate requirement system for non-government school registration and operation. For example, only two governments impose their own minimum enrolment numbers, and only the Northern Territory government examines the likely impact of a proposed new non&hyphen;government school on existing schools in a particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if these considerations are ignored, what we are likely to see is an uneconomic use of necessarily finite resources. What is the sense, for instance, in having four schools in a catchment area all one-quarter full? To what budgetary extent are we willing to fund choice in schooling in the name of which the government is marching down this path?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 10 years, for instance, non-government schools have been funded by the Commonwealth according to what was called the new schools policy. This policy gave parents a reasonable choice on the type of school to which they send their children, but it also provided choice as an overlay to the more fundamental need of universal access to a quality government school. Non-government schools continued to grow and to flourish during these years of operation of the new schools policy. Non-government schools, for instance, were required to meet a level of minimum enrolment numbers&mdash;which appear particularly generous in the light of what is going on now in places such as Victoria.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6052">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having already closed some 300 schools and reduced teacher numbers by 8,000, the Kennett government is now seeking to force another 113 schools to close or merge. The reason? The reason flies totally in the face of the policy arguments put forward by this minister. Phil Gude, the Victorian Minister of Education, says a `broad curriculum is more likely to be achieved in schools with larger enrolments'. The targeted schools include 86 primary schools with fewer than 175 enrolments and 18 secondary schools with enrolments under 400 students. But the minister says that there is greater choice in broader curriculum to be achieved in schools with larger enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What this government is telling us is in contradiction to the Victorian government. They are telling us that the policy of the former government which required 50 students in a primary school and 140 students in a secondary school was too harsh. They want us to believe a situation exists where, as evidence to the committee in New South Wales indicated, a school with five students is capable of receiving Commonwealth funding under the government's proposals. If you can stretch resources to that extent, a lot of people will be missing out and freedom of choice will become quite a hollow bit of rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We will move amendments to this legislation requiring non-government schools seeking Commonwealth funding to enrol 50 students in primary school, 20 in a rural area, 100 in junior secondary school, years 7 to 10, and 140 in full secondary school, years 7 to 12. Our amendments will also require non-government schools seeking to establish or to significantly change their operations to put their proposals before state based committees so that the impact of the proposal or the proposed changes can be examined in light of their impact on the existing policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I have said, Professor Ken McKinnon reviewed this area before the election. He debunked quite clearly the very points which the government is using to justify its abolition of the policy, such as the notion that choice in education can be infinitely expanded and that the establishment of non-government schools in any circumstances automatically <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> results in savings to the public purse. That is advice the government has before it. That is the advice the government seeks to reject in pursuance of ideological fixation. That is one aspect of our concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledge that the abolition of the new schools policy formed part of the coalition's pre-election policy announcements. But what was not explained, however, was how it would be funded. The funding arrangements are quite simple when you look at the evidence provided by the department to the committee. The growth of the non-government sector will be funded by the enrolment benchmark adjustment&mdash;a permanent mechanism for reduction of Commonwealth expenditure on government schools. This will mean that some $177 million will be taken from government schools over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The rationale for this extraordinary attack on schools is the cost to the state. As a consequence, the government is introducing a benchmark based on the average cost of a student in the state school system of some $3,400 for each student. It is arguing that, for every student who shifts from the state to the non-government school sector, some $1,700 per capita will go to the non-government sector. But this is fundamentally flawed. Evidence before the committee indicated that it should have been the marginal cost of a student rather than the average cost that should have been taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not quote at length, but Mr Christopher Taggart, the Director of Management Accounting at the New South Wales Department of School Education, told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the DEET analysis is substantially flawed.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to take all the school system, including the administrative and executive structures of the schools as well as the state infrastructure . . . as being deleted or changed in anyway is nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA>So the basis of assessment here is flawed. It is a flaw which has been highlighted consistently by just about every state in the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6053">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We know that what is driving the government in this particular area is an agenda which was revealed by the leaked minutes of a coalition Expenditure Review Committee meeting on 3 and 4 June 1991. On a page headed `Education: David Kemp' we find the following quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He noted that the Coalition sought to encourage students to move from government to non-government schools. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is the agenda. No policy review, just an ideological fixation. It was also agreed at that committee meeting: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that Dr Kemp would report back to the Committee on non-government schools&mdash;whether additional expenditure could be offset by reductions in grants to government schools and in untied grants.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what you are doing. You are shifting the money from the government school sector to the non-government school sector on the basis of a hollow benchmark and in pursuance of an ideological fixation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have another concern with this legislation: it exposes this government's fancy rhetoric about literacy goals, its commitment to young people and its commitment to those who are disadvantaged. What you are doing is lumping together the former equity programs which were aimed at very specific groups of educationally disadvantaged young people. You are putting them all into one program, blurring the focus of them and, indeed, undermining the national priority designed to make changes affecting all those students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It remains to be seen whether the funds provided continue to deliver the types of outcomes for which the programs were originally designed. Once again, the Australian Council of State School Organisations are under no allusions about this move. They see it as something quite critical in diminishing the capacity to target the disadvantaged, as their letter to us of the last few days would indicate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This legislation exposes the government's hollow rhetoric of its commitment in this area, but at the same time it is very dangerous in that it will undermine a system that has been developed consistently over the last 15 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years or so&mdash;a system which has served and which can continue to serve Australia well.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The bill has far&hyphen;reaching consequences for the future delivery of primary and secondary schooling in Australia. As Senator Bolkus said, this bill is based on deceit. I have to correct something that Senator Bolkus said. The $2.3 billion which the government says is additional funding for schools over the next four years is in fact not FAGs money. As I understand, it is 90 per cent supplementation, indexation and new enrolments. For that you can read inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is based on a deliberate misrepresentation of figures.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . fulfilling the government's commitments to promote excellence and achievement through the provision of quality education . . . The Bill fosters a partnership approach with states and territories which recognises both the constitutional responsibility of states and territories for education and the Commonwealth's role in guiding national directions and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA>It is hard to imagine anything further from the truth than this statement. Senators should ask: is this a bill which seeks to destroy the public education system? The answer is, yes. Is this a bill which seeks to shift students away from state schools and into the private school system? Once again, the answer is yes. Is this a bill which promotes the rapid and uncontrolled expansion of new and existing private schools and punishes students who remain in government schools by cutting their per capita funding? Will this debate reopen the old divisive state aid debate? The answer is most certainly yes. Will this bill allow the federal government to step away from its responsibilities for education? It is the same answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most striking things about the Senate committee's report was the general <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6054"> lack of support for this bill.

<PARA>This was the general tenor of submissions by the Australian Association of Christian Schools, the Anglican Schools Commission, the Christian parents controlled schools and the Lutheran schools. These groups support the bill, as you would expect them to do. It is already possible for these groups to operate schools. The vast majority of their schools receive Commonwealth subsidies&mdash;and some are very considerable subsidies. Others do not because they do not qualify under the current new schools policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new schools policy, which has been in place since 1986, required schools to have minimum enrolments and to demonstrate that there would not be an adverse impact on neighbouring schools, both government and non-government. In other words, it provided for planned educational provision and an orderly means by which decisions can be made about the establishment of new schools and the proper accountability for funding them. The question this bill deals with is whether or not Commonwealth funding should be made available to those schools without any restriction or any consideration of the impact of such new schools on the neighbouring schools and whether or not the considerable extra per capita cost of providing this funding should come out of the budget for public schooling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Catholic Education Commission said in its submission to the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee that the Commonwealth could and should still play a significant role in advocating commitment by state governments to general principles of planning. They said that cooperative and coordinated planning for new <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> schools should be encouraged but only on the basis that such planning does not frustrate the reasonable demand for places in non-government schools. It says that the Commonwealth would need to be satisfied that adequate planning has been undertaken so as to ensure the viability of a proposed school prior to approving its recurrent funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Catholic commission goes on to say that, as a minimum, the process of consultation would include proponents of a new school gaining access to demographic and planning data at the state and territory level and consultative meetings between two or more education providers or, from time to time, between all peak provider bodies. I would argue that this is a sensible approach to planning our schools in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it needs to be noted by the Senate that not one of the witnesses before the committee was prepared to argue that the mechanism for drawing that funding from the public school budget was either fair or appropriate. As we have come to expect, it is ideology which drives the coalition government to privatise that which should remain public and it is ideology which dictates that the cost of its generosity towards private schools should be met by an already under&hyphen;resourced system of government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the year 2000, on the government's own projections, it will cost the Commonwealth $195 million more a year to fund 94,000 extra students in private schools, at current rates of recurrent grants. At the same time, it will save less than $10 million a year on the 23,000 children who it expects to exit the state system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has increased spending in real terms in very few areas in the budget and schools are no exception. The government will fund the $185 per annum shortfall in its budget bottom line with a very devious mechanism it calls the enrolment benchmark adjustment. This ingenious mathematical equation will deduct $305 million from state education budgets over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that the EBA is a punitive measure. It is also cumulative in its effect. The lower the proportion of students in government schools the lower the per capita <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6055"> funding of those students. The Commonwealth recurrent grants to state schools currently average $406 per student. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs prepared a table which shows what would happen, using the enrolment benchmark adjustment, if the proportion of students in private schools rose from just under 30 per cent as it currently stands to 35 per cent. With 35 per cent of all students in private schools, the $406 Commonwealth grant to state school students drops to just $259.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At 40 per cent, that grant would drop to $105. If that proportion was to reach 50 per cent, the grant would in fact be a debt and the states would actually owe the Commonwealth $295 for each student in a state school. This would amount to a debt of $412 million per annum which the states would have to pay to the Commonwealth&mdash;and that is on top of the loss of recurrent grants which would amount to another $260 million each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely hope that the proportion of students in Australia in private schools does not reach 50 per cent, but these figures show just how ridiculous, punitive and ill&hyphen; considered this so-called enrolment benchmark adjustment is. I hope the government is not serious about putting it into effect. These figures also show how misleading the government has been in suggesting that the money simply follows the student when he or she transfers from the state to the private system. I note here that Senator Bolkus made this mistake as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me be quite clear: the Democrats do not like the abolition of the new schools policy, but we could live with it if it were not accompanied by such a ridiculous, punitive and dangerous mechanism. If that money simply went with the individual students when they moved from government to non-government schools, it would at least give some basis to the government's claims about promoting choice. I would not like that either&mdash;if only for the fact that our public schools are not properly funded for their current levels of students&mdash;but, once again, I could live with it because it would at least be a fairer way of allocating funds.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, of course, is the crux of the matter here. The government is not trying to be fair in its dealings between the private and public education sectors. It is backing one sector at the expense of the other whilst trying not to mess up its very precious bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new line from the government is, `Well, don't bother about the EBA, don't you worry about that. We have put an extra $2.3 billion into the budget which will more than offset the enrolment benchmark adjustment.' But will it? As I said earlier, according to the department, the lion's share&mdash;more than 90 per cent&mdash;of this $2.3 billion is in fact inflation, indexation, `supplementation' and new enrolments. By the time you spread that over four years and give it and more to the private sector, it is in fact a substantial decrease in real terms to the government's own schools. No doubt the government is having difficulty knowing just what additional expense it will be up for in removing all impediments to funding new private schools. What this bill does is ensure that the federal coffers are always protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have proposed that the government defer for 12 months the abandonment of the new schools policy, the broadbanding programs and the enrolment benchmark adjustment. We would like to see a full inquiry into the implications of these very radical changes. We think this will also allow time for proper consultation with the states and territories. It became very obvious when witness after witness to the Senate committee inquiry raised the issues of the lack of time in which to respond, the absence of adequate data on which to make judgments, the short time frame for consultation and negotiation, and the fact that, whilst the abandonment of the new schools policy was consistent with coalition policy before the election, the means by which it would be funded was not made clear until well after handing down the budget. Furthermore, the government has not prepared an impact study of the effect of this bill on either the existing public school system or on the non-government sector. I will draw on some examples of what state governments have said about this bill:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6056">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the view of the ACT Government that it should have been provided with advance warning of the proposed changes so that legislation and regulations could have been amended to provide sensible controls.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote is included in the Senate committee report. The Queensland government said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the long term implications of this initiative on future Commonwealth funding to Queensland, the lack of detailed consultation is a matter of significant concern.</PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian government said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before this legislation becomes law, the federal Government should be asked to demonstrate how the quality of Australian schooling will improve as a result of its policy to increase non&hyphen;government school enrolments and cut the resources available to government schools.</PARA>
<PARA>So what state governments are saying is that they also have no idea of how these changes will affect Australian schools. In short, in the name of choice&mdash;and nothing more than that&mdash;this government is going down a path when it has no idea where the path is leading and where it will end up. In the name of choice, it is conducting a major social experiment and it is launching Australian parents and children into the great unknown. It is doing this with absolutely no idea of what the consequences will be. We do not think that is acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe government responsibility in relation to education is about a lot more than promoting choice. It is about developing a balance between choice and ensuring free access to quality education for all Australian children. Choice is important, yes, but it is not and should not be the first priority of government or the goal to which all others must become subservient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, a fair amount of choice already exists. I remind senators that private or non-government schools already receive significant Commonwealth funds. That decision&mdash;that choice&mdash;to opt out of the public system is already heavily subsidised by taxpayers. What this legislation does is give a very small percentage of the population total freedom to choose at the expense of the rest of the community. It does that on the basis of no clear data, no firm evidence and no attempt to even think about what the medium to long- <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> term implications might be. That is a truly staggering thing to think about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure some members of the government do not particularly care about the future of public schooling in Australia. They do not care that it might become more marginalised, more residualised and more under&hyphen;resourced. To those government members and senators who do care and who do understand the social and economic importance of a strong public schooling system, I can only say this: you must take the time to look at this legislation. You must take the time to look at its possible implications. You must take the time to go through the figures and understand exactly what you are voting for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to go down in history as being part of a government which places the interests of small, fundamentalist and extreme schools at the expense of Australia's public schooling system, then by all means vote for this bill. But if you have any commitment at all to the wider value of public schooling in Australia, you must vote against this ill&hyphen; considered and dangerous piece of legislation. I move the Democrats second reading amendment to this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add ", but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> requests the Government to amend the bill to postpone for twelve months the commencement of those provisions in the bill relating to the broadbanding of programs, the abolition of the New Schools Policy and the introduction of the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that Senator Woodley would be most horrified by Senator Allison's description of those schools as being extreme. I would like Senator Allison to give some thought to what she meant by that because the statistics are showing that 10,000 students per year are opting out of the public system. How many families out of the Australian community does that represent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose they are all weirdos, extremists, fundamentalists and, according to Senator Allison, they might be Jewish on top of that, which really nails it down that they are somehow extreme or somehow fundamentalist. It is very concerning that Senator Allison should have used those sorts of words to describe the sorts of schools that parents are now setting up right around this country because of their concerns with the public system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do you think, when there is a free education system provided by the state, parents make the very huge sacrifice to send their children to a private school and pay literally thousands and thousands of dollars? Because they are genuinely concerned about their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the product of the state education system. I never had the benefit of a private school. But I can assure you that my wife and I are doing everything possible to ensure that our children get the benefit of&mdash;in Senator Allison's words&mdash;one of these `extremist' schools. Senator Allison nods her head in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support of that comment. In effect, she is saying that the Calvin Christian School in Kingston in Tasmania, the township where I live, is somehow extremist and fundamentalist. If the Democrats ever hoped to win back a Senate seat in Tasmania, I think it has just gone by that sort of language and by that sort of acknowledgment of what I thought Senator Allison was saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that hundreds and thousands of families around this country are making a significant sacrifice for their children. Those who are filthy rich do not worry about a new schools policy. They can afford a private education system no matter what. So it does not affect them. This policy affects those families that are the true battlers where the other spouse is sent out to work simply to pay for school fees, where they do not buy the new car and where they do not take a holiday because they want to save the money for the education of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parents and people you are talking about are people committed to their children. You are saying to them, `We know best. We don't want to give you a choice.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This tribunal is a good tribunal. Its president is the Hon. Justice Michael Foster and its Deputy President is the Hon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Federal Police force is a very honourable force in these days when much criticism is made of policing. I do think that this is a police force that can hold its head up high. It is led very ably by Commissioner Palmer. I think it is proper that we in this place pay tribute to the force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A disciplinary regime is very necessary in any organisation, whether it be a police organisation or not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most vital things when dealing with the law is to know what the law is.

She studied at the Sydney Conservatorium, training initially as a violinist, but concentrating on singing following an arm injury. She made her debut as a soprano in 1931, her stage debut in Sydney in 1932, her operatic debut in Vienna in 1936, her concert debut in London in 1938 and her first world concert tour and concert tour of Australia in 1946.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dame Joan sang in the world's major opera houses and with the world's major organisations, including Covent Garden, Sadler's Wells, the Netherlands Opera, Liceo Barcelona, the Vienna State Opera, the Bolshoi in Moscow&mdash;she was the first Australian to sing there&mdash;the Kirov in Leningrad, the New York City Centre and the Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Elizabethan Theatre Trust, the forerunner of the Australian Opera, until illness forced her retirement in 1965.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Renowned for her warm portrayals of Puccini heroines, Dame Joan sold more than one million copies of her recording `Oh, my beloved father'. She was the first known classical artist to receive a gold disc for sales of an aria. After retiring she was artistic director of the Victorian Opera Company from 1971 to 1976 and taught singing from 1975 to 1993 at the Victorian College of the Arts, where she was head of vocal studies, and the University of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also a talented golfer, Dame Joan won the New South Wales junior golf championship in 1929 and the state title in 1932, 1934 and 1935, and was three times runner-up in the Australian amateur title. She was a sports writer for the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS>and a member of the Royal Sydney Golf Club, the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, the Barwon Heads Golf Club and the Royal Motor Yacht Club, Dorset, England.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dame Joan won the Sir Charles Santley award from the Worshipful Company of Musicians, London, in 1970, when she was also named musician of the year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dame Joan Hammond's name will always be synonymous with the highest levels of opera in Australia and, indeed, on the international stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it could be said that Hillary Clinton's recent visit provides us with a timely focus on the role of Australian women in politics. It is interesting that we tend to take so much for granted until somebody comes and the media and others suddenly say, `Oh, women's issues, women's concerns; they are top of the agenda. Why aren't Australian women talking about these issues?' Of course, Australian women have been talking about these issues for many years. They have been at the forefront  of the previous government's agenda. When we heard questions yesterday about who was invited to meet with Hillary Clinton, in some ways it was not so much a question of who was invited but what was on the agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that Hillary Clinton is a very prominent woman in her own right. She is a committed feminist and a social activist. She would want to know the kinds of policy issues that are at the forefront of Australian women's agendas. My concern is that because a fairly selective group was invited to meet with her, she might have only gained an insight into one side of the political agenda. That particular side is fairly disappointing at the moment. I wonder whether she would not have been disappointed to find that Australia has actually abandoned the national agenda for women. It has been in place since 1988 as a program of comprehensive commitments across portfolios of those issues that are important for Australian women and their families. Hillary Clinton, someone who is very involved in gender policy development in the United States, must have wondered, if she asked those members who were part of the inner circle, why that national agenda has been abandoned.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She must have also wondered why the new government determined to get rid of the women's budget process. That is not to say that there weren't some initiatives announced by the minister, Senator Newman, particularly in relation to caring, that were not welcome in the budget, but there was not a comprehensive women's budget process. I do not think there are too many people in this place&mdash;indeed out in the community&mdash;who understand that for the past 12 years the women's budget process has guaranteed that every government department has had to account for 51 per cent of the population. That is what was important about the women's budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a question of singling out a few items in a given budget and saying, `That's for the women, end of story.' The administrative structure was set up by my government to ensure that all the departments, whether it was the Department of Defence, the department of housing, the Department of Health, the community services department or the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, were required to account in their policies for their impact on 51 per cent of the population&mdash;that is, women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked both Senator Hill, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, and Senator Newman if they could have another look at that women's budget process for next year. I do not think they realise that the process has been admired around the world as being a very appropriate process for implementing the Beijing national plan of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back now to Mrs Hillary Clinton, as she seems to be better known. She was one of the key speakers to address the Fourth UN International Women's Conference in Beijing last year. She would also be mindful of the tremendous effort that is required by governments around the world to implement the National Platform for Action arising from this important conference. Again, the Australian government made a number of commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are locked in internationally to implement the National Platform for Action. We made speeches at that conference. We negotiated. Australia played a very significant role. Yet, to date, we have heard nothing as to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6061"> what the Howard coalition government's policies are in relation to gender. I am reliably informed that a parliamentary secretary, the Hon. Andrew Thomson, has said that he does not want to see anywhere in the overseas aid project funding details the words `gender' or `empowerment'. He needs to be brought up to date on how the world has changed since perhaps he was last thinking about these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not radical language from the former Labor government or from the so-called radical Labor women's caucus committee; this is the language of the international community, be they conservative governments, be they more progressive governments. There really is a tremendous need for the Howard government to look again at gender policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1984 the federal Labor government introduced the first women's budget that I was talking about earlier. Since then, there has been a women's budget each year. It is there not only as an example of gender policy but also because it details a range of all the services, particularly community services, of benefit to women and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs were focused on improving equality of opportunity for women while at the same time increasing access to health, education, training, employment and legal services. The social safety net supported families through Medicare, various family allowance payments indexed to maintain their value, the child support scheme and a comprehensive child&hyphen;care program which offered different types of care, financial support to maintain the quality of care and assistance with the costs of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the very first budget, what do we have from the coalition? We have all those initiatives that are undermining opportunities for women and their families&mdash;the up-front fees for nursing homes, the increased fees for university courses, the abolition of operational subsidies to community child-care centres and the proposed withdrawal of Commonwealth responsibilities for basic health, housing, community and disability services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at a meeting in Townsville about 10 days ago when over 100 public tenants came to voice their concern about proposed changes <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in relation to the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement. It has been said that it will be more equitable to fund public housing tenants and private tenants on exactly the same basis but, if you look closely, all that will happen is the subsidies will go to private landlords and, indeed, landladies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of continuing to build up that public housing stock and to ensure that there are opportunities for reducing the waiting lists in public housing, we will have no more money going in to build up the housing stock and the whole concept of public housing will be turned over to the private rental market. Of course, there are landlords who are responsible, who will maintain their premises to a suitable standard and who will be perfectly good landlords when it comes to providing appropriate accommodation at a reasonable rent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I will speak about secrecy which hopefully will gather a lot of attention. Governments in particular are often overwhelmed by numbers, financial matters and budgets. But if you ask people about politics, they do not respond with remarks about economics; they respond with how they feel about people, about politicians and their character&mdash;in other words, about accountability. `Secrecy' is the opposite of `accountability'. This evening I will speak on Western Australia where I have done a lot of work on this matter with the Commission on Government, but I believe that my remarks are apposite to Australia as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6062"> The Australian Democrats support the recommendations of the WA Royal Commission 1992 and the Commission of Government Report No. 1. We support the promotion of the freedom of information regime as the governing legislation for determining when information held by the government should be disclosed. We support the enactment of privacy legislation to address specific privacy issues surrounding the storage, use and retrieval of personal data and data matching between government agencies. Also, we support the amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1992 (WA) to make provi sion for the attachment of a public interest test to each of the exemption clauses in schedule 1 attached to that act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The WA royal commission found that unnecessary secrecy surrounded actions taken by the government into some of the events into which the commission inquired. The government was found to have used official secrecy to keep the public deliberately uninformed. Openness in government is an indispensable prerequisite of accountability to the public. It is a democratic imperative. The right to vote is without substance, unless it is based on adequate information. If government truly is to be government for the people, if the public is to be able to participate in government and experience its benefits, the public must be properly informed about government and its affairs. Open government does not hold for all purposes and in all circumstances&mdash;but it should be the norm, and secrecy should be the exception. Information is the key to accountability in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public access to government information was seriously hampered in Western Australia until, in accordance with the recommendations of the royal commission, freedom of information legislation was enacted in Western Australia in 1992. While this has considerably improved public access to information in government documents, albeit often with great resistance by bureaucrats and ministers&mdash;and I guess there should be echoes of this in the Commonwealth&mdash;information freedom is still hampered by extensive secrecy laws in state legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This freedom of information legislation confers upon people a legally enforceable right of access to information held by agencies of both state and local government. The right of access to documents is qualified by specific exemptions, including the exemption of certain agencies. Additionally, the right relates to documents rather than information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The WA royal commission in its inquiries also recommended that the range of exemption documents under the freedom of information legislation should be confined to a minimum. This recommendation was revisited by the Commission on Government inquiry into the secrecy laws of the state. I should say <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that in Western Australia there are over 100 acts with specific secrecy provisions which specifically avoid the freedom of information laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commission on Government made a number of recommendations on freedom of information. Recommendation No. 5 states that there should be a public interest test to each of the exemption clauses in schedule 1. Recommendation 5.2 states that the Freedom of Information Act should be amended to specifically empower the Information Commissioner to formulate guidelines designed to assist agencies on how to apply that public interest test. Recommendation 7 states that, prior to any enactments which purport to override or restrict the provisions of acts, there be a process of public consultation followed by a public report into the outcome by the minister administering the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1986 the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia recommended that administrative decision makers should, as a rule, be obliged to give reasons for decisions to persons sufficiently affected by those decisions. Again, in 1992 the WA royal commission recommended that an administrative decisions act be enacted as a matter of urgency in accordance with the 1986 report of the Law Reform Commission&mdash;and we are still pursuing that administrative appeals tribunal which we need. Now, 10 years later, this recommendation has still not been acted upon. There is no acceptable reason for the continued deprivation of the citizens of Western Australia of what should be accepted as a basic right inherent in our system of government. There is no justification for any further delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The official secrets of WA are in urgent need of systematic review. They are found in numerous statutes scattered throughout the law of the state. In their scope they go far beyond what is justifiable in protecting the legitimate interests of government and of those dealing with government. Even with the FOI legislation finally having been enacted, the ability of officials generally to promote open government has been seriously impaired by the unwarranted breadth of secrecy duties imposed upon them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6063">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public servants are subject to a duty of confidentiality. In addition to the sections of many statutes which impose specific secrecy obligations upon public servants, there are generalised provisions. Consequently, bureaucrats are extremely careful about breaching those and, as a further consequence, we have an uninformed public. The WA criminal code also provides a penalty for a general offence of unauthorised disclosure of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key characteristics of the constraints placed on public servants by secrecy legislation in statutes in the Public Sector Management Act 1994 are the control they reserve to government over the public release of information, and the high level of protection they give to the interests of government and the cabinet executive itself. The interests of government and the cabinet executive, as the events into which the WA Inc. royal commission inquiry demonstrated, are not the same as the interests of the public; they are special and private interests and not public interests. The WA Inc. royal commission recommended that the Commission on Government review the secrecy laws of the state&mdash;and that is exactly what it did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 the Commission on Government conducted its public inquiry into secrecy laws in Western Australia. The WA Information Commissioner, Bronwyn Keighley-Gerardy, in her submission to the commission expressed this common sentiment at the public hearings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secrecy in the public sector is a tradition inherited from a constitutional monarchy and it has evolved as part of the entrenched culture of public administration. It is reinforced by the enactment of secrecy provisions in legislation. In spite of the spirit of openness which is embodied in the concept of FOI . . . existing practices in public sector agencies lean towards secrecy. That is, the public sector has a culture of secrecy rather than a culture of openness.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>For some purposes, official secrecy has a necessary and proper place in the scheme of government. The exemption provisions of the FOI legislation are indicative of the situations in which this can be so. What needs to be emphasised, however, is that it is only the protection of most important public and private interests which can justify official secrecy. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The COG, in its final report on secrecy in the laws of WA, made a number of recommendations on official secrecy. Recommendation 12 covered a code of ethics. Recommendation 12(2) covered chief executive officers and chief employees of public sector bodies to be responsible for specifying classes of information that should be protected. Recommendation 12(3) made them responsible for publishing such classifications. Recommendation 12(4) made recommendations for it to be made available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If responsible government is to have substance in Western Australia, the constitutional role of responsibility must be discharged and seen to be discharged. The processes of parliament must accommodate this need. Accountability can only be exacted where those whose responsibility it is to call government to account are themselves possessed of, or are able to obtain, the information necessary to make considered judgments. Information is the key to accountability. Given parliament's role as a primary accountability agent of the public, accurate information is essential. Without information, the role and effectiveness of parliament can be neutralised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The WA Inc. royal commission, during its inquiry, was particularly concerned with enhancing parliament's role as the gatherer of information about government and as the public's informant. The royal commission made three principal recommendations which ought to be in place if parliament is to effectively undertake this role. First, parliament should have optimal access to information of and about government. This requirement has a number of implications. It requires that both the obligations of the agencies of government and the hierarchy of parliament itself be so tailored that information can be obtained in a comprehensive and systematic fashion and that information not be withheld without full justification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6064"> The reforms introduced by the Financial Administration Audit Act 1985 (WA) have improved materially the information supplied to parliament by way of annual reports from public service departments and statutory authorities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Parliament's own procedures, and in particular, question time and the committee system are not constituted and practised in ways that bring the Executive fully under the scrutiny of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the complexity and diversity of the operations of government, it is no longer adequate for Parliament to rely upon ad hoc measures when inquiring into the conduct of government. Steps have been taken in recent years to establish standing committees of Parliament to review aspects of executive accountability. If Parliament is to have any realistic prospect of bringing the Executive under adequate scrutiny, it must systematise its role. Committees are the most suitable means for achieving this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, if Parliament is to perform its role of scrutiny, it must know with relative certainty to whom it properly can turn to provide and/or hold responsible for the information it requires.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of ministerial responsibility, as traditionally understood, contains an element of fiction. That is, the Minister is required to provide information to parliament in question time, about any matter within the reach of his or her portfolio responsibility. The minister will often have no prior knowledge of, or involvement in, the matter and furthermore, could not reasonably or realistically be expected to be responsible for it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WA Inc. Royal Commission made recommendations that a more realistic approach be taken on the obligation of the various arms of government to satisfy Parliament's information needs. Parliamentary committees in particular must be entitled as of right to exact information, from responsible officers of government, where matters fall within their spheres of actual responsibility. The actual manner in which government is being conducted and the actual responsibilities discharged by officials, and not an inflexible principle of ministerial responsibility, should ordain who is the appropriate officer from whom information can properly be sought by Parliament and, importantly, what information can appropriately be sought from that official. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of commercial secrecy is to prevent the public being informed of those activities. A major function of commercial secrecy is to protect the economic value of information which has value because it is kept secret.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercial secrecy in the public arena can have only one or other of two related justifications. The first is to secure an economic advantage to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public. The second is to safeguard against economic prejudice to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Translating these justifications into principles which should guide the determination as to when secrecy legitimately can be claimed, the Australian Democrats consider the propositions contained in the usual commercial and business information exemptions to the FOI legislation provide an appropriate guide.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, I once again rise to make some further remarks regarding the disastrous decision of this government to consider the construction of an airport at Holsworthy in the Sutherland shire of Sydney. Somebody said to me the other day that if I made any more speeches on this issue I would probably pass former Senator Michael Baume's record on speeches with regard to a well-known piggery. My response to that person&mdash;who I might say is from the other side&mdash;was that Senator Baume used to make a lot of speeches about an issue which was totally irrelevant to the interests of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am speaking about again tonight is a matter that is of the utmost relevance and importance to hundreds of thousands of people in southern Sydney. If it gets under the skin of a few people in the government, then so be it. That is what I intend to do and what I intend to keep on doing. I say that because it is quite clear that, despite the growing protest, the growing anguish of the residents of southern Sydney, the government is simply not listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6066"> When I made my speech last week I referred to a meeting that took place in Cro nulla on Sunday, 17 November. I would estimate that some 700 or 800 people were in attendance at the Cronulla&hyphen;Sutherland Leagues Club to vent their concern and anger at what this government is doing with respect to its aircraft noise and airport policy for Sydney. The people at that meeting made it very clear that they did not want another airport located in their region. They were already suffering and bearing more than their fair share of aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday night I attended a meeting held in Helensburgh. In excess of 300 people attended that meeting. For the township of Helensburgh, that was a tremendous roll-up, particularly considering the very adverse weather conditions that evening. The people of that area and representatives of councils in the Illawarra and Wollongong areas made it abundantly clear again that they are totally opposed to the consideration of any airport being located in the Holsworthy region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Sunday, 24 November&mdash;just two days ago&mdash;I also attended in Sutherland a large rally which comprised, on reliable estimates, around 3,000 people. They gave up the first fine day for some time to attend a rally to oppose this disastrous decision that, if it were to become a reality, will severely impact upon their lives and their future. At that meeting at Sutherland, the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, made it abundantly clear that the New South Wales government is totally opposed to any airport being located at Holsworthy and supports fully the actions of the local councils, the residents and the politicians in the area who are opposing this process and this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also understand that the New South Wales Liberal-National Party opposition is opposed to an airport at Holsworthy, although you do not hear too much from its members. They have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the platform to voice their opinion. No doubt they are severely embarrassed by the decision taken by their federal coalition colleagues. I have pointed out in the past that the decision is an act of betrayal of the people of southern Sydney, particularly those in the Hughes electorate, because it was made without any forewarning prior to the election. It is a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision that reverses a longstanding position, from as far back as 1985, that the site was totally unsuitable and had been previously rejected. As I have pointed out on many occasions, many thousands of people have moved into the area, including the immediate vicinity of the Holsworthy base, on the understanding that they would not have any airport located in their community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community outrage grows day by day. It will continue to grow as people become more aware of what this government has in store. I and the residents are concerned that, notwithstanding the statements by the government, there really is a secret agenda here. The agenda is to locate that airport at Holsworthy. I hope that the government can be persuaded from that course. All indications to date show that this is the preferred site, notwithstanding what the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call in support of that view the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in June this year told his constituents in Bennelong in a newsletter that Sydney was to be guaranteed a second international airport and that the Holsworthy military reserve had been chosen as the fall-back option. He then went on to say that the site had potential benefits because it would involve limited aircraft noise in residential areas, it allowed for future expansion and it was already owned by the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister is wrong in respect of the statement that there would be limited aircraft noise in residential areas. It demonstrates his lack of knowledge of even the locality. Certainly the Commonwealth coalition government has identified some of the reasons why it views this site seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6067"> What is of concern, however, is that the government refuses to come clean as to why it quite unexpectedly&mdash;it left its decision unannounced before the election but dumped it on the people after the election&mdash;chose this site to be reconsidered. Freedom of information requests have been made for documents that set out the reasons for the decision. They have been refused under section 36 of the Freedom of Information Act, because the documents are said to be ministerial briefs and, therefore, classed as deliberative docu ments. I will quote from the reasoning given by Mr Hugh Milloy when he determined, on behalf of the Department of Transport and Regional Development, that the documents should not be released:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recognised that there may be a public interest in releasing the document. However, having regard to the nature of the documents, which include advice, recommendations and express opinions on possible changes to the direction of the environmental impact assessment process for Sydney West Airport, I formed the view that to release the document could mislead the public and encourage ill-informed speculation as to the Government's decisions in relation to the location and development of a second Sydney airport. I therefore came to the view that the release of the document would not, on balance, be in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>What a totally spurious reason. Senator Murray's comments about secrecy are very apposite here. Here we have being withheld documents that would clearly indicate why the government made this decision on the spurious basis that the people may be misled if informed. What an absolutely illogical piece of nonsense. I will finish by referring very quickly to another matter.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's proposal to provide low income earners with the choice of opting out of superannuation recognises that small superannuation contributions are of limited value to many low income earners, who are likely to remain largely dependent on the age pension and have a more pressing need to maintain current living standards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Professor Smith of Oregon University has made several submissions to the Minister, as the Biological Control Authority, that rabbit calicivirus will infect people. These submissions were carefully considered by the Bureau of Resource Sciences, along with all other available overseas and Australian results of testing of rabbit calicivirus on animals and the results of the human health study conducted on Australians exposed to rabbit calicivirus. The results of this consideration were reported to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and his colleagues on the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand before any decision to authorise release of rabbit calicivirus was made. The Bureau of Resource Sciences considers rabbit calicivirus to be specific to the European rabbit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Rabbit calicivirus has undergone extensive testing to determine if it infects other species. Overseas and Australian testing has failed to confirm infection of any species other than European rabbits with rabbit calicivirus. There is also no evidence of disease in animals other than European rabbits associated with rabbit calicivirus. This is despite over ten years experience with infected rabbits associating with other animals and people in over forty countries.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Testing of the Tasmanian devil with rabbit calicivirus is being organised by the Tasmanian Government. Testing is planned to commence in November 1996 and to take six weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) There are no current plans to test the tiger quoll or eastern quoll with rabbit calicivirus. On the basis of the negative tests on another dasyurid, the fat-tailed dunnart, and the forthcoming tests on the Tasmanian devil, tests on these additional animals are not considered necessary.</PARA>
