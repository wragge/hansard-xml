<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I refer to the significant rail reform initiatives of the Australian rail industry announced yesterday by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Could the minister advise the Senate of the importance of these reforms to the secure future of the rail industry in Australia and of the benefits that will flow to jobs and industry in regional Australia as a result of these reforms?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5879" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is a very important announcement that was made yesterday by Mr John Sharp, the minister for transport. Indeed, what the government is hoping to do at long last is to bring about a renaissance of rail, as Mr Sharp described it. At long last what we want is a government that will address the real issues, not simply pander to the unions and sit by and watch what was formerly a very important part of the government business structure haemorrhage away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms will lead to the creation of new jobs in regional Australia as well as securing sustainable jobs in the rail industry. They are in sharp contrast to the mismanagement of the Labor government. Over its 13 years of mismanagement more than 7,000 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jobs were lost in Australian National. As recently as 1995-96, Mr Brereton and Mr Beazley personally approved an AN business plan that saw a further 970 jobs go. During that time of course the rail network continued to decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN's losses for 1995-96 are now estimated to be around $250 million&mdash;much more than the Brew report estimated; dramatically more than AN's own business plan forecast. `If anything,' according to Mr Brew, `AN's situation would only get worse. The former Labor government, in establishing National Rail the way it did, created the straw that broke the back of Australian National. By handing over AN's profitable assets to NR, they were left with no revenue from these assets but all the debts and liabilities.' On that basis we took the view that we simply cannot allow this situation to continue. Failing to act now will inevitably result in the loss of all AN jobs and, if nothing is done, taxpayers will be subsidising each AN job to the tune of $220,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore on 24 November, yesterday, the minister announced a $2 billion reform package to rejuvenate rail services in Australia. The key elements of the package are the sale of AN businesses in whole or in part; interstate passenger services to be offered for sale, with the government committed to their development as tourist attractions in their own right; the assumption of AN's debt and other liabilities, allowing the growth of new businesses without the existing encumbrances; exploring with other shareholders of National Rail the sale of Commonwealth equity; the establishment of a government owned national rail infrastructure body to control and maintain the interstate rail network; and funding for environmental remediation, $50 million, and regional assistance of $20 million. The sale process is to be handled by the office of asset sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A competitive rail industry open to market pressures and private sector enterprise is the only way of ensuring future jobs in the rail industry. The private sector will employ many people who are presently employed by AN. By reducing the cost of transport, many industries which were once not viable will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now be able to begin operation in regional areas creating further jobs. In areas such as infrastructure maintenance and freight operations in South Australia, we expect that the private sector will be ready to step in and take over those functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Staff at AN workshops have the skills to undertake many more areas of work than just rail. Industries in regional Australia will also benefit from greater efficiency in the rail service. To maximise the future prospects of the region, the Commonwealth will provide a $20 million regional development program over two years. The program will assist local economies and assistance will be available through the department of employment as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just hope that this program will be allowed to go ahead as quickly as possible. I was disappointed to see that Mr Carr is making some threats about blocking it, to the extent that the New South Wales government has shares in National Rail. But I am sure that he will see the light. He will realise that the Tasmanian and South Australian governments have endorsed this package. Anyone who has had anything to do with the industry will know that it is about time someone was prepared to take the hard decisions and try to put the industry back on a basis of profitability and to create new jobs in the rail sector, rather than simply standing by, wringing one's hands and doing as Mr Laurie Brereton did in telling Jack Smorgan, the Chairman of AN, that nothing would be done until after the last election. What a total abdication of responsibility. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Minister, in response to an answer given by you to a question on the new deeming provisions on superannuation for people aged greater than 55, a measure that will unfairly affect 67,000 Australians, you said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are doing nothing more than introducing the means test at 55 for people who have been out of work for nine months that they will have to face at 65. If they are effectively retired, there is no injustice in that whatsoever. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5880"> </PARA>
<PARA>What is your definition of `effectively retired'?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5880" SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The requirements of people over 55 who have been looking for work for nine months mean that, in the current climate of unemployment, sadly all too many of them have little or no expectation, realistically, of getting work later. You, like I, Senator Sherry, have no doubt had come through your doors too many of these people, constituents, who feel that their world has finished because they are no longer valued by our society. I have great sympathy for people in that position, and I would not want that to be understood in any other way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, in determining what assistance should be given to people in that position, a categorisation needs to be made of in what circumstances they will then be included in the means testing of their superannuation. Senator Sherry, I must point out that prior to 1993 your government had means testing of superannuation assets. Your government chose to remove the means testing of super products at that time. I understand that the projection that your government had of the cost to revenue was really quite small.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The experience of the last three years is that that projected cost was quite unrealistic and in fact many tens of millions of dollars&mdash;perhaps up to $100 million&mdash;of forgone revenue has been the consequence. This is a bleeding of the system which cannot be allowed to continue. It is not unfair that people who are effectively retired, even if it is involuntarily, should be means tested in the same way as they would be when they are 65.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have already canvassed that pretty thoroughly, but I would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be very happy to add my previous remarks by pointing out that the week before last I was at the OECD in Paris, where members of the OECD were looking at this very issue of early retirement and the problems which are facing OECD countries as a result of the combination of early retirement, a drop in the birth rate and increasing life expectancy for their people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those countries are looking at ways that they must find to discourage people from early retirement and to encourage them to stay in the work force longer. One of the election commitments of this government was that we would encourage people to stay in the work force as long as possible through the introduction of a pension bonus scheme, which we have not introduced in our first budget but which we will be continuing to work on. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The minister would be aware that last week the Senate passed the family tax initiative bills, which provide benefits to a number of Australian families in accordance with one of our central campaign promises.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know Labor is not interested in this, but there are two million Australians out there who are. The Howard government delivered on its election promise to give two million eligible Australian families assistance to the tune of $1 billion a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5881">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative bills which were passed by the Senate will give relief to Australian families after 13 years of neglect by the Labor Party. In just five weeks time, around two million eligible low and middle income families will begin receiving payment. I remind the house that this will be on top of the benefits received from low interest rates, which are as a result of this government's good policies and which are providing an extra $145 a month for families with a loan of $100,000. So Christmas is looking good for Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a worry, however, as to the balance of this budget. We have tackled expenditure in a way that Labor was not prepared to. We have done so in order to bring down interest rates, which we have, to bring down inflation and to keep taxation low. They are our commitments, but they require passage of legislation on the expenditure side in this place over the next couple of weeks. And therein lies a worry, because the Labor Party is in disarray; the Labor Party is having great internal difficulty.</PARA>

He told a party gathering that party members were wallowing around, seemingly not knowing where to begin the refurbishment of Labor in opposition. He said that Labor people used to know instinctively what was the Labor thing to do but now they are no longer sure what it means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently all of this has arisen from the Victorian Left, which is splitting, and a clash occurring between Senator Carr, who is no doubt off on factional business at the moment, and Mr Theophanous from the Victorian state parliament. We want Labor to come back <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> together again, at least for the next couple of weeks, in order to be able to tackle these major budget issues, which will give it the opportunity to sign on to what the Australian people want as evidenced by the election result, as evidenced by the result in Lindsay and as continually evidenced by the opinion polls.</PARA>

The range of financial incentives offered by the New South Wales government through that program is quite extensive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, as you know, our policies of trade liberalisation are designed in our national interest. I thought the Prime Minister put it quite well yesterday in Manila when he was asked a similar question: `What are the tangible benefits for maintaining this push for trade liberalisation of the Australian economy?' His answer was, `More jobs, higher rates of economic growth and the prospect that greater trade flows in the region will provide new jobs for Australians.' That is ultimately what the goal of economic policy is all about&mdash;generating greater economic growth. More jobs for Australians must always be the test of any Australian Prime Minister in applying, in effect, the theory to the practical circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have taken the decision&mdash;which was also the decision of the previous government&mdash;that to press for further trade liberalisation will encourage growth and provide greater job opportunities for Australians. There has been some debate as to who is out in front in this liberalisation. These situations are quite difficult to equate at times because, in some parts of the policy mix, Australia might be out in front; in other parts&mdash;certainly in relation to agricultural policies&mdash;we have been out in front on trade liberalisation for very long period of time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government does want to introduce a greater degree of equity into the higher education system. It wants to do that in a number of ways&mdash;for example, by changing the HECS contribution that students make, by shifting it to a differentiated level, and by some other changes as well. It is interesting to note what those people who profess not to be in favour of these changes have to say or, more importantly, what they do not have to say about these sorts of changes. What they do not have to say is perhaps an indicator of their motives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never heard these people justify why it is that a doctor and a lawyer should pay the same annual contribution for their university studies as nurses and teachers. I have never heard the people opposed to these changes make that justification. I have never heard the people opposing these changes indicate that other taxpayers give about $18,000 a year to educate a medical student. I have never heard people opposing these changes make that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5890"> point. The taxpayers, of course, who give that $18,000 include the battlers, the PAYE taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people opposing these changes equally do not make it clear that the medical student, when she or he finally becomes a doctor, will pay, under the changes, only about $5,500, or 30 per cent, of the cost for that year. That is the only contribution that will be sought. I do not hear these people say that this contribution is, in effect, a real interest free loan for those taxpayers who receive the opportunity, as opposed to the other taxpayers who do not get that opportunity, because it is only indexed to the inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also do not hear them say that this contribution is not pay as you learn but pay as you earn. They say quite the opposite. I hear people opposed to these changes trying to frighten students off suggesting that they will have to pay up front. I never hear these people talk about the very real and substantial benefits that go to graduates&mdash;that is, lower unemployment rates and higher incomes&mdash;for the rest of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who oppose shifting the point at which HECS will have to be repaid from $28,000 down to about $21,000 never actually say to you that not only do they think it is fair that the 25 per cent of school leavers who go to university get, at a minimum, about $20,000 worth of higher education but also that they think they should not have to pay their contribution back until they are earning more than 56 per cent of the rest of the population. That is what people who oppose these changes think is equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I never hear them saying that, in the years of free education, the rise in the participation rate from socially disadvantaged groups was something other than substantial. It was, in fact, negligible. Some figures would indicate that it was negative. In 1980, for example, 59 per cent of children from professional parents went to higher education. By 1989, this had risen to 69 per cent. So that tells you who is getting the benefit out of highly subsidised education&mdash;the sorts of people that members opposite have sought to protect and look after, their own constituency, rather than taking any <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consideration for the funds that battlers, through their tax paying contribution, put into this.</PARA>

<PARA>In question time today, Senator Parer answered, in a most unsatisfactory way, a question that I put to him. We know that this government used the example of the Wright family, a fictitious family created in order to pretend that abuse of social security was occurring when, in the example provided, there was no abuse of social security. The government came into this chamber and admitted that the example they were holding out to be true was indeed false. That is now a well&hyphen;known fact on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, and indeed last Friday, we have learnt that the government has been at it again&mdash;falsifying the facts, fabricating the evidence. It provided a press statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on 23 July and again last Thursday alleging that that there were four examples of actual case studies in which syndication under research and development provisions had been abused. They attached those four case studies to their press release on 23 July. They re&hyphen;issued that press release unamended last Thursday when they launched their START program. They have used those case studies as justification for terminating the syndication R&amp;D program.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a light matter. This is a matter that has caused a storm of outrage in Australian industry. This has caused a storm of protest by reputable Australian companies that their reputations are being slurred by the government's continually exhibiting these case examples and pretending that there are widespread rorts in this system. The government did two misleading things. It said that it based its findings and its press report on a BIE report. There is no such BIE report. The report that it refers to is a report of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism. It also said that it based its decision to terminate R&amp;D on the four case examples. What did the press release actually say? The heading in the ministers' press release was `Use of R&amp;D syndication to generate tax benefits&mdash;actual case examples' and there were four of them. What we now know from evidence given to the Senate economics committee inquiry which sat on Friday is that these are not true. These examples are fabrications. These examples do not represent, as the heading on this press release says, actual case examples. Here, again, the government is caught red&hyphen;handed, fabricating the evidence to justify its decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not just have my word for that. On Friday, we had evidence from a whole host of industry sources who said three key things about these case examples. These industry sources represented 90 per cent overall of all of the applications for syndicated R&amp;D. What were the three things that they said? They said that they did not recognise any of the four examples as being typical or true. They said that those examples are not typical of the applications that they have made under this scheme. And, importantly for this debate, they said that none of those examples would have got through the guidelines as they had been tightened by the former government in December last year in the innovations statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5894"> So the examples, if they had been applications, would have got knocked out under the guidelines last year.

I think this, Senator Cook, points out that industry did not recognise any of these particular cases. That is quite right. This was pointed out to him not on Friday but over two months ago. I think it was two months ago&mdash;5 September, anyway&mdash;in the estimates committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a whole series, and I might say that Senator Cook did a stirling job of pursuing this with great vigour. But the point was made by Mr Evans of the department over and over again that the cases did represent actual cases. Mr Evans said, `They are characterised as representing what was and what is occurring within the operation of a syndication system.' I repeat: what is occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We came into government. We were advised of these particular rorts that were going on. I might make the point clear&mdash;and I think Senator Cook will agree with me&mdash;that during the estimates committee it was pointed out that, while the term `rorting' was used, it was not illegal, it was quite legal. Senator Cook pursued the departmental officials at great length by asking them, `Did this occur before or after the innovation statement?' I think he made the point in the little burst he gave a few minutes ago of saying that the industry people pointed out that none of this would have got through the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was not the evidence given by Mr Evans at the Senate estimates committee. Mr Evans pointed out that, while he was under the impression&mdash;and I have not got the exact words in front of me, although I do have the transcript here&mdash;that they would not have got through the guidelines, in retrospect he felt they would.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to take note of Senator Parer's answer to Senator Cook's question&mdash;and I was somewhat incredulous at the answer, I am afraid. I was present at the estimates committee where I listened to Senator Cook's detailed, measured, persistent and careful questioning of the minister and department on this issue. I conducted my own questioning. I was interested in establishing just what validity there was for two things: firstly, the aspect of rorting, especially after the tightening of the system in December 1995 and January 1996; and, secondly, whether syndication should be dumped because it was ineffective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the first question, Minister Parer began the estimates by using what I refer to as the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `demon&hyphen;speak' of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) &mdash;a method of demonising things he does not like&mdash;such as rorting. By the end&mdash;and the instant will be recalled, and I will paraphrase it&mdash;Minister Parer was saying that rorting was not perhaps the appropriate way of talking about this matter. Today I heard Minister Parer back onto the marketing or propaganda line of knocking it over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no quarrel with the belief that syndication might not be an effective or appropriate system. But to keep using the demonising language of rorting, I think, weakens the government's argument. Let me say quite clearly&mdash;and I have no ministerial record to protect, and I say this as an independent, objective person, I hope&mdash;that to me there has been no empirical objective or even circumstantial evidence on the record, in the budget debates, the estimates or the inquiry that has proven that rorting, which means scams, corruption, illegality, for those who got through a tight screening process, has gone on. Certainly, there were shonky people who tried to get up, but they did not get through the screening process&mdash;and that was acknowledged by the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As such, the use of the word `rorting' is a clear slur, until proven, on the three firms that constitute 90 per cent of the approved syndication systems. I think, if I may say so, Mr Deputy President, that is an unattractive and unhappy way for the government to pursue their agenda, which is one of saving money by reducing these programs to cut the deficit. If that is your aim, that is clearly understood. But do not do it by casting aspersions upon those who have conducted their programs in a legal manner and who have not been proven&mdash;by the Treasury, the ministers or extensive inquiries&mdash;to have rorted or corrupted the system.</PARA>

<PARA>It really is a very sad reflection on those opposite that they should devote question time to issues such as who was invited to Mrs Clinton's function, as opposed to dealing with a fundamental issue such as the future of Australia's railway system. It is incongruous that Senator Crowley, a senator from South Australia, should take the opportunity to ask about Hillary Clinton's function, and who wore hats and gloves and things of such an important nature, as opposed to the Australian national railways system, which the Labor government handled in such a very poor and sorry way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now know that this year AN is expected to run at a loss in excess of $250 million. The accrued debt of AN is now beyond manageable proportions. The subsidy paid per employee, above and beyond the salary that they earn, is $30,000 per annum. That is the state in which the rail system was left when we took over government. I am pleased to say that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) immediately took it upon himself to deal with that problem. He commissioned the Brew report. As it now turns out, the Brew report was quite conservative in relation to the estimated loss that AN would accrue during this year. AN announced the particular figure that it anticipated; Brew suggested another figure, which was higher. The real result is higher than both figures.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy President, it really does indicate how the Labor Party have allowed their eyes to fall from the main game, doesn't it? They are no longer focused on the real issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking about job opportunities, it is very interesting that when Labor first came to power AN had in excess of 9,000 employees. When we took over the number had fallen to well below 3,000, so the ALP should not try to hector us about how we ought to look after the few remaining employees of AN. We will be looking after them. All their rights and entitlements will be guaranteed under the proposal. What is more, the opportunity for growth within the rail infrastructure of this nation will be positive. There will be growth and there will be job opportunities and promotion for those who are involved in this very important part of our infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to note that the coalition government is committed to supporting pensioners through concessional travel. That is a matter that quite rightly has occasioned some concern amongst the pensioners who commute around Australia by rail. The federal government is committed to maintaining concessional travel.</PARA>

There has been a tragedy unfolding in Port Augusta for some years now. Under the Labor Party that city was slowly dying. Over that 13 years, 7,000 jobs in AN were lost.

I was assured this morning that the Minister for Transport in South Australia, the Hon. Diana Laidlaw, will be working very closely with the federal government to ensure that the $20 million that is available to assist with the regional reconstruction both in South Australia and in Tasmania will be used to help those families and to ensure that there is a future in Port Augusta. Again, the same rail worker summed it up when he said, `We want a future; we want a tomorrow.'

In a day of fairly moderate and quiet responses to all questions directed to him, it is interesting that the one time he went off his face was when he was respond <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ing to this question. The preparation was quite clear: `We'll actually accuse them of being petty; we'll dismiss it in that kind of way.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz, in trying to be very smart, has condemned himself out of his own mouth. He said, `Women talk about hats and gloves.' Senator Abetz, that is precisely why Mrs Clinton wanted to meet some Labor women; she especially wanted to talk about issues other than hats and gloves. She wanted to talk about child care. She wanted to talk about women's health. She wanted to talk about Medicare. She wanted to talk to women who make policy&mdash;usually Labor women&mdash;and not to the hats and gloves brigade. She made that clear, to the point of getting her organisation to smuggle people in so that she could speak to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was not averse to speaking to a whole range of people; but she was averse to having an organisation set up her luncheon to exclude Labor women in a petty, small-minded action which characterises Mr Howard's Liberal government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it amazing, as did I think Senator Hill, that Senator Crowley, with the very few opportunities that backbenchers on the other side get to ask questions, took the opportunity to ask the sorts of questions that she did today. As Senator Hill said, there are issues relating to this economy and the state in which the Labor Party left this country that are of much greater importance than who went to Hillary Clinton's afternoon tea, or whatever it was, and what they were wearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that Senator Crowley wants to discuss whether they wore hats and gloves just indicates that she has really lost the plot and why people on 2 March this year voted for and elected the coalition to govern this country. Senator Crowley is now walking out of the chamber because she does not like to hear someone saying that what she was talking about was totally irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons Medicare is in such a state of disarray is that Senator Crowley opposed a co-payment and overlooked the fact that we do not have sufficient money to run Medicare. The Labor government refused to take the hard decisions we are taking in asking people who are on higher incomes to either take up private health insurance or pay an increased Medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government were not prepared to make that decision, yet Labor senators have come in here today and asked questions, as they have done a couple of times, about people with higher levels of superannuation who retire or are unemployed at 55 and who have to make use of some of that resource. This is because the Labor Party will not admit that there are people who may not have employment after 55 but have provided for their retirement by putting their money into other resources such as shares&mdash;especially farmers and small business people who did <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5899"> not have access to superannuation funds. And the Labor Party are prepared to treat those people differently. They are prepared to say that, if you have your money in superannuation, you will be treated differently from the way you would be if your money was in shares, banks or some other fixed deposit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party were not prepared to make the hard decisions. They were not prepared to treat people in an equitable way or make people who are on higher incomes pay.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That we condemn the Federal government's proposed changes to HECS whereby the law degree will be placed in the highest HECS tier of the differential system for students commencing in 1997. We deplore this action for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The differential HECS system is inherently inequitable in that it exacerbates existing disadvantages confronting many students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Law faculties have long been funded at the lowest level of the Relative Funding Model. As a result law faculties have been increasingly under&hyphen;resourced and over&hyphen;crowded, compromising the quality of legal education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Course costs cannot be used to justify placing law in the highest category. Such a system places law students at a double disadvantage&mdash;high levels of HECS and inadequate resources. Furthermore, the majority of law students are also required to pay considerable amounts for their practical legal training, and as such already face a significant financial burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Law courses lead to a variety of occupations such that there are vast earning differences between law graduates regardless of whether they are in the legal profession or otherwise. The reality is that 50 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent of law graduates will not enter the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We strongly oppose the Federal Government's cuts to higher education funding and proposed alterations to HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners, as in duty bound, most humbly ask that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, abandon these destructive policies immediately.</PARA>

<PARA>This matter has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  to and fro for some time. My terms of reference seek to investigate the current superannuation scheme for judges and parliamentarians. The terms of reference show that we seek to look at the fairness of the schemes, particularly in relation to the cost to the public purse and in relation to benefits received by other citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats recognise that there is a need to achieve a fine balance here. There is a need to have an appropriate superannuation scheme that is essential to ensure that parliamentarians are adequately compensated for the resulting vagaries and insecurities of life <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on being elected to parliament. But I think it is true that so many things have changed. We assumed that members of parliament would stay in parliament as long as possible and the focus was on retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening now is that the superannuation scheme we have in place actually fails the test of fairness. When politicians are able to retire in their 40s and early 50s with benefits worth $1 million to $2 million, with 80 per cent of the cost having been borne not by the employee's contributions but by the Commonwealth, I think that does require us to look and ask in 1996 and in relation to other citizens if this can be judged fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Preservation rules are now very tight for other sectors of the work force. Few people can now access their superannuation before age 55. Few workers born after 1960 will be able to access their superannuation before aged 60. But we are different. Federal politicians can do both those things. It is not just that: federal politicians can line up for other government jobs and, even though pension payments might be suspended while they hold that job, they can still line up for other benefits later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Department of Finance, the parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme involves a cost to the Commonwealth equivalent to 78 per cent of parliamentarians' salaries. The way the scheme is designed does benefit longer term parliamentarians while providing significant inequities for shorter term parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With politicians running for office at earlier ages, which I welcome, and retiring earlier&mdash;I think that is something to be encouraged too; I think a healthy turnover of politicians is something we should pay attention to&mdash;the scheme is becoming less about retirement income and more about providing some kind of nest egg for a second career. That is where I think the big changes have happened in the career of parliamentarians and that is why I think it is appropriate now to ask whether this emphasis, this focus, is now appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit, a great deal of whose report I vehemently disagree with, has made several recommendations about the parliamentarians' scheme. It has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5905"> recommended that benefits should be paid through accumulation benefits arrangements and that the amount of superannuation should be determined by the individual member as part of overall remuneration entitlements. Whether you agree with that or not, we are not seeking to pre-empt. We are simply saying that there is an element of transparency attractive in those recommendations. That is why we have incorporated those into the terms of reference. The terms of reference also cover federal judges' superannuation. This raises similar issues to those of the federal politicians' scheme. The National Commission of Audit made similar recommendations about this as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the entreaties of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), the final terms of reference that I am asking us to vote on do not include the Public Service superannuation scheme. I have thought about this at length and I do not agree that the Public Service should be included at this stage. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that I do not trust conservative governments with Public Service superannuation. We can look at various state examples, and I will come to that in a moment. I think it is much more appropriate that the issue of superannuation be looked at in the next enterprise bargaining round, not by a federal government seeking a pre-emptive strike. I think that is what they are up to. My second reason is that I think it is very inappropriate to seek to do this now in the context of a larger scale public sector reform move, evident in the discussion paper released today by Minister Reith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the coalition of their election policy promises. The coalition, in its Public Service policy, promised to guarantee&mdash;you could not get a stronger word than that&mdash;all accrued superannuation entitlements and retain separate arrangements for public sector superannuation. This same promise was repeated in their superannuation policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at history, you can see that conservative state governments in election campaigns made the same promises. But in government, in an effort to make a few bucks, to reduce the deficit, most moved to cut <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public sector superannuation entitlements down from the level guaranteed in current legislation to the minimum level set by the superannuation guarantee charge. In each state, on each occasion, the argument given was, `Well, goodness, we can't have these terrible, terrible unfunded liabilities of superannuation schemes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was on the Senate select committee some years ago and we looked at the unfunded liabilities issue. The conclusion of the committee was that this is not a major crisis. I would argue that there has been no argument sustained to cut entitlements based on the scare tactic of `we have got this major crisis at hand'. We don't. The government actuary regularly reports on the liabilities under the government's superannuation scheme and has reported a steadily declining proportion of GDP in liabilities. Indeed, the most recent report showed that accruing costs were less than emerging costs, suggesting that future generations of taxpayers might be worse off if we move to a fully funded scheme. The National Commission of Audit even conceded that this was an on balance decision. The commission also recommended that, in moving to a fully funded accumulation rather than an unfunded defined benefits scheme, the total value of remuneration packages not be reduced by the change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that only the first part of the commission's recommendations are acceptable to the government because, like Mr Nick Greiner did and like Premiers Kennett, Brown, and Richard Court have already done, I believe that this federal government would, if it had the chance, reduce Public Service superannuation entitlements to the minimum set by the superannuation guarantee charge. Indeed, that was clear to me in the first draft of the terms of reference that Finance Minister Fahey sent me as an alternative to the ones I was proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commission of Audit did not actually do the government's bidding in this area. You might be able to argue that it certainly took up the ideological arguments elsewhere, but in the area of Public Service superannuation it did not do the government's bidding. It recommended no reduction in benefits and it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5906"> saw no problem with the unfunded liabilities issue. I referred to that a minute ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not being able to embrace the recommendations of the Commission of Audit, the government thought, `Here is a go. We might be able to tack this on to Senator Kernot's terms of reference on politicians' superannuation.' I have thought about it at length&mdash;obviously this has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for weeks and weeks&mdash;and I cannot accept that. I think the government should stick by its pre-election commitments. It should keep the current superannuation arrangements for public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we should mix equity and democracy issues, which my terms of reference address, with the massive industrial, financial and political agendas that we are just seeing emerge from this coalition government. It is wanting to run a huge public sector reform agenda. It is going to do it and I do not think we should get mixed up in the middle of that with the subagenda of `let's cut their superannuation entitlements while we can'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that the government is feeling some discomfort in having a level of scrutiny applied to the issue of politicians' and judges' superannuation. We have tried to put this in the too-hard basket for years. That is why I think we have the divisive tacking on of the reference to public servants. In seeking support for this motion today I say that it would be a disgraceful reflection on this parliament if we use failure to agree on terms of reference, specifically the inclusion of public servants, as the reason for doing nothing at all about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not fear scrutiny. We are not above scrutiny. Times have changed. The age of politicians and their retirement age has changed significantly and we should be willing to have that reviewed. We should not be pre-empting the outcome and we should not be frightened of the outcome. It might even say that we do a good job worthy of a particular level of remuneration and superannuation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key issue for the proposed inquiry should be the type of arrangements, that is, defined benefits versus accumulated and funded versus non&hyphen;funded, rather than the specific features of the Commonwealth scheme.

It is up to the committee to call witnesses, whomever they wish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the facts that Senator Kernot put on the table may well be widely accepted by the committee. I wish to put that on the record. It is a matter for the committee to inquire and make recommendations to the government. As I said, the committee does not have a majority of government senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Democrats' proposed terms of reference list a number of issues that the committee's review should have regard to but recognises that these do not limit the committee. I think that is correct. However, the Democrats' list excludes a number of important issues that deserve specific mention so they are not overlooked. Unlike the Democrats proposal, our terms of reference would recognise the National Commission of Audit's recommenda tions in relation to superannuation. Any review that overlooked those recommendations would be severely deficient. The commission made recommendations regarding all major Commonwealth public sector defined benefits schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded that the National Commission of Audit recommended further discussion was needed on these issues of public sector schemes and funding arrangements. I think this is a way that this parliament can respond to those proposals. Our amendment would extend the committee's consideration of unfunded superannuation liabilities to emphasise that it is a broader issue than simply the impact on future budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposals would consider defined benefit arrangements in the wider context of those superannuation arrangements applying to the general work force. Finally, we would have the committee consider how members of existing defined benefit schemes might be treated if the existing arrangements are changed. Some people will be concerned about the impact of any review on their accrued and future entitlements. Clearly, that is an issue which would be addressed by the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the chamber that I think the amendment I moved is not radically different from Senator Kernot's motion. It is more useful. It will allow proper consideration of some of the matters raised by the Commission of Audit. Those who are nervous about this motion, although there is no need for nerves, should note that the government has three members on the committee and I think the non-government parties have four members.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor will support Senator Kernot's motion No. 275 in respect of judges' and parliamentarians' superannuation. Labor will not support the reference of public servants vis-a-vis the National Commission of Audit. When I say `public servants' I am also talking about military personnel. Both the military and the general Public Service have two different superannuation funds with two different levels of entitlement. I would like to incorporate a letter from the Prime Minister <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5908"> to every Commonwealth public servant before the last election. I will come to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, Labor does believe it is appropriate that politicians' and judges' superannuation is reviewed. The appropriate committee to do that is the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. It is the appropriate committee because, as Senator Kemp has pointed out, it is a committee that does not enjoy a government majority. It is a committee with a solid reputation for work. It is currently chaired by my highly esteemed colleague, Senator Watson, from Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just in passing, I do hope, Senator Kemp, that we see the government's legislation in respect of a range of other superannuation matters, as was undertaken by your predecessor, before the end of this year for reference to the Senate committee on superannuation. That is another set of issues. I hope that commitment is maintained. This is the appropriate committee to deal with superannuation issues that come before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time to look at politicians' superannuation. There are a range of reasons. There is no doubt that the nature of work of politicians has changed. The nature of our average life expectancy as politicians has changed. There have been reviews of politicians' superannuation in other parts of the country. Certainly Labor does not shy away from, we are not afraid of and we are not concerned about, a thorough public examination, with public hearings, of federal politicians' and judges' superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As has been noted in this debate, there is, on average, an effective contribution from budget of some 78 per cent of a federal politician's pay into their superannuation. With respect to judges&mdash;I do not think Senator Kernot mentioned the figure&mdash;it is effectively 60 per cent. Those two figures are way above the community norm and standard&mdash;not just above public sector superannuation in general, but substantially above what executives in the private sector could enjoy by way of superannuation. This is an important public issue. It should not be hidden. It should be appropriately debated and investi gated. This is the committee to carry out such an investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We oppose the reference that the government has moved in respect of general Commonwealth employees. As I said earlier, this includes military personnel, who have a different scheme from other Commonwealth employees. This does make reference to the National Commission of Audit. Why do we oppose it? We oppose it because we do not trust the motives of the government&mdash;that is our No. 1 reason. I have circulated a letter from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, which he signed on 28 February this year, just before the election. I will quote the third paragraph from this general letter to all Commonwealth public servants:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I give you my rock&hyphen;solid guarantee that the coalition will not cut and destroy public sector superannuation schemes or the entitlements of existing and prospective Commonwealth government employees.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it a core promise or a non&hyphen;core promise, Senator Kemp? What we have here is an attempt by the Liberal government to use the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to attack the superannuation benefits of public servants, including the military, in this country. The government should say yes or no to the National Commission of Audit recommendations in this area. In its report on page 98 with respect to the Commonwealth Public Service, including the military&mdash;it makes some comments about the military schemes&mdash;the National Commission of Audit says, in recommendation 5.6, to which Senator Kernot has referred:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of this change is to increase remuneration flexibility rather than to reduce the total value of ov</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">erall remuneration packages . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is in respect of public sector superannuation. The Liberal government should give an assurance to every public servant in this country that it is not going to cut the overall level of remuneration of public servants, because this is what this resolution signals today. It wants to either cut their superannuation or cut their wages. The government has to say yes or no to this recommendation from the National Commission of Audit. As far as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5909"> Labor stands on this issue, it says no to reducing the overall remuneration levels, including superannuation, of public servants and the military. Where does the Liberal Party stand on this issue? Yes or no? It does not need reference to a select committee for the government to state its position on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other reasons. The Prime Minister gave an unequivocal commitment in writing. So why does he, presumably, want this issue of general public service superannuation to go to the select committee? It is a Liberal Party hidden agenda. The letter that the Prime Minister sent to every public servant in Australia is a non&hyphen;core promise. He wants to reduce the superannuation entitlements of public servants, including the military, in this country. Labor will not have a bar of it. Labor will hold the Prime Minister to his written undertaking to every public servant and every member of the armed forces&mdash;no reduction in the overall remuneration, including superannuation, of public servants and the military in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what this proposal is all about. You should look embarrassed, Senator Kemp. You have fallen for this instruction hook, line and sinker. Do you, Senator Kemp, on behalf of the coalition, stand by the commitment given by Mr Howard before the election, an unequivocal, rock&hyphen;solid guarantee distributed to every public servant, including the military, in this country? You now want to break it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another reason for opposing this. I am surprised Senator Kemp has not read the third report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation published in October 1992. This matter has already been before the select committee, which spent many hours examining the issue of public sector superannuation. At page 24 under `Superannuation and Unfunded Liabilities' it goes through the issue of superannuation and unfunded liabilities, including state and Commonwealth public servants, for some 10 pages. I do not think the government has read recommendation 6 with respect to this area, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee has not received sufficient evidence on the matter of unfunded public superannuation liabilities, and as it does not have the resources or the time to carry out a far reaching investigation of the problem, it recommends that as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a matter of urgency Commonwealth Government convene a meeting of State Finance Ministers/ Treasurers to develop a plan of action for addressing the problems posed by the unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities.</PARA>

Are you going to adopt the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit as part of the terms of reference that you want to put to this committee? Labor says no.

We have had the National Commission of Audit inquiry and the superannuation committee's third report into this matter. There are numerous other inquiries into state and federal public sector superannuation in this country. We certainly know the extent of the liabilities.

We would like the government to assure us that they do not have a hidden agenda to attack public sector superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason we oppose this amendment&mdash;and I will conclude with this&mdash;is that we do not trust the government. Senator Kernot has mentioned what has happened in Victoria and New South Wales.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And now South Australia, and what has been foreshadowed in Tasmania for state public servants. New employees from the date of the closing of the previous schemes ended up with just the SGC scheme, which is currently six per cent. We do not know the government's intention with respect to the co-contribution. We do not know what that is yet, and that is going to be indicated in next year's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could well have a situation develop where public servants, if their scheme is cut, as the government intends to reduce their superannuation, will be on the SGC scheme&mdash;which will be nine per cent by the year 2000-2001&mdash;without a rock solid guarantee, even though the government gave it before the last election, to the government co-contribution as well. That is what we could end up with. That would certainly be a massive breach of the commitments given by the coalition at the last <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> election. Your general approach on superannuation worries us, Senator Kemp. You want to introduce a new tax, new administrative costs&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support it, yes, we do&mdash;the surcharge, the famous surcharge. You want to introduce all these new costs on superannuation. We have another issue with the over 55 superannuation. So your approach on superannuation does worry us, Senator Kemp&mdash;the undermining of the system, the loss of faith in the system, the growing public concern about superannuation, the question mark over the government co-contribution and the question mark over the superannuation of public servants, including people in the military.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This approach does worry us even though we have in writing assurances from the Prime Minister. Where do these written assurances stand? They are more non-core promises to be disposed of like the public servants who are being made redundant. You get rid of the public servants and you get rid of their superannuation. Labor will not have a bar of that. Labor will not have a bar of these reductions given the Prime Minister's commitment to the entitlements of members of the military and the general public service in respect of their superannuation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that I will be supporting Senator Kernot's motion and to indicate that I will not be supporting the amendment to this motion put forward by the government. There is a great deal of concern and uncertainty in the community in relation to superannuation. That word `uncertainty' is usually used when we are being beaten over the head in relation to business matters. It is always considered to be less of a problem when it relates to the average worker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5911"> But this is what is happening. It actually started with Labor. My concern with the Kelty push for compulsory superannuation was that we saw a move towards the beginning of the end of pensions as a right in Australia. I think it is true that we now have a situation where we are expecting people to fund their own retirement. We are also ex pecting people to run down their superannuation before they will be allowed to access pensions. This is happening more and more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great deal of uncertainty and fear in the community. I think the end of Australians being given a fair go has been signalled by this new government in their new plans for the future and whether or not they believe that pensions should be a right within a fair and just society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this motion is a relatively discrete term of reference. It has not been given a huge amount of time, considering we have Christmas and early January coming up&mdash;and it is hard to get hearings during those times. So the first sitting day in March is not giving a great deal of time for wide ranging debates. It has been mentioned before that issues relating to Commonwealth public servants have been looked at before. I would agree that it fits in very nicely with the current attack on anybody who happens to be considered to be a public servant at present. I usually reject the word `reform' in relation to what is happening amongst the public service, because reform in my definition means a change for the better. It seems that an ideological attack can hardly be called that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen changes in the industrial relations legislation, which will affect public servants. We have seen changes in many areas of work. We have seen changes in relation to privatisation. We have seen this based not necessarily on cost cutting but on a belief that people whose role is unequivocally to serve the public somehow or other are bad and that people whose role is to serve their own interests through the private sector are good. I am not making a judgment, but I do think the debate is bizarre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we are going to have an ongoing debate in relation to accountability problems. We have seen that already in this term of parliament. I believe that in the United Kingdom they are hearing debates now where ministers are refusing to answer questions where they have passed on some part of their role to the private sector because they do not take responsibility for advice that has been given to them by the private sector.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we are actually going into a very bizarre  situation in relation to responsibility. I do not wish that this term of reference, which is specifically to look at the defined superannuation schemes of parliamentarians and judges, be muddied into a general attack on public servants in Australia. Therefore, quite clearly, I will support Senator Kernot's motion and will not support the ham&hyphen;fisted attempt by the government to further attack people working on behalf of the community in Australia in the public service.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As only medical expenses net of reimbursements from health funds qualify for the rebate, the increase in the threshold is consistent with other incentives announced in the Budget for people to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the threshold is expected to raise additional revenue of $26 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $23 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $24 million in 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sale of mining rights</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another Budget measure to be implemented by this bill concerns the sale of mining rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will withdraw the exemption from tax on income from the sale, transfer or assignment of mining rights for gold or other prescribed metals or minerals. Income from the sale of mining rights under contracts entered into after 31 December 1996 will no longer be exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated revenue saving is $2 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $20 million in 1998&hyphen;99, and $40 million per year thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Co&hyphen;operative companies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill implements the repeal of paragraph 120(1)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 announced in the Budget. The measures will prevent the effective 200 per cent tax deduction which was previously available for the cost of certain assets and which provided co&hyphen;operatives and government lending institutions with commercial and taxation advantages over other companies. These advantages are not justifiable and are inconsistent with competitive neutrality principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will apply to government loans entered into after 7.30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on 20 August 1996 and to existing loans only where their terms are altered after this time subject to transitional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first transitional arrangement ensures that certain loans to eligible co&hyphen;operatives that were entered into after 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996, but on or before 31 December 1996, will remain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eligible for the paragraph 120(1)(c) tax deduction provided the company has in the three years leading up to 20 August 1996 had a loan to which paragraph 120(1)(c) applies. This transitional provision applies if the loan was entered into for the sole purpose of acquiring a specified asset pursuant to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a business plan approved by the directors where that approval is recorded in the company's minutes before 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a contract that was entered into before 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The specified asset must be plant or articles for the purposes of section 54 of the act (other than a passenger motor vehicle) or an eligible building for the purposes of section 124ZF of the act. It must be installed ready for use by 30 June 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further transitional provision applies where a co&hyphen;operative has entered into a contract (which may include a verbal contract) before 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996 to acquire an asset and has an agreement for the provision of finance before that time. In such a case, any drawdowns of funds under that agreement after that time for the sole purpose of acquiring the asset will be eligible for the tax deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference in these transitional provisions to an asset would include a group of assets within a particular project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure is expected to save the revenue $2 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $4 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $6 million in 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Infrastructure borrowings&mdash;amendments of the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of the amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 is to prevent certain types of schemes undermining the integrity of the infrastructure borrowings program by breaking the symmetry in the special tax treatments of the payer and receiver of interest. Such schemes enable indirect infrastructure borrowings to be made functionally independent of the financing of an infrastructure project thereby increasing the value of tax benefits to those involved and the cost to revenue without a commensurate increase in the funding for private sector projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will give effect to the Budget announcement designed to prevent those sorts of schemes from undermining the integrity of the infrastructure borrowings program. As was stated in Statement 4 in Budget Paper No. 1: `If allowed to proceed, such schemes would substantially increase the value of tax benefits to those involved, and the cost to revenue, without a commensurate increase in the funding for private sector infrastructure projects.' <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5915"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amending legislation will require:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> new indirect infrastructure borrowings or refinancing infrastructure borrowings that succeed them to be made only by Australian resident taxpayers; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> any transfer of rights by a direct infrastructure borrowing lender or repayment of a direct infrastructure borrowing, to be accompanied by repayment or parallel transfer of any associated indirect infrastructure borrowing or refinancing infrastructure borrowing that has succeeded the indirect infrastructure borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments, which will have effect from 30 October 1995, will not prevent infrastructure borrowings from operating in the way intended by the Government to encourage the genuine private sector development of publicly accessible infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments have the potential to prevent a future loss to the revenue. The amount of potential revenue loss is not quantifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research and development activities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 to give effect to policy changes announced by the Government on 23 July and 20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concessional deduction rate for R&amp;D expenditure is being reduced from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and new syndicates are prevented from claiming R&amp;D deductions. The R&amp;D deduction rules for interest, core technology, pilot plant and feedstock are also being modified. The definition of R&amp;D activities is being clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax concession for eligible R&amp;D nevertheless remains generous. It allows immediate deduction or rapid write&hyphen;off of expenditures which may otherwise be capital or deductible over longer periods. Even the reduced premium rate of deduction provides a considerable degree of concessionality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 to remove the ability of companies to register jointly for the R&amp;D tax concession, or as it is more commonly known, to register a syndicate. Joint registration has facilitated arrangements that provide considerably greater tax benefits than the benefits provided to other registrants under the R&amp;D tax concession. This level of tax benefit was clearly unintended. The Government considers that quality R&amp;D can be promoted effectively through other mechanisms, including the new START program, at lower cost to the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other minor amendments to the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 include the streamlining <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of grant provisions to make them more clear, and the introduction of a mechanism by which the Minister can provide formal advice to the Industry Research and Development Board and its committees in an open and transparent manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will result in a gain to revenue of $59 million in 1996&hyphen;97, $718 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $630 million in 1998&hyphen;99, and $840 million in 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax exempt entities that become taxable</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to amend the income tax law to deal with transition issues that arise when previously tax exempt entities become taxable. The measures were announced by the previous Government on 3 July 1995 and apply to entities becoming taxable on or after that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will generally allocate income, gains, losses and deductions of an entity between its exempt and taxable periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments minimise compliance costs for entities that are becoming taxable. Deductions for post transition costs in respect of pre&hyphen;transition leave, eligible termination payments, bad debts and superannuation are to be determined by reference to liabilities accumulated at the date of transition rather than by reference to the particular cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are expected to be revenue neutral.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rebatable annuities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill closes a loophole in the law that allowed the conversion of non&hyphen;rebatable annuities to rebatable annuities and pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the tax law in 1994 to allow the unused undeducted purchase price of a commuted superannuation pension or roll&hyphen;over annuity to be further rolled&hyphen;over had the unintended consequence of allowing amounts received on commutation or termination of annuities purchased with money outside the superannuation system to be treated as eligible termination payments (ETPs).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These ETPs could then be rolled&hyphen;over into the superannuation system to purchase rebatable annuities and pensions. This rebate is intended to apply only to superannuation pensions and roll&hyphen;over annuities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annuities that have not been purchased with amounts accumulated within the superannuation system should not be eligible for concessional taxation treatment that has been earmarked for genuine superannuation amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that, subject to exceptions designed to maintain the current treatment of some annuities purchased on or before 9 December 1987, only annuities purchased wholly from ETP monies are treated as ETPs on commutation or termination <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5916"> and can be rolled&hyphen;over to purchase rebatable annuities and pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure will apply to annuities commuted or terminated on or after 15 June 1996. It is not expected to raise any additional revenue. However failure to act to close the loophole would have posed a potentially significant threat to the revenue.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is the first of three in the legislation package for the implementation of a cost recovery regime for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service, which was announced by the Government in the 1996-97 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 3 bills in this legislation package provide the legislative authority for the imposition and collection of 13 charges and fees for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Service. The 13 imposts are located in 2 new charges bills, and this Customs Amendment Bill and will apply full cost recovery for commercial Customs activities directly and indirectly required to process imports. This measure is consistent with the general thrust of Government policy which increasingly sees the closer alignment of service delivery costs with sectors of the community which generate the workload.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, the user pays system is already used in relation to the recovery of costs of processing passengers at international airports, through the Passenger Movement Charge. Similarly, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service introduced cost recovery in the early 1990s for its work associated with the movement of international cargo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The services to be covered by the new charges in this legislative package are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the processing of cargo reports (both sea and air),</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">import entry processing (sea, air and post), and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">licensing of approved places for the examination of goods</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To coincide with this measure, Customs has taken also the opportunity to streamline elements of two existing fees. The first relates to refund of customs duty application fees and the second relates to administrative arrangements for the determination of costs associated with out of hours work by Customs officers or for work by Customs officers at locations where Customs' work is not usually performed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation package sees an extension of the current cost recovery regime for import related services. Customs currently recovers part of the cost of its electronic systems (amounting to approximately $18.5m in 1995-96) through charges levied on importers for import entries. The extension of the charging arrangements, however, relates only to commercial import processing. It does not cover activity associated with Customs' community protection function relating to the detection and interception of prohibited imports and drugs. The Government recognises Customs' important role in this area and has, in the Budget, provided funds to Customs to significantly increase the use of sophisticated technology to maintain and enhance its community protection capability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor will charges apply to the processing of export transactions. The exemption of exports from the new user pays system is a recognition of the key role export industries will play in improving Australia's trade balance, creating more jobs and reducing the Federal deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs has undertaken detailed activity based costing of its services to ensure that the costs <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5917"> recovered do not exceed the costs calculated to process import transactions. The cost model used in calculating the charges has been reviewed by two firms of external auditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The charges are limited to the calculated costs of delivering the functions, and will be reviewed annually to ensure that they only reflect the actual costs of service delivery. Any efficiencies identified in service delivery will be passed on through lower charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">103,000 importers generated around 2.2 million Customs import entries in 1995 containing 7.2 million entry lines. 98 per cent of these entries were lodged electronically with Customs. Based on the 1995 data, 95 per cent of entries have 10 lines or less and will incur the minimum charge. The new charges, for the majority of entries, will see the current electronic entry cost rise from $8.75 to $29.65 (sea) or $22.80 (air and post). The present charge of $8.75 only picks up some of the computer costs for entry processing and does not represent full cost recovery. Although the increase in entry costs are significant, in absolute terms, the additional costs-will be small for the majority of importers. For example, 65 per cent of importers make 4 or less entries per year and would incur a total cost increase of less than $85 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the Budget announcement, members of the Customs National Consultative Committee were briefed, at a special meeting, about the nature of the proposed charges. This Committee comprises representatives from the Australian Air Transport Association, the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the Australian Federation of International Forwarders, the Customs Brokers Council of Australia, the International Air Couriers Association, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Their feedback resulted in some changes being made to the charges for entry processing and the methods of collection. This Committee met again in September where the charges were once more the subject of discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Informal meetings have been held with various sectors of the importing community, such as the air express couriers, the cargo terminal operators, and the Australian International Movers Association in regard to establishing the most efficient collection methods for the charges. In meeting with a variety of industry sectors, Customs was made aware of some difficulties the collection of cargo reporting fees and screening fees would impose on cargo terminal operators and shipping companies, for manual reporting charges, and on air express couriers for screening charges. As a result, the legislation now provides that special arrangements may be entered into for the collection of these charges, including periodic settlement arrangements to coincide with the operating environment and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billing cycles experienced by many of the firms in the importing community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to meetings called at the behest of industry, Customs has conducted a series of industry briefing sessions in all State and Territory capital cities and in several regional centres. These sessions have provided an opportunity for Customs to explain details about the charges and how they will be collected. At the same time, the sessions have provided a valuable forum for feedback from all sectors of the importing community, much of which has influenced implementation decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three bills which comprise this legislation package will provide the legislative authority for the imposition and collection of the 13 charges and fees for the import related services delivered by Customs to which I have referred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, this bill contains: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the fees relating to the processing of those entries which are required to move imported goods out of a warehouse and into home consumption;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the replacement fees currently contained in the Customs Act for the processing of applications for refund of customs duty and for the provision of officers' services either out of hours, or at locations where such services are not usually provided;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains 7 of the charges dealing with the import entry and cargo reporting regimes in the Customs Act 1901. Different charges will apply for electronic and manually lodged entries and for entries relating to sea cargo and air cargo (including post).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains charges associated with the new depot licensing regime for Customs depots which are appointed for the examination of goods subject to Customs control, or for the consolidation of goods for export, or for the deconsolidation of goods after importation. While these depots are currently appointed, no licensing regime exists. Corresponding changes to the Customs Act 1901, which are contained in the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, the first bill of this package, will establish the licensing requirements for these premises and their operators. Given that these places are an extension of the wharfs and airports and hold cargo which is still under Customs control, the new licensing arrangements will help to ensure that the control of cargo prior to Customs release is acceptable and in keeping with the intent of the Customs Act in regard to control and release of cargo.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill gives effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth and Victoria whereby the Commonwealth will pay Victoria an amount of money no greater than the windfall tax revenue that will accrue to the Commonwealth as a result of the settlement of a dispute over the passing on of the PRRT between Victoria and Esso&hyphen;BHP. This agreement resolves a long running dispute between the Victorian government and Esso&hyphen;BHP as to whether the producers could pass the effect of the PRRT on to consumers based upon agreements executed during the 1960s between the producers and the state of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will enable the Commonwealth to pay Victoria $555 million, representing a windfall tax gain accruing to the Commonwealth that they would not otherwise have received except for the settlement of this dispute. Victoria will, in turn, make a lump sum payment to Esso&hyphen;BHP, and Esso&hyphen;BHP will remit the Commonwealth tax on this payment. The overall impact on Commonwealth finances will be a $70 million contribution to the budget bottom line in 1996-97. As I seem to recall&mdash;and Senator Kemp might refresh my memory when he speaks&mdash;this is not in the forward estimates for the government's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on this occasion we are particularly happy to support an additional windfall to the government of $70 million. We are prepared to assist the government on a speedy passage of the bill. It enables settlement of a long running dispute over the impact of PRRT between Esso&hyphen;BHP and Victorian gas utilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When PRRT was introduced in 1990, it replaced the existing excise and royalty regime. The introduction of the regime saw a dispute emerge over the meaning of certain clauses in long-term contracts which had existed between the producers and Victorian gas utilities. The argument centred on who had to bear the cost of the liability for the difference between the old royalty regime and the new PRRT and whether it could be passed on to consumers or whether the producers had to absorb it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement will see the Victorian government pay, on behalf of the utilities, a sum of around $1 billion to the producers to cover both past and future PRRT liability. This amount represents a third of the original claim of $3 billion, and the settlement represents the commercial judgment of both sides as to the risk of what the final outcome would be and who would win and who would lose. This settlement allows a win-win situation for all parties concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The settlement of the dispute also allows for the gas reform process to advance and for the liberalisation of the Victorian gas market. The settlement will see the Victoria gas corporation monopoly over gas distribution rights removed, and that can only be of benefit to gas consumers. Given the $70 million windfall gain to the government, the government could consider using this money to continue the funding of government programs it has cut. I hope you are enthusiastically taking that last comment of mine on board, Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want that $70 million to be used to fund government programs that have been cut. For example, my own state is suffering because of your draconian cuts to the Commonwealth dental program. It is not just my own state but many hundreds of thousands of Australians that are suffering as a result of the cut to that program. In respect of this windfall government revenue that is not in the forward estimates as I understand, the government could certainly do something productive by way of assisting persons who have suffered as a consequence of that vicious cut to the Commonwealth dental health program. I do not want to detain the Senate any longer, so I conclude by saying that we support the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For five years since the petroleum resource rent tax has been in place, the Victorian government has refused to pay Esso&hyphen;BHP higher charges for gas because of a contractual statement that tax would not be passed on to the customer&mdash;in this case, Gas Corp. Companies argue that the price and agreement were based on existing taxes, not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5920"> new taxes unknown when the contract was written.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The courts have finally decided that the companies were right and Victoria would have to pay. This has resulted in increased income as a lump sum payment of about a billion dollars to the companies and an increase of tax liabilities by the company of about $620 million. Of that, the Commonwealth has agreed to pay $550 million back to Victoria. Rather than leave anyone in deep trouble waiting for a cheque and hearing the famous `It's in the mail, don't worry', a cheque trading meeting has been arranged for Friday; hence the urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the company is also making a windfall profit&mdash;either that or in some sense they have been seen as having been able to recoup a share of their profit that has been lost. If they are making a windfall profit, then tax on that is duly owing, not a windfall. If it is recouping profit lost, then the Commonwealth is recouping tax lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a fundamental issue of why the Commonwealth should not have been receiving this tax and why it is not theirs by right. I can understand that it would be difficult for Victoria to suddenly lose a billion dollars. I understand that this full tax will be paid in future. Perhaps the minister can let me know whether that is correct. If not, what is the situation? What will be the ongoing impact on Victorian finances and the cost of gas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be argued that states do not pay Commonwealth taxes, but this situation is that of a state government business enterprise which is involved in commercial sales, including to commercial industry. State tax exemption would mean all such consumers, including commercial enterprises which use gas, receive tax exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other issues here in relation to both the environment and competition. With the resolution of the tax issue, it is becoming necessary to renegotiate the contract. This renegotiation includes competitive measures designed to avoid competition policy laws soon to come into force. One aspect of this renegotiation was to remove contractual restrictions on building private sector pipelines. A concern was that competitive equity <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> may be used to allow private sector companies exemption from environmental or local planning regulations. I would like the minister to let us know if he will give an undertaking that no exemption from current Commonwealth laws or regulations and no reduction in stringency will be available to private sector gas companies for gas pipelines. Of course, this is what was flagged by Senator Brown earlier on when we dealt with the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is that while contractual barriers to building pipelines, and for sale to end consumers, are being lifted, there remain legal barriers within Victoria. The Victorian Treasury states that issues like industry regulation, community service obligations and public interest requirements would be looked at `when the legal framework is changed'. While access to reticulated gas pipelines is on a unit basis, access to high pressure transmission pipelines is by distance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increased costs mean that there is a competitive disincentive to provide services to those who live in more sparsely populated areas, especially when those areas are at a distance from major urban centres. In fact, this happens now under GASCOR, a government business enterprise which has those commercial pressures to a certain extent. The implication of this, coupled with a standardised unit price, is that more remote users and rural users will not get access to gas or will only get it if there is a shift to user pays, unless there is a universal service obligation modelled on that under the Telecommunications Act where all service providers pay a proportional part of cross&hyphen;subsidies and where provision of services is an obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One implication of cross&hyphen;subsidies is anti&hyphen;environmental. Extension of reticulated gas or electricity to remote users may be a worse option than provision of stand&hyphen;alone renewable power systems from an economic as well as an environmental point of view. A universal service obligation under competition policy should be amenable to obliging companies to offer cheaper, more environmentally benign alternative technologies or conservation measures. It is therefore on this basis that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5921"> I am moving a second reading amendment. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add: "but the Senate, expresses concern that the nature of the agreement between the State of Victoria, Esso and BHP:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> has failed to establish any community service obligations in the process of opening the gas industry to private&hyphen;sector competition;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> in opening the gas industry to competition, has failed to provide a legislative and regulatory environment which will protect consumers, residents, public interest and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that there is a lot of concern within the wider community in relation to the implications and the implementation of competition policy. Quite frankly, it is a mess. We always said it would be, and it is. Those levels of concern within the community have not abated; they are in fact increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement between GASCOR, Esso and BHP is contractual and it is hailed as opening the way for competition. Yet we do not hear of any environmental considerations. There is no new regulation in this industry and we hear of no public interest requirement or community service obligations. There are issues whenever we move from a framework where a service is provided by government to one provided, even in part, by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government is assumed to act in the common good and to integrate all its functions into decision making. Let's face it: that is what government accountability is all about. This includes social welfare and protection of the environment. Government can be held accountable for its decisions on the basis of all its duties, not just profit making for its shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private industry has no such requirements. To fail to exploit is usually to miss a competitive advantage. When a corporatised government business enterprise competes with the private sector, it either completes ruthlessly or it loses competitive advantage. For this reason, when a service moves from the public sector to the private it is necessary to regulate explicitly. We have seen no evident desire by this government to do that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary to enforce regulations. It is not competitive if they are not enforced and other industries become disadvantaged. Failure to do this creates an inexorable pressure to ignore regulations or considerations of social and environmental impact. Those who retain a conscience are competitive losers in an amoral environment where nice people finish last. Under competition policy it is important to include regulations, obligations and agreements in major contracts with government opening a market. When these kinds of issues have been mentioned before, it has often been said, `Oh, but you can include that in the tender.' Where is it? They are not simply commercial contracts, and their implications are larger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian contract agreement is such a case. At the time of passage of the Competition Policy Reform Act there was a press release saying that states would have to submit their agenda for implementing competition policy, including exemptions, public interest considerations and community service obligations. Yet we still have little more than a vague public interest test in the competition act itself. It is circular: public interest equals competition policy equals public interest. It is not good enough. Here we are making major decisions and it is still not there. Therefore, I urge support for my second reading amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Margaret Blakers from your office sought an explanation of the implications of the RRT settlement on the approval process, in particular the environmental approval process, for pipeline development, including the proposed Eastern Gas Pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the one through East Gippsland. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, we were asked whether the settlement arrangements, including the new contractual arrangements between Gascor and ESSO/BHP had any implications for the environmental approval process for the Eastern Gas Pipeline or other pipelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no implications of the sort referred to above.</PARA>
<PARA>It states further that this restriction is referring to restrictions `on ESSO or BHP which prevent them from building pipelines in certain areas of Victoria', it being a change in `contract between Gascor and ESSO/BHP which restricts ESSO/BHP's ability to build pipelines as a contractual matter'. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This restriction has now been removed, but there are no implications for environmental approval processes.</PARA>
<PARA>That might be reassuring on the face of it. However, we are dealing with Premier Kennett's Victoria, in which&mdash;as in Tasmania, which is now facing a fast&hyphen;track approval of a pulp mill financed wholly or in part from Taiwan&mdash;the reality is that these days all environmental considerations can be swept aside by the stroke of a ministerial pen. That is Victoria 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community can feed what it likes into a process of approval for major or minor enterprises, including pipelines. Those enterprises can be shown to be environmentally and even socially damaging. But, if it so takes the minister of the day, then he&mdash;in this case it is a male in Victoria&mdash;simply signs an exemption for the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have an assurance that this legislation does not intervene with the environmental approval process in Victoria. But, as I say, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the end of the day that does not mean anything in Victoria because that approval process can be swept aside and ignored totally in the interests of developers if they get to the minister and, over a business lunch, convince him that it is in their financial interests to ignore environmental considerations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As others have said, the Payment of Tax Receipts (Victoria) Bill arises out of a complex settlement of a long&hyphen;running dispute between the Victorian government and Victorian gas utilities and their gas suppliers. We know that the dispute itself centred on the desire of the producers to pass on to the utilities the cost of paying the Commonwealth's petroleum resource rent tax. We know that part of the complex settlement involves payment of more than $1 billion by the Victorian government to the producers to resolve the dispute. We know that the payment will result in a windfall tax to the Commonwealth of about $625 million. We know that the Commonwealth has agreed to ensure that, of that, only $70 million&mdash;that being the tax on amounts previously unpaid by the gas utilities&mdash;will be paid and the rest will be refunded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have heard some interesting points raised on what people might have seen was a little cough&hyphen;through bill. The Australian Democrats will support the bill.

We have them all pitted against each other in the name of the holy grail of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying that, the Democrats will also support Senator Margetts's second reading amendment because it is important to keep noting that competition policy in the Victorian gas industry, which this bill, this settlement, will facilitate, does not guarantee that any benefits will ultimately flow on to the consumers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to put on the record the opposition's position in respect of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. Our initial approach in assessing this legislation has been that the government must be held to its word. During the election and since, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, `All we have done is extend Labor's six&hyphen;month waiting period to two years.' Our position is that, if you do not have to wait six months for a payment at the moment, you should not have to wait two years for a payment after the bill is dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also maintain that the waiting period of two years should not apply retrospectively. We also maintain that those who are currently exempt from serving a six&hyphen;month waiting period should continue to be exempt. We believe that refugees, humanitarian migrants, their families, Australian citizens and their families must be protected. We also believe that this legislation should not act in a discriminatory way and should not override the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For us, this legislation is regressive. It is intended to dismantle the underpinning of a very successful migration program. Its effect will be to erode the success of that program. It was just the other day that these comments appeared across our national newspapers:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This city has people who traced their origins to more than 140 different nations . . . Australia has a higher percentage of immigrants who came here and built decent lives and strengthened your country through hard work than almost any other country on Earth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Think about how every day in every way when you bring in people who are those, like me, who trace their roots to England or Ireland or Scotland, to various Asian countries or South Asia or Latin America or the Middle East, every day you do that when the world is looking at you, you offer a rebuke to all those who would take away the lives and the futures and the fortunes of the children of this world, because they are different from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I cannot think of a better place in the entire world, a more shining example of how people can come together as one nation and one community than Sydney, Australia. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5926"> </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to thank President Bill Clinton for those observations because they do go to the success of what we have done in this country, to the success of our migration program. In making those comments, President Clinton goes to four major points, which are worth putting on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">President Clinton makes it very clear&mdash;he has brought home the international awareness that our single greatest achievement as a nation has been how we have developed by taking and absorbing into our community some five million migrants over five years. He has sought to educate us about ourselves, and I think in a very striking way has done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has made us dramatically aware that the world knows what is happening in Australia. He has put it on the front pages both here and overseas. He has highlighted the extent of our diversity. He has emphasised that it is not easy to do what we have been doing. He has emphasised that we have done something special. He has also emphasised that we have a particularly different and special approach&mdash;and I would maintain very strongly that this is through our settlement programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, in saying that I think the President of the United States has sadly shamed the Australian Prime Minister&mdash;the man who cannot find it within himself to use the word `multiculturalism', the man who does not understand the importance of our diversity, the man who does not stand up for multiculturalism and indeed rejects it as more and more evidence shows, the man who does not attack the racists and the bigots in our society, and the man who has advocated racial discriminatory policies. Sadly, I think President Clinton has shown by his example that this government and this Prime Minister do not care about settlement policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing President Clinton has done has been to expose the boring and insensitive nature of our administration. Standing within two yards of the dispatch box in the House of Representatives last week, I was embarrassed as an Australian member of parliament to see that, while the whole of that chamber&mdash;downstairs and up in the public gallery&mdash;applauded the President of the United States <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a number of times, our Prime Minister did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly concerned that, when the President of the United States mentioned the issue of race in the House of Representatives, Tim Fischer, Alexander Downer and everyone else on that side of the parliament applauded him except two people&mdash;our Prime Minister, John Howard, and Ms Pauline Hanson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it really reflects on this Prime Minister, the person who has as his responsibility engaging this country with the rest of the world, that he stood there in stark isolation in his own parliament. I think what the President of the United States did last week was to very starkly highlight the difference between the leader of the United States and the person who claims to be the leader in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">President Clinton would not have read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to know why John Howard was not applauding him. He would not have understood the niceties that the Prime Minister wanted to stick to. All he could see from his position was that the person in closest contact to him was the one person in the parliament who was not applauding him on the issue of race and on other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also particularly embarrassed to see, for the first time in a number of years, at an official function for a visiting head of state, that there was no reflection in the performances of the day of, for instance, our multicultural society, particularly the people of Aboriginal descent. The President quite pointedly referred to the talents of Aboriginal Australians the next day when he not only went shopping for some of their craft work but also referred to Aboriginal entertainment as part of the vital contribution Australians are making to the world scene. The other thing the President of the United States did last week was make it very clear at one critical point when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want you to know the world is looking to you, and I want you to know that America will keep looking to you.</PARA>
<PARA>In this global environment, you cannot hide and you cannot run. What you do within your own society is something that very quickly gets currency throughout the rest of the world. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5927"> President Clinton, I think, showed that we are doing something especially important. The opposition would maintain that there are dividends, both socially and economically, in how we handle not just migration but also migrants when they come here. There are huge benefits if we get it right and there are losses socially and economically if we get it wrong. It does not just happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What President Clinton was alluding to last week does not just happen by the wave of a magic wand or whatever. Getting people into a country is one thing. How they fit into that country and what infrastructure and support they get from their own families, from their direct communities and from the broader community is the most critical part. What this legislation is about is dismantling that very important social policy infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference between us and other migration countries is that we do have a settlement policy. It is based on inclusiveness. It is based on social justice. It is not just words; it is also programs. This is the bill that tries to dismantle so much of that social infrastructure, and it does so with blind disregard for the consequences. You do not expect this Prime Minister to understand the implications on migrant families, because he has shown a disregard for their plight. But what you see here is legislation without the preceding policy review, without any assessment of the impact of the legislation on individuals, on families and on the broader community, without any recognition of the role or the need for some of these programs of support that this legislation tries to dismantle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is the work of serial wreckers because it is not preceded by any policy review; it is merely preceded by public opinion polls. The only research available to the government on the impact of this legislation is not on how it will affect our society. The only research available to them is the research they get from their public opinion polls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migrants have been marginalised under this government. They are being used as a political football. The problem with that is that, though it might resonate in some parts of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community, we are playing politics with the cohesiveness of our society. We are introducing legislation driven more by prejudice than policy review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, social justice is the critical distinction between us and other countries with migration. We have always worked on the basis of a couple of simple principles. We invest in migrants when they come here, and they do pay back. In the immediate sense, they pay back through indirect taxes and direct taxes. They contribute to society. In another sense, what we are doing is providing a springboard for them and their families&mdash;a springboard which ensures that they do not fall into the underclass nature of society but have a chance to establish themselves and their families in a new environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere is this better shown that in Australia's Vietnamese community, having come here as refugees some short 20 years ago. Okay, they have got problems, and problems in terms of accessing jobs, but they are the community which already achieves high retention rates at schools and high participation in the workplace. They are the community which is already in the business of exporting and trading with overseas countries, particularly the country from which a lot of them have come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Respect for family is also critical. One concern we have about this legislation is that it does not adequately ensure the capacity of families to reunite on the basis of the experience of a successful family migration program. This legislation makes it much more difficult for families to unite because it places in front of people that hurdle of the need for extra resources for families to come together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is, to the opposition, a wholesale attack on the social infrastructure. It is a pernicious one as well. At the same time as having this legislation, we get concern expressed to us by the government that they want debate. If they wanted debate, they would not have done away with the office of multicultural research and effectively abolished it. They would not have effectively abolished the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research and so on.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5928">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation has met with comment from quite a number of people in the community. One person I do not often quote but whom I would now like to quote is Bob Birrell. In his advice to the Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs he said that, through this legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition Government is in effect saying that it washes its hands of responsibility for their welfare, unless they fall into the Humanitarian category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is to advance down the American road, that is, to allow continued migration but without a commitment to help the migrants in question become secure and productive citizens.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Bob Birrell is, and I think has been for some time now, a strong supporter of the government, but I think he has got it dead right here. What this legislation does, paraphrasing Bob Birrell, is take away the difference between Australia and other migration countries. We feel it is racially discriminate. It is not just the opposition who says that. It was also the concern of the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Zita Antonios, in her evidence to the committee&mdash;evidence which the Attorney-General's Department sought to rebut but at the same time acknowledging that there was some force in Ms Antonios's argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We feel this legislation breaches some of Australia's international obligations. The International Bill of Human Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention on the Rights of the Child all have principles that ensure that one has, for instance, a right to social security, that children have a right to their best interests being taken into consideration, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, I think it is worth noting the evidence of Mr Stephen Langman, solicitor with the National Welfare Rights Network, who explained:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view, these provisions are certainly going to create suffering amongst children. For families with nothing to live on but the basic rate of family payment, which we think is going to happen, there is no doubt that children will suffer as a result. Even if the family is given the special benefit, the new provisions do not apply the same tests for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> giving additional family payments to those families. So those families will be living on special benefit, which is limited under the act to the amount of a jobsearch allowance and $22.70 per child by itself.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only do we have those certain concerns; we have concerns about retrospectivity. We also have particular concerns about how this legislation has been implemented across the country, sporadically I must concede, before it has even come into effect. All these concerns build that basic picture in our minds that this legislation is all about bad policy, policy by prejudice and policy which, in effect, will undermine much of what has been done as part of a successful settlement policy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the start, we are taking an approach to this legislation which tries to hold the government to its word. We in government imposed a six&hyphen;month waiting period in respect of some payments. I accept now, as I did before, that there is some concern about that six&hyphen;month waiting period. We maintained then that six months was a good balance. We also maintained then and we maintain now that two years is not a good balance; it is a poverty trap that migrants and this society can least afford. When the government said that all it would do would be to extend our six&hyphen;month waiting period to two years, we said that if you do not have to wait for six months at the moment then you should not have to wait two years for payments after the bill is dealt with.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, there is a major difference between six months and two years. If you do not understand that then you are not fit to be in this place. Six months is a reasonable period but you are talking about two years now. You are talking about a wide raft of benefits and you are talking about a pernicious undermining of migration and settlement programs in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have come in and pressed every trigger to try to divide this society in respect of migration. You have a Prime Minister who refuses to stand up to racism bigots and wants to kick this political football for all it is worth and does so. You have someone who is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5929"> against multiculturalism on the record as such. You have someone who refuses to even acknowledge the word and someone who does not respect and recognise the real cultural diversity in this country. You do not come into this debate with clean hands, Senator  Tambling,  and  that  is  what  you  should recognise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are the ones who, consistently over a period of time, put together not just the social infrastructure but a racially non&hyphen;discriminate program&mdash;a program that took in the needs of families. In doing so we also respected and recognised the importance of a family in terms of migration. We also recognised the importance of one family feeling as though it had sufficient rights, equal rights, with another family in terms of sponsoring their families into Australia. This is where this legislation has a pernicious effect. It will be much harder for those from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds across the world in so many different circumstances to be able to sponsor their relatives, because of the combined impact of this legislation and some of the regulations that you have tried to bring into play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some changes that the government has picked up as a consequence of the deliberations of the Senate committee that we accept but there are some government amendments that we deplore&mdash;amendments, for instance, which extend the two&hyphen;year waiting period to yet another class of visa holders, the 826 visa holders. We especially deplore the introduction of a new schedule to the bill which, for the avoidance of doubts, ensures that the waiting period applies retrospectively to former jobsearch allowees now that the jobsearch allowance has been stopped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned that the government is signalling and has signalled in the recent budget that a two&hyphen;year waiting period will apply also to Austudy and to what is left of labour market programs. We are also concerned that we have received legislation out of left field, I must say, in the last few weeks which would apply the two&hyphen;year waiting period to the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. This is not legislation which is in the best interests of Australia. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is legislation, as I said, driven by prejudice and driven by a Prime Minister who knows nothing but prejudice, a Prime Minister who refuses to acknowledge the massive contribution that non&hyphen;English speaking Australians have made to this country, and continue to make, and respect for their diversity in the process. We are concerned, as I said at the start, that the infrastructure that has been quite critical to our successful migration program is in fact being undermined by this legislation. It is no small thing. I will close on this particular point because it is the most critical point in terms of policy in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do it better. We are recognised internationally as doing it better because we are prepared to put the investment in those first couple of years. That investment has paid off for Australia. Migration policy does not cause ghettos; it is social and economic policy that cause ghettos. If you do not want to divide this country then you should not be bringing in legislation which takes away that basic safety net, the springboard, that families need when they migrate&mdash;when they take the huge step of migrating from one country to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a difference between us and the rest of the world. Professor Birrell made it very clear in his submission that this legislation takes us down the wrong road. For that reason, the opposition will oppose a number of the government's amendments but also move our own.</PARA></SPEECH>

I think by now the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of both <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5930"> chambers of this parliament are beginning to overflow with statements abhorring racial intolerance or the issue of race discrimination. But, yet again, the Australian Democrats are compelled to stand up in this place to voice our concerns about government legislation which conflicts dramatically with the statements that have been made in this place and in the other house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 seeks to increase from 26 weeks to 104 weeks the period during which migrants will be ineligible to claim certain benefits&mdash;that is from six months to two years. This legislation is, as Senator Bolkus has said, retrospective in many regards dating back to 1 April 1996. Some of the benefits that would be affected&mdash;that is, prior to the amendments being tabled by the government today&mdash;include the carers pension, disability wage supplement, widow allowance, sickness allowance, newstart, special benefit, partner allowance, maternity allowance, parenting allowance, child disability allowance, double orphan pension, mobility allowance and youth training allowance. It does not take too studied a view of these aspects of the legislation to realise that many of the people who are affected by this legislation are, of course, women, young people and traditionally disadvantaged people in our community. For that reason, the Democrats will be opposing this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is mean&hyphen;spirited and motivated by revenue considerations rather than considerations of fairness and social equality. In fact, we find it shameful in its disregard for the most socially disempowered and economically disadvantaged people in this nation. It is a discriminatory piece of legislation. This government is seeking to further its objective of stratifying permanent residence below that of citizens. This is a debate that we had two weeks ago with the disallowance of certain regulations. We saw a recent example of this when Minister Ruddock attempted to alter the sponsorship eligibility in the concessional family category so that only citizens would be able to reunite with their loved ones. Those regulations, and now this legislation, coupled <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the soon to be debated Immigration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), bring into question the government's protestations about racism in this country. On 30 October this parliament passed a joint statement on racial tolerance. At page 6065 the statement read by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stipulated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly non&hyphen;discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word `origin'. If those words are to have any meaning in this place, then when the parliament and, indeed, the Prime Minister repudiate discrimination on the grounds of someone's origin, this undeniably must apply to migrants as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When legislation such as this appears before the Senate, it shows that the government has mouthed the words, but clearly there is very little substance to what they have said. So that the Senate is absolutely clear on what is meant by racial discrimination, I would like to repeat the statements that I made two weeks ago in the earlier debate over statutory rule 211:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will appreciate that in the recent political climate, it is absolutely essential that not only are the government's policies non&hyphen; discriminatory, but there must be a reasonable perception&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that they are so. It is an issue of national and moral leadership, as Senator Bolkus was saying. I continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard and in light of Australia's less than proud history&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in regard to the White Australia Policy, remembering that was a policy that was in place until 1972&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is a strict onus upon all Australian governments to ensure that beyond a doubt, our immigration&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and in the context of this legislation, social security legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is non&hyphen;discriminatory. The government have fallen way short in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to clarify again what the Australian Democrats mean by `non&hyphen;discriminatory' because an apparent ambiguity as to what it actually means seems to continue. Again, I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5931"> quote the Racial Discrimination Act which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That any enactment involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life is discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 10 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, by reason of, or of a provision of, a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin do not enjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, or enjoy a right to a more limited extent than persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, then, notwithstanding anything in that law, persons of the first&hyphen;mentioned race, colour or national or ethnic origin shall, by force of this section, enjoy that right to the same extent as persons of that other race, colour or national or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the words of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Clearly section 10 of this act makes it clear that national or ethnic origin are part of the attributes which constitute racial discrimination and this bill does construct a distinction based upon national or ethnic origin, in the provisions of who is eligible for nominated social security benefits. To distinguish between citizens and permanent residents in this way is, we believe, in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What distinguishes this debate from that concerning statutory rule 211 is that this legislation is designed to impact upon people after they have already migrated to this country. With the recent increases to application fees and the large sums of money that are required for some categories of migrants to provide assurances of support, including the English language charge&mdash;now in the vicinity, I believe, of around $12,000 for some visa classes&mdash;this legislation is merely the icing on an economic rationalist cake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with some disdain in the last debate comments by the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone, and Senator Bill O'Chee, who is present today, regarding the Australian Democrats. I wish to put on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> record the peculiarities of Senator Vanstone's remarks. I say peculiar because, despite the fact that every non-government senator voted to disallow these regulations, it was on the grounds of an alleged inconsistency with our policies&mdash;that is, the Democrat policies&mdash;that Senator Vanstone and Minister Ruddock chose to attack the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From our side of the chamber, we find the arguments presented by the government in this regard to be quite curious. Was the government in that debate actually alleging that they were supporting a Democrat policy? As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show, the government chose to selectively extract out of context a portion of the policy of the Australian Democrats and then had the gall to suggest that we were not pursuing it. If the minister is so keen to pursue Democrat policies, she should understand that our policy on immigration is fundamentally tied to a paramount regard for the environment. As a logical extension of that position, a sensible and reasonable approach to population management is inextricably linked to that discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that the Australian Democrats will be opposing this bill because of its specific effects on women and its other discriminatory features&mdash;certainly, its dubious consistency when held up in light of the Racial Discrimination Act. We will be supporting the ALP amendment that inserts a provision into this bill stipulating that nothing in this legislation is to be taken as being inconsistent, either expressly or implied, with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I note, with particular disappointment, the ALP's backsliding on this bill. I think they have perhaps flogged the mandate argument a little too much. Is this not a litmus test for this government? If indeed it is the government's policy to abhor race discrimination, then such a provision&mdash;as the ALP amendment&mdash;serves to remove, beyond any reasonable doubt, any doubt about such an assertion. I hope the government will also support the amendment moved by the opposition. It simply requires the coalition government to affirm its principle in legislation&mdash;that is, the principle of non-discrimination in legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5932">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask: what message are we sending to the community and those people who will join us here from overseas when we say to them that in Australia all persons within our jurisdiction are required to comply with obligations? The corollary of that is, of course, that in a liberal democracy people have a legitimate and democratic expectation that they will enjoy the benefits of this country as a consequence of meeting their obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seeing this government is seeking to remove access to social security payments by newly arrived migrants, the question must therefore be asked of the government as to whether or not they are prepared to give an equivalent tax exemption proportional to those benefits that newly arrived migrants will now be disqualified from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have before us a litmus test for what is a reflection of the social conscience of this government. Australia's system of social security&mdash;and I stress the term `social security'&mdash;has a number of distinctive features. Until this proposal, social security payments were available to Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand residents. I would like to quote from the majority report on this bill of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Page 4 of the report states that social security payments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . function as income support or supplementation. An important feature of Australia's social security system is that threshold eligibility is based on whether the person is a permanent resident at the time that the benefit is claimed. The aged pension is the main exception to the rule that threshold eligibility is triggered by permanent residence. The aged pension requires ten years of permanent residence for threshold eligibility. Citizenship plays no part in Australia's social security system except in relation to eligibility criteria, and applicants will need to comply with these.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another distinguishing feature of Australia's social security system is that it is non-contributory. It is funded through general revenue and no direct contribution is demanded from an intending recipient. This is in contrast with a contributory system which requires individuals to contribute directly to fund, usually in conjunction with employment or as a feature of the taxation system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>apparently like our superannuation schemes. The report continues:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contributory systems, the level of benefit will usually relate to the level of contributions. Australia has a single tier formal social-welfare system where benefits are flat rate regardless of previous earnings and payable without prior contribution. This is quite exceptional internationally and Australia and New Zealand are the only two members of the 19 members of the OECD that do not have separate social security taxes. Australia's social security system seeks to provide a welfare safety net to persons who are unable to provide for themselves through other means. Accordingly, the benefits available seek to comprehensively cover all the main contingencies of life that may effect eligible persons.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought this would be something we would be very proud of. In short, what we talk about here is giving people in our society a fair go. But, most importantly, we are saying that there is a minimum standard of living to which we as a society will attempt to mediate people's living standards. It is a laudable principle for any nation to uphold. I think we should be screaming from the rooftops about this one, not seeking to cut it back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Disparities of wealth constitute one of the parameters for inequality and social division which neither progress nor enhance our national character or international standing. Yet again, this government is asking to draw a distinction between Australian citizens and our most recently arrived residents where previously none has existed. Apart from the right to vote, Australian permanent residents and Australian citizens have, for all intents and purposes, been afforded equality of treatment in our laws. The intention has been to foster a society which does not discriminate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the tremendous challenges that face the Australian community and the limitless potential we have not only as individuals but also as communities, does our Prime Minister really want to go down in history as the man who solved the Beazley black hole but to the detriment of social justice and human rights in this country? Mean spirited economic rationalism is not the stuff of inspirational leadership. Penny pinching from migrants and other disadvantaged groups in society may balance books but it bankrupts our national character. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5933">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the kind words of the President of the United States during his recent visit, to which Senator Bolkus referred. I thought the President's words were timely and appropriate. I noticed with some interest also on a program last week the comments by a former minister for immigration in the Whitlam government, Mr Al Grassby, who incidentally was briefed with dismantling, legislatively at least, the vileness of the White Australia policy. He said that while the policy had been removed, the attitudes which brought it about remained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a not unrelated topic, I wish to leave the Senate with the words of an indigenous Australian&mdash;an inspirational one&mdash;Mr Noel Pearson, who claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The popular, Anglo Celtic story of Australia's past was seriously distorted by significant omissions and by some straight out fictions, such as the fiction of `peaceful settlement'. . . It seems to me that the psychological unity of this country depends upon our taking responsibility for the future by dealing with the past. Anything less is simply an evasion of reality.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, there are aspects of racism alive and well in this country today. We have seen it manifestly through comments by individuals and by some organisations. Unfortunately, we are seeing aspects of it in legislation that has come before this parliament and is before this parliament today. It is for that reason that the Australian Democrats remain opposed to this legislation. We also oppose it because it will most unfairly impact upon women and other traditionally disadvantaged groups in our community. As well, it potentially breaching the standards that we hold so high in our Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens oppose the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and other Measures) Bill 1996. We do so because, above all, it is an indictment of the direction that Australia is going. It is pastel Pauline Hanson. It is discriminating between new arrivals and people who have been here for more than two years. It can all be put simply in the context of our international obligations. Here we are, Australia&mdash;the land of the free, the land of the fair go, the land that welcomes people from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whatever part of the world they might come&mdash;breaching in this legislation a series of international treaties. This is Australia breaching the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is the Howard government breaking the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This is our national government breaching the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In simple terms, if we support this bill&mdash;if the Senate gives the stamp of approval to it&mdash;we are endorsing the government breaking those international covenants because the measures in this legislation discriminate against permanent residents in Australia in that it deprives them for two years on arrival here from the social security benefits and advantages available to other permanent residents and to other citizens in this same country. Remember, we are talking about people who are coming here to stay in this country. We are talking about people for whom this country is home. We are talking through this legislation, if it is allowed to stand, about 8,000 to 10,000 people at any time in Australia who are penalised because they have just arrived here and are denied those benefits available to the other 18 million Australians if circumstances warrant it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is clearly discriminatory. As the two earlier speakers on this side of the Senate have said, it has very clear racial overtones because it falls into the easy lot of discriminating in particular against non-English speaking people in this country. It is a pretty sad piece of legislation to have before the national parliament but it fits the unsavoury direction&mdash;the unspeakable direction as far as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is concerned&mdash;that one member of the House of Representatives would have us go, whereby we not only stop people coming to this country until some unspecified time but for those people arriving in the country, we do not give them benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is the government going halfway to the Hanson dictum. Here is the government discriminating against people and creating a cop&hyphen;out for itself by rearranging immigration <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5934"> policy by disincentive. It is saying to people whom it does not want in this country, `Don't come here because we are not going to afford you the same benefits everybody else in Australia gets until after you have been here for 24 months. The most difficult period you will ever face in this country is the period when we are going to make it hardest for you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the backdoor way of cutting the number of immigrants coming to this country by the 12,000 or 14,000 that the government is preparing to cut this year. But it is also a backdoor way of saying to those who are going to find it hardest when they come to this country because their first language, for example, is not English, `We are going to make it particularly hard for you because the social security net is going to be pulled away from you.' It is immigration redesigned by stealth. It is something that this Senate should be opposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gather that the Labor Party is not going to oppose this legislation. I am pleased to hear that the Democrats will oppose this legislation. The Greens will be opposing this legislation because it is wrong legislation. It is not good enough to simply change the strictures on people arriving in this country which currently pertain. Whereas at present they wait six months before they get social security benefits, they will have to wait 24 months&mdash;which is what the ALP is supporting. That is drifting in the wrong direction as well, when we should be holding the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to Jo De Silva in my office for her work in contacting a number of groups concerned with social welfare, immigration and ethnic affairs in this country. There is widespread concern about this legislation. There is widespread concern throughout the community, which is interested in social justice&mdash;and isn't that a fair go?&mdash;that this legislation cuts right across that national ethos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will oppose the second reading of this bill. It should not get through this place. It should, like the regulations brought in here a couple of weeks ago, be stopped in its tracks. However, the numbers appear to be for it and it therefore comes down to juggling with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposed amendments&mdash;and there are a lot of them&mdash;to try to blunt the worst effects of this legislation for people coming to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, we will support those amendments which limit the range of people that this legislation cheats of rightful social security benefits as permanent residents in this country. For example, we will oppose the 104&hyphen;week&mdash;that is, two&hyphen;year&mdash;waiting period for spouses and partners of people who are already receiving social security benefits. It means that those couples are going to be living on half benefits in this country, as the one social security beneficiary will have to share her or his income with the partner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also support amendments to remove any reference to that narrow entitlement to special benefit&mdash;the bottom of the pit, where people who cannot get any other benefit at all are placed. The vote of the Greens on this legislation will be trying to draw some of its teeth. The legislation's mouth should not be open. Its bite should not be upon those people who have gained legitimate entry to this country. The government should be ashamed of bringing this legislation into parliament. But there it is. With Senator Stott Despoja, I appeal to the Labor Party to think again about giving this legislation passage. We should be voting against it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some months ago in this place, I spoke on similar legislation that was before parliament and pointed out that we are contravening a principle that is at least 3,000 years old. The Judaeo&hyphen;Christian ethic is very clear on the support which is called for from people who espouse that ethic, particularly in relation to refugees, to those who are strangers in our midst.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not very fluent in Hebrew but, if you want me to give it to you in Greek, I could perhaps do that. The text says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lord defends the rights of orphans and widows. He cares for foreigners and gives them food and clothing. And you should also care for them, because you were foreigners in Egypt.</PARA>
<PARA>This was an absolute paradigm for the Hebrew people because they themselves had been refugees and strangers in a foreign land. So they were called particularly to care for and give support to the strangers in their midst. We can trace the Old Testament of the Hebrew scriptures right through to the New Testament and find this principle espoused over and over again. Because I gave that whole interpretation last time at some length, I will not do it today. But I invite senators to go back and read my speech on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with the issue of refugees and migrants, or foreigners, if you like, as I said before, we are talking about an example that goes back to the absolute paradigmatic history of Israel. In being rescued from Egypt, this became a fundamental principle for them in their relationships with other people and other nations. When they are reminded that they should care for foreigners in their own land because they were foreigners in Egypt, what is touched on is a fundamental paradigm of their history, which is taken up, of course, in the New Testament and in the Christian ethic as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most fundamental parables of Jesus spoke about the importance of caring for people who are hungry, thirsty and who are strangers. In that parable, Jesus says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and you did not welcome me . . . Truly I tell you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.</PARA>
<PARA>Foreigners and strangers are regarded fundamentally as those whom Jesus would have us care for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in this legislation an attempt has been made to say to people, `Yes, you can come here, but make sure you don't get into any trouble because, if you do, we ain't going to help you; for two years you're on your own.' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I am afraid that if I were to be on my own for two years, I do not think I could survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go on. In an article taken from a Catholic magazine that was sent to me, we read words like this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Migration is, in fact, a central Christian metaphor. God is imaged as a free spirit wandering over the face of the earth . . . who visits Abraham as three itinerants . . . The Holy Family are refugees, fleeing to Egypt from Herod's `killing fields' . . . Jesus, rejected by his compatriots, moves from town to town and `has nowhere to rest his head' . . . Migrants can be to us, then, icons of Jesus and a stimulus to compassion out of love for him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scriptures are full of stories of migrants and refugees. Abraham is called to leave his homeland and go to a land he knows not; the people of Israel wander as nomads from place to place, settling in Egypt and then fleeing as refugees; and later their kingdom is invaded and they are carried into exile. Early Christian missionaries such as Paul were itinerants relying on the hospitality of those they visited. This migrant experience became a key metaphor for the life&hyphen;journey of every child of God in both the Old and New Testaments. Thus Christians are described as `aliens' even in their own land, as they focus on that other kingdom beyond . . . Thus a second century author described the Christians as `permanent migrants' and the Second Vatican Council as `a pilgrim people'.</PARA>

<PARA>Let me talk about some of the facts of the case. Let me talk about the harsh effect of the changes upon newly arrived refugees. From 3 July 1996 only Australian citizens can sponsor other family members to live in Australia. This will apply to all family, including spouses and dependent children, no matter what age. There will be no exceptions to this rule. Hence, it will apply to people who come to Australia under the refugee and humanitarian program and also to those who are recognised as refugees from within Australia. It takes a minimum of two years to become eligible to apply for Australian citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many refugees are separated from their spouses and children when fleeing persecution; their greatest wish after finding safety in Australia is to be reunited with them. However, under the new system they will not be able to sponsor for at least two years. The separation of families, especially parents from their children, in such traumatic circumstances is intolerable. This concern applies to all refugees, whether they have been granted refugee visas before or after arrival in Australia.</PARA>

He came to Australia as a refugee in April 1996. In his country he had been kept under house arrest prior to UNHCR negotiating his release and resettlement. When fleeing to Australia, he left behind his wife and six-year-old daughter. He had been assured by the Australian embassy that he would be able to sponsor his family to join him after he arrived in Australia. He must now wait over two years before seeing his wife and child again. Is the government ashamed of itself? It jolly well ought to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me read from the refugee and migrant services magazine of the National Council of Churches in Australia. This magazine, I might add, is the magazine of all the major churches in Australia&mdash;Roman Catholic, Orthodox, most of the Protestant churches, Quakers, et cetera. It says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5937">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Council of Churches in Australia is concerned that migrants who already speak English will be favoured in the new program.</PARA>
<PARA>So we are not simply talking about whether or not this is an overall policy; we are really talking about a policy which is quite discriminatory. There is already a lack of recognition of overseas qualifications. If this situation is compounded by the higher points of the English language, it will particularly disadvantage people from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. Even though the capacity to speak English does increase the economic viability of a migrant, the primary goal of the family reunion program should be to maintain family ties rather than focus specifically on improving Australia's labour pool. This particular appeal is an appeal to the government of course, but it is also an appeal to the Labor Party, who are very half&hyphen;hearted in the amendments that they are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Council of Churches in Australia is particularly troubled by the manner in which the new changes to the family reunion program and the overall size and composition of the migration program were announced. Information on the different aspects of the migration program and policy changes was not announced in a cohesive manner. This created confusion and anxiety in the wider community, which in turn encouraged racist remarks and xenophobic attitudes from anti&hyphen;migration and anti&hyphen;Asian lobby groups. Community groups would have appreciated being consulted before the changes were made. This would have given the government an opportunity to explain the rationale behind the changes, and it would have allowed input from the communities to be taken into account. But none of that from this government. It seems that successive governments take great pride in the multicultural nature of this country. Of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had to defend that very policy this week. But I am afraid his words will ring very hollow when this particular policy, if it is passed, is known in Asian countries. They will compare what he is saying with what his government is doing. They will see the vast difference between the two things.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again the government has failed to effectively  illustrate the positive aspects of immigration to the Australian public. The public needs to be aware of the reasoning behind Australia's migration program in order not to be confused over the issues. Public opinion, as shown by one recent public opinion poll, has been used by the government as justification for the new cutbacks. In other words, when the government wants to it is prepared to say that racism is not on its agenda and that multiculturalism is its policy. But, when it suits the government, the government is prepared to use racist public opinion as justification for its own policy. A misinformed public may send the wrong signals to its leaders, especially if attempts to clear up confusion over the issues have been unsuccessful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I am very disillusioned by this particular piece of legislation. It really does underline the fundamental failure of this government to understand anything about what it means to have social justice and equity and fairness in this country, particularly for those who are most vulnerable. I hope the government stands convicted by history when we look back and see what we have done to the people in our midst who, indeed, are the most vulnerable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 with a great deal of sadness&mdash;sadness about what the contents of the bill reflect and, more importantly, about what is happening in the wider community. I am referring, of course, to the debate on racism, which is a debate we should not be having. Australia should not be having this debate at the moment. If we had a strong Prime Minister in this country, I am sure we would not be having the debate that we are having.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speakers&mdash;particularly Senator Brown and Senator Woodley&mdash;referred to the debate. Senator Brown, in fact, named Ms Hanson, a member in the other place. I, as other senators have done, have disassociated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5938"> myself from the remarks that are attributed to that honourable member. Indeed, I condemn many of the remarks that she has made. I will not go so far here now as to condemn others who are not taking the same position as me in this matter&mdash;others with the responsibility to come out and condemn. But I hope that the message will filter through to the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that he is the political leader of this country and that he should exercise some leadership in this. That is a faint hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We&mdash;the Labor members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee&mdash;reflected on matters such as this in our minority report, which was presented to the parliament in September this year. In the opening comments of that minority report we drew attention to what had been a sustained attack on migrants to Australia and their families by this government in the short period of time that this government had been in office. We drew attention to the fact that the Office of Multicultural Affairs, which was formerly an integral part of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, had been effectively abolished. We noted that the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research had been abolished. Everybody&mdash;even those on the government side, I think&mdash;recognised the invaluable contribution that those bodies had made to the exercise of government policies and to the community as a whole with high quality research and policy advice on areas affecting new migrants. In our minority report we drew attention to the fact that services had been cut. We drew attention to the fact that resources under the SIP English language programs had been halved for 1996&hyphen;97 and were to be abolished next year. We drew attention to cutbacks in labour market programs. Charges to the adult migration education programs are proposed to increase by over 200 per cent. So what we have seen today is not something that is happening in isolation. It is, indeed, as our opening remarks drew attention to, a sustained attack on migrants and their families. What is really bad is that it is happening in an environment which was caused by comments by a member of the other place whose comments remain on the record. They have not been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> repudiated by the Prime Minister of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this place I have previously spoken about and drawn attention to many newspaper articles of condemnation of the Prime Minister for not taking a stronger line on the Hanson affair. I am not going to repeat them all here today, but I am going to draw attention to an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> just two days ago, on Saturday 23 November 1996, headed, `Letter comes back to haunt Howard'. I quote from the beginning of the article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's role in the debate over race and immigration is likely to flare again after a letter surfaced showing his strong support for policies of assimilation and integration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter, obtained by the Nine Network and aired last night, has Mr Howard writing to a constituent in May 1991 expressing his personal opposition to multiculturalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"My own view on this issue is that Australia made an error in abandoning its former policy of encouraging assimilation and integration in favour of multiculturalism," Mr Howard wrote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I do not mind where immigrants come from. However, once in Australia, the goal must surely be to establish a completely cohesive integrated society and not encourage separatism."</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Multiculturalism, a policy originally developed by the Fraser Government, acknowledges the right of all Australians to express and share their cultural heritage, while assimilation places a much stronger onus on migrants to blend into society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter was written when Mr Howard was a frontbencher in the Hewson-led Opposition and after the 1988 furore sparked by his comments about the need to slow Asian immigration in the interests of social cohesion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When he reclaimed the Opposition leadership, Mr Howard admitted he had erred in making the comments, describing them as "wrong" and "clumsy". But doubts have remained about his commitment to multiculturalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Coalition criticised the Keating Government's approach to multiculturalism, it remained a part of the Coalition's platform for the 1996 election. However, the Howard-led Government has dismantled the Office of Multicultural Affairs, reducing it to a small branch within the Department of Immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard also opposed the use of the term multiculturalism in the joint resolution passed by the Parliament last month deploring racism. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5939"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appearance of the letter will add to Mr Howard's problems on the eve of his attendance at the APEC summit in Manila.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A spokesman for Mr Howard declined to comment on the letter last night, saying he could not contact the Prime Minister as he was en route to Manila.</PARA>
<PARA>It is unfortunate that we have to be debating and drawing reference to these matters whilst those important talks are taking place in Manila&mdash;important for each and every Australian. But we should not have our neighbours being given the opportunity to further criticise Australia on the matter of race. Indeed we know that many of our neighbouring countries are very upset about what has been happening of recent time in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come back to the bill, to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and to recognise the presence in the chamber of Senator Ellison, the chair of that committee, and Senator Abetz. They will recall that I expressed my pleasant surprise with the recommendations that the majority of the committee brought into the committee when we were deliberating on the report. Their actions in adopting some of the recommendations given to the committee in the various public hearings that were conducted and the submissions that the committee received during the inquiry are an indication&mdash;if one was needed, and I am not sure it is&mdash;of the good work that committees can engage in and can undertake on behalf of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is physical evidence of that good work now in the sense that some of the concerns that were raised to the committee in the public hearings were listened to by the majority of the committee and indeed were then in turn listened to by the minister after the majority report was tabled in the parliament. But, unfortunately, as usual the considerations do not go far enough. The majority has not yet explained the breach of election commitments that the government has engaged in with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Prior to the 1996 election there was a six-month waiting period for the jobsearch allowance, the newstart allowance, the youth training allowance, the parenting allowance, the sickness allowance and the witness allow ance. The government indicated in the election campaign that they would extend the six-month waiting period to two years. But the government have extended it way beyond the six or seven areas where the six-month waiting period applied. They extended it to the carers pension, the child disability allowance, the disability wage supplement, the double orphan allowance, the family payment, the guardian allowance, the health care card and a whole range of other benefits which were never mentioned by the coalition in the election campaign. They were not part of the shonky promises that were made to the community in the election campaign of February-March this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats and I think Senator Brown pleaded with the opposition, with the Labor Party, to join them in total opposition to the bill. We will not be doing that. We will be sticking with the recommendations that we have put in the minority report. We will not be breaching one of the commitments we gave in the election campaign and indeed the legislation that we brought into this place in 1992 which put in place the six-month waiting period that applied from 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, in the debates within Labor Party caucus and the caucus committees the support for these measures was not unanimous. Nonetheless, at the end of the day the numbers were there within the party to bring in those provisions. Senators on the other side of the chamber, as we were then, supported the legislation to impose this six-month waiting period. It would be hypocritical of me to stand aside from the votes in which I participated in 1992 in relation to this matter, so I will stick with the principled position that we adopted. We will seek to hold, by way of the amendments we intend to move and the way we will vote on government amendments, the government to the promises and commitments that they made at election time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned in passing the shonky figures. In a coalition statement issued before the budget, the now government said they were going to save $616 million as a consequence of extending the six-month waiting period to two years. The committee, in its deliberations <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5940"> in June this year, was given different information. We were told, for example, in the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the bill&mdash;there are details of this on page 9 of the majority report&mdash;that in the year 1996-97 the provisions would save $31.4 million; in 1997-98, $143.5 million; and, in 1998-1999, $185 million. That totals $360.5 million&mdash;quite a distance from the $616 million that was promised in the `Meeting our Commitments' statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget statement came up with another figure. I will not go through the amounts for the individual years, but the total was $520.2 million. I note that, in the list of government amendments that have been circulated, the additional measures that the majority of the committee has been able to make the government accept cut those savings by some half a million dollars in each of the next two years. I do not believe that is good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I endorse the comments of Senator Bolkus, who led the debate for this side, on the Racial Discrimination Act and the fact that we would like to ensure, by way of an amendment we seek to move to this bill, that nothing we do to this bill this afternoon or tomorrow will in any way contravene the  provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. We are seeking to move an amendment in that light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We listened carefully to the evidence presented to us by the Racial Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Zita Antonios, who provided us with evidence, I think in Sydney. We also noted, and drew attention to on page 5 of the minority report, the prevarication, if you like, of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department when they were questioned on what the Racial Discrimination Commissioner said. We would like to put this matter beyond doubt. Even if the racial discrimination debate was not currently taking place in our community, I think there is an obligation on the parliament, on this Senate, to carry that amendment when it is put to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, Mr Acting Deputy President, I again draw attention to the minority report that we submitted in September this year. I have not dealt with each and every matter in the minority report; it runs to some 16 pages. I commend it to the parliament. One area that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was not properly addressed in this speech was how the provisions of this bill, if enacted, will discriminate against individuals. In one of the appendices that we attached to our minority report, we provided information on currency restrictions that various countries impose on their nationals as they leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People leaving the United Kingdom have no restrictions on the amount of currency that they can bring with them. However, the most a person coming from Vietnam can bring with them is $US5,000. All a person can take from the Philippines is 5,000 pesos, which, at the time we were preparing the report, amounted to $A243. Other provisions worth mentioning concern India, the People's Republic of China, South Africa and Iraq. I dare say that, had we more time, we could have looked at a number of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, these provisions are discriminatory. As a nation, we cannot address what the Philippines determine that their nationals should take out of the country, but we do have to be aware that these restrictions are in place and that a migrant coming from the Philippines, China or Vietnam should have the same rights of settlement in Australia as a person coming from the United Kingdom or, indeed, the Republic of Ireland. It is going to be a fairly arduous committee stage debate on this matter. It is something that I look forward to, although I would have preferred that it happen in a different environment than the one that currently exists in our community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 was introduced into the Senate in May 1996 as part of the government's commitment to a pre-election policy that new entrants to Australia should provide for their own support during their first two years here. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and other related bills to extend the newly arrived residents waiting period for certain social security payments from six months to two years for migrants who arrived in Australia on or after 1 April this year. It also makes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5941"> amendments to these acts to ensure that these provisions are more workable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in May and was reported on in September. I am pleased to advise the Senate that the majority of the committee made a number of recommendations which have been taken up by the government and accepted. Before I touch on them, let me deal with a number of concerns that have been mentioned today. One of them relates to racial discrimination. I might say at the outset that the committee relied on the evidence of Professor Ivan Shearer and the Attorney-General's Department to the effect that the bill does not discriminate on the grounds of race or contravene international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, concerns were raised in relation to retrospectivity. I am pleased to put to bed any concerns of that sort. The committee noted these and looked at that subject. It stated that, in its view, these provisions were clearly enunciated during the election campaign. Information on the proposed changes to the policy were widely circulated by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The committee noted that the provisions in this bill relating to special benefits are prospective and that new residents who arrive on or after 1 April 1996 will be eligible for special benefits under the current arrangements. Therefore, for those reasons, the committee was of the view that there was no retrospective effect in relation to this bill. This policy achieved a good deal of attention in the run-up to the March election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that other recommendations were made by the majority. These related in part to the carers pension, the child disability allowance, the double orphan pension, the innocent illegals category of migrants and interdependent relationships. There was a lot more detail to it than that. I recommend to anyone interested in this area to read the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Suffice it to say that a number of groups gave evidence in relation to these areas of concern. This was taken up <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the committee and acted upon by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also add that the majority of the committee recommended that some guidelines be set down by the secretary to the department in relation to the definition of `family members'. Furthermore, as the two-year waiting period commences on the date of arrival in Australia or the granting of permanent resident status, the committee was of the view that any appeal provision should not unfairly interfere with the rights or situation of any appellant in relation to their status. For this reason, an amendment has been included to provide that if a decision not to grant a visa is overturned, the period will commence on the day it was initially refused. That concern was raised in the course of evidence and has been met by the majority report of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must also make it clear that this bill does not affect in any way the refugee or humanitarian programs which are currently in place. It does not detract from those in any form whatsoever and I think it is important that it not do so. At the end of the day we have a bill which strikes a balance between allowing for equity in dealing with those who fall within the exceptional categories that I have mentioned in part and the need to allow for responsible control of government expenditure in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Substantial savings will accrue on the passing of this bill. That will mean that the huge deficit which this government inherited in March this year can be partly addressed. The government looked not only at financial considerations but also at the matters that I raised earlier&mdash;in much more detail than I have enunciated here today&mdash;relating to exceptional circumstances, including such areas of concern as the carers pension, just to name one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, therefore, there is a balance. I reject entirely the proposition that this is a bill which has not looked at these exceptional circumstances. There is a balance between controlling government expenditure and looking at the more human aspects which can touch on the area of immigration in these circumstances. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5942">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government saw fit to impose a six&hyphen;month waiting period. This government in the run up to the election announced that its policy would be that this period would be extended to two years. It was on that basis that it was elected to power. I do not think you can get a clearer mandate than that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 we are now considering amends the Social Security Act 1991, the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, the Data&hyphen;matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 1995 and the Health Insurance Act 1973. This bill will amend legislation which is itself going to be amended by requests to be moved on behalf of the government. There are some proposed amendments put forward by the Australian Democrats and by the opposition, but I think those are going to have little chance of passing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, it is legislation that has been put forward and, before it becomes law, will be amended further. It is to be amended partly because of the work of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which is chaired by Senator Ellison, who has just spoken. He himself has said that there was a need to make changes to the proposed amendments because the proposed amendments as they originally stood were too harsh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having looked at the amendments put forward on behalf of the government, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Tambling) to find out before this comes on for debate in the committee stage what proposed division 18 refers to. It seems to be referring to clause 94. If the parliamentary secretary could find out what legislation division 18, schedule 1A refers to, it would be very helpful for debate on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Ellison and other speakers have said, this is a matter of balancing good government in terms of financial management against good government in terms of looking after people who come and live here. Senator McKiernan, who is not a bleeding heart, but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is very wise in this area and has been interested in it for many years, has said that this does not strike the proper balance between good government in terms of economic management and good government in terms of looking after people who come here to live, because, as has already been said, it imposes obligations on people who come here that are not imposed on others. That imposition is the necessity to exist without any assistance from the community at a time when people are most vulnerable&mdash;and Senator Brown brought this out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is the intention of this legislation to save money, then perhaps a better way round would be to give people the support they need when they get here and ask for repayment of that money when they have been able to set themselves up and are in a better position to return the money taken from the community. That is not a new concept by any means. We have HECS where we enable people to study at universities&mdash;to give them the skills needed to make this country the sort of country we want it to be&mdash;by giving them support when they most need it and we ask those students to pay back the money when they are in a better position to do so. Why that concept is not used in this circumstance I am really unable to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who get here from overseas, who are brought here in accordance with the law and who come here as lawful migrants are most likely to be trying to find out how the country runs and what the culture of the country is. They are probably trying to get themselves a job, trying to find out how to accommodate to the customs of the place and perhaps trying to skill themselves in English during those first two years. Why, when there are alternatives to this, do we impose upon them the hardship of coping without any support from the community? After all, they are to become our fellows as time goes by. Indeed, as I understand the situation, they become our fellows as soon as they get here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who are either resident in the country on a permanent basis or citizens of the country have a right, I think, to expect that we will not leave them in distress. Social security is simply that&mdash;giving security to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5943"> people who are in need of it because it binds up the social fabric of the country in which we live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing with this legislation is simply saying, `You people may be in need, you may need disability wage supplements, you may need all sorts of things, but we are not going to give them to you because you are in a particular category,' even though there are some pensions which we say they ought to get, the double orphan's pension for example. Why is that made an exception? Does somebody without a job have any greater or lesser need than somebody who needs a double orphan's pension?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is there this scheme which picks and chooses between those who are in need? If you are in need, you are in need. People recognise that. The government in its original proposals for this bill recognised that. The government members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee understood that. In fact, they made suggestions that this support be extended to a larger category of people than the government had originally suggested. That has been done by the government. The minority said that there were other categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me extraordinary that we should say there should be choices made between people who are in need, by definition&mdash;that is what this is all about&mdash;so that some are allowed to get the lifeline and others are not when they will all ultimately become part of this community in which we live. We have got them at their most vulnerable: in the first two years they are here. How do we face them 10 years later when they are great contributors to this society? Do we say to them, `We are a bit sorry about those first two years. That is how things come. We had to make a choice. We had to save a certain amount of money and, unfortunately, your need, at the time desperate, could not be fulfilled'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Page 9 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report sets out the amounts of savings the government envisages will be made as a result of this legislation. As I understand it, it is an amount of some millions of dollars overall, but in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> respect of certain categories it is quite small. In relation to the double orphan's pension, for example, `negligible' is the word put beside each of the four financial years after this one. It is probably for that reason that the double orphan's pension has been taken off the list of those to which migrants will not be entitled in the first two years of their coming here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the government that they look carefully at these categories generally to see if there cannot be at least more added to those that are exempt from this fairly rigorous legislation, which is going to deprive some people who have come here to live as residents and ultimately citizens of this country of assistance to help them through their hard times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of quite emotional words have been said in this debate. I think that is proper because it is an emotional issue. We are talking about stopping the sorts of people that have made this country what it is&mdash;we have talked about them&mdash;gaining access to the benefits that citizens and residents here can expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the latest in a wave of migration that goes back a long time and which has contributed mightily to this country. Wave after wave of migration has met an at times unfriendly reception in this place. Migrants have made this country what it is. Of course, I do not leave out from the considerations here the original inhabitants of this place. Great contributions have been made by migrants over the years. I think it looks very ill, if you sit back and consider this, that those of us whose ancestors have been here for a long time in many cases have nevertheless benefited from more recent waves of migration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In three years time it will be 150 years since the last of my overseas ancestors came to this land. I think you have to agree that in those 150 years the economic, cultural, moral and even religious quality of this country has gone up in leaps and bounds. It is a much better place to live in than was then the case. It seems now that, if you look at those generations, suddenly we of this generation say, `Those that come now are not going to enjoy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5944"> the benefits that those of us who had ancestors that came before do.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Conroy says, an excellent man. In the article, headed up `Shades of Enoch Powell: Pauline Hanson's star will also fade', he states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Talk of being "flooded" by Asians ignores the fact that immigration control in Australia is now tighter than for 50 years for all except New Zealanders. Talk of Asian "cultures" being incompatible with "mainstream" Australia ignores the fact that large proportions of Asian immigrants (other than refugees and their relatives) are English&hyphen;speaking Christians.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The point I want to make is not so much about the people coming from Asia but the fact that we are now operating, according to Dr Jupp, under immigration control which is tighter than it has been for 50 years. It seems extraordinary that we are reducing the number of migrants that come here every year but nevertheless we are imposing these hardships upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government had a six&hyphen;month waiting period for migrants. I want to say two things about that. Firstly, two years is four times greater than six months, which is obvious, and it would be easier to cope with six months than two years. Secondly, I am not sure that imposing six months upon migrants was a good thing in any event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> When you look at this hit on the very sort of people who, apart from the original habitants, have come to this country and established their families, who have brought up their children&mdash;who have brought up their children in turn&mdash;for a number of generations, and when you look at the sort of people who got the place going and who are being picked out for particular attention so that there can be some savings to the budget, you begin to wonder about the balance that is to be made between the government's responsibility to the budget and the government's responsibili ty to our people and the people who have established non-Aboriginal culture here. You certainly think this legislation weighs too heavily in favour of what is called fiscal responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we should be doing one thing with public funds, if we should be doing one thing with the taxpayers' dollar, it is making sure we have a society that is cohesive and cared for and that when properly looked after can make their contribution later during their stay here. Let us look after these people now and let them, if we so require, pay back that help at a later stage when they are better able to do so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996. In doing so, let me try to debunk some of the commentary that was introduced by those opposite concerning the approach by the coalition to migrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was inherent in a lot of the comments the suggestion that the coalition was somehow anti-migrant, that somehow we did not acknowledge the achievements that migrants have made to this great country. The fact that I am standing here in this place today is indicative of the fact that the Liberal Party does recognise those contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that Mr Zammit, the member for Lowe, and Mrs Johnston, the member for Canning, being overseas born and from a non-English speaking background like me, find themselves in this parliament I think is sufficient proof to indicate that we do have the proper humanitarian standards required in making the migrant community in this country feel welcomed. There is, I would suggest, a big difference in as much as we do not try to be paternalistic to them but rather want to deal with them on the basis of their being Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5945"> I embark upon the next part of my speech with some reluctance. Each time there is a debate about migration in this place we unfortunately see the Labor Party descend to a commentary bordering on racism, trying to hold themselves up as the party that is not for racist views and thereby, by implication, suggest ing that those of us on this side of the chamber somehow do wish to give credibility to those views. Of course Senator McKiernan's contribution was very much along those lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know which past Labor leader those opposite would want me to refer to but Arthur Calwell had a few very choice words to say. He was a man whom Senator Cooney defended in this chamber only last year by saying what a magnificent individual he was in supporting multiculturalism in this country. Do you want a few quotes of what Arthur Calwell said? He said things like `Japanese women ought not be allowed to pollute our shores.' There are a whole lot of others. I only have another six minutes, so I will not go through Arthur Calwell's record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You then can read former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's comments, not from me but from the Clyde Cameron diaries. He referred to refugees as the Vietnamese Balts, referring to the Baltic refugees. Vietnamese Balts&mdash;how denigrating can that be, not of migrants but refugees, upon whom I hasten to add this legislation does not impact at all? Or we can go to comments of former Prime Minister Keating who said the famous words, `After all, the best migrant is the infant Australian.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Labor Party want to hector us on each and every occasion migration comes up, we will embrace that debate and quote back the shameful record of their past leaders. The reality is that this is simply a piece of legislation which has no foundation on the basis of some misunderstanding or dislike of migrants. In fact, it is legislation which is designed to ease part of the burden which our economy can no longer bear. Why is it that the economy can no longer bear the burden? It is because of the spendthrift nature of those opposite when they were in power. If they wanted Australia to be able to afford to continue to fund migrants as we have done in the past, they should have thought about that before they got us into the huge debt that we are now in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the chamber have to get Australia out of debt. It is interesting to note that those opposite implemented a decision which required migrants to support themselves for the first six months after their arrival in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. That was after the 1993 federal election when they had made not a single noise about their intentions during the election campaign. They kept that one in the bottom drawer. There was not a word in their policy platform. They realised the financial mess that they were getting themselves into. They were trying to retrieve some money and, as a result, introduced the six&hyphen;month rule. So they were the ones who set the precedent and said it was fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney's speech was quite moving until you realised that Senator Cooney and his colleagues voted for the six&hyphen;month rule. It really does beg the question: why the crocodile tears now? Why weren't there crocodile tears in 1993? Why weren't there crocodile tears when you were acting in the spendthrift way which bankrupted this country and has made us, unfortunately, impose some of these measures. It is no good trying to say to us now that we have to look after them. The reality is that we cannot. I do not think it is unfair if we do not look after them, given the structure of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very interesting to listen to Senator McKiernan's contribution in which he suggested that somehow it would be just and reasonable for the Labor Party to vote for only those aspects of this legislation which we had specifically enunciated during the federal election campaign. If that is the way they are going to act in this chamber, they should be embracing the Telstra one&hyphen;third sale absolutely. But no, they will not adopt that principle for Telstra. They adopt this principle only when it suits them. Of course, if you adopt a principle only when it suits you, it belies the fact that it is not a principle at all; it is just cheap politicking&mdash;and the Labor Party has been exposed for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee which looked at this legislation, of which I was a member and formed part of the majority, made a number of recommendations to the government which, we believe, would make it fairer and more reasonable. I am glad to say that the government has accepted those recommendations. Rather than dealing with some of the emotion in this issue, it might be interesting to deal with some of the facts. For example, newly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5946"> arrived residents generally have higher rates of dependants on social security than do the general population. In the longitudinal survey of immigration to Australia, it was found that the overall unemployment rate for newly arrived residents was 39 per cent. You have to ask whether, in the current economic climate, we as a nation can continue to afford that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government clearly came to the conclusion that they could no longer afford that sort of support and, therefore, made the rule 26 weeks. We are putting it out to 104 weeks. But those under the refugee and humanitarian program will not, in any way, be adversely affected by this. These conditions will apply to only those migrants who come here on the basis that they can look after themselves.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of weeks ago, the annual report of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation was tabled in the Senate. I was interested in this because, by coincidence, my Perth office is on the same floor of the Exchange Plaza as Austrade and EFIC, as it is known. It seemed to me that EFIC was a fairly obscure government agency but, having read through the report, I would like to put on record that I greatly admire the contribution EFIC is making towards facilitating Australia's export drive to all parts of the world. It is very clear that EFIC is playing a very important role in promoting Australia's export trade internationally, in particular within the European and Asian markets. EFIC is doing an outstanding job in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to EFIC's annual report, the corporation supported an incredible $7.5 billion in exports in 1995&hyphen;96, which was an increase of some 20 per cent in the support they had given to Australian exports over the previous year. It shows that the work EFIC is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doing in financing insurance for Australian exports is really vital to the international economy that Australia seeks to become a part of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EFIC support goes mostly to small and medium sized companies. For example, over the last year, as I said, the total value of exports that they supported was $7.5 billion, but that included $2.935 billion to Europe, $2.227 billion to Asia, and $1.173 billion to the Americas&mdash;which is, interestingly, made up of $949 million to North America and $224 million to South America&mdash;and also includes exports to the Middle East and to Africa. So EFIC's spectrum is very wide indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kinds of companies that EFIC has supported include financing a German company's support of fast catamaran ferries for routes on the Baltic Sea to and from Sweden as well as other Baltic ports. Most of their focus, however, in terms of new business is in Asia, which is appropriate when one considers the growth of the economies in that area and their importance to Australia in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Asia accounted for 30 per cent of the total exports financed by EFIC, and South-East Asian buyers were recipients of 49 per cent of new loans signed. Indonesia was the largest borrower of medium- to long-term finance for Australian exports, while Singapore overtook Malaysia as the largest user of EFIC credit insurance in South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EFIC provided financial services to people who wished to export across the whole spectrum of South-East Asia, India, North Asia, China and Japan. Support was given for loans to China for 15 telecommunications and water treatment plants, which amounted to some $83 million in export value to Australia, and four export working capital guarantees were issued for things as diverse as mining machinery, pumps, packaging and brewing machinery&mdash;Australia, obviously, being a world leader in the technology of brewing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Japan, credit insurance for exports to Japan increased by some $231 million, covering things such as dairy and machinery products. In addition, seven working capital guarantees were issued covering <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5947"> contracts for aerospace equipment, car parts, motor cycles, audio editing equipment and canned beer. It just shows what a wide spectrum of activities EFIC does support, including, as I said, exports to places as diverse as the Middle East, Africa and South America&mdash;where three loans were signed for the export of agricultural machinery to Argentina and another loan provided for the provision and installation of telephone switches in the same country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Middle East is a growth area for EFIC with export credit insurance increasing by 45 per cent over the last year, and four export working capital guarantees were issued for Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. It is interesting to compare the current record of the Australian merchandise export portfolio to various regions of the world with what it was 20 years ago. The figures reveal the changing pattern of Australia's involvement with the rest of the world and our growing engagement with Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1975, the Asian region as a whole accounted for 47.2 per cent of Australian merchandise exports compared with 63 per cent in 1995. Western Europe received 17 per cent of our merchandise exports in 1975, but this is now down to 12.3 per cent. Eastern Europe represented 4.7 per cent in 1975, but in 1995 that was only 0.6 per cent. The North American free trade area accounted for 12.8 per cent of our merchandise exports in 1975, but that is now down to 9.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These relative changes in percentages reflect the growth of Asia, particularly South-East Asia and North Asia, in importance as destinations for Australian exports. They are undoubtedly a measure of the success of Australia's push into the region following the British entry into the Common Market in the early 1970s. They also reflect the spectacular growth of some of the nations and their economies in the Asian region. It is interesting to note that, excluding Japan, the East Asian regional economies have grown by an average of 9.4 per cent since 1990. There is no doubt that this growth signals great opportunities for Australian industry and business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In conclusion, I would like to say and put on the record that I greatly admire the import ant contribution that this small office on the same floor as I occupy in Perth is  making to the Australian economy and to our export drive. I would like to put on record the fact that EFIC supports exports to some 155 countries either through insuring the exporter against non-payment by the buyer, which is credit insurance, or through providing finance for capital goods. As I said, I think they are doing a great job. They certainly deserve to be recognised for what they are doing.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk today about the effect that the Howard budget will have on the Western Australian economy. While it is important to note that Western Australians will be affected by changes in a general sense, like citizens in all other states, there are some particularly damaging aspects for Western Australia in this budget. Briefly, I will mention the broad general cuts taking place and then address one or two specific issues of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prescriptions, as we know, will increase to $20. A family with three children, when they all get sick together, as is the norm, will face a bill of $60 in one hit for the prescriptions. Dental care promises by Mr Howard in the last election campaign have been broken and waiting lists for our elderly citizens will increase. The elderly will also be faced with a $34 a day charge for nursing homes when they earn more than $50 a week. This will be on top of the $26,000 up-front fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's refusal to properly compensate doctors may result in the loss of bulk-billing. The result could be that consultant bills at the doctors will be $10 a visit. On top of this, government supported increases in health insurance premiums will provide no solace in the area of health care. I note reports in newspapers last week which show just how recently the Prime Minister has himself approved health insurance premium increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents with children in child care will also suffer. They now face increased charges of $21.40 per week for children under three in government child care and $14.35 per week <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5948"> for children over three. In private child care, these charges will be $19.60 per week for families with children in long day care of 50 hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes represent a strong ideological point of view. That view is that the government is bad. The objective then is to remove the government from participation in key sectors of the economy. A message I will repeat throughout this speech is that this view held by the government is wrong. We believe that the government does have a role to play in industry, job creation and service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This retreat from government activity in the economy is best evident in my home state of Western Australia. It is particularly true with regard to the shipping bounties. The federal government slashed these in the budget when other competing nations now have a bounty of around 10 per cent. In a number of European countries the bounties have been increased. Termination of this bounty will affect a group of high growth, export oriented manufacturers. This is exactly the section of the economy we want to encourage, not push out of competitive business by slanting the playing field out of their favour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision has resulted in shipping companies in Fremantle such as Austal Ships being unable to compete on a level playing field with its competitors. Whilst this in itself is harmful for the company involved, it also has disastrous ramifications for the Australian economy. The government will be hampering an industry which, through the assistance of the ships bounty, had a growth rate in production of 200 per cent, a growth in exports of 150 per cent and a growth in employment levels of 50 per cent since its inception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of these figures is the way in which they translate to on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground effects. In coastal areas such as Fremantle, Rockingham and Mandurah the industry may see a slump. The result will be a drop in income for local areas and a possible loss of jobs for many of the local residents. When the issue of suppliers and support staff is factored into those who will lose from the drop in work for Austal Ships and other such companies, the figures begin to grow.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as if these macro figures were not enough, there is still more. The report which reviewed the government decision to cut the ships bounty is a flawed ideological document. The first surprising figure on which the government has based its decision is the size of the savings by termination of the bounty. The termination of the ships bounty will save the government the total sum of not quite $3 million. When compared to the size of the national economy, this saving is minuscule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the size of the saving is compared against the damage which will be done to an important and potential growth area which is export oriented, the decision can be described as nothing other than sad. Stupidity also springs to mind. A paltry $3 million saving is not worth the loss in employment and export dollars generated from this industry. The government fails to realise that continued support of this industry can result in it eventually becoming successful enough to survive in a market without the bounty. However, at this stage it requires a small degree of assistance to get to that level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, the report uses as its base some rather dodgy economic assertions. Firstly, the report quotes from a submission from the Bureau of Industry Economics. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All export industries are in direct competition with each other, that is, Australia's ship builders, miners, farmers and tourist operators compete with each other to supply the foreign exchange that Australians use to buy imports.</PARA>
<PARA>This a nonsense argument that all export industries are in competition with each other. They are, in fact, in competition for access to markets with other similar industry operators in that field around the world. The competition is between like markets for access rights. The notion that shipbuilders and farmers are competing for access rights with each other illustrates one of two things by the government&mdash;either profound stupidity and no understanding of the international economy or a willingness to use any silly argument to justify its ideological policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report that the government relies on is full of such other ridiculous and plain wrong statements and assumptions on which its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5949"> decisions are apparently based. There appears to be no real analysis of the industry assistance programs being terminated and the reasons why this should happen or why they should continue. The Senate should be aware that this is not an isolated incident. The same ridiculous cuts founded on poor analysis of the relevant industry is also occurring with the book bounty, computer bounty and the machine tools and robots bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commitment to this document illustrates two things about the current government. Firstly, there is an inability to think through issues comprehensively with regard to the national economy&mdash;a failure which stems from lack of understanding about the forces that drive the engines of growth in our own economy. The second point it illustrates is that this current government understands little about how competitors in South-East Asia manage their economy and, consequently, do not understand how to make the government and its policies work to the advantage of our own domestic industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision by the government to slash the bounty and retreat from government involvement in this sector may increase unemployment in the Western Australian economy and reduce its export contributions to the nation. The Labor Party rejects this approach by government because we believe that the government does have a critical role to play in assisting industry to build on exports and create employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern and attitude towards the government stemming from this decision, however, does not stop there. Austal Ships were rightly aggrieved when the government showed their arrogance and lack of interest in industry policy by granting Austal Ships only a 10-minute hearing after they flew all the way from Perth to Canberra at their own expense to argue their case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to export oriented markets do not stop there, however. The slashing of the DIFF program has meant that Western Australian companies involved in shipbuilding and construction in other countries has seen their support eroded. The result is a further loss of export dollars and, as a result, employment in Western Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this an additional question must be asked. Why is the Western Australian Premier, Richard Court, not doing more to save Austal Ships and the local economy? In fact, the role of Mr Court in the whole budget debate needs to be closely examined. It is forecast that the impact of the budget will be felt in early 1997. Coincidentally, the Premier has shifted the Western Australian election from its traditional date of February/March to 14 December of this year. The result will be the state election not coinciding with the initial impact of the budget cuts in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no attempt in Western Australia to diversify the economy from being simply reliant on the resources sector. An export oriented manufacturer such as Austal Ships has been successful at doing this. Their good work is now liable to be destroyed by the actions of the Commonwealth government. The government needs to recognise the role industry policy and support can play in our economy and use it sufficiently to Australia's advantage.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.37 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to continue my remarks of 16 October regarding the possible health effects of low level radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation. Over the next three weeks, the Standards Australia subcommittee for non&hyphen;ionising radiation will make a decision about a proposal to relax the public exposure standard for radiofrequency microwave radiation by a factor of five&mdash;that is, from 200 microwatts per square centimetre to 1,000 microwatts or one milliwatt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the government that it should, as a matter of some urgency, request the Standards Australia subcommittee to postpone a final decision on these standards until all of the relevant data has been properly assessed. As I understand it, discussion and decision making processes on the standards subcommittee have essentially taken place behind closed doors away from the scrutiny of the general public, from independent scientists and from concerned interest groups who might hold a different view from that of the industry. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5950">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask senators to take note that the standards subcommittee is very heavily weighted with industry representation. They include: the Australian Electronics Industry Association, the Australian Radiation Protection Society, the Civil Aviation Authority, departments of industrial relations and employment in New South Wales, departments of defence and transport and communications, the Institution of Radio and Electronics Engineers of Australia, the National Measurement Laboratory of CSIRO, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, Royal Adelaide Hospital and the Wireless Institute of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is passing its regulatory responsibilities to limit or control emissions of electromagnetic radiation to a body controlled, in this instance, by the very industries which stand to gain from the sales and use of electromagnetic technology. This shift, together with the fact that industry interests ignore warning signs from recent research which points to likely health effects, makes it clear to me that we have an environmental, public and occupational health and planning problem on our hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is also fair to say that consultative processes appear to be playing second fiddle to the economic growth and expansion of the telecommunications industry. I have spoken before about why some scientists are concluding that low power density microwaves could pose serious health problems. The current Australian exposure standard is not a standard that takes low level microwaves into account. The exposure standard is a thermal standard, set up by technical and industrial experts at a time when wireless technology was far less developed than it is now. It is more appropriate as a protection for those exposed to very high or occupational levels of microwave radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor John Goldsmith, in a recent study about low power density effects, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Epidemiology provides a growing number of reports which find health status change, including increased cancers, miscarriage, brain&hyphen;activity changes, anxiety, sleep disorders, etc in association with above&hyphen;average exposure to radiofrequency and microwave radiation. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>In a few days time a conference in Munich will be convening with international delegates, including Australians, to discuss this problem of athermal microwaves on human health. Professor Goldsmith also has this to say about the issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are strong political and economic reasons for needing there to be no health effect of RF/MW exposure, just as there are strong public health reasons for more accurately portraying the risks. Those of us who intend to speak for public health must be ready for opposition that is nominally, but not truly, scientific.</PARA>
<PARA>But, to return to the change to the exposure standard, I have been advised that, of non&hyphen;industry members voting, CSIRO is opposed to relaxing the standard, on the basis that the science is inadequate to guarantee human safety and, furthermore, that to date there is no operational reason for the change. There is currently no equipment which needs this massive increase, or any increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former chief medical officer of Telstra, Dr Bruce Hocking, has voted no already to the relaxation of the standard, because of uncertainties arising from his recent survey around the TV towers in Sydney. But I understand that the Australian Radiation Laboratory will vote in favour of it. This is quite an interesting position for a Commonwealth government health and radiation safety body to take and I suggest that it is not unreasonable to question whether this might in fact be a failure to act in the interests of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The discussion on this standards subcommittee on whether or not to relax the standard has been fraught with uncertainty both here and in New Zealand and the final outcome of that voting is still not certain. But I remind the Senate that people are being told by industry and by government that our electromagnetic radiation emissions are well within the standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few days, Red Hill preschool, in objecting to the installation of a mobile phone tower, have been told by Vodafone:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no substantial or convincing biological effects that could lead to adverse health effects including cancer from radiofrequency radiation around base stations. Radiofrequency levels are at least two thousand times below the limit for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5951"> continuous public exposure permitted by the current international and national standards.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Senate to take note that telecommunication carriers are causing considerable community distress and anger with this attitude. It is an attitude which the current legislation has fostered. I suggest to you that feelings out there where people live are reaching boiling point. Week after week, my office receives calls from people who are struggling to come to terms with their inability to get answers from an industry which seems only interested in its own very narrow research. I suggest that not only is a review of the present exposure standard due but also the basic structure of the standards subcommittee needs to be examined to make sure that it is a more balanced and representative body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also suggest that it is quite inappropriate for the standard to be relaxed at a time when ongoing research indicates that there may well be serious health effects from accumulated high frequency microwave radiation. Indeed, it would seem prudent in the current climate of concern and uncertainty to tighten rather than relax the standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History books have shown that the progress of science depends on the capacity for flexible thinking processes, and we believe that a paradigm shift is now due. The New Zealand Ministry of Health in its recently completed report of August this year, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Literature Review on the health effects of radiofrequency radiation</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Biological plausibility is an important guide to judging causality, but is of limited value in assessing exposures that have been studied for a relatively short period . . . Judgments about the "plausibility" of athermal effects of radiofrequency radiation may be quite different in ten years time than at present.</PARA>
<PARA>Continuing from the same report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no well understood biological mechanisms to explain some of the epidemiological findings, but this is not a sufficient reason to reject the evidence. Biological plausibility is a weak criterion for assessing new exposures, and the flaws in the research must be weighed against some consistency in the outcomes. Rather, there is a high level of scientific uncertainty, and the implications for policy making depend largely on where the onus of proof lies: the epidemiological evidence <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> may be construed as either "incomplete evidence of cause" or "incomplete evidence of safety".</PARA>
<PARA>I think there is only one conclusion possible in the light of this report: the Australian government should examine the breakneck speed of the telecommunications industry expansion, including changes to exposure standards, and a prudent avoidance policy should be applied. The eminent ex-CSIRO scientist Les Dalton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Above all, we need to question the economic myths that motivate our growth&hyphen;oriented and ever more polluting society. Only then will we seriously begin to re&hyphen;establish a genuinely healthy relationship with our natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the expansionist philosophy of the telecommunications industry is one such economic myth. Competition, deregulation and privatisation policies are producing a more hazardous, wasteful and environmentally destructive telecommunications industry, and I think it is now time to take stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I finish, I would like to inform the Senate that Dr Peter French, one of Australia's top medical researchers at the Centre for Immunology in Sydney, whom I mentioned once before, was advised this month that his very important and unique work on electromagnetic radiation and human cells has been refused funding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.47 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I will address some remarks on an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper on Friday last, 22 November. Also I will relate those remarks to some others I made in this place in September of this year regarding the Royal Commission into the City of Wanneroo which is proceeding in Western Australia right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> is entitled `Davis criticises MHR'. It starts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wanneroo royal commissioner Roger Davis has accused Labor MHR Stephen Smith of acting irresponsibly by using parliamentary privilege to reveal Mr Davis had suppressed evidence by accountant Laurie Fowler and then ordered that no reference be made to the suppression.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Davis is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not of course able to identify the reasons which applied in the case of Mr Fowler without <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5952"> even further undermining the confidentiality I was seeking to enforce.</PARA>
<PARA>The article also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his speech to the House on Monday, Mr Smith said the commission's decision raised very grave concerns for people interested in accountability. Mr Smith described Mr Davis' act of suppressing the suppression order as a "double banger"&mdash;and it is also a tongue twister.</PARA>
<PARA>One can understand why Mr Davis would not want to identify all his reasons for having taken the very unusual step of suppressing the fact that there had been a suppression order. But one would hope that his reasons for issuing that double&hyphen;banger suppression order are not related to the state election which is under way in Western Australia now. One would hope also that Mr Davis is not protecting Premier Richard Court's chief political adviser, Richard Elliott. One would hope, indeed, that that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to draw a distinction between what is happening in this particular matter with the suppression of Mr Fowler's evidence as opposed to what happened in the commission recently to the suppression of evidence given by the previous commissioner into Wanneroo, Mr Peter Kyle, and the again quite extraordinary actions by the commissioner in lifting that suppression order on the evidence given by Mr Kyle. Again, one would hope sincerely that Mr Davis has not been influenced by fact that there is an election going on in the state of Western Australia at this time and, indeed, by the fact that Mr Kyle happens to be a candidate in that election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the speech I gave some months ago, to which I have referred, I mentioned that Mr Kyle had previously criticised police in Western Australia for going soft on corruption, for not vigorously investigating politicians and for refusing to hand over documents necessary to his inquiry&mdash;and this was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 11 April 1996. Mr Kyle also had earlier stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 17 February that `some of the same police figures alleged to be involved in the Argyle diamonds disappearance also were involved in Wanneroo' and that `people in the drug trade had connections with Wanneroo'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This royal commission we have proceeding in Western Australia is truly extraordinary and it continues to be extraordinary. Not only are there the matters I have referred to tonight but there are also the actions of the commission and the effects of the commission to date which are of grave concern to the good citizens of Western Australia. One of the casualties of the commission so far has been the intelligence unit of the Ministry for Justice which is involved in the gathering of information about one David King. David King was convicted of corruption and gaoled, and some of his evidence was given to the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr King was subject to an axe job by the counsel assisting the commission. But of greater concern was that it was said that her attacks had serious implications for the fight against crime and corruption generally because all law enforcement agencies at both state and federal level depend on the information flow. Miss Narelle Johnson was critical of the ministry's intelligence unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The officer in charge of certain investigations before the commission, Detective McLeod, told the commission that the Police Bureau of Criminal Intelligence had been informed of an association between convicted former mayor of Wanneroo Bradshaw and convicted drug runner Allan Harriman, what had been done about this and about the contacts between Bradshaw and well&hyphen;known criminal John Kizon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Royal Commissioner, Mr Davis, has decided not to require Harriman to give evidence because his information is outside the terms of reference. It seems to me that terms of reference can be particularly fluid from time to time as, indeed, it would appear that the use of suppression orders have been fluid from time to time, depending on who they are going to impact upon. But the matter of the intelligence unit and the impact of the commission on it is of importance. Previously it was staffed by eight people; it is now only going to be staffed by five people. Its name, of course, is also going to be changed. It is going to be called just the intelligence unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the role of any intelligence unit is the gathering and collection of intelligence. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5953"> Part of the gathering and collection of intelligence occurs in prisons. We have already witnessed the impact of the reduction in staff and, indeed, the impact of the reduction in the gathering of information in the prisons in Western Australia. On one particular weekend&mdash;the weekend of 26 and 27 October, just a month ago&mdash;a total of 10 prisoners escaped from the Karnet and Wooroloo prison farms. There were five escapes from each of them. A total of 39 escapes have occurred in Western Australia in the financial year to date&mdash;that is, from 1 July this year. Intelligence unit staff are now not permitted to go into prisons to gather information from prisoners and/or staff. They are now reliant on information passed to them by security staff within each institution. It is well known that this system of information gathering does not work. Prisons have a history of not passing on information for fear that their prison will be criticised for poor management practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The restricted movement of intelligence staff in prisons will lead to the reduction of criminal intelligence being passed to police. This will mean that vital criminal intelligence is not gathered or passed to the appropriate law enforcement agencies. With the reduction in the number of intelligence staff, the intelligence unit will also cease its weekend coverage. It will no longer be able to provide a service to prisons and police during the weekends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I too could be criticised by Commissioner Davis for giving out that information, but I suspect that those incarcerated in the prison system in Western Australia will know that their weekends are quite free to plan whatever they care to plan. Of course, when we talk about illicit drugs and the use of illicit substances within the prison system, one really has to be concerned that the intelligence system is not there to detect these things at the moment. The matter of the Wanneroo royal commission is of grave concern, but I suggest that the behaviour of the commissioner&mdash;and, indeed, counsel assisting&mdash;may indeed be of even graver concern in the long term for Western Australia and for the justice system of Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tasrail</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator O'BRIEN</EMPHASIS> (Tasmania) (7.56 p.m.) This evening I rise to speak about the sale of Tasrail as part of the Australian National Rail sale which was announced on Sunday by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). I noted the comments that were made by Senator Abetz today in taking note in relation to a criticism of the opposition with regard to questions asked in question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues that have been raised in relation to the statement by the minister regarding the sale are serious issues. One would have thought that the minister would have been keen to have had those issues properly tested by the scrutiny of parliament, and yet the minister announced this most important aspect of the business of the Australian transport industry on a Sunday leading into a week when the House of Representatives was not sitting. I understand we have the opportunity to ask questions of Senator Alston, who is representing the minister in the Senate. However, I do not think that is the desirable course of action; Minister Sharp is the appropriate person to be answering those questions. I think there are some questions that the minister needs to address himself to&mdash;and, no doubt, will&mdash;when the House of Representatives resumes next Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was amazed to hear Senator Abetz, who represents Tasmania, being so fulsome in his praise of the sale of Australian National and the National Rail Corporation given the position of Tasrail, the Tasmanian arm of Australian National. It is equally amazing that the Tasmanian government has abrogated its responsibility to Tasmania on this issue and supports Minister Sharp's plan for the sell&hyphen;off of Tasrail. According to today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> newspaper, Tasmania is the only state in which the track&mdash;or, as it is more properly known, the permanent way&mdash;will most probably not remain in public ownership. There is some question about the land on which the rails lie, but that is not yet resolved. The question of even that aspect of the asset is up in the air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that Tasrail lost $6.6 million in the last financial year. That compares with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5954"> losses in the 1980s of in excess of $15 million. When you factor those losses into today's dollars, you find that Tasrail's position has improved markedly following the restructure of Tasrail that the former Labor government set about achieving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand, but have not had fully confirmed, that Tasrail's losses are in part due to the cost of servicing debt. It is interesting to note that the proposal that the minister has put before the public involves the federal government effectively taking upon itself and removing from the rail assets the total debt of $2 billion. If that debt is removed from Tasrail, then I suspect it becomes a profitable concern. However, given the sale is supported by the Tasmanian government, which is a minority government and does not have of its own right the ability to govern, and given that it is obviously the policy of the federal government, one must consider the possible implications for Tasmania of the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, I suspect, probable that some of the lines and services will close, transferring the cargo carried on those lines to road freight. Every 100,000 tonnes transferred to the road equates to 72 tri&hyphen;axle truck movements per week. That is one way, assuming they go full one way and come back empty to their original loading point. If you consider that in terms of the B double or articulated truck systems, that is 46 truck movements both ways. Again, that assumes that the trucks are fully laden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Transfer of course will therefore mean more pressure on the roads. Road damage is repaired at the cost of the state. Also, there are dangers and inconveniences caused to road users by the additional use by heavy vehicles of the Tasmanian road system. It is also probable that increased freight charges to rail users will occur, as any buyers seek to recover their purchase costs. That will have an impact upon the Tasmanian economy, but it also may have the impact of forcing further freight onto the road system on the basis of the cost competition between road and rail freight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the totality of the picture, you will see that last year Tasrail carried 2,091,000 tonnes of freight. If you convert <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that to tri&hyphen;axle or B double trucks, you find that it is suddenly between 980 and 1,400 additional truck movements per week, again both ways. If you look at what might happen, for example, in the transportation of coal from the Fingal Valley&mdash;and anyone in Tasmania who knows the road would be considering in horror the prospect of heavy truck movements carrying coal on that road&mdash;you see that there would need to be 80 additional truck movements each way each day to carry the 50 tonnes of coal that is carried out of there per day. In relation to the carriage of cement from Railton to Devonport&mdash;this is the most profitable line and it may be the most remote possibility&mdash;if it were transferred to a trucking system, it would involve one truck movement for every three minutes of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So at its best, this proposal, this strategy, is a massive risk for Tasmania. If it does not come off, Tasmania will lose its rail services and hundreds of jobs. If it does not come off, there is the prospect of massive damage to the Tasmanian road system at the cost of the Tasmanian government to repair it. In addition, there will be a disincentive to the tourists who travel the state's roads. That is not a good thing for the tourism industry in Tasmania, given the events over the recent year and the fact that Tasmania is looking to rebuild its tourism industry. We are looking at the possibility of further carnage on Tasmanian highways as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The risk being taken in relation to Tasrail, if one separates that from the rest of the package, is unnecessary. Clearly Tasrail is able to be kept in public hands and to operate profitably if the debt burden is removed from it. The Tasmanian government should demand that Tasrail be handed back debt free to be run by the Tasmanian government in the interests of the Tasmanian people. That is an equitable solution. In relation to this sale, there is a case to be made for separating Tasrail from the rest of the rail assets.</PARA></PROCTEXT></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about the announcement by Mr Peter Reith today of Public Service reform, a discussion paper which he has put out. The part of the discus <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5955"> sion paper to which I wish to refer is a section on page 18, which talks about the age at which people in the Public Service are required to retire. The discussion paper says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Workplace Relations legislation will outlaw discrimination in employment on a number of grounds, including age, membership or non-membership of a union and family responsibilities. Consistent with the principle of non-discrimination, the government intends to repeal compulsory age 65 retirement&mdash;an issue where, under Labor, the Commonwealth lagged behind other jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is alleluia to that. I have been campaigning in this chamber for years to see that reform and I welcome the announcement that Mr Reith made in that discussion paper. The days when capable, productive and vastly experienced employees are told to quit merely because they have reached a certain age will soon be a thing of the past. I have been approached in the corridors of this place by a number of people, including public servants, since I brought in my first private member's bill. They have asked me what is happening about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said here a number of times, it is not as if we will be overwhelmed by the number of people over age 65 wanting to stay on. I have forgotten what the percentage is, but off the top of my head it will be a very small percentage. I stand to be corrected but about four per cent of public servants are over 64 years of age. There is not going to be a great flood of people wanting to stay on and thus taking jobs from younger people, but a number of people are capable of staying on and wish to do so. How ably people can do that is demonstrated by people in small business working till their middle or late 70s&mdash;and even later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me inappropriate that in this day and age we have a retirement age in the Public Service. As I have said, I have campaigned against this inequity for many years. I have introduced two private member's bills&mdash;one in 1992 and another in 1995&mdash;and all the Labor Party could do was give excuse after excuse about why it was impossible to get rid of age discrimination. Older Australians are justifiably outraged at the existence of age discrimination. As I said, denying people the opportunity of employment based <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> solely on one's age without regard to their ability, qualifications or experience is no less offensive than discrimination on the basis of sex, race or religion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All too often older Australians are betrayed and stereotyped as being frail, dependent, unwell, incapable of learning new skills, inflexible, unable to accept change, passive and unproductive. Those sorts of views and concepts will be thrown out the window. There is no arbitrary point in life where we can say someone is no longer a productive and worthwhile member of the work force. There is no discriminating age at which one can determine that someone is not capable of being productive in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of age discrimination has been part of coalition policy since 1988. Labor has dragged its feet on this issue for at least six years. The coalition has made concrete moves to address this, even though it has been in office since only 2 March, but I want to remind people of Labor's history on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990, the Minister for Social Security, Graham Richardson, gave an undertaking to remove age discrimination from all existing federal legislation. That was never done despite an undertaking by a minister. In 1993, Senator Bolkus stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department is working towards the development of a comprehensive Commonwealth age discrimination policy.</PARA>
<PARA>It was never done. We saw the resistance the Labor Party showed when time and again I moved amendments in this chamber to enable people serving on boards of statutory authorities to remain doing so after they were 65. One example is the National Maritime Museum. They said they were grateful I moved those amendments because a retired naval officer who was able to make major contributions to the museum was going to have to cease working with them and they wanted to still be able to call on his skills and abilities post age 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way we could overcome this type of situation was, when a bill that related to a statutory authority like the museum or various bodies of that ilk came forward, to systematically put an amendment to allow people aged <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5956"> over 65 to serve on the board. Senator Baume and I religiously put that in every time one came up and gradually, bit by bit, we wore away the stone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Labor always found some problem&mdash;for example, if the person concerned fell over, what would we do about their compensation? There was always some petty excuse. They could not work out a way of overcoming these things. But it so happens that every state legislature except Tasmania has been able to do it. All states except Tasmania have enacted legislation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age&mdash;the most recent being Victoria with the Equal Opportunity Act 1995. It was not a Labor government but a coalition government which enacted that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disgraceful that the Commonwealth should be second last to enact this legislation and to enact this protection. It is particularly disgraceful that for so long the Commonwealth and the Labor Party tolerated discrimination against its own employees. We have lagged behind the rest of the world in this regard. Labor have ignored the moves that have taken place in many other legislatures around the world. On page 11 of the report of inquiry into complaints of discrimination in employment and occupation, dated 30 August this year, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recommend that the Commonwealth legislate to provide a comprehensive national prohibition of age discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether Chris Sidoti realised when he wrote that how quickly the government would move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call upon the Labor Party, the Greens, the Democrats and the Independents to give their full support to the amendment which will eliminate age discrimination in the Public Service. I hope Senator Barney Cooney's comments in this chamber the other day that people should not be discriminated against on the basis of age and that they should be allowed to work if they are capable of doing so signal a change of mind in the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this reform is brought in, hopefully we will see a very quick move away from the inaction of the Labor Party and we will see <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something being done for those who wish to continue to work and are assessed as being able to do so. I do not think we should indiscriminately permit people to continue working. Some sensible guidelines enabling review should be put in place to ensure that people do not stay on past the time they are still productive. I welcome the reform that Mr Reith has announced.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(8.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to outline an imaginative proposal by the government to create jobs in regional Australia. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is investigating a proposal to build two new Department of Social Security client service centres. The plan is to build these somewhere in regional Australia to create jobs there. The minister is communicating with state and territory governments to enlist their support and cooperation, so it is outrageous that the ALP government in New South Wales has strenuously rejected the minister's proposals. Chances to win regional jobs for New South Wales have been knocked on the head by the state Labor government. That will put those of us in New South Wales' rural and regional cities at a great disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Minister Newman's proposal had two key elements. The Department of Social Security was going to build one or two hub centres in regional Australia. They were going to be manned by 200 staff to service the telephone inquiries of the department's clients. Of course, with advances in the information superhighway and the roll&hyphen;out of optic fibre around Australia, it really does not matter where you put these sorts of centres. Traditionally we have tended to put these things in the centre of the big cities. With the new technology, this is no longer necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As the United States examples have shown us, you can often drive the taxpayer's dollar quite a lot further if you put such centres in regional areas, where the land is cheaper and there is often an available, quite willing and skilled labour force&mdash;that is certainly the case in my area&mdash;to take advantage of such a proposal. To support this arrangement, each state government was asked to indicate the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5957"> level of assistance that they were prepared to put towards such a project by way of grants or other incentives to attract the Department of Social Security to a regional city. It was suggested that this support could be in the form of fitting out premises and free rent periods and could involve staff transport costs and the costs of furnishing and equipment. A bidding process to force such efficiencies and save taxpayers' money was to be undertaken to encourage the state and territory governments to play a constructive role in regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> So what has been the response of the New South Wales ALP government to this imaginative proposal? The Treasurer of that government, Michael Egan, has guaranteed single&hyphen;handedly that another major investment will not be going to New South Wales. Mr Egan is again turning his back on rural and regional Australia, and possible job creation projects in areas such as Newcastle and Maitland are now at risk. Labor, both at the federal and state levels, appears incapable of learning the lesson that people in regions such as the Hunter want support, not sabotage, for investment proposals such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The DSS proposal would be ideally located in the Hunter region, which has very high youth unemployment and a skilled population that could quite easily fill the 200 positions available. We have sites in the region, such as the better cities Honeysuckle development in Newcastle, and certainly ones in Maitland as an alternative. If the New South Wales ALP government is serious about attracting jobs to the Hunter, it should at least consider Senator Newman's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Baldwin) and I will not be deterred by Mr Egan's playing politics. We will seek urgent discussions with the Minister for Social Security to ensure that the Hunter region is listed as a possible location for the Department of Social Security's hub service centre. In the meantime, we will continue to expose the ALP as the party that is sabotaging job creation in the Hunter region and other parts of New South Wales.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 24 October 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Is the Minister aware that the National Report for Australia to the Ramsar Conference in Brisbane in March 1996 pointed to `ongoing public concern about the potential threats to the ecological character of the Western Port Bay Ramsar site' from the proposal by Shell and Mobil to import through Crib Point and from other shipping activities in the bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Has the Australian Nature Conservation Agency received a letter from the Secretary General of the Ramsar Wetland Convention in Geneva asking whether, in the light of detailed information provided to the Ramsar Bureau on this proposed escalation of oil handling and on other threats to the bay, the site should be included on the Montreux record.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) With reference to the fact that the report of the Review Group on the response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS>  oil spill (January 1996) reveals that only 7.5 tonnes (or 2.3 per cent) of the 325 tonnes spilt was recovered from the sea, and given that this amounts to 97.7 per cent ineffectiveness of the National Oil Spill Plan for a comparatively small spill, (but is not surprising given that recoveries of more than 10 per cent are unusual in the world for spills near coastlines or in enclosed waters): In view of this lamentable failure, how can the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil as it applies to Western Port Bay (or the related, Australian Marine Safety Authority approved, Shell-Mobil oil spill prevention and response plan) be regarded as providing adequate protection of the important wetland values of the bay for which the Australian Government has responsibilities under the Ramsar, JapanAustralia Migratory Birds Agreement and China-Australia Migratory Birds Agreement treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) (a) Did the Minister, in May 1996, meet with community representatives on Phillip Island and was the Minister presented with both on-site evidence and documentary evidence (so far completely unchallenged) to indicate the ecological sensitivity of Western Port Bay for the importation of crude oil; and (b) what steps have been taken to meet these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Is the Minister aware that, whilst the Shell-Mobil project is still on hold (although fully approved by both State and Federal Governments and open implementation at any time), the importation of refined spirit by another company (Wickland) through the Crib Point jetty has been allowed to proceed despite the community's long-standing and well-documented concerns and requests for an open inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Is the Minister aware that, in March 1994, the Council of the (former) Shire of Hastings resolved unanimously `That in light of existing decisions of the State Government not to require an EES/EIS for the project, the PMA and the Federal Government be requested to require that an EES/EIS be prepared for the Crib Point Terminal and other current and future oil and refined product importation projects within Western Port Bay before these facilities come into operation, as highlighted by Council's review and suggested in earlier port planning studies conducted by the PMA', and that the recommendations made at this time by Hastings </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) In recognition of the environmental values to Western Port Bay, I have requested that my Department provide me with advice on options, which the Commonwealth could consider, to assist the Victorian Government with their future management of oil handling in that State.</PARA>
